			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Vestey buys back food interests The Vestey family is to buy back a large part of Union International, the food processing and distribution group, as part of a restructuring of the private Vestey food, shipping and property business empire. Under the terms of a proposed deal, the Vestey Trust will acquire Union International's food trading and distribution businesses in Australia and Asia and its farming and property interests in Venezuela. The deal, worth a maximum of Pounds 100m including up to Pounds 24m of deferred payments for the Venezuelan property, paves the way for the liquidation of Union International, a Vestey subsidiary which has been operating under a standstill agreement with its banks pending debt restructuring. Union International is asking its banks to extend the standstill agreement by six months to mid-1995 by which time the company is expected to have eliminated its remaining debt and pushed ahead with the sale of its remaining assets which include the Dewhurst, Matthew's and Baxter's butcher shop chains, its British Beef businesses, its North American trading arm and some property interests. The operations being acquired by the Vestey Trust represent the core of Union's food business with a combined profit before tax and interest of Pounds 11.7m last year. In the first six months of this year their profit contribution rose to Pounds 8.5m from Pounds 5.8m in 1993. The Australian and Asian food operations are considered to have strong potential and, together with the Frederick Leyland shipping business, will form the basis of a slimmed-down Vestey empire. The deal is subject to approval at a meeting of shareholders and preference shareholders on November 18. The Vesteys own all of Union International's ordinary shares and about a third of Union International's outstanding preference shares so the outcome of the meeting is not in doubt. The buy-back is a blow to Mr Terry Robinson, Union International's chief executive, who had been seeking a management buyout. Under him, Union's debts have been cut from a peak of Pounds 420m to Pounds 124.6m last year.</p>

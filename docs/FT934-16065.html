			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Sand for the desert is no mirage THEY USED to talk about hauling coals to Newcastle as the ultimate in unlikely business. The modern equivalent might be chips to Silicon Valley - or sand from the UK to the Middle East. For the past year, Mr Ted Bonner has been doing just that, arranging for the dispatch of container loads of sand to Oman and other countries in the Middle East. This unlikely export involves silica sand, widely used in filters for water treatment in desalination plants, sewage works and - especially - swimming pools. Silica sand is not readily available in the Middle East. It has to be imported, creating an opportunity for UK-produced silica sand that Mr Bonner is determined to exploit. A civil engineer, Mr Bonner went to work in Oman in 1980, and returned to the UK last year. He had been working for a swimming pool company in Oman, which became his first customer for the sand. Working from his home in Caunsall near Kidderminster, Mr Bonner has set up EG Exports - the name is based on his initials. He gets the sand from two companies in Leighton Buzzard and Stoke-on-Trent, and arranges for its export. Mr Bonner admits that the business has its curious side. 'I was in Dubai earlier this year, sitting in an office discussing the price of silica sand when there was a sandstorm outside,' he said. He is optimistic about growing business, which might soon have to take extra staff. One Middle East customer prefers UK silica sand to its US counterpart because it is better quality. Not content with selling sand, Mr Bonner is also exporting the water filters themselves, and even heaters and radiators for those cold desert nights.</p>

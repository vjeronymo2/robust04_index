			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GERBER EXECUTIVE TAKES TOP JOB AT EMBATTLED CAMPBELL  </P> <P> David W. Johnson, chief executive officer of Michigan-based Gerber Products  Co., has been named chief executive officer of embattled Campbell Soup Co., the  companies announced today.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Alfred A. Piergallini was elected chairman, president and chief  executive of Gerber to succeed Johnson.  </P> <P> Campbell began searching for a new chief executive long before R. Gordon  McGovern, 63, announced his early retirement in November.  </P> <P> Johnson's appointment comes amid growing dissent among members of Campbell's  founding family, who control about 59% of the company's common shares.  </P> <P> Last month, three descendants of John T. Dorrance, who invented condensed soup  in 1897, declared their desire to sell their 17% interest and push for a sale  of the entire food-products company. On Tuesday, a second group of investors  that also includes members of the Dorrance family said it will maintain control  of its 2.5% stake and support efforts to keep Campbell independent.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 5 (CTK) -- Premier Vaclav Klaus said  a positive result of his two-day working visit was agreement  with his Russian partner on a definitive solution to the  question of the Russian debt to the Czech Republic.    He also voiced his satisfaction with Russia's willingness to  conclude long-term agreements on supplies of Russian oil and gas.    Klaus stressed that Czech-Russian relations could not be  limited only to the past, regarding the debt, but it was  necessary to deal with present and future in which the imports  of gas and petrol were of great importance for the Czech  Republic. Russia agreed in general with preparing long-term  agreements on both raw materials, Klaus reported.    Klaus welcomed that he had agreed with Russian Premier  Viktor  Chernomyrdin on May 30 as the binding, final date by which the  agreement on the schedule and form of payments of the Russian  debt would be signed.    Klaus admitted that Russia offered to repay a part of its  debt by means of exports of military equipment. He stressed  that the Czech Republic was not interested in the purchase of  new Russian weapons, while only import of spare parts to the  present military equipment was feasible.    "I found the political and economic situation (in Russia)  was  a bit more stable than anticipated," noted Klaus.</p>

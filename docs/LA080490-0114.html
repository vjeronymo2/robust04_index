			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER HEALTH TOOK A LICKING, BUT MILLIE'S OK NOW  </P> <P> The all's-well was sounded at a White House press briefing Friday.  </P> <P> "Millie's in good shape and back performing her functions as first dog," White  House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced.  </P> <P> Millie's health did not exactly trigger shock waves in a day otherwise filled  with them, from Wall Street to the Persian Gulf. But it did raise some  questions after President Bush told a Colorado audience Thursday that Barbara  Bush was in Maine with their grandchildren and "a sick dog."  </P> <P> Later, Bush told reporters that Millie was suffering from lead poisoning. "It's  a terrible thing," he said.  </P> <P> But on Friday, Millie's ailment was downgraded from lead poisoning to "acute  lead exposure, much less serious," said Jean Becker, a spokeswoman for Mrs.  Bush. "In fact, the condition is basically already cleared up through the  natural cleansing processes of the body."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said a veterinarian thinks that Millie's problem began when she  walked through the solvent workers have been using to remove old paint from the  south side of the White House.  </P> <P> "She then ingested the solvent, which caused this condition," he said, adding  that the solvent has been removed.  </P> <P> Becker said Millie's only symptom was lethargy, first noticed several months  ago.  </P> <P> "She is still a little lethargic," Mrs. Bush told Becker on Friday.  </P> <P> Millie, who is "basically shy" and known to avoid crowds when she can get away  with it, has an autobiography-of-sorts coming out Sept. 17. Titled "Millie's  Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush," it was actually written by Mrs. Bush during  her vacation in Kennebunkport, Me., a year ago.  </P> <P> In the book, Millie reportedly gives the inside scoop on a dog's life at the  top.  </P></p>

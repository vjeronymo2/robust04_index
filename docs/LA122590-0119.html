			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Clarification: In a Dec. 16 story about a man challenging his criminal  conviction, public defender's investigator John V. Depko told The Times that of  2,000 cases he has worked, "this is the only one where I feel the defendant is  innocent." Depko said he did not mean to imply that all his clients are guilty;  only that of those convicted, he believes this one to be innocent.  </P></p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Regulator warns on US banks' loan margins US BANKS are allowing loan margins to fall and loosening conditions for borrowers to obtain credit, in spite of their claims to have learned lessons from past bad debt problems, a leading US bank regulator has warned. Mr William McDonough, the newly-appointed president of the New York Federal Reserve, said that 'if some anecdotes are true, it seems some managers are forgetting the lessons of the past awfully soon'. Mr McDonough, who addressed a private meeting in Washington organised by the G30 group of financial institutions this week, said afterwards that recent data received by the New York Fed showed that banks were relaxing controls. Mr McDonough said that margins on unsyndicated loans were falling in the New York area, and in the past two weeks the Bank had seen evidence that credit standards were being reduced as a result of competition to extend loans. Mr McDonough, a commercial banker who recently took over as president of the New York Fed from Mr Gerald Corrigan, said the recent narrowing of spreads on loans was 'the first indication that wisdom is being fluttered away'. However, a senior US banker said at a separate briefing that he thought the risk management of banks had improved. Mr Tom Labrecque, chairman of Chase Manhattan, said readiness to make loans meant there was no 'credit crunch'. Mr Labrecque said Chase had observed some banks competing aggressively for loans, but he did not believe most were doing so. While some banks 'might have dropped a few loan covenants, I would not depict that as rampant change'. Mr Labrecque also said he believed that the potential risk to financial systems from the rapid growth in the Dollars 4,500bn market in over-the-counter derivative financial products could be exaggerated, and most banks had strict controls.</p>

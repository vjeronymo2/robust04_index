			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Charmaine Pretorius] </F>   [Excerpt] The absorption into the South African National  Defence Force [SANDF] of 30,000 Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the  Nation -- ANC military wing; MK] and APLA [Azanian People's  Liberation Army] cadres and members of the homeland defence  forces, will mean that 30,000 Defence Force members will have to  go over three years through rationalisation, which could include  retrenchment.    This was made clear yesterday by chief of the Defence Force,  General Georg Meiring.    Addressing a group of journalists at the SANDF Headquarters,  Gen Meiring said because the SANDF "did not have the money to  maintain such a large permanent force" it would, through  rationalisation, have to maintain the same size of the force as  it was at present, which, in effect, meant a reduction of 30,000  people.    He said because the non-statutory forces' recruits to be  incorporated into the SANDF still needed a lot of training, it  was not foreseen that people would be "put on the street within  a few months or even a year's time."    The bridging courses of the new recruits to prepare them for  reincorporation into the SANDF would be overseen by a British  military assistance team, which will arrive in the country  within the next few days.    This whole process would take about three years, Gen Meiring  said, and would, among others, include the selection of recruits  who would after initial training qualify to join the SANDF as  permanent force members.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Downturn in third quarter at Mobil Lower US natural gas prices and weaker refining margins in eastern Asia were behind a 25 per cent fall in net income at Mobil in the third quarter, to Dollars 503m. Leaving aside one-off charges in both periods, however, the slide in underlying profits after tax was only 14 per cent from a year before, when Mobil had enjoyed a very strong quarter. At Dollars 1.23 a share, compared with Dollars 1.63 a year earlier, the company's earnings were squarely in line with market expectations. Earnings in Mobil's exploration and production businesses fell by Dollars 56m to Dollars 309m. This reflected lower natural gas prices, offset in part by higher crude oil prices, and higher exploration costs, both in the US and overseas. Profits from marketing and refining, meanwhile, slipped by Dollars 120m to Dollars 234m. While margins were lower around the world, the fall reflected Mobil's greater exposure to the refining business in the Asia/Pacific region than most other US energy groups. Partially offsetting these factors was a continuing rebound in Mobil's petrochemicals business. Earnings of Dollars 60m, up from Dollars 9m a year ago and Dollars 39m in the second three months of 1994, benefited in particular from a better polyethylene resin market, Mobil said. Mr Lucio Noto, chairman, said he expected conditions in the petroleum industry to remain volatile, and added that Mobil would continue with the restructuring and cost-cutting policy which was intended to increase its returns from its existing assets. Mobil's return on equity in the 12 months to the end of September was 9.2 per cent, down from 12.3 per for the whole of 1993. Mr Noto, who took over as chairman earlier this year, has set a target of raising Mobil's long-run return on equity to about 12 per cent.</p>

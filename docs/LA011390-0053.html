			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE CAN'T JAIL ILLINOIS TOWN, SO HE PUTS IT ON PROBATION  </P> <P> A judge on Friday placed the financially troubled city of East St. Louis on one  year of probation for potentially endangering its police officers by not  repairing their squad car radios.  </P> <P> The city was convicted on Jan. 4 of reckless conduct. That was the city's  second reckless conduct conviction in three months and only the third such  conviction known against a city in Illinois in more than 75 years, St. Clair  County State's Atty. John Baricevic said.  </P> <P> "The city has made a minor effort to improve the situation," Baricevic said. "I  do not know that everybody has a radio. I do know that many police officers  have bought their own radios."  </P> <P> The city had also been charged with reckless conduct for allowing police cars  to fall into disrepair, but it was not found guilty on that charge. Baricevic  originally filed the charges against the city in February, 1988.  </P> <P> Because a city cannot be given a jail term, it faced a maximum fine of $1,000  on the reckless conduct charge. Baricevic recommended a token $1 fine because  of the city's huge debt, estimated at $40 million.  </P> <P> Instead, St. Clair County Associate Judge Robert P. LeChien placed the city on  probation for one year. He said the city should be checked regularly to ensure  that it is keeping its radios and patrol cars in good condition. The city was  also assessed court and probation costs.  </P> <P> LeChien said the evidence showed that there is "pervasive potential for danger  to police officers due to faulty equipment."  </P> <P> "I find, in aggravation, that the city has not met the obligation of protecting  its citizens," LeChien said.  </P> <P> The city has 30 days to appeal, he said. The city's attorney, Irvin Williamson,  said that an appeal was being considered.  </P> <P> "The judge went as far as he could," Baricevic said after the hearing. "The  city deserves to go to jail, but that is physically . . . impossible."  </P> <P> Sgt. Joseph McCaskill, vice president of the city's police union, refused to  comment on the sentence until it could be discussed with other union officers.  </P> <P> Some new patrol cars have been bought, but the city still fails to keep  gasoline in them or have the tires repaired, Baricevic noted. "But the mayor  (Carl Officer) still gets tip-top dollar for operation for his car."  </P> <P> East St. Louis was convicted in October of reckless conduct for a sewer system  failure that flooded a high school with raw sewage. In that case, Associate  Judge C. Glenn Stevens waived the fine because of the city's debt.  </P> <P> The last known case in which a city was found guilty on a similar charge was in  1912, when Chicago was convicted of reckless conduct for improper operation of  a municipal hospital.  </P></p>

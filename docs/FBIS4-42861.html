			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has called on the Greek  Cypriot side for mutual disarmament, stressing that this is the  wish and will of the Turkish side. Denktas inaugurated the  central siren system established by the Civil Defense  Organization.    In a speech which was broadcast through the siren system he  inaugurated today, Denktas called for mutual disarmament.  Denktas said: Come let us sign a disarmament agreement and let  our people be comfortable. Let us be good neighbors and let  these good neighborly relations lead to peace. This is our wish  and will. Armament is of no help to anybody and only instigates  enmity. Within this awareness, I repeat my call for peace on  this historical day, for signing an agreement on condition that  the flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not  lowered from its flag-post. Indicating that the whole world  knows the Turkish side's feelings concerning this issue, Denktas  added that he wanted the Greek Cypriots to be aware of the  Turkish side's sentiments as well.</p>

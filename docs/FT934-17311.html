			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: FT-SE decision on enhanced scrips The following notice was issued by the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee yesterday The committee met to consider the treatment of enhanced scrip dividends in the FT-SE Indices. The Committee has decided to consult more widely on the preferred method of treating enhanced scrip dividends and the timing of any change prior to taking a decision. No retrospective changes to the treatment of enhanced scrip dividends are planned. A working party of practitioners, set up in June, has recommended that enhanced scrip dividends should be treated in the indices as a capital gain rather than as income. The UK Indices Committee recognises that such a change may have accounting implications for institutional investors and fund managers as well as affecting the pricing of futures and options contracts. Notes An enhanced scrip dividend (ESD) is an issue of shares instead of the cash dividend at the option of the shareholder. The share alternatives being offered have been worth significantly more than the cash dividend which has resulted in the vast majority of shareholders opting to take the share alternatives. The existing practice largely ignores ESDs treating them as normal cash dividends and making subsequent capitalisation adjustments for the scrip issue after the take up and listing of the new stock which normally occurs on the pay date. The working party has proposed that in all cases where the share alternative is worth more than the dividend, the enhanced scrip dividend should be treated as a capitalisation change and implemented on the xd date assuming a 100 per cent take up of the scrip. The terms of the capitalisation change should be calculated using the published amount of the enhanced scrip dividend and shares-in-issue immediately prior to the xd date. An adjustment for any stock not taken up will be made on the pay date. The xd adjustment should be zero as it assumes a 100 per cent take up of the scrip.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to a BILD AM SONNTAG  report, Russian Mafia organizations are in possession of the  most important parts for building atom bombs and could use them  to blackmail Western and Arab states. This follows from  intelligence reports for the Federal Government that were  discussed at the cabinet meeting on 8 June, the newspaper writes.    "There is the serious danger that criminal organizations  could try to blackmail states by using such highly toxic  radiation material. Therefore, it is time for us to act," the  tabloid quotes Minister of State in the Chancellor's Office  Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union) as saying.  According to BILD AM SONNTAG, he also said that Western  intelligence services are concerned that Mafia organizations  before long could threaten to detonate smaller atom bombs or  release highly toxic radiation material.    The Federal Intelligence Service (BND) will take part in  planned U.S.-Russian cooperation against the nuclear Mafia.  Schmidbauer said that BND staff should in the future be  permitted by law to examine radiation material or bring such  material to Germany for examination. Exact analyses are the  prerequisite for assessing and warding off dangers, Schmidbauer  said.</p>

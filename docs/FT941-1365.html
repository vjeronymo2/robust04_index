			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Observer: Kopper's cop-out? When the mighty Deutsche Bank first invited bank analysts for a debriefing after its results a couple of years ago, the Anglo-Saxon scribblers marked the event with a barrage of tricky questions. Their more biddable German colleagues merely proposed a vote of thanks. Deutsche executives readily admit they do not fully comprehend what international investors expect of them in terms of information disclosure. Hence great excitement at the promise, months ago, that this year's briefing would be handled by Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's boss, and not an investor relations flunky. Might Kopper lift the veil just a little bit on those impenetrable accounts? Imagine the let-down when faxes arrived explaining that 'unforeseen circumstances' would prevent Kopper from turning up. 'As far as I can ascertain, that consists of a board discussion and a credit meeting,' scoffed one crest-fallen analyst. Clearly the Germans still think one buys Deutsche Bank shares because they are there.</p>

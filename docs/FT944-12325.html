			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Superstores forced from fresh pastures: Planning consent will become increasingly hard to come by If the era of rapid superstore and shopping centre development in the UK was already drawing to a close, yesterday's report from the environment select committee may hasten its end. Should the committee's proposals be implemented - and environment secretary Mr John Gummer said he would consider them 'carefully and positively' - they would make it significantly harder to get planning permission for retail developments outside towns. Signs of a policy change emerged last year, with publication of a new planning policy guidance note, called PPG6, which emphasised the need to protect the 'vitality and viability' of town centres. Its main effect was thought likely to be to prevent planning consent being given for new large out-of-town shopping centres, such as Merry Hill in the West Midlands, or the MetroCentre in Tyne and Wear. In fact PPG6 has already been used by local and central government to clamp down on both shopping centre and superstore developments - especially since Mr Gummer has involved himself personally in the planning process. A report last week by Mr Paul Smiddy, food retailing analyst at the Japanese investment bank Nomura, found the percentage of successful planning appeals had fallen from 60 per cent before PPG6 to about 30 per cent in the past three months. Of 15 planning appeals considered by Department of the Environment inspectors this year, eight were allowed, but of 18 which went to Mr Gummer, only one was approved. This has forced supermarket groups such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway, which have built several hundred out-of-town superstores over the past decade, to cut their expansion plans. Tesco and Sainsbury have launched revamped town-centre formats, called Metro and Central respectively. Sainsbury now expects to add 25 per cent less floorspace in 1995-96 and beyond than it was forecasting a year ago. The three groups yesterday defended the need for large, out-of-town sites. Safeway said the report 'failed to recognise what weekly bulk-food shoppers require'. It added: 'Supermarket customers will not return to daily high-street shopping, even with fully integrated planning and transport policies.' Tesco said superstores provided 'essential' facilities for shoppers with young children, and for the disabled. It said families typically bought 80lbs of shopping in one trip. Some groups warned that banning out-of-town developments would not in itself revitalise town centres, unless they provided better facilities - including sufficient car parking - for shoppers. The British Property Federation warned that retail development 'responds to social change, it does not create it'. 'Restrictions on certain kinds of retail development will not necessarily secure the vitality of existing town centres,' the federation added. Mr Richard Wright, vice-president of the British Council of Shopping Centres, said that while it was correct to support town centres, each had different problems. He added: 'It might be appropriate in a historic town to consider edge-of-town developments to relieve congestion and protect a unique environment.' The Consumers' Association warned that the report risked condemning customers to a future of high prices - to pay for town centre redevelop-ment  -and of limited choice. The Council for the Protection of Rural England said planning policies needed to be revised 'to stop sprawl and help breathe new life into our town centres and high streets'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- [Passage omitted]  The funding of health care has brought it to the brink of  collapse with a 2 billion crown debt ($60 million). Due to  this, urgent measures must be taken to prevent the system from  collapsing, Health Minister Tibor Sagat tells the independent  NARODNA OBRODA.    First of all, supplies of medicaments cannot be halted, says  Sagat. The government has provided the National Insurance Fund  with a half-a-billion crown "injection," while additional money  is expected by the end of April, he adds.    Moravcik's cabinet will try again to settle last year's debt  of the health facilities. However, previous techniques of  comprehensive repayment only demoralized the management, Sagat  says. That is why it is necessary to apply a differentiating  approach regarding repayment of debts, while Sagat himself he is  about to establish the criteria in person in cooperation with  the Association of Hospitals, he adds.</p>

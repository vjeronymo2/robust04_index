Bulgaria will  start buying coal at considerably higher prices from the  Republic of South Africa which would most probably raise the  prices of electricity, Mr. Shervashidze believes. He says that  the possibilities for setting up a new common power grid among  Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine  were discussed in Kiev. Negotiations with Ukraine will continue  two weeks later, during a visit to Kiev of a Bulgarian  delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev, the  private daily STANDART NEWS reports. A commentary in the same  newspaper says that if the National Electricity Company were  private, the negotiations would definitely succeed. [passage  omitted]</p>

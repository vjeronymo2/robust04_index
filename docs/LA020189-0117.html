			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> EPA TARGETS APPLE ENHANCER  </P> <P> In the latest development in a decade-old controversy, the Environmental  Protection Agency today proposed a ban on a popular chemical used to make  apples appear more appealing and to increase shelf life, citing "an inescapable  and direct" link to cancer.  </P> <P> The EPA, however, stopped short of ordering the chemical, which is marketed  under the trade name Alar, immediately off the market because it said it does  not consider the health risk severe enough for such action. The rule review  process could take 18 months, it said.  </P></p>

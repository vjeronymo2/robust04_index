Applicant's common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Before March 26, 1993, applicant was licensed to operate as a small business investment company (``SBIC'') under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and provided long-term, primarily variable rate, secured loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization of small businesses. Applicant was granted an exemption from various provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder to permit it to create a holding company structure. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The purpose of the holding company structure was to allow applicant to expand its business beyond that of an SBIC. Although applicant is no longer an SBIC, it will continue to provide secured loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization of small business entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19030 (Oct. 15, 1992) (notice) and 19092 (Nov. 10, 1992) (order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

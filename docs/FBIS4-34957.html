			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- Canada today invited Cuba to  participate in a multinational counternarcotics training  program, as part of the joint efforts against that scourge.    Canadian Ambassador Mark Entwistle made the announcement,  indicating that "drug consumption is an international problem  that can only be solved through international action and  coordination."    The diplomat said that on Sunday, 26 June, the international  day against drug consumption will be commemorated. He  emphasized that his country's sponsorship of the training  program shows Canada's commitment to the war against drug  trafficking.    According to a note obtained by PRENSA LATINA, the  counternarcotics agencies of 17 other Latin American and Asian  nations have also been invited to participate in the course,  which will be held in the Atlantic Province of New Brunswick  during two weeks in August.    The invitation was made three days after Christine Stewart,  minister of state for Latin America and Africa, ended a working  visit to the island. Her visit was described as highly  constructive by both sides.    Precisely on Monday, Ottawa resumed official economic aid to  Cuba, in line with the plans of the government of Prime Minister  Jean Chretien to maintain a foreign policy that is more  independent of the United States and with greater rapprochement  toward Latin America.    According to the training schedule, in the first week there  will be classes and workshops on the counternarcotics methods  and procedures used in Canada and in the following week, the  participants will visit specialized counternarcotics units in  several Canadian locations.</p>

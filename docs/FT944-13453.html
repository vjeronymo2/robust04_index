			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Wider than expected loss at Data General Data General reported wider than expected losses for its fourth fiscal quarter, but revenues increased as the minicomputer manufacturer continued its difficult transition from proprietary computers to 'open' systems based on industry standards. Revenues for the quarter increased 5 per cent to Dollars 292.6m from Dollars 278.4m in the same period last year. Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 6.2m, or 17 cents a share, compared with last year's fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 37.2m, or Dollars 1.06, when the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars 25m. 'The fact that our revenues are continuing to grow is encouraging,' said Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive. Open systems products now represent almost 90 per cent of total product revenues, he said. The company has achieved improved operating results in each quarter this year, he noted. The company said that it this week received a Dollars 53m payment from Northrop Grumman in settlement of a copyright infringement suit. The gain will be recorded in the current quarter. 'Looking forward, we are cautious for the short term. However, we believe that our ability to continue to grow revenues, combined with aggressive management of our cost structure, should result in achieving our goal of returning to profitability,' said Mr Skates. For the full year, Data General reported revenues of Dollars 1.12bn, compared with Dollars 1.08bn in fiscal 1993 - the first year-on-year revenue increase since 1991. Net loss for the year was Dollars 87.7m, or Dollars 2.45 a share, including a restructuring charge of Dollars 35m in the second quarter. In fiscal 1993, the company reported a net loss of Dollars 60.5m , or Dollars 1.73 a share, which included a Dollars 25m restructuring charge. Data General shares fell 75 cents to Dollars 9 3/4 in mid-session.</p>

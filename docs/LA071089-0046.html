			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QANTAS RAIDS HONG KONG'S POOL OF TALENT;  </P> <P> OFFERS PASSPORTS TO MAINTENANCE WORKERS  </P> <P> The Australian airline, Qantas, is attempting to recruit maintenance and  engineering staff from the Hong Kong airport by offering them jobs that will  ultimately entitle them to Australian passports. Nearly a third of the staff  are seriously considering the offer.  </P> <P> The move, a coup for Qantas, which is desperately short of skilled engineers  and maintenance staff, will be a further blow to confidence in Hong Kong, which  is suffering an accelerating brain drain as its best qualified people leave in  search of security and passports elsewhere.  </P> <P> The Hong Kong government and Cathay Pacific, the colony's airline, are  understood to have expressed concern to the Australian government in Canberra.  Hong Kong officials also raised the issue with Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British  foreign secretary, during his visit last week, citing it as a dramatic example  of the crippling effect the brain drain will have on the local economy if the  right of abode in the United Kingdom is not granted to Hong Kong people.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many May Accept  </P> <P> Qantas, which is also trying to recruit in Singapore, Britain and Ireland, sent  airline executives to Hong Kong together with an Australian immigration  official.  </P> <P> The airline interviewed more than 150 of the 400 engineering employees of  Haeco, which provides maintenance services to airlines operating in and out of  Hong Kong's Kai Tak international airport. Up to 130 are expected to join  Qantas and move to Australia within two to six months, once applicants produce  professional and technical certificates and immigration documentation.  </P> <P> The loss of more than 100 licensed engineers at Haeco would deal a severe blow  to the company. The Hong Kong government and Cathay Pacific would like the  departures staggered over a longer period to allow Haeco time to adjust. About  50% of Haeco's business comes from Cathay Pacific Airways, which like Haeco, is  part of the Swire group of companies.  </P></p>

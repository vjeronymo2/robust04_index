			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of government statement; date not given] </F>   [Text] The attention of the Federal Military Government has  been drawn to the text of an interview granted by NEWSWATCH  magazine to the former minister of communications under the  immediate past military regime, retired Brigadier General David  Mark, and published in the current edition of the magazine.  Having carefully gone through the text, the Federal Military  Government wishes to make the following statement:    1. That the said interview is wholesomely sinister and that  it is part of a well funded and well organized scheme by a few  disgruntled elements to destabilize government through sponsored  publications of crass falsehood and deliberate blackmail about  the present administration.    2. [Words indistinct] such tendentiously seditious and  criminally libelous publications, the sole purpose -- as has  been discovered in some documents which are already in the  possession of security agencies -- is to set out to undermine  the integrity of some members of the present leadership, and  thereby discredit the administration.    3. That the government is utterly aware that part of the  objectives of such allegations in [words indistinct] press  interviews is to preempt the outcome of some of the current  corrective measures already embarked upon by the administration,  including the ongoing series of investigations into some  government parastatals, especially in cases where the  disgruntled members of the discredited cabal are known to have  some vested interests as will be discovered later in this  statement.    4. That the government is also aware that one way by which  the cabal seeks to achieve the above stated objectives, as could  be identified from the contents of the NEWSWATCH interview, is  to instigate disaffection and undermine discipline within the  Armed Forces as well as to create confusion and unnecessary  anxiety among the civil populace by deliberately setting one  ethnic or tribal group against another.    5. That some of the said documents that are already in the  possession of security agencies have also revealed that the  group has succeeded in enlisting the support of some selected  media organizations which are to be used for publications of  material and press interviews that would not only be  deliberately criminal and libelous against some well targeted  individuals in the government but would aggressively canvass the  sabotage of the administration's program by actively fanning the  embers of disunity in the country.    6. That the NEWSWATCH interview of a member of this [word  indistinct] acclaimed clique, coming into play at this crucial  and most sensitive period of this administration's tenure,  clearly falls in line with the above extremely mischievous  motives.    7. The Federal Military Government wishes to remind  Nigerians that these are the same people whose actions, while in  government, have brought the nation to its present precarious  situation in which the economy was almost bleeded [as heard] to  death through large scale corruption and barefaced looting of  the nation's resources.    8. It will be recalled that Brig. Gen. David Mark, who  incidentally has escaped abroad, was minister of communications  between 1987 and 1990 under the immediate past military regime,  and that the ministry supervising the operations of Nigerian  Telecommunications-Plc, NITEL, one of the nation's prime and  resourcefully endowed parastatals. It is therefore not  unexpected that David Mark, like some members of his clique,  should feel very much uncomfortable with the ongoing  investigations being instituted by the government into the  activities of NITEL and other agencies.    9. The purpose of this statement, therefore, is to alert  members of the Armed Forces and the police as well as the public  to be circumspect and not to be quelled by these evil  machinations.    10. For avoidance of doubt, the Federal Military Government  would like to warn that no amount of cowardly acts such as  blackmail or mischievous propaganda by these disgruntled  elements, some of whom are not courageous enough to stay at home  and defend their stewardships, will deter the administration  from actively pursuing its set goals to their logical conclusion.    11. The Federal Military Government, through the security  agencies, is already closely monitoring the activities of these  elements whose movements are also being placed under  surveillance and warns that anyone found to be working towards  undermining the nation's security and corporate existence will  be summarily dealt with.    12. Let it be stated for the umpteenth time that much as the  ongoing investigations in selected government parastatals are  not geared at witch-hunting individuals, the Federal Military  Government is determined to implement fully, without fear or  favor, the recommendations of the probe panels.    13. The Federal Military Government is equally not unaware  of the current trend whereby as a result of the declining  fortunes of some media houses occasioned by the temporary  downturn in the economy, some of them have made themselves  cheaply accessible to criminally libelous or seditious  publications for financial gains to the detriment of  professional ethics and national security.    14. The administration would therefore like to repeat its  earlier warning that much as it is committed to the creation of  an enabling environment for an unfettered, virile press in the  country, it strongly believes that freedoms should be exercised  with some responsibilities.    15. For avoidance of doubt, let it be acknowledged  emphatically that this administration is conscious of its  responsibilities to the ordinary people of this country and it  would definitely not fold its arms while some mischievous,  selfish, and unpatriotic Nigerians threaten the peace and  security of this great country. The gimmicks in whatever form,  either through publications or other mass media channels, will  be handled with all the forces at the government's disposal.  Liberty is not license.</p>

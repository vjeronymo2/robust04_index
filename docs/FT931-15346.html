			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Italy to press on with state sell-offs: Minister pledges move to join mainstream of competitive countries ITALY will join the mainstream of competitive European countries with its planned privatisation of a large swathe of state-owned industry, Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, predicted yesterday. Launching a presentation of prime companies to be sold to private shareholders, he told London bankers that privatisation would curb the 'anomaly' of the undue size of Italy's public sector. 'The path we are following is full of problems. There will be a lot of dissent. But the government doesn't have any alternative.' Yesterday's one-day conference was the first full-scale presentation to foreign investors of the disposal programme formulated by the government of Mr Giuliano Amato. A line-up of heavyweight Italian government and corporate representatives attracted an audience of about 500. Mr Barucci stressed the government would approach the problem pragmatically, learning from other countries' experience in dismantling the public sector, above all the UK and France. But yesterday's session failed to clear up some important details about the privatisation programme. Mr Barucci confirmed that the government would sell off 51 per cent or more of some state groups. He also announced that a package of incentives to increase private investors' interest in share flotations, delayed at the end of last year, would be passed by ministers on Friday. But he could not dispel doubts over whether Italy's relatively thin stock market will prove adequate to cope with the large amounts of equity likely to be sold in coming years. 'The great question is how to encourage retail buying of shares in a country which relies on large private purchases of bonds to finance the budget deficit,' one banker at the conference said. The government plans to raise L7,000bn (Pounds 3bn) in privatisation revenues this year, followed by L10,000bn each in 1994 and 1995. Mr Barucci refused to countenance having to lower this target if Italian economic sluggishness persisted. Asked whether Italy might face deflation if it tried to cut its budget deficit in line with the Maastricht economic performance targets, Mr Barucci said anyone who predicted such a 'desperate' outcome should fly to the moon. 'You must be optimistic. This is the only way.' Mr Franco Bernabe, managing director of ENI, the state oil and petrochemical concern, admitted that the recession was a 'large problem' for efforts to privatise groups hit by lack of demand. But he said hidden reserves in ENI's balance sheet of an estimated Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn (Pounds 6.5bn-Pounds 9.7bn) represented a powerful attraction for investors. There was also some confusion about possible safeguards to prevent foreign shareholders building up controlling interests in strategically important Italian companies. Mr Bernabe said Italy would bring in a 'softer version' of the so-called 'golden share', designed to pre-empt control of certain companies by foreign shareholders. But Mr Michele Tedeschi, managing director of the industrial and banking holding group IRI, said there would be 'no prejudice' against foreign investors.</p>

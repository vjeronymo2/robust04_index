			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAGER ON ISRAELI-ARAB CONFLICT  </P> <P> Prager is mistaken in his belief that Arabs hate Israel because it is  democratic or embodies Western values.  </P> <P> Arabs hate Israel for what it really is, a virulent, aggressive, colonial  outpost of U.S.-supported cowboys using every brutal means at its disposal to  oppress the indigenous Arab population. Even the U.S. wouldn't care if Israel  was democratic or embodied Western values so long as Israel served our  interests. Unfortunately, Prager's effort to gain the moral high ground for  Israel is simply a rhetorical device to demonize Arabs among Americans.  </P> <P> SHANT AGAJANIAN, Newport Beach  </P></p>

THE THEATER OF MILITARY OPERATIONS </H5>   At about 0300, Khizha, Shoygu, and Filatov went to a  suburban  residence to catch some sleep. As soon as they fell asleep, they  were awakened by the clamor of a battle.    Internal troops commander Savvin spent the night in the  office of the military school commander and, having learned of  an intensive exchange of fire near the government residence,  sent a detail there. The detail reported: "It is our own." The  detail ruined the spectacle, and the shooting stopped.    As GKChS [State Committee on Emergency Situation] Chairman  Shoygu, his deputy Colonel General Filatov, and internal troops  Commander Colonel General Savvin noted, a considerable share of  reports on the happenings were invented or the events themselves  staged. The special predilection for this was shown by the North  Ossetian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the republic's MB  [Ministry of Security], and their press centers. It appeared  that episodes of a scenario prepared in advance were being  retold. Military and MB personnel alternately reported  periodically on Ingush tanks coming from somewhere, on Ingush  APC's [armored personnel carriers] breaking through, on Ingush  artillery. Reports were predominantly delivered verbally, and  decisions had to be made on the spot.    It was reported to Shoygu that according to operational  data,  two Su-25 fighter planes were discovered in the Ingush  settlement of Muzhichi. He ordered helicopters to fly there to  verify the reports, to the laughter of others, who explained to  him that the people in the mountainous village of Muzhichi there  have never been any asphalt paving, let alone a take-off strip  for a Su-25.    Even before the conflict broke out, the internal troops  commander received a report from the North Ossetian MVD on  movements of tanks from the Chechen side and armored vehicles  from the Ingush side, on shelling of administrative buildings in  Prigorodnyy Rayon. Every time a check revealed that the reports  were not true.    During the days of the armed conflict, intensive  reconnaissance--airborne, among other kinds--refuted Ossetian  side's information that Ingush allegedly had some structured  system of armed formations. They did not have armored vehicles,  tanks, or rocket-propelled Grad systems. But the  authoritativeness of the sources, among which were not only the  republic's enforcement agencies but also its statesmen, required  continuous verification of the coming reports.    Judging by the statements of the North Ossetian leadership,  Ingush armed formations were seizing internal affairs  departments here and there. Savvin had a communications officer  stationed in Oktyabrskoye, and all he had to do was pick up the  receiver--to find out that he had been lied to again.    Still, there were embarrassments. What happened on that day  in Dachnyy, Chermen, and in the Chermen circle could only be  explained by the fact that the military was put in a position of  actors familiar with the plot of a play but not with their parts  and therefore forced to improvise. An airborne troops regiment  of the Pskov internal troops division immediately upon arrival  went to cover Chermen. They got on their way close to the  evening, and when the reconnaissance unit in PFV's [paratroop  fighting vehicle] approached Chermen, shots sounded. The  commander thought they had been fired upon. In the darkness they  approached Dachnyy instead of Chermen, by mistake. They opened  "return" fire on Dachnyy's outskirts as well. One fighting  vehicle, making a turn near a bridge, hit a land mine; two  paratroopers died. The second, a PFV, was reported to the  commander as having been captured by the enemy (as it turned out  later, the crew lost their way and ended up in Nazran).    The paratroopers thought they saw tanks. The regiment  commander reported to corps headquarters, to the deputy  commander of internal troops General Chindarov, that he was  engaged in a battle and the fire was very dense, denser than in  Afghanistan. At about 0100, another report--this time of  encountering unidentified armored forces. Savvin got in touch  with Chindarov on the telephone, who confirmed that heavy  fighting was in progress, but could not tell anything regarding  casualties. Upon arrival at corps headquarters, Savvin found  Chindarov talking to the commander of the Russian Air Force.  Chindarov was asking for air support. It was promised to him. He  was told that support aircraft would be taking off shortly from  several airfields.    In the morning, the generals in helicopters inspected the  areas of "heavy fighting." A burned Moskvich; a burned bus; and  no traces of tanks.    Thus ended the Russian Army's biggest battle in this  imaginary war.  <H5>  CLEANSING THE TERRITORY </H5>   On 1 November 1992 at 0540, a massive artillery shelling of  all population centers of compact habitation of Ingush began. In  the afternoon, units of the Pskov Airborne Division began to  arrive.    At 1600 official representatives of North Ossetia and  Ingushetia met on the territory of the 19th Division (settlement  Sputnik). The decision was made for a cease-fire at 1800. The  Ingush accepted the proposed terms. The fire only became denser,  however.    The president's representative Issa Kostoyev was calling  Khizha. Khizha demanded new negotiations, stalled; Khizha and  Galazov had different plans, and Ingush capitulation did not fit  in. In the opinion of former internal troops commander V.N.  Savvin, all that was needed was just one division that could be  positioned against the national guard and thus extinguish the  conflict. One! In his opinion, the Ossetian leadership, which  insisted on "cleansing" the territory, was against separating  the conflicting sides. Galazov saw the task of this purge in a  methodical disarmament from house to house, which meant people  had to be squeezed out.    Khizha accepted Galazov's plan, although he knew of I.  Kostoyev's proposal--to advance the troops from the direction of  Beslan, in order to block the zone from both sides. Still, had  the MVD troops entered shortly after the paratroopers, setting  up posts and commandants' offices, there would have been fewer  casualties and less cruelty and destruction. The internal troops  were in no hurry, however. Instead, it was the Ossetian OMON  [Special Designation Militia Detachments], republican guard,  people's volunteer corps, and South Ossetian units commanded by  Teziyev, a deputy chairman of South Ossetian Council of  Ministers, who entered Prigorodnyy Rayon villages in the  paratroopers' wake. The latter, by the testimony of everyone,  including the top military, displayed particular cruelty.    Later, the belated entry of the internal troops was blamed  on  Colonel General V.N. Savvin. The reasons he cited in his defense  are indeed not very convincing, and the consequences of his  inability to get things organized are frightening. But could he  cite real reasons?    Moreover, both Savvin and Shoygu get touchy when it comes to  questions about interaction with North Ossetian armed  formations. Forced to admit that he as the senior troops  commander was instructed by Khizha to take command of the  unified forces, General Savvin immediately points out that the  republican guard and the volunteers corps were not subordinated  to him, but remains silent about the North Ossetian MVD units.  Sergey Shoygu maintains that the participation of the volunteers  corps, the guards, and the "southerners" was not envisaged by  the plan. Shoygu does not answer, however, a direct question  about the actions against the "aggressors" by the united front  of the Russian Army and the Ossetian side.    Shoygu speaks of the republican guard as a well-organized  formation armed in the military fashion; the volunteer corps he  considers as something akin to loose guerrilla groups. Both  Savvin and Shoygu believe that the participation of Kudarians  from the south in punitive actions was the initiative of the  North Ossetian leadership.    The generals are in a difficult situation. If they admit  that  North Ossetian formations, fortified by a South Ossetian  "peacekeeping" battalion, were part of the unified forces, they  would have to accept part of the responsibility for the massacre  in Prigorodnyy Rayon. As to Savvin's inability to get organized,  keeping in mind Khizha's stalling in negotiations with the  Ingush, it looks artificial.    If they admit that the Ossetian republican guard and  volunteer corps were not subordinate to anyone, including  Ossetian leadership, this makes their illegitimacy inarguable,  and they have to be declared dangerous gang formations. In this  case, there is an obvious fault of the political and military  leadership, who did not take any steps to disarm and disband  them. I could even feel sorry for both generals, had I not seen  corpses of men with their throats slashed and of women with  traces of torture on their bodies.    Even by the admission of the Ossetian press, all kinds of  armaments, including heavy, were used against the Ingush. On 11  November 1992 the newspaper SEVERNAYA OSETIYA ran a photo of  tanks in a battle formation with this caption: "Military units  participating in cleansing the territory of North Ossetia of  Ingush gang formations more than once had to deploy heavy  hardware and use tank firepower. In the photo: tanks during an  attack".    Whom did these tanks attack?    Both Shoygu and Savvin admit that the Ingush did not have  military-type armed formations; that their armed groups numbered  25-30 persons each; that they had no arms other than firearms  and several captured APC's. Yes, the tanks attacked the homes of  peaceful residents, and the unified forces of Russia and Ossetia  were not conducting a military operation--they were cleansing  Prigorodnyy Rayon of "persons of Ingush origin."    I should probably write that Galazov's plan was given life.  But the word "life" is not appropriate here. The purpose of the  operation was, as already mentioned, to push the Ingush out at  any cost. All of them, to the last man. Therefore, cruelty was  part of the set of tools, and there is nothing surprising about  that.    Neither is it surprising that public opinion in North  Ossetia, with minor exceptions, supported and justified this  cruelty.    After all, the propaganda apparatus that had remained since  Stalin's time and now was supplemented by no-longer-concealed  nationalistic texture, deluged citizens of Ossetia with an  avalanche of impressive cliches, legends, and heart-rending  details. A strictly civilian person--a Vladikavkaz  designer--told me on the way: 'Having heard of children's heads  chopped off and pinned on fence spikes in Chermen, I came to the  volunteer corps headquarters and offered the use of myself and  my car for the defense of the republic."    According to the latest data of the provisional  administration, fortunately, not a single Ossetian child was  killed during the war.  <H5>  FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE </H5>   Information of casualties (from the investigation  materials):    Overall, 546 persons died during the days of the armed  conflict. Of them, 407 were Ingush and 105--Ossetians.    Among the dead are 41 women (33 Ingush and five  Ossetians), 12 children under 15 (all on the Ingush side), and  49 persons over 60 (42 Ingush and 7 Ossetians).    By other reckoning, a total of 1,300 persons were  killed on both sides.  <H5>  VLADIKAVKAZ, INGUSHETIA, CHECHNYA. 2-11 NOVEMBER </H5>   Beginning 2 November, a state of emergency was imposed on  the  territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. All power in the  state of emergency zone was vested with the provisional  administration headed by Georgiy Khizha. Sergey Shoygu was  appointed Khizha's deputy. For almost two days they possessed  almost dictatorial powers, until under pressure from North  Ossetia the president relented and issued a new edict, which in  essence restricted the powers of the local authorities only on  the territory of Ingushetia. They have not used their power and  strength for peacekeeping, however; instead, they used them as  if they were on the one side of the front line confronted by the  commensurate strength of an enemy power.    Actually, the inquisitive mind of the deputy head of  provisional administration moved him once to a heroic deed  comparable only with actions of the unforgettable Shtirlits.    On the night from 3 to 4 November, he drove in a Volga car  with two bodyguards through Beslan and Mayskoye to Nazran's  central square. Incognito.    None of the local top officials expected him in Nazran.  There  were a lot of people on the square--a rally was in progress. All  speeches were in the Ingush language, and therefore he did not  understand a word.    He did not see any armored vehicles there. He did not meet  with any of the local leaders. He stood there, walked around,  and returned to Vladikavkaz the same way, unimpeded.    So what did Sergey Kuzhugetovich report to the center from  his deep undercover mission? "Could not understand a word"?    He was not afraid of a bullet. What he did not have the guts  to do in Nazran was to get up to the second floor of the  building in front of which the rally was in progress, to meet  Issa Kostoyev, Ruslan Aushev, Commandant Musa Tsechoyev--also,  by the way, Russian generals--and listen to "the other side."  How else can one explain then why Sergey Shoygu, a man  undoubtedly intelligent, energetic, and knowledgeable about his  business, closed his eyes to what he saw, and did not see what  he looked at?    The GKChS Chairman Shoygu, Colonel General Filatov, and  Colonel General Savvin, who arrived in the zone of conflict--or,  to be precise, to the capital of North Ossetia, Vladikavkaz--had  been here before, had established official and personal  contacts. One could explain by these factors their openly  pro-Ossetian position, had it not been for two considerations.  The generals' remarks and actions were so one-sided that they  could be regarded not just as politically tactless, but as  provocational.    For instance, Colonel General Filatov, speaking on  Vladikavkaz television, stated: "Russia has not forgotten its  loyal Ossetian sons, who served it faithfully and honorably for  many years. And as early as today, the airborne troops, jointly  with Russian internal troops and the troops of the North  Ossetian Ministry of Internal Affairs, will begin military  operations.... With every passing hour this pressure on the  aggressor will be increasing." Having confided that he has  acquired many loyal friends among Ossetians--apparently the kind  only Ossetians can be--the general suggested that all Ossetian  families should leave the zone of conflict so that the troops  could operate without looking over their shoulder. "I basically  followed the text Galazov wrote for me," Filatov later would  explain innocently.    What is worse is that G. Khizha, a deputy prime minister of  the Russian Government, whose intellectual level is attested to  by the title of professor, and who has no known personal reasons  for pro-Ossetian sympathies, immediately upon arrival took the  same one-sided position and, speaking on television, said that  Ossetia is a loyal friend of Russia and that he will do  everything possible to clear its land of Ingush aggressors. In  addition, Khizha did not denounce any of the gross anti-Ingush  statements of Ossetian leader Galazov; neither did he refute  Galazov's numerous statements regarding military operations  jointly with Russian troops against another part of Russia--the  Ingush Republic.    One would think that such behavior on the part of the  highest  Russian official sent from Moscow with a peacekeeping mission  and the statements and actions of the generals subordinate to  him should have immediately prompted the president of all  Russians to recall and demand the resignation of officials and  military people who have discredited both him and themselves.  Nothing like this happened until a certain time, however. It  looks as if Khizha and others had received a dispensation in  advance. As to the military, they had been publicly relieved by  the presidential address from any pangs of conscience and doubts  with respect to the legitimacy of their orders. "Your actions  are protected," declared the president, "and are guaranteed by  the law and affirmed by the people." But could it be that B.N.  Yeltsin would give the troops an indulgence for the massacre of  civilian Russian citizens? After all, only two years earlier he  spoke to the troops with these soul-touching words: "You may be  told that with your help order will be restored in society. But  can you consider violating the Constitution and the laws as  restoration of order, because this is precisely what you are  being pushed into by those who strive to solve political  problems with the help of the might of Army units.... By  carrying out the order....to use arms against the civilian  population, you are becoming a tool in the hands of dark forces  of reaction."    These were the same troops--the Pskov paratroop division;  and  the laws were the same. Could the president have changed that  much over a short period of time? Even knowing now of the tragic  experience of October 1993, let us not forget that in  Prigorodnyy Rayon we were dealing not with an insurrection, and  not with the danger of a split in the Army and a civil war in  the entire of Russia.    If we assume, however, that what the president meant was not  a war against the civilian population, but military operations  against the army of another state, then everything falls into  place. The only army not subordinated to Commander in Chief B.  Yeltsin in the North Caucasus was the Chechen army. Now the  closing words of the president's address acquire at least some  meaning: "The honor and dignity of Russia, its security and  territorial integrity, must be ensured."    This pathos cannot possibly refer to a conflict between the  inhabitants of two small Russian republics....    Before his trip to Vladikavkaz on 31 October 1992, Deputy  Prime Minister Georgiy Khizha had in his possession a secret  decision of the Security Council of the Russian Federation,  signed by Skokov. One would imagine that a person of such high  rank as a deputy prime minister also received verbal information  of an especially confidential nature. What about? We can  reconstruct it only by accidental slips in the available  documents and statements of G. Khizha, carried away in his role.  And most importantly, by what was happening in those several  days.    At the time, the secretary of the Russian Federation  Security  Council, Skokov, attempted to introduce censorship in the  Russian mass media by sending to television and to newspapers an  nonclassified excerpt from a classified document. But this  document is interesting not because of Skokov's natural  emotional move, but by its suddenly prominent Chechen motif. The  Russian mass media were prescribed not to allow "reports that  provoke escalation of an armed conflict, first and foremost on  the part of the leadership of Chechnya as an illegitimate  formation on the territory of the Chechen-Ingush SSR."    G. Khizha apparently got such a powerful impetus in Moscow  that during the first day of his Vladikavkaz visit he still  continued publicly to expound on the Chechen factor. To confused  Ossetian journalists, who dutifully retold government rumors of  a high-powered Ingush offensive, he said that "Right now there  is no other danger except that which arises on the part of  Chechnya," and remarked ominously: "Some solution to this  problem must be found." And once again: "This issue must remain  in the field of vision of the Government of Russia, and it must  be resolved."    The Chechens, however, were displaying indifference not  anticipated by Moscow, and Dudayev even went as far as to  proclaim his neutrality. But a peacekeeping mission that arrived  to Ossetia at the time Khizha was there was not permitted to  proceed to Vladikavkaz on 4 November. The untimely peace-loving  behavior on the part of Chechens clearly irritated the head of  the Provisional Administration. This irritation he turned  against Colonel General Savvin. The internal troops commander  was accused of bringing them into the zone of conflict at a  wrong time. Savvin, on the other hand, kept saying stubbornly  that he did not agree that troops should be sent into  Ingushetia. Thus, until 10 November they did not have the  opportunity to bring Russian tanks into Groznyy on the backs of  the retreating Chechen army.    It is hard to tell what role in this other example of  brilliant planning was played by Vice President Rutskoy, but in  the past he already had tried in the president's absence to  impose a state of emergency in Chechnya and to grind Dudayev's  regime into dust; what he achieved was an unconditional  consolidation of the Chechen people and a sharp rise of  President Dudayev's authority.    Who conceived the next clumsy step is not known. Except that  on 10 November "in order to prevent mass unrest and to  confiscate the arms and ammunition in illegal possession of the  population" troops were brought into Ingushetia. Heavy T-72  tanks, armored vehicles and paratroops moved on Chechnya in  great numbers. Yes, Chechnya, because there was, and still is,  no border between Chechnya and Ingushetia. Chechens from nearby  villages came out to the road and blocked the highway with  gasoline trucks; Dudayev declared a state of emergency. There  was again the smell of big war in the Caucasus.    The next day, on 11 November, the Russian Government's  Acting  Prime Minister Gaydar signed an agreement with representatives  of Ingushetia and Chechnya on withdrawal of troops.    The idea of "Ingush aggression" was losing attractiveness  for  the Russian center. Participation in the Ingush pogrom did not  bring any glory to Russian arms. Another peacekeeping action  resulted in great blood and humiliation--not too conspicuous,  though. The Russian press, with the rare exception, kept an  organized silence, while the West, not yet interested in this  incomprehensible Caucasus cauldron, was wary of interfering in  Russian family affairs.    All three "enforcement" ministers--Grachev, Barannikov, and  Yerin--who arrived a day before at the theater of military  operations, also departed quietly. Savvin resigned. So did  Khizha.    One could question the motives of Deputy Prime Minister G.  Khizha's behavior, but his intentions were announced publicly,  his orders did not diverge from his intentions, and he did not  even find it necessary to hide his personal affinity toward the  Ossetian leadership. It is hard to imagine that Khizha could not  foresee the casualties and destruction stemming from his orders.  But where experienced generals turned away in disgust, he went  to the end. The generals he advised to rid themselves of the  "Tbilisi syndrome." He knew he was answerable only to those who  had appointed him, and he was right. When the time came, he was  held to answer both for the dilletantism of Moscow politicians  and his own zeal. Khizha has disappeared from the political  horizon.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels June 18 TASS -- Deputy Russian Foreign  Minister Vitaliy Churkin and Deputy NATO Secretary-General for  Political Issues Gebhardt von Moltke voiced progress in the  establishment of new relations between Moscow and NATO on  Saturday.    After negotiations at the NATO Brussels headquarters, Von  Moltke told correspondents that the Russian-NATO cooperation is  on a good path. In his turn, Churkin added that the  negotiations on a broad range of issues were useful. Neither of  them specified what progress has been achieved.    In the words of Von Moltke, permanent representatives of  NATO  member-state in the rank of ambassadors will study the results  of his negotiations with Churkin on Monday, and Churkin will  hold consultations with his government.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is expected to sign  a  framework document of the NATO Partnership for Peace program on  Monday. It is so far unclear whether the sides will adopt a  bilateral document which, in the opinion of Russia, should  provide for a broader political dialogue between Russia and NATO  with due account of the Russian scale, the role in international  affairs and the nuclear status.    NATO recognizes the Russian right to special attitude but  wants to hold this broader dialogue on the informal basis  outside the partnership program that is equal for all.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-'Attas Tells AL-HAYAH: My </F> Dismissal Illegal, All My Contacts Aimed at Halting War"]    [Excerpt] London, AL-HAYAH -- Prime Minister Haydar  Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has told AL-HAYAH that the "decision to  dismiss me is null and void and illegal." Al-'Attas was  answering a question put to him by AL-HAYAH, which contacted him  in the hospital where he is receiving medical treatment in the  United States. He said: "All the contacts I have made in the  United States are aimed at halting the war. The situation which  has emerged is saddening and we have warned of it a lot in the  past. It is easy to launch a war, but it is difficult to end  it." Asked about the way out, he said: "The way out is to halt  the war and return to dialogue in order to implement the Pledge  and Accord Document. We have agreed in the past that war is not  the way to settle disputes, because it will bring nothing but  destruction and tragedies for our people." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi has issued new controls on economic activities  of the powerful Ministry of Interior [MOI] in what is seen as a  major attempt to curb corruption in the police force and  restructure the state enterprise sector. The move came in an  order announced by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai which was  carried in the March 7 edition of SAIGON GIAI PHONG. The order  cautioned the MOI against allowing private businesses to act "in  the names of police enterprises". It called on the MOI to "check  the activities" of companies under its wing, and to dismiss  managers found to be incompetent.    The order also indicated that subsidies would only be  forthcoming to business activities of the police force that are  deemed to meet its needs.    The MOI owns the Pacific Company, which operates a chain of  hotels in major cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Vung  Tau. In Hanoi, it owns the Boss Hotel which was among the first  establishments in the capital to offer a discotheque and pool  table.    "The MOI has to report to the Prime Minister on the  effectiveness of the hotel operations...and convert loss-making  hotels into joint ventures with foreign partners in order to  ensure effective use of capital," the order said.    The Government further instructed the MOI to make optimum  use  of prison land, calling among other things for a  "reorganisation" of the plantation of industrial crops. It also  urged maximisation of prison labour "except for (that of) the  old, ailing and political criminals." The order called on the  MOI to turn over products made by prison labour and resources to  the Government. It said proceeds from the products would be  shared out as reward to worthy "cadres" and prisoners, and  reinvested for expanded production.    The order affirmed that the State Planning Committee had  been  assigned to work out a capital allocation plan for companies run  by the MOI.    It also made clear that none of these companies would be  "equitised" -- in other words, be open to shareholdings by the  general public.    The State Planning Committee organises subsidies given to  companies run by the MOI and the Ministry of Defence.</p>

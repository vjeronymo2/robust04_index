			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SUCCESS EGGS HER ON;  </P> <P> STUDENT, 17, LAYS CLAIM TO LOWERING CHOLESTEROL IN HER HENS' PRODUCTS  </P> <P> She's been called the "Chicken Feed Queen" by schoolmates and doubted by  scientists, but Alice Havens remains undeterred in her quest to help millions  of egg-loving Americans.  </P> <P> Every day about 5 a.m., the 17-year-old high school student slips out of bed  and into a pair of boots kept by the kitchen door, then heads for her back  yard, where she feeds 25 hens a special formula to cut the cholesterol in eggs.  </P> <P> Cholesterol-lowering research also is going on in laboratories where  researchers with advanced degrees and heavy funding measure results with fancy  instruments. Havens' experiment started out as a project for a science fair.  </P> <P> Sitting at the kitchen table, she opens a notebook to the typed pages that  detail her research. She says the charts show that the special feed has dropped  the cholesterol count 22% to 27%, and that it is going down even further.  </P> <P> Some scientists are skeptical, questioning her testing methods and results.  Edward Naber, who has been doing egg experiments for 30 years at Ohio State  University, doesn't think her numbers are significant.  </P> <P> Havens, who has applied for a patent, is pushing on. Her words get stronger,  her pace quicker, when asked to respond to skeptics: "Well, that's your opinion  and I've got mine, and just because of what you said isn't going to make me  stop."  </P> <P> The Havens family lives in a big, frame house tucked deep in the woods in  Sherman, with two horses, a collie, two cats and Alice's 25 chickens.  </P> <P> Science has occupied her since seventh grade, when the papier-mache volcanoes  she made with her best friend, Hannah Roberts, won a prize at the Science  Horizons fair in Danbury. "We built all these volcanoes, and we had a backdrop  and everything, with moss and paint, and it was a huge mess." Inspired by her  teacher, John Halloran, she kept entering the fair, studying vision in horses  one year, chicken feed in another. In early tests, she gave her hens different  diets, like sunflower seeds and oyster shells; she started testing for  cholesterol when she entered New Milford High School.  </P> <P> "What I did was I tested different things on the hens, things farmers sometimes  fed, to see if the cholesterol level would change in any way."  </P> <P> She hit pay dirt with the third diet, an ingredient she decided to try -- and  won't disclose -- because a friend of her sister had a lot of it. Before, the  hens laid jumbo eggs with 388 milligrams of cholesterol; after, it was 340.  </P> <P> Havens says the level has dropped even more, but she won't release the figures  until the next phase of the experiment is over. She also is trying to pinpoint  exactly what in the feed is working.  </P> <P> Many researchers have tried to cut eggs' cholesterol but failed to find a safe,  cheap diet, said Naber, a food science professor. He questioned Havens'  figures, and said a large Connecticut egg has 202 milligrams of cholesterol and  the national average is 213.  </P> <P> Havens sticks by her guns, saying she started out with bigger eggs and has not  relied on U.S. Department of Agriculture standards as a benchmark. She also has  been egged on, so to speak, by the accolades she has won.  </P> <P> At the kitchen table, she flips through a scrapbook to certificates and letters  from the American Heart Assn. and the Nutmeg Institute of Food Technologists,  and mementos such as a luggage tag from her trip to Knoxville, Tenn., for the  International Science Fair. Her booty includes an encyclopedia set, five shares  of stock in United Technologies Corp., a leather briefcase, five trophies on  her bedroom dresser, four framed certificates on the wall above her bed, and  enough cash to pay for the experiment.  </P> <P> Last summer, Havens went to London for a science symposium with 800 students  from around the world. She presented her research, made friends, toured castles  -- and initiated a walkout at one session when a boy from Ireland made  disparaging remarks about Vice President Dan Quayle. She was reprimanded for  taking 400 students with her when she left in disgust.  </P></p>

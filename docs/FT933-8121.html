			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Georgian arrest in US envoy's killing THE Georgian authorities said yesterday they had arrested the man who shot US diplomat Fred Woodruff earlier this month, but described his death as a 'chance killing', Reuter reports from Tbilisi. 'The crime has been solved. The criminal has been identified, the investigation is proceeding, and we expect him to go on trial,' the first deputy interior minister, Mr Mikhail Osadze, said on radio. Mr Woodruff, who according to unconfirmed US press reports was working for the Central Intelligence Agency, was killed with a single bullet to the head on August 8 while travelling in a car with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's security chief. Mr Osadze, speaking to Reuter by telephone, said the unnamed suspect had apparently fired in an attempt to stop the car in which Mr Woodruff was travelling, but had not intended to kill any of the passengers.</p>

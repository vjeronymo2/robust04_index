			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article, under rubric "Statistics": "How Are We Living?" </F>   [Text] SMOLENSKIYE NOVOSTI recently published a statistical  survey of the oblast's socioeconomic situation in 1993. But how  did the city of Smolensk live through that year? Specialists  will have to carry out a professional analysis of the situation.  We shall present only the most interesting data from a report  that was prepared by the city's statistics department.    Last year 2469 infants were born in Smolensk. This is 525  (17.5 percent) less than in 1992. During the same year 4550  persons departed for the other world (732, or 19.2 percent, more  than in 1992). It is not difficult to compute that, as a result  of the considerable increase in the mortality rate, as compared  with the birth rate, the natural loss in the population was  2081, or an increase in that indicator by a factor of 2.5 as  compared with 1992). Incidentally, the year 1992 in this respect  outstripped the year 1991 to an even greater extent -- by a  factor of 20.5.    The average income of persons working in the city's  enterprises and organizations last December was 101,000 rubles,  including 87,900 rubles of wages. The persons with the highest  wages were construction workers. Their average December wages  were 134,700 rubles. For those workers also, last year the wages  rose more rapidly than anyone else's (by a factor of 11.2, as  compared with 1992). Then come the organizations in the  nonproduction sphere -- 96,800 rubles (10.9); motor  transportation -- 96,000 rubles (7.4); industry -- 78.1 (6);  trade and public nutrition -- 71,200 ((.2); housing and  municipal economy -- 65,000 rubles (8.7); and personal services  -- 57,200 (8.7).    The year 1993 also presented Smolensk with 2586 new  families,  which is 1266 (6.8 percent) more than in 1992. However, 1981  divorces were registered that year. Thus, for each 100  marriages, there are 77 divorces...    Last year the city's enterprises produced consumer goods  with  a total value of 310 billion rubles, or 10.5 percent (in  comparable prices) less than in 1992. In light industry the  situation is worse -- the production of commodities dropped by  12.8 percent. The amount of food products produced was 2.1  percent less than in 1992, including: meat (8.9 percent);  whole-milk output (0.8); bread and rolls (8.8); confectionery  articles (7.6); and soft drinks (20.9). But the amount of  sausage products produced increased by more than 0.2 percent.  There was also a 0.9 percent increase in the production of  alcoholic beverages.    A total of 1692 apartments, or 80.1 percent more than the  1992 level, were activated in 1993 at the expense of all sources  of financing. In the total amount of housing, state builders  turned over 30 percent, and the remaining 70 percent was the  share of the nonstate sector. In addition, last year ten  uncompleted construction projects, with a total value of 58.8  million rubles, were sold at open auctions.    According to the results of the first 11 months of 1993, 3  percent of the city's industrial enterprises were operating at a  loss; 14.3 percent of transportation enterprises; 11.4 percent  of construction enterprises; 22.2 percent of trade enterprises;  36.4 percent of personal-services enterprises; and 8.3 percent  of scientific organizations.    As of 1 January 1994 the indebtedness of customers to the  city's enterprises and organizations surpassed the indebtedness  to suppliers and contractors by 22.3 billion rubles, and came to  a total of 90.9 billion rubles. In the total amount of the  customers' indebtedness, nonpayments (overdue indebtedness) came  to 13.3 percent, and the volume of nonpayments to suppliers,  with regard to the volume of output produced, in December 1993  came to 20 percent.    Overdue indebtedness on wages as of January 1994 came to  339.1 million rubles in industry and construction. Nevertheless,  retail commodity turnover increased somewhat. From the official  registered trade and public-nutrition enterprises alone, the  population purchased commodities with a total value, in  comparable prices, that was 4.3 percent more than in 1992.  However, the volume of sales of personal services dropped (also  in comparable prices) by 35.5 percent.    In 1993, 135 enterprises of municipal property were  privatized in Smolensk. The average rate of the value of the  enterprises sold (the ratio of the selling price to the initial  price) came to a factor of 69. Property funds received 33,500  privatization checks. The total proceeds from the sale of  enterprises was 1,922,400,000 rubles. Eleven thousand apartments  were also privatized. The rates of privatization of housing  increased by 42 percent.</p>

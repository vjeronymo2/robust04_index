			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Amid reports of a stream  of North Korean people escaping from their communist country or  from their logging yards in Siberia, North Korea has sharply  reinforced border guards in areas bordering China and Russia, it  was learned here on Friday.    "The brigade-strength North Korean border troops have  recently been reinforced to the strength of a corps consisting  of 30,000 to 40,000 men," Vice Unification Minister Song  Yong-tae said.    Speaking at a panel talks at the National Assembly, Song  said  in the past loggers at North Korea-run logging yards in Siberia  used to be granted special outings on Kim Il-song's birthday,  April 15, the biggest public holiday of North Korea.    "We have a report indicating that this year no outings were  allowed at all for their loggers in Siberia," Song said.    He said there had been no particular signs of armed  provocation on the part of North Korea.    But, people there have lately been whipped into producing  more military supplies in addition to daily necessities, and Kim  Il- song's birthday is being observed in low-key celebrations  this year, Song said.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK / SAM FARMER;  </P> <P> STRING OF CONFERENCE TRACK TITLES ENDS FOR GLENDALE  </P> <P> Although its string of 14 consecutive league titles came to an end, the  Glendale College men's track and field team made a strong showing in the  Western State Conference championships Friday at Bakersfield.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros, who were 9-0 in WSC meets, placed third in the conference finals  and fell victim to a rule implemented this season in which the conference  champion is determined solely on the outcome of the WSC finals. In years past,  a team's regular-season performance in dual meets was taken into account.  Glendale would have shared first with Bakersfield and Moorpark in that format.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, 10 men and seven women from Glendale qualified for the Southern  California preliminaries at Cerritos College on Saturday. The finals will be  held May 13.  </P> <P> Marty Beck, who was named the top men's athlete in the meet, qualified in four  events. Beck won the 400-meter hurdles in a personal-record 53.46 seconds and  the long jump with a leap of 23 feet, 9 inches, also a personal record.  </P> <P> Steve Barnett set a school and meet record in the javelin with a throw of  207-6.  </P> <P> Other qualifiers included John Szekely, who placed second in shotput at 49-0,  and Steve Graham, fourth in the 1,500 in 4:03.59, a personal record. John  Kearney posted a career best with a 4:03.61 finish in the 1,500 and Fernando  Diaz notched a personal record with a fifth-place finish (15:30.62) in the  5,000.  </P> <P> For the women, Marji Gilles qualified for the Southern California meet in six  events: triple jump (37-7 1/4), javelin (111-2), high jump (5-2), long jump  (16-11 3/4), shotput (33-1) and as a member of the 4 x 100 relay (53.24). The  relay team, which finished fourth, included Daniella Gogh, Bianca Howard,  Gilles and Margarita Red-Horse.  </P> <P> Karen Myers qualified in the javelin with at 129-3, the discus (122-0), the  shotput (34-11) and the triple jump (33-1 3/4).  </P> <P> Linda Benioff qualified in the shotput (39-4) and discus (114-7), Howard  finished second in the high jump (5-4) and Gogh placed fourth in the 100  hurdles (17.09).  </P> <P> Two days earlier, at Bakersfield, three Glendale runners qualified in the men's  10,000 meters. Graham finished second in 32:23, Kearney placed third in 32:58  and Diaz finished fifth (33:16). In the hammer throw, Jeff Levy finished second  with with an effort of 122-2.  </P> <P> He's waiting for the movie: Glendale High shortstop Swain Wukelich found that  when he starts checking his statistics, he inevitably falls into a slump. He  prefers the one-day-at-a-time approach in which each at-bat is a fresh start.  </P> <P> So when teammates bust out the stat book, Wukelich usually scoots.  </P> <P> He did, however, take a peek recently. And, well, ouch.  </P> <P> "He checked out his average and almost dropped on the floor," Coach Chris  Axelgard said. "He's hitting about .105. He's batting less than he weighs."  </P> <P> Wukelich batted .330 last season.  </P></p>

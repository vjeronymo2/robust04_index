			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFC PLAYOFF NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> CARSON EXPECTS BRONCOS TO BE IN A HURRY  </P> <P> In light of the chaos caused by the Buffalo Bills' unexpected no-huddle offense  last week, Cleveland Brown Coach Bud Carson spent the week preparing for more  of the same today from the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game.  </P> <P> "The Bills found a couple weak spots, and they exploited them. We didn't do a  very good job adjusting to them," Carson said. "They not only used a hurry-up  game on us, they used an even more effective hurry-up game in that they weren't  even audibling at the line of scrimmage. They were getting lined up and running  plays quickly."  </P> <P> Buffalo's Jim Kelly passed for 405 yards and four touchdowns against Cleveland  and nearly won the game before Clay Matthews intercepted a pass at the goal  line with three seconds left to preserve the Browns' win. One play earlier, a  potential touchdown pass glanced off the hands of Ronnie Harmon in the left  corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> Buffalo's first touchdown came on a no-huddle play that created confusion among  Cleveland's defenders. Matthews was feverishly trying to call a timeout as the  ball was snapped, and Kelly proceeded to hit a wide-open Andre Reed over the  middle for a 72-yard touchdown play.  </P> <P> Though Denver attempted to use a hurry-up offense without much success in a  16-13 loss to the Browns in Cleveland on Oct. 1, Carson said he'd be surprised  if the Broncos didn't try of it today.  </P> <P> "We're anticipating 90,000 no-huddles. Our whole practice has been no-huddles,"  he said.  </P> <P> The Browns are seeking their first Super Bowl appearance. The Broncos are after  their third appearance in four years and fourth overall. They are 0-3.  </P> <P> Denver had a 1,000-yard rusher and a 3,000-yard passer in the same season for  the first time. Its attack is more balanced than Cleveland's.  </P> <P> John Elway will supplement the passing game with Bobby Humphrey, who rushed for  1,151 yards as a rookie and scored eight touchdowns. He is effective inside and  out.  </P> <P> Elway did not have an outstanding season, but he did pass for 3,051 yards and  18 touchdowns. He also threw 18 interceptions and was the team's third-leading  rusher with 244 yards.  </P> <P> Cleveland's defensive backs excel at going for the ball -- the Browns led the  AFC with 27 interceptions.  </P> <P> The only snow fans at the game are likely to see will be capping the mountains  in the distance.  </P> <P> The forecast for today is mild and breezy, with increasing afternoon clouds and  high temperatures in the low 50s.  </P> <P> "It's perfect football weather," said weather service meteorologist Joe Baskin.  </P> <P> "It's cool enough for the players to enjoy it, and enough breeze to blow all  the smoke out of the stands. Just a really nice day."  </P> <P> Baskin said snow could follow on the heels of the game, however, perhaps on  Monday.  </P> <P> "Maybe for the ticker-tape parade," he said.  </P></p>

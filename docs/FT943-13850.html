			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / ITN plea for share transfer delay Independent Television News has appealed to the government to postpone an ownership skake-up at the news organisation following the spate of mergers among the big ITV companies. Under broadcasting legislation no single shareholder is allowed to have more than a 20 per cent stake in ITN, which supplies television news to ITV, Channel 4 and other broadcasting organisations. The Carlton Communications takeover of Central Television and the Granada acquisition of London Weekend Television means that Carlton and Granada each own 36 per cent of ITN. The other shareholders are Reuters, the news and information group, with 18 per cent, and Scottish and Anglia, each with 5 per cent. The Independent Television Commission has written to ITN and its shareholders reminding them of the 20 per cent rule and saying that it wants to see the issue resolved this year. Mr Michael Green, chairman of ITN and of Carlton Communications, has written to Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, asking for the restructuring to be delayed. The ITN argument is that changes to ownership should come at the same time as changes to cross-media ownership rules - something unlikely to happen before the 1995-96 parliamentary session. ITN has apparently been spared the most drastic ownership change in the 1990 Broadcasting Act. The act says that by the end of this year a majority of ITN should be held by non-ITV broadcasters. There is general acknowledgment that because of the way the act is drafted the ownership requirement can be met if ITN shares are held by the holding companies of the ITV investors. Barring a legal challenge it looks as if the ITV companies, through their holding companies, will be able to keep control of ITN.</p>

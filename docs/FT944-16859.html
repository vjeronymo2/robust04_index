			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph deals The buy-back of Telegraph shares began as dealers said parent group Hollinger came into the market to acquire 1.4m shares at 330p a share. The block is part of an intended 6.5m share purchase announced on Friday and the trade is expected to irritate financial institutions who were persuaded to pay 580p a share for 12.5m shares sold by Hollinger in May. One month after the original stake sale the Telegraph cut its newspaper cover price and the shares slumped to the current price. Yesterday the shares improved 4 to 334p with final turnover hitting 3.3m, the highest since the June slump.</p>

There was a conversation, a significant part of  which was held in the absence of press representatives. Various  aspects of further aid to Ukraine on the part of the Soros  Foundation were discussed during the conversation.    Leonid Kravchuk emphasized that in our state they highly  assess the humanistic activity of this foundation and are  grateful for the aid that is so necessary today for the  Ukrainian state.    After the conversation George Soros granted an interview to  journalists in which he, in particular, emphasized that during  his meeting with the president, apart from stating positive  factors of cooperation with our state, they also discussed an  issue on exempting from taxation separate kinds of aid extended  by the Soros Foundation to Ukraine.

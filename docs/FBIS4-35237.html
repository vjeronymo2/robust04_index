			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament has not yet  responded to a request by a southern Yemeni official to play a  "prominent role" in mediation efforts to end the war in Yemen in  accordance with conditions set by the Yemeni Socialist Party  (YSP) in Aden.    House Speaker Tahir al-Masri said Sunday he hasn't yet  looked  into ways of dealing with the request, which was made by Anis  Hasan Yahya, president of "the Provisional Assembly for National  Salvation" the caretaker parliament in the "Yemen Democratic  Republic."    In the letter, which was faxed to Mr. Masri Saturday  evening,  Mr. Yahya called on Jordan to intervene to "end the bloodshed  and the destruction for our people and country" by demanding an  end to the war and the withdrawal of northern Yemeni forces to  the borders that existed between South and North Yemeni before  they merged in 1990.    Mr. Yahya also called on the Kingdom to work with other  "Arab  brethren" to launch unconditional negotiations between the  warring parties in Yemeni under the auspices of the Arab League.    The southern Yemeni official said Aden welcomes a prominent  role for Jordan in negotiating an end to the war, especially  that Amman hosted the signing of the Yemeni reconciliation  accord in February.    Civil war erupted in Yemen on May 4 after Yemeni President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his then Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid failed to find a peaceful settlement to their conflict.    Mr. al-Bid later declared an end to the merger between the  north and the south, forming the Democratic Yemeni Republic.    More than three weeks of fighting have failed to produce a  military victory for either side and observers expect a  protracted civil war. Mr. Salih has rejected foreign mediation  efforts, including those by the Arab League, saying the war is  an internal Yemeni affair.    The official Jordanian media has taken what seems to be a  pro-north Yemeni stand, referring to the government in Sanaa as  the legitimate government and calling the forces of Mr. al-Bid  secessionists.    Parliamentary sources said Sunday that Jordan opposes the  fighting and supports unity, accepting whatever the Yemeni  people decide for themselves.    "We will not impose anything on any side," one lawmaker  said.</p>

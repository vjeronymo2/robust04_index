			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Arafat's pain It may seem churlish to speculate that Yassir Arafat chose peace because other options had been closed, but it is a difficult conclusion to resist. The terms accepted by Arafat in the Oslo agreement, signed at the White House in September 1993, bore little relation to the conditions sought by the Palestine Liberation Organisation in successive rounds of talks since the opening of the Madrid peace conference in October 1991. But, in one secret swoop, the deal with Israel catapulted Arafat from his backstreet office in Tunis to the forefront of international diplomacy. Unaccustomed to western praise, Arafat found it heaped upon him. The gun had given way to the olive branch. Peace, it seemed, had arrived in the Middle East. Hamas, the extremist Islamic group, and other radical Palestinian factions, rejected the deal. Palestinian sceptics were little moved, arguing that any outline accord which relied so heavily on Israeli generosity was doomed. The doubters were silent, or grudgingly willing to await developments. Enthusiasts declared that there could be no turning back. The question voiced more generally was whether Arafat, already under mounting criticism for his arbitrary leadership of the PLO, could ever develop the skills of consultation and delegation needed to administer a self-rule authority in the Gaza strip and West Bank. He has yet to provide a positive response. It might be argued that Arafat has scarcely been given a chance, either by the Israelis with their insistence that he wages war on Hamas, or by the international aid donors with their demands for total transparency and accountability in the dispersal of funds. But suspicions are growing about Arafat's handling of contracts, and his reliance on a small group of cronies linked to international business. This all smacks of the old Arafat in his Beirut days of the 1970s when he was accountable to no one, controlled a generously funded budget, and commanded a powerful guerrilla army. When, in November, Arafat's police opened fire on protesters in Gaza, fears grew among Palestinians that he was acting just as Hamas had forecast: as a surrogate for the Israeli armed forces so recently withdrawn. At the same time, little or no progress was being made on the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank which would trigger the holding of much-delayed Palestinian elections. With senior members of the Israeli cabinet openly questioning whether adequate protection could be provided for Israeli settlers, Arafat's popularity among Palestinians continued its decline. Unable to deliver for his own constituency, or for the Israeli government, Arafat's political prospects look bleak. However, he can draw some comfort from the number of times he has rebounded after being written off. The difference this time is that Arafat is relying for survival on the co-operation of old enemies, rather than old friends. The participants in the process all like to describe themselves as contributing to a 'peace of the brave'. Arafat knows what it is like to lose a war, but must fear that losing a peace could be considerably more painful.</p>

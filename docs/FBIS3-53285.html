The same source told IRNA here that right before the attack  the group's leader Sheikh Mostafa Naqshbandi was entertaining  PUK members. The source added that PUK members confiscated the  arms at the disposal of the Naqshbandi group.    Although the PUK has denied any involvement in the incident,  sources close to Jalal Talebani have disclosed that the  Naqshbandi group was attacked because the group was an Islamic  one.    The self-styled parliament of the Iraqi Kurdistan had passed  a law earlier for public disarmament. Observers feel that the  incident is a prelude to new inter-group clashes.</p>

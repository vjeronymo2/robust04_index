			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Nicholas and Alexander, the two rare beaked whales that have amazed ocean  scientists by surviving for more than a week, are continuing to hold their own  and Alexander even ate three pounds of herring. The two had not been expected  to survive the night when they were brought to Marine World/Africa USA animal  park in Vallejo after beaching themselves Aug. 24 on San Francisco's Ocean  Beach. The deep-ocean whales have been surviving on a diet of "fish shakes"  force fed to them through tubes. Another rare whale -- a young, female pygmy  sperm whale found beached between Santa Cruz and Monterey last week -- was  given only a 1-in-10 chance of survival.  </P></p>

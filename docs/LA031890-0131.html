			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSTENKOWSKI'S DEFICIT PLAN  </P> <P> Rostenkowski is to be commended for his courageous proposal to reduce our  horrendous federal deficit. The key feature of his proposal is the elimination  of the "tax bubble" raising the rate for the very wealthy from 28% to 33%.  </P> <P> Robert Kuttner, writing in The Times (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 13, 1989) pointed out  that so much red ink in our federal government comes from under-taxing our  nation's rich. "Simply collecting the taxes that the richest 1% paid back in  1977 would solve the problem.  </P> <P> "In 1988 . . . the wealthiest 1% of Americans received a record 12.5% of the  national income, or about $450 billion. The average household in this group  enjoyed an income of about $452,000. Simply collecting the taxes that the  richest 1% paid way back in 1977 would wipe out half of the budget deficit."  </P> <P> President Bush and former President Reagan argue that allowing our nation's  rich to become disproportionately richer is good for our economy.  Industrialists need the capital to expand.  </P> <P> But proponents of that view have yet to explain the great boom of the 1940s,  1950s, and 1960s when the economy enjoyed record growth and the distribution of  income was more equal.  </P> <P> President Bush is correct when he promised no new taxes. The issue isn't new  taxes. The issue is a fair tax program. We must return to the tax program of  1977.  </P> <P> All of us must pay our fair share, the wealthy as well as the middle class and  the poor.  </P> <P> S.M. ROSEN  </P> <P> Newbury Park  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Takehiko Yokoyama: "Japan-China </F> Relations May Step on Thin Ice"]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Jan -- Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata returned to Japan on the evening of 9  January after winding up his two-day visit to China. During a  series of talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li  Peng, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, the Japanese foreign  minister, taking advantage of the good state of Japan-China  relations, sought a candid exchange of views with the Chinese  leaders on China's growing military spending. In response, on  many occasions during the series of talks, the Chinese leaders  simply reiterated the country's basic stance, giving the  impression anew that although Japan-China relations are said to  be in a "mature stage," relations may be "stepping on thin ice."    Commenting on Foreign Minister Hata's visit to China, the  Foreign Ministry said: "The foreign minister had a broad-ranging  exchange of views with the Chinese leaders on building a  future-oriented relationship between the two countries looking  toward the 21st century." The Foreign Ministry has said that  Japan intends to help enhance security in the Asia-Pacific  region through an exchange of military information between the  two countries. The Foreign Ministry also has said that the  foreign minister's visit to China was to lay the groundwork for  Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to China, scheduled for this  spring.    For the Chinese Government, meanwhile, Japan's cooperation  with China in the areas of technology and economy is  indispensable for China to continue its policy of reform and  opening up. China intends to strengthen relations with Japan at  a time when Sino-U.S. relations remain unstable with the aim of  keeping the United States in check. Maintaining good relations  between Japan and China is in the interests of the two countries.    During the series of talks with the Chinese leaders, Foreign  Minister Hata candidly pointed out that China's neighbors are  concerned about its moves for military buildup and that China  needs to disclose military information.    In response, President Jiang Zemin devoted a substantial  amount of time to explaining the current state of China's armed  forces, but his explanations did not add anything to previous  explanations and lacked specifics. There is little possibility  that China will go along with the Japanese foreign minister's  request for disclosure of military information, and a security  dialogue between the two countries that Japan has sought is not  likely to proceed smoothly in the future.    The Taiwan issue drew attention during Mr. Hata's stay in  Beijing. Taiwan's economy has grown dramatically, and China has  become deeply concerned about Japan's rapid response to this  development.    Commenting on the Taiwan issue at a news conference in a  Beijing hotel on 9 January, Foreign Minister Hata said: "Taiwan  has grown remarkably, and it has become a nation that Japan  cannot ignore. Both China and Taiwan, however, reject the  concept of `two Chinas,' and Japan supports their positions.  Japan intends to honor the Japan-China Joint Communique." In  this way, the foreign minister reiterated that Japan will  confine its contacts with Taiwan to economic exchanges. Foreign  Minister Hata also ruled out the possibility of cabinet members  visiting Taiwan, which China has vehemently opposed.    Since Japan-China relations are entering a stage where they  can candidly discuss a variety of issues, a "rift" between the  two countries is surfacing in visible form. A senior Foreign  Ministry official says: "Japan-China relations remain very good.  But the attitude of China is such that it may unexpectedly  initiate changes in these ties. Postwar issues between the two  countries remain unresolved, and we do not know when those  issues might explode."</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAR, AT 59 YEARS OLD, COMES OF AGE  </P> <P> Speaking of "Anything Goes," now -- as the show's run winds up at the Center  and we won't be accused of trying to put a damper on ticket sales -- the truth  can be told.  </P> <P> Before the musical's opening, Mitzi Gaynor blew her "blond" top and refused to  give an interview to The Times because in a previous story, staff writer Jan  Herman had the audacity to print her age (59).  </P> <P> He added, right in the same sentence, that she looks "as hot as anyone had a  right to look at her (or any) age." But still, Mitzi hadn't liked that one bit,  and she went into a rage all over again when she was told that Herman, 48, was  on the phone to talk about "Anything Goes," 55, at the Center, 3.  </P> <P> Talk about the show? Talk about her work, her goals as a performer, her  approach to her craft? Not with him! HE told people HOW OLD I AM!  </P> <P> This is exactly the sort of me-me-me-me, what's-art-got-to-do-with-it (though  one does hesitate to use the words "art" and "Mitzi Gaynor" in the same  breath), oh-so-showbizy tripe that one would hope to avoid these days,  especially in dealing with productions brought in by a place such as the Center  -- which could, and should, be a champion of work that is innovative and, if  nothing else, serious and purposeful.  </P> <P> The Center should not, I think, be just another stop for some road show whose  principals still adhere to the Hedda Hopper school of mug-a-lot, hoof-a-lot and  never-let-em-know-how-old-you-are.  </P> <P> At least that's what my editor, 42, told me, 36.RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

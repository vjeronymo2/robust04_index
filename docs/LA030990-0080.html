			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE IN LOBSTER MECCA  </P> <P> For more than a quarter of a century, lobster fisherman John Guth has weathered  all sorts of unkind elements in pursuit of the stubborn little crustacean that  has put food on his table and those thick flannel shirts on his back.  </P> <P> There are the unpredictable ocean currents that play havoc with his submerged  traps. There are the gentle coastal breezes that, without a moment's notice,  can become gales strong enough to make even a brawny powerboat stand still in  the water.  </P> <P> And then there are the lowly lobster poachers, the pirate divers who, under the  cover of night, can fleece a whole set of traps, robbing local lobster  fishermen of thousands of dollars a year.  </P> <P> But now fishermen like Guth -- a rugged man with strong, steady hands -- are  facing an element more fickle than anything the moody Pacific could throw their  way.  </P> <P> Now, they say, they're doing battle with the whims of politicians.  </P> <P> In January, following through on the brainchild of Encinitas City Council  members, state legislators passed a bill to create an ocean sanctuary along a  half-mile strip of coastline in the city, effectively putting it off-limits to  commercial and sport fishermen, tide pool robbers, even divers looking for  dinner.  </P> <P> The new marine refuge stretches south from D Street at Moonlight Beach to the  southern edge of Swami's Point, a popular surfing spot noted for an extensive  reef system that stretches well beyond the breakers. The rugged ocean  outcropping serves as a feeding ground for an array of fish, and it harbors  perhaps the most abundant crop of lobster north of La Jolla Cove, which is  already designated a marine reserve.  </P> <P> Moreover, the tide pools that appear as the ocean recedes each day provide  homes for sea anemones, crabs, sea cucumbers and other flora and fauna of the  Pacific.  </P> <P> The legislation, sponsored by Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), was  designed to protect the ecologically rich coastline, prohibiting the harvesting  of all manner of marine life from the tide pools and reefs up to 600 feet  offshore.  </P> <P> But self-employed fishermen such as Guth see the law as just another threat to  their already beleaguered industry, locking them out of the fertile waters that  provide their keep.  </P> <P> "In this line of work, we're at the mercy of the elements, the thieves and the  poachers and the unpredictable ocean," Guth said Thursday morning as he  repaired lobster traps on the 35-foot Stephanie D, moored in Oceanside Harbor.  "Now it's the politicians and bureaucrats as well.  </P> <P> "We've been fishing those waters for generations and we've never harmed the  ecosystem there. But as soon as Encinitas becomes a city, these new politicians  want to go out and save the world. Well, this little part of the world has  already been saved."  </P> <P> The fishermen cite the 1972 Tidal Invertebrate Act, which protects most  invertebrates within 1,000 feet of the shoreline. An exclusion in the act  allows commercial and sport fishermen to harvest lobsters in the zone, as long  as they keep to limits imposed by the state Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> The fishermen hope to gain a similar exclusion for the marine refuge, which  they say wasn't necessary in the first place.  </P> <P> "It's like putting a stop sign in the middle of the desert," said Guth, a  48-year-old Encinitas resident. "It's useless."  </P> <P> Chris Heiserman, administrative assistant for Mojonnier, said the intent of the  legislation is not to put the lobstermen out of business. "That's not what we  set out to do," he said.  </P> <P> Recently, several lobstermen met with Mojonnier, Encinitas city officials and  marine life experts to strike a compromise that would allow them to continue  plying their trade within the rich coastal waters.  </P> <P> In the end, Mojonnier agreed to refer the law to legislative council in  Sacramento to determine whether licensed fishermen should be allowed inside the  protected area, as the lobstermen and their lawyer claim.  </P> <P> The reefs are worth fighting for, fishermen say. The refuge is home to abundant  numbers of lobsters because of the rocky clefts and crevices where the  creatures seek cover.  </P> <P> "It's not like we can fish the entire coast; there's only a few places that  support the lobsters in those kind of numbers," Guth said. "And what's to stop  the guy in Solana Beach or someplace else from wanting to put a refuge in front  of his house -- where's it going to end?"  </P> <P> Dave Wigginton, director of community services for Encinitas, said the refuge  was intended to protect the tide pools that were being stripped by people  walking on the beach at low tide.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Anne Omsted, he said, had noticed a drastic reduction of marine  life in the pools because of the "free-lance harvesting."  </P> <P> While the lobstermen claim their harvests don't disrupt the fragile ecology,  Wigginton said that city officials aren't so sure.  </P> <P> "That's what they say, but I've been shown no proof one way or the other. I'm  not a biologist," he said.  </P> <P> Officials also worry that the dangerous traps sometimes drift ashore in bad  weather or are a hazard to surfers, including one youth who was killed off  Carlsbad State Beach in 1985 when his surfboard leash became tangled in a trap  line.  </P> <P> Besides, Wigginton said, there has already been compromise. The original scope  of the refuge extended to a mile offshore. After the lobstermen complained, it  was reduced to the present 600 feet, he said.  </P> <P> Guth said many fishermen are miffed because they were never consulted over the  new refuge.  </P> <P> "They don't care what happens to us," he said. "We don't matter; we're just a  few old dinosaurs, anyway."  </P> <P> In an unusual alliance, the commercial lobstermen have even received support  from the state Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> Phil Swartzell, a marine biologist for the agency, told officials at the recent  meeting that he thought the refuge was redundant to existing state laws  protecting the area.  </P> <P> "We should have laws and regulations only to the extent that we achieve what  we're trying to achieve. They shouldn't restrict beyond that," he said.  </P> <P> "If the objective is to have life in the tide pool area where people can  examine invertebrates and plants in their environment, I don't think that  having lobster fishermen in the area is going to affect that."  </P> <P> One solution, officials say, would be to offer special permits to the dozen or  so lobstermen who regularly harvest in the area. But the last thing Guth and  others say they need is another permit.  </P> <P> "I've already got 500 permits," he said. "We're under the gun all the time from  all these agencies. It's just another club they have to hang over your head."  </P> <P> Guth, who also fishes his 500 traps off San Clemente Island, says the plan will  most likely affect the smaller-scale lobstermen whose boats are too tiny to  venture very far from shore.  </P> <P> "It means up to a third of their earnings," he said. "Some of them could go out  of business, lose the livelihoods their fathers taught them."  </P> <P> Some of them have already left. Last year, a good friend of Guth's packed in  his traps and moved to Wyoming. "He said he was sick and tired of dealing with  all the politics," Guth said.  </P> <P> While reducing the pool of lobstermen in North County may be healthy in the  long run, Guth doesn't want to see any veteran fishermen robbed of their  hard-earned professions.  </P> <P> "They're reducing our territory all the time," he said. "We're like a can of  worms. Or a bunch of snapping lobsters in a trap."  </P> <P> For now, officials say, they may be saved by the bell. Lobster season ends this  month and doesn't open again until October. By then, they hope to have found a  solution.  </P> <P> Otherwise, officials say, they'll begin laying the buoys that will effectively  wall off North County lobstermen from yet another fertile fishing ground.  </P> <P> As he hauls his traps in for the summer, John Guth can only shake his head.  </P> <P> Sometimes, he says, fishermen are their own worst enemies. They're loners who  rarely agree on anything -- independent men with temperaments better fit for  the open ocean, not City Council chambers.  </P> <P> "That's why I became a fisherman," he said, "to get away from these  well-intentioned but uninformed politicians who want to save the world."  </P></p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fotex lifts turnover 40% in year FOTEX, the retail group which is Hungary's largest public company, lifted turnover last year by 40 per cent to Ft9bn (Dollars 106m). The full consolidation of Kontur, a department store chain in western Hungary, a doubling of turnover at Azurinvest, the wholesaling subsidiary, and growing returns from the distribution of Gillette razors, contributed to the improvement. Fotex expects that last year's purchases of Ofotert, a photo-developer, and Domus, a furniture retailer, will add another Ft5bn to turnover for the current year. Fotex has expanded largely through bids for companies set for privatisation. However, executives expect a pause in its acquisition strategy in the first part of the year to allow time to digest and implement new management systems. The acquisitions, while boosting turnover, hit profitability. Fotex drew down the cash raised through a Dollars 54m share offering in the US during 1991 and interest income fell, pushed down by plummeting deposit rates. The fall in interest income was largely offset by improving operating results. Profits after tax came to an estimated Ft1bn in 1992 compared with Ft1.05bn a year earlier.</p>

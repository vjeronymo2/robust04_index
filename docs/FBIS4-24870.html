			<p>BFN     [Text] Bogota, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Colombia notified the  U.S. Government that it will not revoke its decision to  intercept and shoot down any plane that has been declared  suspicious or hostile even if the Pentagon decides definitively  it will no longer supply information on unauthorized flights.    The "EL TIEMPO" newspaper revealed today that Colombia's  Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda and Air Force Commander  Major General Alfonso Abondano Alzamora spoke out publicly and  forcefully to that respect.    The minister and commander were in response to the U.S.  Government's official information on Tuesday [31 May] that the  suspension of U.S. radar operations in Colombia and Peru was due  to the fact that the U.S. Defense Department is in disagreement  with Colombia's decision and practices in Peru.    Pardo Rueda affirmed that the Colombian Government is not  going to suspend its order to Colombia's Air Force to intercept  planes without registration numbers, request their flight plan  and force them to land if the pilots of those aircraft do not  supply the same or shoot them down if they refuse to comply with  orders.    He said that the measure is a valuable tool which Colombia  is  using to prevent drug traffickers and other criminals from  violating Colombian air space.    Colombia's Air Force commander lodged a protest over the  unilateral suspension of radar operations and said that the U.S.  decision was taken without consultation.    It was reported that the U.S. Government is studying the  re-establishment of radar services and information for  controlling drug trafficking in Colombia and Peru.</p>

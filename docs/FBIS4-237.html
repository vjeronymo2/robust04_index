			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 6 SAPA -- Police have reported 13  further killings in Natal this week, pushing the death toll  since last Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency in the  region to at least 101. It emerged on Wednesday that there were  some overlaps in violence reports from the kwaZulu Police, SA  Police [SAP] and the SA Defence Force [SADF].    The latest confirmed deaths, however, put the toll at 101  since last Thursday.    Among the overlapping reports was one of six deaths in  Ndwedwe at the weekend, reported by the SAP on Wednesday.    The kwaZulu Police on Tuesday reported 10 weekend killings  in  Ndwedwe and it emerged that this included the SAP's report of  six murders there.    The Natal Security Committee -- comprising the SAP and SADF  -- said 11 more people had been killed in the region since  Tuesday morning. After investigation, however, it emerged that  four of these deaths had already been reported.    The latest deaths included the fatal shooting of a man at  Batania mission, near Port Shepstone.    In war-torn Bhambayi, north of Durban, a woman was shot dead  and another injured.    In kwaMbonambi, on the North Coast, a man was shot dead. In  the nearby Masekane area, a school child was fatally shot.    In the Northern Natal area of Newcastle, two people were  killed and seven were injured in an attack at the Mfolozi  reserve.    At the Mashenga reserve, also near Newcastle, a man was shot  dead.    The committee said three houses were burnt down in the  Drycott area of Estcourt, in the Midlands, and two houses were  petrol bombed in the Northern Natal area of Dundee.    At kwaKhoza, near the North Coast area of Eshowe, security  forces confiscated sticks, spears, and a firearm from a group of  20 men.    In Wembezi, outside Estcourt, participants of an Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] march were searched and a revolver and  homemade gun were confiscated along with a quantity of  ammunition.    IFP supporters en route to Tuesday's march in Empangeni were  stopped in two buses and a shotgun, ammunition, and three  homemade guns were confiscated.    Meanwhile, Wednesday's toll includes six deaths reported  earlier in Nongoma, Zululand, where three people were shot dead  in a car, and another three were murdered in a minibus in a  suspected taxi feud.</p>

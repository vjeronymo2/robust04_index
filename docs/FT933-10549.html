			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Abbey National rises 11% pre-tax ABBEY National, the home loans and banking group, yesterday reported an 11 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 301m (Dollars 448.5m) from Pounds 270m. It was helped by rapid growth in wholesale-funded fixed-rate mortgages. Abbey achieved a 31 per cent rise in UK retail profits, to Pounds 300m from Pounds 229m, helped by a lower bad debt charge of Pounds 118m against Pounds 146m. This reflected a fall in house repossessions and in the number of mortgages in arrears. In France, the bad debt charge rose to Pounds 94m, from Pounds 16m last time, because of the weak commercial property market. France accounted for the bulk of an Pounds 86m loss in continental Europe and offshore, against a Pounds 9m loss in the first half of 1992. The European problems drove up the overall bad debt charge, which includes loan provisions and suspended interest, by 35 per cent to Pounds 222m. Abbey raised its share of new mortgage lending to 23.3 per cent of the UK mortgage market, against 12.4 per cent, by promotion of fixed-rate mortgages. Net lending was Pounds 2bn, compared with Pounds 1.2bn, largely funded by wholesale funds rather than retail savings. The group's share of UK retail savings fell fro 4.1 to 3.3 per cent as retail inflows dropped to Pounds 400m from Pounds 700m, and the percentage of the domestic mortgage book funded by retail savings fell to 80 per cent from 86 per cent. Operating profits before bad debts rose 20 per cent to Pounds 523m. Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, said the result was 'encouraging, given that the UK housing market is only just beginning to emerge from a prolonged recession'. Sir Christopher said Abbey believed trading results in France might be improved by interest rate cuts. Lex, Page 14</p>

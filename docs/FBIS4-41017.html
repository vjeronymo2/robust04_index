			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has addressed  Russian President Boris Yeltsin, proposing to set up a  Russian-Ukrainian oil company as a transnational corporation.  The proposal was made after Kravchuk's visit to Lugansk's  Lisichansk Petroleum Organic Synthesis joint stock company.

The president of Ukraine familiarized himself with the state  of affairs at the joint stock company. At a meeting with the  enterprise's leadership, work force, and specialists, the  prospects for the development of the oil processing sector and  ways of curbing its economic crisis were discussed.    On the same day, Kravchuk met representatives of labor  collectives, local authorities, parties, and movements from the  towns of Lisichansk, Rubezhnoye, Pervomaysk, as well as  (?Kalininskiy) and some other rayons of Lugansk Oblast.

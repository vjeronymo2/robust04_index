			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 18 (AFP) -- The United Nations  withdrew seven of its liaison officers from the besieged eastern  Bosnian enclave of Gorazde Monday but left five unarmed military  observers behind, General Michael Rose, the UN ground commander  in Bosnia, said.    Rose said the liaison officers were pulled out of the Moslem  enclave at dawn because their equipment was not usable. He did  not elaborate on what he meant by that.    Earlier in Zagreb, a French military source reported that  the  UN had pulled all of its personnel from Gorazde overnight Sunday  as the Serbs intensified their shelling of the town where some  60,000 people are trapped.    The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva said four of  its representatives also remain in the enclave.</p>

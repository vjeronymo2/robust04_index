			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant unveils Pounds 4.2m rights issue to reduce debt HOLMES &amp; MARCHANT, the once-acquisitive marketing services group, yesterday unveiled plans for a Pounds 4.2m rights issue aimed at reducing debt amassed in its purchases. The cash call, on a 1-for-3 basis at 75p per share, accompanied a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.64m to Pounds 1.7m in the six months to March 31. The latest figure was struck after exceptional charges totalling Pounds 105,000 largely reflecting reorganisation costs offset partly by profits on sale of investments. For the past year Holmes has been affected by the impact of the recession on its marketing services consultancies, notably its design and sales promotion businesses. Turnover fell to Pounds 25.16m (Pounds 30.7m) and earnings per share to 6.6p (13.7p) but the interim dividend is held at 3.3p. Mr Emyr Jones, finance director, said the group was still trading within its banking facilities but was concerned that the interest bill was absorbing a high proportion of operating profits. 'It would take us four or five years to trade our way out of this situation,' he said. 'The easiest way of reducing our debt was by raising money and the best way to do that was a rights issue.' The issue is underwritten by Lazard Brothers with Cazenove acting as broker. Holmes' shares slipped by 1p to 84p on the announcement yesterday. Holmes has spent Pounds 13.7m on acquisitions in the past two and a half years and has been left with net debt of Pounds 11.3m as a result. It paid Pounds 839,000 (Pounds 554,000) in interest from operating profits of Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 4.2m) in the first half. The group also expects to have to pay Pounds 2.8m in defered payments on acquisitions over the next two years. Mr Jones said so far this year there had been no sign of any change in trading conditions, although the market did seem to have stabilised. He said Holmes did not anticipate any significant recovery until early next year.</p>

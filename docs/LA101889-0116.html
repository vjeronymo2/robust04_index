			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEMBLOR SPURS REVIEWS OF ORANGE COUNTY'S PLANNING  </P> <P> Top Orange County officials vowed Tuesday night to immediately begin reviewing  the county's earthquake preparedness plan, acknowledging that the county is not  ready for a disaster such as the one that hit the San Francisco Bay Area.  </P> <P> "If that quake had struck Orange County, we'd have similar problems," said  Christine Boyd, manager of the county's disaster planning agency. "We've taken  some steps to get ready, but we've got a ways to go. This serves as a good  lesson, and hopefully it will push to get us going."  </P> <P> County Administrative Officer Larry A. Parrish said he told key members of his  staff by telephone late Tuesday to review the county's preparedness plans. But  Parrish would not predict whether the 6.9-magnitude quake in the Bay Area will  mean more local money for countywide emergency preparedness. He would say only  that the disaster may have a "very sobering effect on our financial  priorities."  </P> <P> In 1985, a sweeping plan designed specifically to help the county prepare for  such a calamity was created. Known as the Southern California Emergency  Preparedness Project, the plan covers everything from educating the public on  how to prepare for a major quake to deployment of equipment, medical supplies  and volunteers during such a catastrophe. But so far, the county has spent less  than $300,000 on the plan, which Parrish said would cost about $12 million to  implement fully.  </P> <P> "At this point," Parrish said, "it's not within our capacity. . . . The  temptation there is to say whatever it takes, we'll spend it. But perspective  is critical. I just think we need a little time to assess what's worked and  what hasn't."  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, while supporting Parrish's  review of the county's response plans, said that paying for such preparations  is difficult in light of the county's fiscal condition and pressing needs.  </P> <P> "The amounts of money you're talking about make it very difficult to finance,"  Riley said. "You got jails. You've also got the homeless. You've got  innumerable projects that are crying out (for county money). These have greater  appeal to all of us.  </P> <P> "I guess most of us think it can't happen to us. You just hope it doesn't  happen here," he added.  </P> <P> But Boyd, manager of the county's Emergency Management Division, said the Bay  Area quake serves as a graphic lesson that she hopes will stir commitment to  local preparedness efforts.  </P> <P> "I hope that if anything constructive can come out of this tragedy, it's that  people must prepare," Boyd said. "The San Andreas Fault is not exclusive to the  Bay Area. It can happen here, and we've got to redouble our efforts to get  ready."  </P> <P> The San Andreas passes about 30 miles northeast of the Los Angeles Basin. But  many earthquake experts say Orange County residents face an even greater threat  from the Newport-Inglewood Fault, which travels along the county coast from  Newport Beach to Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> A cadre of county emergency officials, from utility managers to physicians,  were preparing Tuesday night to lend assistance to the quake-relief effort in  Northern California.  </P> <P> The National Guard's 40th Division, based in Los Alamitos, has been placed on  alert, but no troops or equipment have yet been dispatched to aid in quake  relief, a National Guard spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Boyd's agency sent one of its senior coordinators to the Bay Area to observe  recovery operations. County fire officials were on alert, prepared to send  medical and fire equipment as well as volunteers to quake-stricken areas.  </P> <P> The local Red Cross chapter opened its emergency disaster center in Santa Ana  to answer calls from county residents concerned about friends and relatives in  the Bay Area. Red Cross Director George Brown said about a dozen volunteers  answered calls from anxious county residents, many of them wondering how to  safeguard their homes in event of a similar quake. The Red Cross information  line is (714) 835-5381.  </P> <P> "It always happens, but it takes pictures of a major disaster on TV to get them  concerned about their preparedness," Brown said. "In a way, maybe that's good,  but I just hope people get the message."  </P> <P> County residents were also urged Tuesday night not to phone the Bay Area.  Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonnekson said the few phone lines still working  in the Bay Area are overloaded with calls, complicating and slowing relief  efforts.  </P> <P> Because phone service is so critical, Bonnekson said that Pacific Bell conducts  quarterly drills with dozens of employees at its large Tustin operational  center. The facility employs more than 1,000 workers, including several shifts  of operators.  </P> <P> "With roads knocked out, the phone becomes a key tool in coping with an  emergency of this type," Bonnekson said. "We try to train our people how to  deal with the disaster and keep working at the same time."  </P> <P> For Robert Bade, a county emergency medical physician, the Bay Area quake  underscored the need to develop a network of private doctors ready to roll  should a quake strike. Bade has been pushing for six years to establish a team  of "quake-ready" doctors, a program that has received nearly $25,000 in seed  money from county officials.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, Bade spoke Tuesday to two civic groups in Tustin and Dana Point  on this very subject.  </P> <P> "It used to the kind of topic that would put a luncheon group to sleep," Bade  said. "Now, after seeing those remarkable and sad pictures on TV, maybe people  will start to take this seriously. I think they are."  </P></p>

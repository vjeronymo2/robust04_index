			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Management: Putting over the message Are middle managers really obstructive to change? Nine months ago Ingersoll Engineers, the consulting firm, published a survey strongly suggesting that they are. It polled top directors of British manufacturing companies and discovered that 41 per cent found middle managers resistant, and only 21 per cent believed them supportive. Now Ingersoll has returned to the same businesses, talked to the middle-ranking executives themselves, and concluded that there is another side to the story. Their apparent truculence stems not, it now seems, from any underlying wish to oppose change in principle, but from a lack of understanding and from ineffective, unprofessional, internal communication. The two surveys show that there is little disagreement between managing directors and ordinary managers on the need for change and on the priorities of change programmes. Both groups lay heavy emphasis on communication and commitment, but according to managers the communications process itself is often flawed. The failure, according to the study, appears to lie in what is actually communicated (the message) and how (the medium). The perception of breakdown is widespread - with approach, skills and technique all suspect; too often changes are announced, or initiated with information which is insufficient or too incomplete for others to be able to understand them. Communication both upwards and downwards is considered crucial. 'Frequently the downward is there, but the upward falls on deaf ears,' commented one manager. 'Attempts (to change) without communicating . . . lead to the suspicion of a hidden agenda,' says another. 'The undeniably good news,' claims Brian Small, Ingersoll Engineers' managing director, 'is that there are clearly no longer any cultural barriers to the efficient management of change programmes; the big pitfall is misunderstanding. 'Communicating a clear plan superlatively well is central to creating the confidence for successful change.'</p>

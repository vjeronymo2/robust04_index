			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Curb advances above 90%, societies told BUILDING SOCIETIES will be encouraged not to lend more than 90 per cent of the value of properties and to be more cautious about borrowers' ability to repay loans under Building Societies Commission proposals disclosed yesterday. Mrs Rosalind Gilmore, chairman of the industry's regulatory commission, said societies were likely to have to set aside additional capital to cover the risk of lending more than 90 per cent of the value of properties. Mrs Gilmore also told the Building Societies Association annual conference in Brighton that they would probably be encouraged to calculate borrowers' ability to repay loans on the basis of minimum mortgage rates of 10 per cent. Mrs Gilmore's disclosure of details of a forthcoming prudential note from the commission is likely to add to growing caution among mortgage lenders about giving mortgages to borrowers lacking substantial savings. But she emphasised that societies had 'a duty' not to cut off lending to categories of borrowers such as single parents and older people living alone whose income was 'both less, and less secure'. Mrs Gilmore's remarks follow the disclosure by Bristol &amp; West Building Society that it is to start pricing mortgages according to the family status of borrowers later this year to take account of different risks. She said trying to raise prices to cover higher risk in a particular segment of the lending market was 'a particularly difficult strategy to isolate and define accurately' for mass products. 'I doubt whether it can be done,' she said. She said the 87 societies were now having to lend 'against a background in which loan assets will be more fragile than ever before'. This would lead to permanent changes in the way lending was done. She remarked that mortgage loans above 90 per cent of property values would in future be allocated a risk weighting of 65 per cent rather than 50 per cent when calculating the capital to be set aside in balance sheets. This she said would reflect the higher risk attached to loans of above 90 per cent because of changes in the terms of mortgage indemnity insurance of societies under renegotiated contracts with insurers. Mrs Gilmore also warned societies of the risks of failing to hedge fixed rate or capped mortgages, and told them to err on the side of caution. 'The game at this stage is to bet low to find out more clearly what the dangers are,' she said. She said two years of falling house prices and high interest rates had 'driven home the dangers' of lending at a high proportion of loan to value. Even some lenders with conservative policies had been 'taken aback' by the risks.</p>

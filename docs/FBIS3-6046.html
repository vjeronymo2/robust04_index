			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By An Song-kyu from Panmunjom] </F>   [Text] On the morning of 12 March, the North held its  sixth working-level contact with the South at the House of Peace  in the South side's area of Panmunjom to discuss issues such as  the actual procedures for the exchange of special envoys.    At today's contact, the South side stressed that this year's  Team Spirit exercise will be suspended, and that the third round  of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks will proceed smoothly only  if the exchange of special envoys is held. In relation to the  actual procedures, the South side revealed it would be willing  to consider flexibly accepting North Korea's proposal on  amendments to the agreement on exchanging special envoys if the  North side renounces its four demands that include President Kim  Yong-sam taking back his remarks regarding the North Korean  nuclear issue.    While repeatedly demanding that "the South side must express  its position, in any form, regarding the North side's four  demands," Pak Yong-su, the North side's chief delegate, receded  slightly from his previous position by saying that he would  "take note of the South's indication that the North side's four  demands were problematic."    Chief delegate Pak also proposed that they issue a joint  communique on the will of both sides "to exchange special  envoys" prior to adopting an agreement.</p>

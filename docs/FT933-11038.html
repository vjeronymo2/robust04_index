			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Pragmatism v dogmatism BATTERED AND drowsy, the European exchange rate mechanism looks to be on its last legs. Miraculous recoveries have been known before. But unless Europe's finance ministers are able to hatch a plan over this weekend which can promise to deliver a sizeable cut in French interest rates very soon, the prospects for fixed exchange rates surviving in Europe, other than among a small core of Germany's north European partners, look slim. What is needed is a pragmatic and face-saving escape route for the French government which can deliver lower rates without requiring the abandonment of its European ambitions and commitments. It is in Bonn, more than Frankfurt and even Paris, that the hard thinking must take place. Germany's political leaders, rudely awakened in their holiday retreats, must put past errors and disagreements behind them. Yes, Bundesbank council members can rightly complain that it is the German government's budget profligacy that has required them to keep interest rates so high. Yes, German government ministers can mutter that France should not have resisted a upward realignment of the D-Mark when it still made sense. Nor are French remonstrations about the Bundesbank's lamentable performance over the past week likely to help in the search for a route out of the current crisis. Reasonable people can disagree about whether recession-troubled Germany really does face a short-term inflationary threat. But it was perfectly within the Bundesbank council's rights to resist a cut in its discount rate if it truly believed that such a cut would run counter to its declared aim of securing medium-term price stability in Germany. But the French can complain about the Bundesbank's failure to quell the widespread rumour before Thursday's council meeting that a discount rate cut was imminent. Indeed, by cutting the repo rate almost to the discount rate floor on Wednesday, the bank actively fed those rumours. Ruled out Still, the substance, not the style, of the Bundesbank's decision was what set off yesterday's turmoil on the foreign exchanges. For the Bundesbank has effectively ruled out a cut in interest rates in the ERM, as currently constituted for some weeks. This realisation was enough to undermine confidence in the ability of Belgium, Denmark and, most important, France to live with the high real interest rates that Germany's fiscal difficulties are transmitting across Europe. Intervention, on an unprecedented scale in Europe's monetary history, could not keep the French franc from falling out of its ERM bands. The future of Franco-German monetary relations has thus reached a crucial juncture. The time has now passed when public statements of commitment to current parities from the French minsters can do much good. Regardless of the hopes and wishes of the French government, the markets do not now appear to believe that France can maintain interest rates at their current levels. The gap between the market rates and prime rates is too large, the banking system too weak, the French economy too troubled and the erosion of public support for the franc fort policy, in the face of rising unemployment, too rapid. Any effort to sweat next week out will probably end in failure. Economic reality Nor is a realignment, or modest widening of bands, likely to buy anything more than a fleeting breathing space. France, Belgium and Denmark are not burdened by uncompetitive exchange rates, but by much higher interest rates than their excellent inflation performances require. A realignment cannot work unless it persuades the Bundesbank to cut German interest rates. But Germany's inflationary pressures are in the service sector, where the impact of a higher exchange rate is negligible. In the private sector, where a stronger D-Mark would bite, deflation is currently the problem. The only other alternative, short of a rapid and politically improbable move to monetary union, is temporarily to sever the Franco-German monetary link. France can no longer afford to ignore the economic reality that Germany's particular problems demand a tighter monetary policy than France can sustain. What is needed is a way to break the link in a manner consistent with the French government's political pledges: to stay in the ERM and to honour the spirit of the Maastricht treaty. The solution is for the German government to propose what now seems economically rational, if politically very difficult: the temporary departure of the D-Mark from the ERM. The remaining ERM member countries should then announce an immediate 2 percentage point cut in interest rates, perhaps accompanied by a move to narrower bands. France may blanche at such an outcome. But, by choosing pragmatism, both Paris and Bonn would signal a partial but honourable retreat from their joint monetary aspirations. Trying to soldier on looks increasingly likely to deliver an inferior outcome, and in a much more ignominious fashion.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Short list of high pay-outs Sir, Nothing emphasises more the misunderstanding by Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, of the financing of publicly quoted companies than his weekend statement that 'it may be right for Glaxo and ICI to distribute as they do but it isn't right for an expanding high-tech firm with a capitalisation of Pounds 50m'. I have been in the City a long time, but I cannot recall too many expanding high-tech firms noted for their high pay-outs. Perhaps Mr Dorrell could produce a list. It would be a very short one. M J Hart, chairman, Foreign &amp; Colonial Management, Exchange House, Primrose Street, London EC2A 2NY</p>

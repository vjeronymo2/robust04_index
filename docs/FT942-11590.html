			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Large National Insurance shortfalls found Employers appear to be underpaying National Insurance contributions due on their employees' company cars to the tune of more than Pounds 240m a year, the National Audit Office says in a report published today. The public expenditure watchdog reports that fewer than half of 10,000 employers surveyed were paying the right amount. Underpayments averaged 36 per cent of the amount due. The audit office has qualified the accounts of the National Insurance fund because of uncertainties over the amounts of contributions underpaid. However, the Contributions Agency, responsible for collecting National Insurance, said last night that the underpayments were still being pursued. Underpaid contributions can be pursued for up to six years after they are due. Employers are liable to pay Class 1A contributions on the cash equivalent benefit of cars and car fuel provided to employees. About half the money is paid direct to the Contributions Agency, the rest collected through PAYE by the Inland Revenue. The Revenue has been unable to modify its computer systems to separate Class 1A contributions from other National Insurance contributions. The National Insurance accounts are therefore based on an estimate by the Government Actuary of Pounds 429m for the amount collected in Class 1A contributions. The Contributions Agency wants to use company car declarations provided to the Inland Revenue by employers to check that the right amount of National Insurance has been paid. It is also compiling a register of employers to assist in checks. In addition to monitoring Class 1A contributions, the register will be used to ensure that employers deduct and pay the right amount of Class 1 contributions on employees' earnings. The agency's inspectors discovered underpayments in Class 1 contributions of some Pounds 89m on visits to 118,000 employers. Inland Revenue staff checking PAYE records discovered Pounds 48m of underpayments on 46,000 inspection visits. But since employers' visits are targeted on high-risk businesses, the agency is unable to quantify the overall level of error in contribution receipts. The accounts have also been qualified over uncertainties experienced in previous years in the amounts employers are paying out in statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay. The agency plans a survey of employers to determine whether correct amounts are paid out. The level of errors in unemployment benefit payments were also censured by the NAO.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Observer: Smoke rings From cramming the lines to clearing the air. Squeamishly capitalist Californian long-distance telephone company Working Assets - which has regularly offered its subscribers free calls to Hillary Clinton and other US eminences to lobby for causes such as nationalised healthcare - has hit on another do-gooding dodge. This time its target is the permits the Environmental Protection Agency issues to electrical utility companies setting a specific limit, according to their size, on the amount of sulphur dioxide each may emit into the atmosphere. Although intended to control the total amount of the emissions, the permits are marketable. A holder that manages to make do with less than its quota can sell the short-fall portion to another which wants to belch out more. So Working Assets is proposing to put a percentage of the bills paid by its subscribers into a fund to buy up the unused permits, and take them out of circulation altogether. 'If you want to do something to reduce pollution, this is probably the easiest and most direct thing you can do,' says owner-president Pete Barnes. 'Every dollar keeps about 10 pounds of sulphur dioxide out of the air.' Well, maybe - unless the agency resorts to the printing press and issues new permits to fill up the space the company has cleared.</p>

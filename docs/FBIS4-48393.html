			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Council of Ministers' Secretariat </F> in Luanda on 16 May]    [Text] It was with astonishment that the Council of  Ministers' Secretariat of the Republic of Angola learned about a  recent report circulated by a Spanish daily EL PAIS. The report  says the former director of the Spanish Civil Defense [Guarda  Civil], accused of corruption and evasion of justice, personally  promoted and participated in an arms sale operation to Angola  between the end of 1992 and beginning of 1993. The report also  says Angolan leaders were involved in this alleged arms traffic.    The Council of Ministers' Secretariat of the Republic of  Angola categorically rejects the manner in which the report has  been circulated, since relations between Angola and Spain have  always been at the level of sovereign states, based on the  existing cooperative relations. The communique says at no time  has the Angolan Government established relations with Spanish  private entities or individuals.    The Council of Ministers' Secretariat can only conclude that  the report is simply aimed at making an abusive link between an  individual on the run from justice and a legitimate government  that has nothing to do with the internal affairs of other  countries, no matter how good the relations between them.</p>

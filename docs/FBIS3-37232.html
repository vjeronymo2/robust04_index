The talks with the  U.S. President proceeded "in a cordial and friendly atmosphere,"  the Kazakh leader stressed, expressing satisfaction with the  fact that the White House meeting had proved "productive."    Nursultan Nazarbayev noted that the Charter of Democratic  Partnership signed by the two presidents "marks a qualitatively  new stage in our relations, which are now assuming a more  comprehensive and long-term character." The document "embraces  such areas as politics, economics, military cooperation,  science, and technology, ecology, health care, and more."  Security guarantees from the United States contained in the  Charter, as well as Kazakhstan's participation in the  multilateral cooperation in the framework of the Partnership for  Peace program adopted by NATO, strengthen our confidence in  Kazakhstan's future as a sovereign state, President Nazarbayev  stressed.    Earlier on Monday Kazakhstan's president met representatives  of the U.S. business community. An agreement was signed on the  principles of cooperation between the Republic of Kazakhstan,  the U.S. Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation,  and the U.S.-Kazakhstan Council for Economic Development.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Crucial week for Italy's emergency economic package THE Italian government's emergency economic package faces a decisive week in parliament. The package, which seeks to raise L30,000bn (Pounds 13.9bn) through revenues and spending cuts, is due to be debated by the Chamber of Deputies by Wednesday. Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, has yet to decide whether to urge a vote of confidence, but he may be forced to do so to ensure swift approval. Some 500 amendments have been tabled mainly by the populist Lombard League and the breakaway communists grouping, Reconstructed Communism. But so far the package, announced on July 10, has gone through the lengthy parliamentary procedures in record time. Mr Amato said at the weekend that he had repeatedly underlined the dramatic state of Italy's finances to all 16 parties in parliament over the past two weeks, and believed the message for urgent action had sunk in. His message has been reinforced by the continued weakness of the lira and latest figures on the public sector deficit. During the first five months of the year the deficit reached L83,000bn, 24 per cent higher than the same period in 1991. Even with the emergency package this means the deficit for 1992 is unlikely to be less than L150,000bn against the original estimate of L128,000bn, equivalent to 10.3 per cent of GDP. Mr Amato's government - backed by the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals - only has a 16-seat majority in the chamber of deputies. But the prime minister still hopes to broaden his support, encouraged by a softening of the small Republican's party's opposition to the measures. He admitted last week's decision to abandon the creation of two superholdings to facilitate privatisation of the main state entities was a political set-back. However, Mr Amato said the two superholdings risked becoming unworkable. He confirmed reports that Prof Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister who proposed the scheme, had offered to resign. One of the factors weighing against the move was Mr Amato's discovery that the Italian banks, who were expected to underwrite bonds to the tune of L4,000bn this year in the superholdings, would have done so only if specifically pressured by the prime minister. Mr Amato said he believed it would now be easier to privatise directly through the main state entities, which in the past two weeks have become joint stock companies. He expected the first privatisation move would come from the flotation of Agip, the oil exploration subsidiary of ENI, the state oil concern. ing, might sell off one of its banking subsidiaries. The government, he said, was still committed to raising at least L4,000bn through privatisations this year. Mr Amato said the abandonment of the two superholdings did not mean a change in his government's broader aim of slimming down the state sector. Control of the four main state entities which had become joint stock companies - IRI, ENI, Enel, the electricity authority, and INA, the insurance institute  -was in the hands of the Treasury. There is likely to be a big battle over how IRI obtains new funds, if it is to remain as head of a group controlling a L79,000bn turnover with debts of L60,000bn. IRI is due to have its new statutes approved on August 6 but it only has provisional capital of L1,873bn.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Woolwich Building Socy turns in rise to Pounds 149m WOOLWICH Building Society, the fourth largest with assets of Pounds 23.3bn, yesterday disclosed a 9.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 149.3m, compared with Pounds 136.4m, despite doubling its provisions for possible bad debts in the depressed housing market. Woolwich made new provisions of Pounds 144.7m (Pounds 72.4m), raising its total provisions to Pounds 207m. About 40 per cent of the rise in provisions was estimated to relate to the Town &amp; Country Building Society, with which it merged last May. The society achieved a fall in its cost to income ratio to 50.7 per cent (59.9 per cent). Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he believed this was the biggest single year fall achieved by a large building society. Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive, said about 9 per cent of the society's 541,000 borrowers were in arrears. The number of properties taken into possession fell to 3,364 (3,788). Town &amp; Country added 400 repossessions to its stock. The society declared an exceptional loss of Pounds 17.9m from restructuring costs, and a Pounds 6.5m exceptional profit from tax reclaimed from the Inland Revenue after litigation. The aggregate net losses of the society's subsidiaries were reduced to Pounds 24m (Pounds 30m). It managed to halve the trading loss in its estate agency subsidiary to Pounds 11m after closing 55 branches during the year and making 200 staff redundant.</p>

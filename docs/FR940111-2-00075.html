This Notice is published as required by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as amended. A new written agreement for this long-standing computer matching program recently has been approved by both the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services Data Integrity Boards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose of match:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOL will conduct a computer matching program of DOL and SSA records of Black Lung benefit recipients in order to detect individuals who might improperly receive dual Black Lung benefits from SSA and DOL. When a verified match occurs, the case will be referred to the proper DOL office for development to assure the validity of the match and to make any required benefit adjustments. The SSA data will contain the date of death of SSA beneficiaries. This information will help to minimize those cases in which benefit payments are made to deceased beneficiaries, by identifying a DOL beneficiary who has died, but DOL has not been notified of the death. The SSA data also will assist DOL in properly referring inquiries and correspondence received at DOL regarding SSA-only Black Lung beneficiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Authority for conducting the matching program:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, 30 U.S.C. 901, et seq. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Categories of records and individuals covered:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA, as the source agency, will provide DOL with its Black Lung Payment System, HHS/SSA/OSR 09&hyph;60&hyph;0045, (52 FR 9543, March 25, 1987), which will be matched with DOL's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs' Black Lung Benefit Payment records contained in DOL/ESA&hyph;30 (55 FR 7131, February 28, 1990).

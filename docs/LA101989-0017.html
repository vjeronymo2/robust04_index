			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK COUNCILWOMAN DROPS HUSBAND'S LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, in a move aimed at ending  accusations of conflict of interest, has dropped a lawsuit that her late  husband filed against the city in a property dispute.  </P> <P> "The case is over," Howard said. "I was never interested in pursuing this  lawsuit. There were just some things that had to be worked through before it  was dropped."  </P> <P> Howard's announcement at Tuesday night's council meeting was met with applause  by several people seated in the council chambers.  </P> <P> The lawsuit stemmed from a 1984 dispute that arose when the city's  Redevelopment Agency used its power of eminent domain to take over Jack  Howard's law office building at Angeleno Avenue and 3rd Street. Although Howard  was reimbursed for his property, the agency refused to relocate his law  practice on a downtown redevelopment site because of his wife's position on the  Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> "I personally did not have any interest in this case," Mary Lou Howard told the  council. "It was filed because the agency refused to forward the same rights  and benefits to Jack that other persons receive when they are relocated from a  redevelopment project."  </P> <P> The lawsuit, however, was dismissed in March when Jack Howard committed  suicide. It was refiled a short time later by Mary Lou Howard because, she  said, she needed time to assess all of the legal issues involved before  deciding what action to take. The suit had asked for $1 million in damages.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to make any rash decisions," Howard said. "Jack is gone now, so  it no longer makes any difference."  </P> <P> For the past several months, Howard has come under harsh criticism from other  City Council members and the public because of her pursuit of the legal action.  Last week, the council members directed the city attorney to investigate  whether Howard was in conflict of interest as a result of the litigation.  </P> <P> After her announcement to drop the suit, Councilman Thomas E. Flavin told  Howard that he appreciated her decision. He said he hoped there were no hard  feelings between Howard and the council regarding the matter.  </P> <P> "As council members, we have the responsibility of vigorously defending  taxpayer money from any lawsuit that is filed against us, by anybody," Flavin  told Howard. "I don't think there were any personal differences that motivated  it. It was just that we saw it as our responsibility."  </P></p>

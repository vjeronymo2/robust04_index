			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / AT&amp;T to cut up to 6,000 jobs AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph will cut as many as 6,000 jobs and close 31 offices after it has deployed its voice-recognition technology for long-distance calling in 1994, Reuter reports. The company said the technology will allow it to automate many calls now handled by operators. The cuts will affect 200 to 400 management positions and 3,000 to 6,000 non-management positions in its operator services organisation by the end of 1994. AT&amp;T employs about 18,000 operators. It said it hoped to offer jobs to affected employees, and has identified eight types of job openings likely to occur between 1992 and 1994. Those not placed will receive severance of up to 104 weeks' pay. Calls that will be handled by voice recognition include collect and billed-to-third-party calls. An AT&amp;T spokesman said the company sees 'little or no impact' on its earnings from the reduction plan and had not planned any reserves at present.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (4): Towards greater regulation - In spite of the proposed new legislation, Jersey continues to walk a tightrope / Trusts and Companies It does not take long for the casual visitor to St Helier to identify one of the mainstays of the local economy: numerous brass, silver and gold plaques symbolise the enormous number of offshore trusts and companies controlled from the island. But after the great growth of offshore financial services on Jersey since the 1960s, the government has finally begun turning its attention to clamping down more firmly on their regulation in line with controls covering most other parts of the finance industry. The biggest growth in trusts took place in the past decade, after Jersey became one of the first countries in the world to introduce a trust law in 1984. According to figures from the Jersey Financial Services Commission, nearly half of the top 500 companies in Europe now have companies or trusts on the island, and nearly one third of the top 700 companies in Asia-Pacific. It now estimates that there are about 200 trust and company administrators, managing several thousand individual trusts holding assets of perhaps Pounds 50bn. 'Jersey has been distinguished by the quality of legal advice and of the courts,' says Mr Richard Syvret, director of the Financial Services Commission. 'The trust law has been much copied in other jurisdictions. It has been a real bonanza.' In the past, Jersey has relied on maintaining high quality by scrutinising businesses when they first apply to set up. Under the 1973 regulation of undertakings law, it has always vetted companies, requiring information such as beneficial ownership. However, the mood has been changing in the past few years towards greater regulation. The 1984 trusts law only has one very restricted supervisory requirement: that if a limited liability company is acting as a trustee, its directors should be jointly and severably liable. 'The view has now developed that we need to play a part in supervising trustees from the point of view of protecting the island's good name,' says Mr Syvret. 'We've had one or two small problems.' Jersey has generally escaped relatively unscathed from many of the financial scandals of the past few years, but only last year it became clear that the existing system was far from foolproof when two significant cases came to trial in the local courts. Mr Tony Delaney, a certified accountant, who controlled Deltrust and Sentinel Management, was sentenced to six years' imprisonment after pleading guilty to defrauding clients of more than Pounds 1.1m. Later last year, Mr Nicholas Hanley, a barrister and company and trust adviser, was also sentenced to six years after pleading guilty to defrauding 17 clients of Pounds 4.75m which he used to fund his compulsive gambling addiction. This is believed to be the island's biggest ever fraud. However, work on a new set of regulations began long before these cases came to light. The reason was partly recognition of the growing need for consistent regulation across the financial services sector. 'Trusts and companies were the big black hole for regulation,' says Mr Jeffery Grime, senior partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Mr John Pallot, deputy director of the Financial Services Commission in charge of the financial business division, is currently helping draft the Financial Business (Jersey) Law, which will cover trusts and company administrators, as well as insurance intermediaries and investment businesses. Under current plans, his department will increase to eight staff as they adopt their new supervisory role. Under the proposals, trust companies and other financial businesses will be required to register with the States, be subject to an annual audit, demonstrate they have professional indemnity insurance cover, and show that the directors are 'fit and proper' to run the operations. There will be an annual declaration by the directors on topics such as the segregation of money, the quality of books and records, the state of internal controls, and to ensure that there are at least two executive directors or partners examining the work - the 'four eyes principle'. Following an outcry over client confidentiality if civil servants examined trust records, revised proposals say companies will provide an annual statement verified by a reporting accountant. The delays caused by debate over the trust regulation are likely to delay the law into next year, although some are suggesting the trust elements may be split from the regulations covering the other financial services sectors, to allow these to be enacted more rapidly. In spite of this proposed new legislation, Jersey continues to walk a tightrope in its determination to continue to attract high quality offshore business. If it does not, it will lose out to the increasingly aggressive competition from some of its rivals - not least Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Last year, it introduced the International Business Company, under which businesses can opt for a rate of tax as low as 0.5 per cent, and a two-hour incorporation service. 'Those companies with a sound track record will find no difficulty in getting a licence,' says Mr Syvret. 'We are very very open for quality business.'</p>

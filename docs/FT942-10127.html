			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Skoda's sales drive is no joke - The Czech company's use of the Volkswagen connection to reposition its Favorit brand Why does a Skoda have a heated rear windscreen? So you can keep your hands warm while you're pushing it. The Skoda has all the charm of the typical eastern European product in the British mind - a dubious car of comical design, renowned only for its joke status. The complete repositioning of the brand, which Skoda is currently bravely attempting, must amount to one of the most daunting marketing challenges of recent years. The impetus for Skoda to attempt the seemingly impossible comes as a result of Volkswagen taking control of the Czech company three years ago and, in the UK, the establishment last year of Skoda Automobile UK, a new wholly-owned subsidiary to import the cars. The old Estelle model - the traditional Skoda of the joke - was superseded by the Favorit in 1989, and, over the past three years, Volkswagen has been further improving the specification and quality control of the Favorit range (priced between Pounds 5,600 and Pounds 7,700). Skoda proudly quotes a recent BBC television programme which gave the Favorit a test drive and found it 'completely free of rattles and squeaks'. Skoda has never had more than 1 per cent of the UK car market - now the objective under the new Volkswagen management is to increase that share to 2 per cent by the end of the decade. Robin Woolcock, managing director of Skoda Automobile UK, had no illusions about the magnitude of the job: 'It was clear to me very early on that this was a major marketing task. It wasn't about distribution strategy or retailing capacity - it was about changing the perception of a company that had come to epitomise eastern Europe.' In the UK, the brand is a victim partly of its own success: the jokes exist because Skoda has a considerable presence in the market. Elsewhere in western Europe, the jokes would be meaningless and have therefore not taken root, says Woolcock. A tight marketing budget meant that objectives had to be clearly defined and focused. With no marketing department, Woolcock's first stop was a market research consultancy called Quadrangle, which carried out qualitative studies among three groups: current Skoda owners; 'susceptibles' who might be persuaded to buy a Skoda; and 'rejecters' who would be unlikely to purchase. Simon Lidington, a Quadrangle partner, discovered there was nothing odd about Skoda owners. 'They were just normal people who were characterised by being honest, straightforward and disliking hype. They had a very clear-sighted view of the kind of purchases they wanted to make, wanting to pay no more than they needed.' Skoda owners loved their Skodas and had even come to love the jokes, says Lidington. The only problem was that there weren't enough owners, which is why the next group, the 'susceptibles', became so important. Susceptibles were 'attitudinally similar to Skoda owners', found Lidington. 'They had been put off by the jokes and by their lack of awareness of the Favorit. If conditions were right, and they felt other people weren't going to laugh at them, they'd jump at the chance of owning a Skoda.' Working alongside Lidington was the advertising agency GGK, whose job it became to develop a strategy for awakening the interest of the susceptibles. Steve Green, a GGK director, discovered it was not enough merely to point out the merits of the Favorit to potential purchasers. 'There was such a huge dissonance between what people - even susceptibles - have in their head about what Skoda is and means, and what we were presenting to them,' he says. The most important lever has turned out to be the fact that Volkswagen - with its strong reputation for quality - now controls the company, says Green. 'The Volkswagen connection lit lights, hit the spot. People immediately latched on to it. It allowed susceptibles a route into the brand,' he says. Press, poster and television advertising - currently showing - has all led on the VW link. After an outlay of Pounds 6m on press and poster advertisements last year, and Pounds 4.5m for the current TV campaign, Woolcock believes the benefits are beginning to materialise: after the first week of TV adverts, dealers are reporting a 50 per cent rise in sales, he says. The final ingredient in the campaign has been public relations. PR company Shandwick has the task of monitoring press coverage and listening out for the jokes. Journalists, comedians, disc jockeys and other careless Skoda joke artists are likely in future to find themselves threatened with a test drive. Says Shandwick: 'We don't intend to overreact but if anyone does make an ill-informed comment about Skoda, we will be offering them an opportunity to reconsider their views. We're also trying to educate the public that we're not a soft touch any more - we're not going to lie back and take comments that affect the brand value.'</p>

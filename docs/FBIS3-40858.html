			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Following widespread reports on the arrest of 'Abbas  'Abdi, a member of SALAM's editorial council and recent remarks  by Yazdi, chief of the judicial power concerning the immediate  investigation of this matter, Hojjat ol-Eslam Ra'isi, Islamic  revolutionary prosecutor, gave a press conference in Tehran on 5  Aban [27 October] in which he made some very interesting points  on this matter. In this interview he made ridiculous claims  about the Islamic Republic's defense of freedom of the press.  For example, he said: We believe in freedom of the press,  freedom of the pen, freedom of speech, and the freedoms that are  in the law. We believe that the sacred sanctuary of the press  must be preserved, and those who disrupt this sacred sanctuary  will be dealt with. This dealing is not by any means with the  press, but is for the purpose of strengthening freedom of the  pen.    He then discussed 'Abdi's arrest, the relationship between  this arrest and freedom of the press, and the question of what  this person's crime really was. Among other things, he said: "It  is not clear how correct this is in the eye of public opinion.  His crimes will certainly be discussed when it is appropriate,  and when necessary he will go to trial..."    Mr. Ra'isi was asked repeatedly by various correspondents  about what his crime really is, whether the accusations are only  for the press or otherwise and why they have kept him in  solitary confinement for 66 days without allowing visitors. He  was not willing to give a proper answer. He only emphasized:  "Because his crime was not announced, it is not known to you,  but his crime is known clearly to the revolutionary prosecutor.  However, concerning the manner of dealing with it, including  visitors, detention and interrogation, you certainly must know  that the legal regulations will be observed for him the same as  they are for other defendants."    In other words, based on the laws the security organizations  of the Islamic Republic act upon, the defendant is savagely  tortured to the point of death. He "confesses" to crimes not  committed and then goes to "court." In view of the fact that in  violation of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic the  defendant is imprisoned for a long period without access to a  defense lawyer, talk of "defense of freedoms," and by one of the  regime's agents at that, can be nothing more than a horrifying  joke.    In any case, what can be said right now is that Engineer  'Abdi's friends are conducting behind the scenes negotiations to  free him, and with the results of these negotiations it will be  clear whether he will be freed or whether he will "confess" to  crimes he did not commit, like tens of other victims.</p>

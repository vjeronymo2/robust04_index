			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> GENE LOSS, LEUKEMIA LINKED  </P> <P> Loss of genes that make interferon, a natural disease-fighting substance, has  been linked with development of a form of leukemia, researchers said. The  researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as regulators that stop  the body's cells from becoming cancerous.  </P> <P> Researchers from the University of Chicago found an association between loss of  the genes and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a blood cancer that  is the most common form of childhood leukemia.  </P> <P> They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found that 29% of them  lacked the interferon genes. Their work, directed by Dr. Manuel O. Diaz, was  published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It adds to the growing list  of cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of particular  genes.  </P> <P> Interferon plays a variety of roles in regulating the body's immune defenses  and controlling cell growth.  </P></p>

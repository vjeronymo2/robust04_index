			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The U.N. secretary  General's special representative on Cyprus Joe Clark has tried  to change the U.N. document of March 21 concerning the  implementation of the confidence-building measures (CBM), a  senior government official said here today.    Government Spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said in his daily  briefing that the Greek Cypriot side had accepted the March 21  paper regarding the U.N.-proposed measures.    The document provides only for the unmanning of the area  south of the fenced part of the Turkish-held town of Varosha  (Famagusta) to allow access from the government-controlled area  to this part of the coastal town.    According to the document, the Turkish troops should  withdraw  from this particular area although the area would remain under  Turkish control. The road linking the government-controlled  area with the fenced part of Famagusta would be under U.N.  control.    According to the spokesman, in a speech Saturday [16 April]  in Washington, the U.N. envoy said this area could be used for  civilian purposes, something which is not provided for by the  March 21 document.    Clark was quoted as saying that because of the lack of  confidence between the two communities on the island, "We have  proposed that access to Varosha be under United Nations  protection.    "This would imply that the Turkish Cypriot side would not  station military or police personnel on the access route to  Varosha or in the immediately adjacent area, even though it  would retain formal control of the area and obviously could go  on using it for civilian purposes," the U.N. envoy reportedly  said.    Clark added, "in fact, the access route stays Turkish. There  is no surrender of land. The United Nations would have an  obligation to protect passage, and, in effect, to guarantee the  safety of those using the road, but there is no transfer of  land."    The CBM, put forward by the U.N. chief last May, provides  for  the transfer of the Turkish-held fenced area of Varosha to the  U.N. administration to allow some 16,000 Greek Cypriot refugees  to reclaim their properties, and the reopening of the now  defunct Nicosia International Airport, again under U.N. control.    The island's two communities, the Greek and Turkish  Cypriots,  have been engaged in proximity talks aimed at implementing the  CBM since February 17.    On March 21, the U.N. representatives presented to the two  sides a document regarding the implementation of the peace plan,  which was accepted by the Greek Cypriot side, but rejected by  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, thus leading to the  failure of the U.N. efforts to reach an agreement by the end of  March, the deadline set by the U.N. Security Council.    In order to save the U.N. peace package, the U.N. chief  decided earlier this month to extend the deadline to allow the  parties concerned to conclude an agreement before the end of  April.    Joe Clark and his deputy representative Gustave Feissel are  currently visiting Ankara in an effort to persuade the Turkish  side to accept the U.N. document of March 21.    The Greek Cypriot has repeatedly declared it would not  accept  a revised version of the document.    Clark and Feissel are expected in Cyprus Wednesday to  discuss  the CBM with President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot  leader Denktash.    The Cyprus problem started in 1974 when Turkey sent troops  to  seize one third of its territory following a Greek Cypriot coup  seeking union with Greece.    Repeated U.N.-sponsored peace talks, aimed at reuniting the  island under a bizonal and bicommunal federal system, have so  far failed to yield any results.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo 17 May TASS -- "Work is now nearing completion  on the foundation for the rapid development of economic  relations between Uzbekistan and Japan," Uzbek President Islam  Karimov told ITAR-TASS. Karimov arrived for a four-day visit to  Japan on Monday. According to the president, the key purpose of  this visit is to promote economic cooperation between the two  countries.    "Japanese businessmen are very cautious in their approach to  the tapping of the Uzbek market, which is new for them," Karimov  said. "They have been carefully studying Uzbekistan for the past  one and a half years, focusing their main attention to the  assessment of the political stability in the Republic, which is  an inalienable precondition for the development of economic  cooperation. Now this work is nearing completion." Today,  Japan is adopting important decisions on economic cooperation  with Uzbekistan at government level. Some major Japanese  private companies are getting down to business on the Uzbek  market, the president added.    At the same time, Karimov complained against the shortage of  information on Uzbekistan in foreign countries, including Japan.  He noted that the new Uzbek laws and government decisions,  aimed at creating optimal conditions for the operation of  foreign companies, were still unknown in Japan. In connection  with the claims of the Japanese press that foreign companies  were heavily taxed in Uzbekistan, Karimov said that there was an  Uzbek law exempting joint ventures, in which there are more than  10 per cent of foreign capital, from state taxation for a period  of five years. All customs duties on imported goods are fully  annulled in the republic until 1 July 1995. "We have created  all the necessary conditions for foreign investors," the Uzbek  president said.    Touching on his visit to Japan, Karimov noted that  Uzbekistan  was planning to study most seriously Japan's experience in  restoring its economy after the war and to use it in the  Republic.</p>

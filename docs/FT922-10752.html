			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Personal View: No freedom in the skies By January 1993 European air transport will be largely liberalised if not deregulated. Airlines will be free to fly anywhere within the Community at whatever fares they wish to charge. The protagonists of liberalisation argued that a more competitive environment would push down fares, in turn forcing airlines to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Without state aid, banned under the Community's rules, only the efficient would survive. New airlines would come in to challenge those established national carriers operating cosy duopolies on the main routes. Consumers would benefit from a wide choice of products and from lower fares. That is the expectation. What is the reality? Experience of deregulation in the US showed that airlines had to be big to survive in a more competitive marketplace. Size does not generate cost economies but does offer powerful marketing advantages. Some European airlines were quick to grasp this. They set out to enlarge their scale of operations by buying domestic competitors or by purchasing shares in foreign airlines to gain greater marketing spread. Examples include Air France, which in 1990 took a majority holding in UTA, France's large independent carrier, which also gave it control of the leading domestic operator, Air Inter. At the same time several airlines established strong marketing alliances: Air France with Lufthansa, and Iberia with Alitalia. During this first stage of airline concentration most of the independent scheduled carriers in Europe have been swallowed up or have lost their independence. With the exception of Virgin, no independent airlines of any importance survive. The next stage will see a number of the smaller national carriers disappear or become subsidiaries. Sabena was the first in April, when it signed a partnership agreement allowing Air France to acquire 37.5 per cent of its shares. In time some of the larger European airlines will begin to merge, as KLM and British Airways almost did earlier this year. By 1995 the four or five largest airlines will control 75-80 per cent of the Community's scheduled air traffic. Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa will be among them. As had been expected, liberalisation encouraged Europe's charter airlines to launch competitive scheduled services. But by 1990 most of them began to realise that the costs of mounting scheduled services were higher than anticipated. They rapidly reduced their scheduled operations. Air Europe, which by 1990 was operating 15 scheduled routes, collapsed in February 1991. The impact of liberalisation on fares has been mixed. On most intra-European routes little has changed. They are operated in most cases by two airlines, one from each end of the route, charging similar fares. Only on a few routes have fares gone down appreciably, usually when smaller independent airlines have entered previously controlled markets. Between London and Dublin the entry of Ryanair in 1985 pushed average fares down by about a third. In fact, yields have been so low that British Airways pulled out of this route early in 1991. But such markets have been the exception: too frequently new entrants charge fares similar to the established carriers. Dan Air, which launched a London-Athens service this year, is doing just that. In a deregulated market, downward pressure on fares is more likely to come from new entrants. But it will not be easy for new airlines to enter the busiest markets. A growing number of European airports are desperately short of runway capacity, especially at peak periods. To launch its Heathrow-Brussels services this year British Midland had to abandon its flights to Liverpool in order to free convenient slots. Within the single European market, competition should take place on a level playing field. This means no direct or indirect state subsidies to airlines. But recent decisions by the Commission in approving government aid to Sabena and Air France has made the playing field very bumpy. A large capital injection of FFr2bn (Pounds 203m) by the French government in Air France was approved by the Commission on the grounds that it was a commercially justifiable decision which would equally have been made by a private investor. A huge cash injection in Iberia by the state-owned holding company, INI, is likely to be condoned on the same grounds. The aim of liberalisation has been to increase competition in order to produce lower fares and greater choice for passengers. But the European Commission seems powerless to prevent the emergence of a small number of European mega-carriers, which will dominate European markets. They are likely to ensure, through tacit collusion on fares and control of runway slots, that consumers do not enjoy the full benefits of competition.

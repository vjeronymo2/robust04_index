			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Caricom seeks to join Nafta The 13 member countries of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) are to apply to join the North American Free Trade Agreement rather than risk losing exports and being put at a trading disadvantage. Caribbean and Central American states have been seeking 'parity' with Mexico in exporting to the US and Canada as one way of protecting their markets. However, Caricom leaders decided at their annual meeting in Barbados this week that they are being asked to concede too much in exchange for parity, and stand to gain more through actual membership of Nafta. This change of policy follows publication of a report by the World Bank suggesting that Caribbean basin countries will lose millions dollars in exports because of the Nafta accord. The World Bank report says Nafta 'may pose large export losses for individual Caribbean countries'. Caricom leaders described an interim trade agreement being proposed by President Bill Clinton's administration as inadequate, and said that the Community had to prepare itself for full accession. Fearing the loss of markets in the US and Canada to a more competitive Mexico, Caribbean and Central American countries had asked for parity with Mexico for a range of products exported to the US. These included clothes and textiles, leather goods, petroleum products and tuna. Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, said recently that the administration was seeking congressional approval for the removal of quotas and duties on Caribbean Basin clothing exports to the US. 'We asked for the Caribbean basin countries to be given Nafta parity, and we got a limited offer for garments and textiles,' said Mr Percival Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. Caricom had decided that too much was being asked of the region and too little was being granted, he said.</p>

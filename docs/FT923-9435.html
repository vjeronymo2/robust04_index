			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / UK banks face Pounds 490m suit: Liquidators allege payments to Wallace Smith Trust misdirected THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland is being sued for up to Pounds 418m and National Westminster for more than Pounds 71m by the liquidators of a small banking group which was closed down last year by the Bank of England after involvement in alleged fraud. Neither bank has made provisions against any losses which may result from the legal action. The Pounds 418m claim against Royal Bank of Scotland is roughly equivalent to its full-year profits before provisions. Its shares fell 21p yesterday to 153p, while those of NatWest dropped 4p to 320p. The damage claims stem from allegations that substantial payments that should have been deposited with the Wallace Smith Trust Company were made by the banks to another company, Wallace Smith Holdings. Wallace Smith Trust Company's liquidator, Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick, claims the payments were non-transferable and should not have been rerouted. The banks say the rerouting was properly authorised. Mr Hayward has issued a writ against Royal Bank of Scotland. NatWest has not yet received a writ though it expects to receive one. Wallace Smith Trust was a banking and finance group closed down by the Bank of England in May last year. Wallace Smith Holdings was a general financial services company. Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, a director of Wallace Smith Trust, has been charged with fraud exceeding Dollars 50m. Mr Smith, 58, has a wealthy, though private lifestyle, with an address in Chelsea and property in the Bahamas. Born in western Canada, he is described as a family man. He is well known among the Bruges Group of anti-European federalists and is known to have paid the rent on the Bruges Group's one-room office in Jermyn Street for nearly two years. Mr Smith was arrested in April last year and charged with fraudulent trading. His case was transferred from City of London magistrates court 12 months later, by which time he faced 15 charges. His trial has been fixed for February 1 at Knightsbridge Crown Court. Two charges of fraudulent trading allege that between January 1980 and April 1991 he was knowingly a party to carrying on the business of Wallace Smith Trust with intent to defraud its creditors. Royal Bank of Scotland said its writ claimed 'damages in conversion' for 39 payments made between August 1989 and January 1991. Eleven payments originated from Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank and 28 from Bank of New York. The bank said yesterday: 'We deny liability and are going to vigorously contend these allegations.' National Westminster said in a note to its interim accounts, released yesterday, that it had been advised of a claim 'arising out of the conduct of (a former) customer's account'.

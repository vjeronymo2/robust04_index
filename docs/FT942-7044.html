			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Premiers offer Sinn Fein more time on peace The British and Irish governments said last night they were prepared to give republican leaders more time to decide whether to embrace the Northern Ireland peace process, provided they end sectarian violence immediately. But Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds insisted after a 90-minute meeting at Downing Street that they would press ahead with efforts to forge a durable political settlement in the province in advance of the next full Anglo-Irish summit in July. The two prime ministers said good progress had been made on a framework document 'grounded in' last December's Downing Street Declaration designed to instil new momentum into political talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. But they would give no guarantee that the framework document would be completed in time for the planned summit. Yesterday's wide-ranging but informal talks came after Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, pledged to give a 'definitive' response on the question of what part the UK-Irish declaration would play in the overall peace process. Mr Adams also signalled that republicans were now satisfied with the clarification London had given of the joint statement's meaning. He said: 'We are committed to building the peace process regardless of how significant a part that declaration plays. We may have some other questions. But I doubt it.' In remarks interpreted by some as an attempt to win support for Sinn Fein candidates in next months European elections, Mr Adams said he was 'quite convinced' that a settlement was going to come out of the peace process. He said Sinn Fein would meet after polling day on June 9 to 'work out a timetable and discuss it with our leaderships'. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist party security spokesman, said Mr Adams was preparing to announce a 'cynical and very temporary ceasefire' to maximise the Sinn Fein vote in the European elections. Emerging from a 'very useful' meeting at which matters of mutual interest were discussed, Mr Reynolds counselled patience, saying if the 'internal debate' among the republican movement took 'another few weeks, so be it' - as long as the violence ended at once. In carefully balanced remarks, he emphasised that neither republican or loyalist paramilitaries would gain anything by continuing their armed campaigns. He added: 'We are waiting for a decision by both organisations to desist from violence.' Mr Major praised the 'dramatic' improvement in cross-border security co-operation. He said few people would have imagined how much progress had been made in addressing the province's problems over the past 12 months.</p>

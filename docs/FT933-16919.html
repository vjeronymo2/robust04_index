			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Observer: Hanson melody Don't call us, we'll call you. Hanson's latest communications gimmick was the transatlantic conference call organised yesterday to broadcast news of its Dollars 3.2bn purchase of Quantum Chemical. While waiting for the 15-minute 'informational presentation' to begin, the 150 listeners in the US and the 92 in the UK were entertained with a jazzed-up rendition of Somewhere over the Rainbow. Whether the encore will be Pennies from Heaven or pie in the sky, must remain to be seen.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As BIA, we are assigning the highest margin among the margins alleged in the petition, in accordance with the two-tiered BIA methodology under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon a respondent who refuses to cooperate or otherwise significantly impedes the proceeding, and as outlined in the Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (56 FR 31692, 31704, July 11, 1991). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Slip Op. 94&hyph;1112 (June 30, 1994); and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allied Signal Aerospace Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see also Krupp Stahl, AG et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Such or Similar Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar merchandise. We made fair value comparisons on this basis. In accordance with the Department's standard methodology, we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the third country market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to the antidumping questionnaire, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We altered the order of the SSB grades specified within the grade criterion of Appendix V to account for certain other SSB grades which respondent sold in the third country market during the POI, but which were not taken into account in Appendix V.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also reversed the order of the size and shape criteria in Appendix V. In our original questionnaire issued on February 28, 1994, the fifth and sixth matching criteria were shape and size, respectively. However, based on the advice of our in-house technical expert, we reversed the order of these two criteria. Subsequently, Acciaierie Valbruna (Valbruna), a respondent in the concurrent antidumping investigation of SSB from Italy requested that the Department reconsider the reversal of these criteria in Appendix V. Specifically, Valbruna argued that the distinguishing factor of SSBs as compared to all other stainless steel products is that they can be supplied in a variety of shapes and that the COP and price of SSBs are influenced significantly more by shape than size. In light of the arguments raised by Valbruna, we reversed the hierarchy of these criteria to reflect the order in our original Appendix V. Although the issue was not raised by any interested party in the instant investigation, we reversed the order of these criteria to ensure consistent treatment of respondents in performing product comparisons across all concurrent SSB investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, we are using BIA with regard to Mukand and thus did not make fair value comparisons with regard to this company. For the remaining company, Grand Foundry, we made fair value comparisons as discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine whether sales of SSB from Grand Foundry to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 C.F.R. 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We based USP on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States before importation and because exporter's sales price methodology was not otherwise indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated PP based on packed CNF prices to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign brokerage (including containerization, foreign inland freight and port charges) and ocean freight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SSB in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of SSB to the volume of third country sales of SSB in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that Grand Foundry had a viable home market with respect to sales of SSB during the POI. However, based on Grand Foundry's claim that its home market sales made during the POI consisted only of SSB scrap and rejects and that its U.S. sales during the same period consisted only of first (or export) quality SSB, we determined that third country sales would be a more appropriate basis for FMV. (See April 5, 1994 Decision Memorandum To Richard W. Moreland From The Team Re: Appropriate Basis for FMV.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to select the appropriate third country in this case, we examined three factors in accordance with 19 C.F.R. 353.49(b): (1) The degree of similarity in terms of physical characteristics between the products sold in the United States and the individual third country markets; (2) the volume of sales in each third country market relative to that in the United States; and (3) the similarity of the market organization and development between the U.S. market and third country market. Based on these factors, we selected sales to Germany as the appropriate basis on which to calculate FMV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USDA recognizes that significant efforts must be undertaken to ensure that participation is maintained as meals are improved. If a meal does not taste good or look good then children will not eat it. The proposed regulation recognizes that food changes alone will not bring schools meals in line with the dietary guidelines. The results of SNDA and the two demonstrations suggest that reductions in calories from fat must be accompanied by nutrition education and promotional activities to maintain student participation. Gradual implementation of the Dietary Guidelines in school meals will allow for incremental changes in food offerings, minimizing the impact on current participation in the school meal programs. School food service is a nonprofit business that must meet student preferences to stay viable. This requires maintenance of participation by meeting food preferences, and accomplishing nutritional improvements through changes to recipes, food preparation techniques and purchasing specifications that are consistent with these preferences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> e. Implementation Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Initial implementation costs faced by schools will vary depending on existing capabilities and resources within districts and will take many forms. Local, State and Federal resources are available for implementation. USDA has already initiated a number of improvements: Updated and improved recipes for schools, a computerized data bank of standard nutritional values of meals served and a demonstration project on NSMP. The demonstration will incur much of the developmental cost of the basic system framework and identify cost effective strategies for implementation. The Department has announced the availability of nutrition education cooperative agreements to develop comprehensive community-based approaches to nutrition education and is working on a national publication directed at grade school children. The Department is assisting school food service professionals in working with chefs, farmers and others to make school meals appealing and healthful. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The President's FY 1995 budget contains a request of over $20 million to support extensive training for school meal providers on how to plan and prepare nutritious and appealing meals as well as launching a national media campaign directed at building children's skills at making wise food choices for life. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States receive over $90 million annually from the Federal level in State Administrative Expense (SAE) funds for program oversight. A portion of these resources are available to assist in implementation. In addition, the proposed regulation would reduce the level of State resources devoted to local school food authority reviews, which is described in more detail below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the local level, implementing nutrient standard menu planning will require computer capabilities. Many schools currently make extensive use of computers for management activities and have the facilities and capabilities to undertake nutrient standard menu planning. One of the goals of the initiative is to use the technology more effectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A study of school food authorities in the mid-Atlantic region found that 60 percent of SFAs employ computers for some functions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Over one-fourth of these districts had comprehensive systems that allowed them to do menu management and nutritional evaluations. The menu modification demonstrations found that the lack of appropriate computer software limited the feasibility of monitoring the nutritional quality of menus. More recently developed software has greatly enhanced the ability to perform these analyses, which will now be supported by a USDA developed data base. Schools with microcomputers should be able to use this software. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Schools without sufficient computer capability or necessary access to technical assistance may opt for Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning, which will allow development and analysis of menus by other entities, such as State agencies, consortiums of school districts, consultants or the Federal government, while still applying the essentials of NSMP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per meal reimbursement provided to schools was designed to cover both the food and administrative costs (labor and operations) of providing meals to students and can be used to acquire computer hardware and software. Enhanced computing abilities offer significant improvements in other areas of food service management beyond nutrient standard menu planning. The potential for additional improvements in food service operations beyond menu planning, for example, inventory control, should help offset the cost of acquiring this capability for NSMP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

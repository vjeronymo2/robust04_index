			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government, ANC [African National Congress], and  Freedom Alliance have held secret talks. Chief government  negotiator Roelf Meyer says yesterday's talks were exploratory  discussions to see whether there can be any basis for  commonality. He says while no agreement had been reached,  certain positions could now be taken back to the various  parties's principals for approval. The government and ANC have  been trying for months to reach a political settlement with the  alliance which has rejected the interim constitution. The  alliance is demanding a stronger federal system than provided in  the constitution. The government and ANC have set 24 January as  the deadline for the completion of negotiations on the  constitution.</p>

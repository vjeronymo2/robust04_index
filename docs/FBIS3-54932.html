			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Kalistratov, acting coordinator of </F> the newly created faction of independent deputies, by Sergey  Brusin; place and date not given: "Gennadiy Kalistratov: Party  Sword Hangs Over Duma"]    [Text] The State Duma has not even begun its work, but the  lives of the deputies within it is already tense. The parties  which collected the largest number of votes during the elections  are forming factions, conducting publicized and unpublicized  talks, elaborating scenarios, and sharing out power. The  creation of a faction (or a group -- it is being given various  names) of independent deputies elected in the regions in  one-seat districts has come as a surprise event to many people.  Our correspondent Sergey Brusin talked to Gennadiy Kalistratov,  acting coordinator of this new deputies' association, who, as he  stressed, expressed his own personal viewpoint.    [Brusin] Gennadiy Stepanovich, why has the association of  regional independent deputies been formed?    [Kalistratov] The reason is simple; it has moral and civil  roots. The main tasks facing all of society are to give  economic reform a social orientation, to create a federative  state in reality and not just on paper, to develop local  government, to create the political conditions for fruitful work  by the government, to combat crime, and to ensure the political  and economic integration of the CIS countries.... Without them  we will not achieve political stabilization in the country.    However, the way the State Duma has started work may turn  out  to be such that a solution to the aforesaid problems will not be  brought nearer but, conversely, will be delayed. Such a turn of  events is the potential outcome of employing a purely  party-based principle in forming the Duma's working mechanisms.    That is why a special role has been given to the independent  deputies, who have from the outset been outside the influence of  Moscow (as we know, the parties mainly represent Moscow),  outside party struggles, and outside party discipline. The  independent deputies are responsible to the electorate and the  electorate alone. By uniting to coordinate their actions on the  basis of pragmatism and realism, they can stabilize the  parliament's work. They will have to fight against both narrow  party interests and the ambitions of individual deputies.    For instance, the parties will first and foremost try to use  the rostrum and the opportunities presented by the Duma to  prepare for the next elections. Private agreements between  leading party factions are also possible, leading to scenarios  whereby all of the deputies will be forced to vote for packages  of proposals. Then the Duma's leading organs will be formed  practically solely from the parties. Another scenario is also  being elaborated: to offer to post of speaker to a faction  representative from a small party, in order to put an end to  arguments. This is a good intention as long as there is no  hidden maneuver here to have the speaker pursue the line of a  specific leading party later on.    The independent deputies should uphold temporary regulations  which would enable people who are professionally trained to  enter the leadership of the Duma -- people unconnected with  party discipline. The speaker should not be an isolated figure  (let us learn the lessons of the past). The number of his  deputies should most probably not be equal to the number of  leading parties, otherwise an exclusively party-based principle  will prevail in the Duma's work. The formation of the Duma  apparatus should also be seen from this angle.    The party principle in the division of the mechanisms of  power is also a "minefield" because the party coalitions are not  mature but were created in an ad hoc way and will scarcely  withstand the tests of unity to which life itself will soon  subject them. Processes of division and collapse within parties  are inevitable. And the Duma, if formed on the basis of the  party principle, will find itself drawn into them. Then, before  we even have time to deal with Russia's problems, we will drown  in behind the scenes squabbles.    It appears that, in this situation, only a strongly unified  political center, organizing cooperation among all constructive  forces, can preserve the Duma's viability.</p>

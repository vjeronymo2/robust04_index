			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "The Khmer Rouge Group Has Used an </F> Obsolete Pretext To Further the Destructive War Against the  Nation"]    [Text] The long letter of the Khmer Rouge group to His  Majesty on 3 May is clear evidence that the group does not want  to heed the sacred king father's initiative calling for an  on-the-spot cease- fire between the Khmer Royal Armed Forces and  the Khmer Rouge. In the letter, although the Khmer Rouge  strives to show that it wants the cease-fire -- which  constitutes a step toward national reconciliation, peace, and  compromise -- Khieu Samphan spends a large part of the message  detailing a vague description. This has prompted His Majesty to  complain that he does not know what the Khmer Rouge want to have  or do. The king also says that he does not know whether the  Khmer Rouge rejects or supports his proposal. It is clear that  the Khmer Rouge has painstakingly raised the obsolete pretext  that it has been using for years in order to shun the cease-  fire and refuse to enter the roundtable meeting to solve  problems peacefully. It is well known that for over a decade  the Khmer Rouge, using Vietnam as a pretext, has totally  destroyed monasteries, Buddhist monks' quarters, stupas, roads,  bridges, trains, schools, and hospitals. It has massacred  children, elderly persons, women, and our people in rural areas  without mercy. Moreover, the Khmer Rouge has also alleged that  the Paris Accord of 23 October 1991 mapped out with the  international community's support is a Vietnamese scheme. It  contemptuously trampled upon the accord. It not only refused to  cease firing, demobilize its troops, and lay down its arms, but  it also fired at UNTAC and called the latter YUONTAC [derogatory  word for UNTAC]. The Khmer Rouge also calls the royal  government, which has come into being as a result of the  people's wish through the elections organized and supervised by  the United Nations, a Vietnamese puppet government.    In its latest letter, the Khmer Rouge has sternly charged  that the subsistence of the two-headed government is maintained  only by the communist Vietnamese's muscle and force. This  constitutes a show of utter contempt for the people's wish and  displays scorn for the king, who approved the government lineup  last year. Most seriously, the Khmer Rouge has charged that the  three conditions raised by the royal government in keeping with  the king's 21 November 1993 three-point proposal are part of a  Vietnamese scheme. It seems that the Khmer Rouge tends to  insolently regard the king's proposal as a Vietnamese scheme as  well. This is really an intolerable action. Moreover, the  on-the-spot cease-fire is based on the clear-sighted initiative  of the king; so why did the Khmer Rouge wildly accuse it of  being a poisonous trick of the royal government.    In sum, it can be seen that the Khmer Rouge, drunk with its  sense of identity with the people, has regarded those outside  its group as Vietnamese, whom it intends to destroy completely.  The Khmer Rouge has used the Vietnamese issue as a pretext to  continue the destructive war against the nation. Vietnam is a  label used by the Khmer Rouge as a pretext to massacre the  people. At a meeting with Buddhist monks, senior citizens,  nuns, and his children in front of the Chan Chhaya pavilion on 4  May, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman said Vietnam should  not further be used as a pretext to continue the war and that  one should understand that the present war is a war between  Cambodians. His Majesty added that those using any pretext  whatever to prolong war are all national traitors, who are  endangering the nation and bringing about a loss of Cambodia's  independence, territorial integrity, and race. This being so,  the Khmer Rouge, which always boasts about its patriotism,  should feel humiliated and stop using the obsolete and base  pretext to continue its political and military ambition. It  should turn to talking about the reality with veracity and  equity.</p>

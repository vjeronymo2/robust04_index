			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The GOLD reached a two-month high as fresh US investor fund buying piled into the New York futures markets. In London it closed at Dollars 372 a troy ounce, up Dollars 5 on the day. 'It is quite a strong move. The (investment) funds are buying it fairly heavily,' one dealer said, adding there was no physical demand. 'Dealers were buying to test the price at over Dollars 370,' he said. SILVER was also strong, ending 13 cents up at Dollars 4.51 1/2 an ounce, but Platinum lagged with a Dollars 1.85 rise to Dollars 375.10 an ounce. At the London Metal Exchange the three months TIN price rose to a fresh 10-week high of Dollars 4,970 a tonne but found expected stiff resistance near Dollars 5,000 and ended after hours trading at Dollars 4,950 a tonne, up Dollars 70 on balance. COPPER ended its decline with three months metal gaining Dollars 12.75 to Dollars 1,645.25 a tonne in what dealers described as a 'technical consolidation'. ZINC was unable to extend initial upward momentum, with the rise attracting hedge selling, although an undercurrent of support remained, based on continued talk of production cuts. The three months price closed at Dollars 952.50 a tonne, up Dollars 11. Compiled from Reuters</p>

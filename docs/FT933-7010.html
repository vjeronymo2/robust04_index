			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen gains further ground THE YEN continued to gain ground against the dollar in Monday's Asian and European trading, in spite of the US Federal Reserve's intervention in support of its currency last week, writes James Blitz. Last Friday, the yen was already clawing back some of the lost ground against the dollar, closing in London at Y104.85. When Tokyo opened on Monday, the Japanese currency moved even higher, in spite of comments from officials that an economic expansion plan would be launched in September and that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, would visit the US in late September. Dealers said the upward pressure on the yen continued to come from exporters, who sold dollars at comparatively high levels in the belief that they might get less yen for them if they waited. However, once the dollar reached the Y103.30 level, the Bank of Japan intervened to support the currency, and fears that the US would echo the move stopped the weakening in the dollar/yen rate. There was no intervention when US markets opened, and the rate closed at Y103.25. It is still uncertain whether the dollar will breach the Y100 level, as so many dealers anticipated at the start of last week. In New York it finished at Y103.10. In Europe, the main focus was on cuts in French and Danish interest rates, in the latter case the first since the exchange rate mechanism's bands were widened. The 50 basis-point cut in the French overnight rate, to 7.75 per cent, did not lead to a heavy depreciation of the franc, which ended at FFr3.485 per D-Mark from FFr3.478. The Danish cut had little effect on the krone, which closed at DKr4.1043 to the D-Mark. In both cases, the currencies held steady because of a strong belief in the market that the Bundesbank will lower its discount rate at its first meeting after the summer recess on Thursday. The market is far less certain that there will be a cut in the German central bank's repo rate, however. Today's inflation figure for the state of Baden-Wurttemberg will be an early indication of how much room for manoeuvre the central bank has. Miss Wendy Niffikeer, international economist at IBJ International, believes a discount rate cut has been well priced in by the market. If the Bundesbank eases its rate floor by  1/2 percentage point on Thursday, it is unlikely to lead to a fall in the D-Mark's value. The weaker currencies in Europe were less well underpinned yesterday because of speculation that their countries might try to reduce interest rates in advance of the Bundesbank meeting. The peseta declined yesterday morning, bottoming out at Pta81.05 to the D-Mark from a previous Pta80.97, but it closed at Pta80.92. The Portuguese escudo receded yesterday to Es101.95 to the D-Mark from a previous Es101.40. Sterling was largely unaffected, finishing unchanged at DM2.5375.</p>

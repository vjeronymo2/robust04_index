			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLES, VATICAN RESUME FULL TIES AFTER 44 YEARS  </P> <P> The Vatican and Poland restored full diplomatic relations Monday, paving the  way for the first exchange of ambassadors between the Holy See and a Warsaw  Pact country.  </P> <P> The resumption of formal diplomatic ties after 44 years was announced  simultaneously by the Vatican and the Polish news agency, marking the climax of  lengthy negotiations between a skeptical Polish Pope and a Communist government  locked in a struggle with political reform and anxious to enhance its  credibility at home and abroad.  </P> <P> In Poland, where 95% of the 38 million people are Roman Catholics, the news was  welcomed by church officials. They had been skeptical when the negotiations  were first undertaken, fearing that the Communist authorities would attempt to  undermine the local church hierarchy by dealing directly with the Vatican  envoy.  </P> <P> The skepticism seemed prudent in a country where Communist leaders, in the  Stalinist period, had done their best to suppress the church.  </P> <P> After severing diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1945, the Communists placed  the Polish primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, under house arrest. Church  property was confiscated and ordinary priests were arrested and harassed by the  police.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Benefits for the Whole Society'  </P> <P> In a statement Monday, the Polish bishops said they greeted the renewal of  relations with the Vatican with "the deep conviction that a proper development  of relations will influence the realization of citizens' rights in Poland and  open a new field of church activities with benefits for the whole society."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Stefan Staniszewski, called it "a very  important fact that crowns a long process of normalization of relations between  the state and the church."  </P> <P> Some Polish government officials had expected that diplomatic relations would  be restored two years ago, when Pope John Paul II made his third papal trip to  Poland.  </P> <P> But the Pope could not be rushed, despite a strenuous campaign by the Polish  authorities and the opening of a cautious dialogue with Communist officials in  order to win concessions for the church.  </P> <P> The Pope, who received Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity independent trade  union, in Rome on April 20, follows Polish political events closely. In June,  the first relatively free elections in the postwar era resulted in a new  National Assembly in which Solidarity-backed candidates won 46% of the seats.  Two months ago, the Parliament granted legal recognition to the church.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 15-Year Working Relationship  </P> <P> A working relationship between the Polish government and the Vatican goes back  15 years, to a time when authorities hoped to win public support by easing its  tough stand on the church.  </P> <P> The contacts intensified about four years ago for the same reasons as the  Communist leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, pressed his campaign for "national  unity" after the martial-law crackdown that suppressed Solidarity.  </P> <P> The role of the church, always close to Solidarity, was central in laying the  groundwork for the "round table" talks between the government and Solidarity  that resulted in the union's legal reinstatement and the June elections.  </P> <P> Prominent church laymen were also key intermediaries between the government and  Solidarity in two rounds of strikes in 1988, a role that helped establish the  church as a referee between the two sides.  </P> <P> The Vatican's relations with Hungary and the Soviet Union also have improved in  the liberalized mood inspired by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> There was no immediate announcement on a papal nuncio, or ambassador, to  Poland, but there has been speculation that it could be Archbishop Gabriel  Montalvo, a Colombian who is the papal nuncio to Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> Nonaligned Yugoslavia is the only Communist country in Eastern Europe with  diplomatic ties to the Vatican. The Vatican also has full relations with  Communist Cuba.  </P> <P> The last papal ambassador to Poland left Warsaw on Sept. 5, 1939, at the start  of World War II.  </P></p>

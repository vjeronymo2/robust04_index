			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / An old man's magic: Canute James on a suspect Dominican electoral win Mr Joaqun Balaguer, the seemingly eternal president of the Dominican Republic, has perfected the science, much to the annoyance of his political opponents, of snatching slim electoral victories from almost certain defeat. For the third time in the last three elections in the Caribbean state, Mr Balaguer has retained office controversially, and in conditions which have encouraged losing candidates to claim that he did so by less than fair means. While the country's electoral board is still reviewing the preliminary results of the presidential and congressional election held in May, Mr Balaguer is preparing to be inaugurated in August for his seventh term. But there must be questions about the result. In an electorate of 3.3m, Mr Balaguer's conservative Social Christian Reform party received about 30,000 votes more than the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary party of Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez. The latter, for whom opinion polls had forecast a win, has claimed there were widespread irregularities. Most of the estimated 200,000 prospective electors who were unable to cast their ballots were his party's supporters, Mr Pena Gomez claimed. Foreign observers concurred. The US National Democratic Institute for International Affairs noted 'significant problems and irregularities in the electoral process.' It said that about 200,000 people did not get voting cards on time and concluded: 'A disproportionate number of the disenfranchisement cases, which members of the delegation noted, appeared to affect opposition parties.' Mr Balaguer, aged 87 and blind, dismissed the charges and claimed victory, saying the election had been clean. Officials of his party agreed that all had not gone well with the election but denied that fraud had brought the result into question. They allowed that some inefficiency had occurred but said this would not have altered the result despite the narrow victory of the Social Christian party. Mr Pena Gomez is unlikely to succeed in his plan to have foreign governments press Mr Balaguer into holding new, internationally supervised elections. If, as expected, his victory is confirmed by the board, Mr Balaguer will have to deal immediately with two main issues. One is relations with Haiti, with which the Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola. The recent tightening of international economic sanctions on Haiti, to prise out the military rulers and allow the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from exile, has forced Mr Balaguer into an awkward position. The Dominican leader is far from enthusiastic about the return of Father Aristide, who once described as 'slavery' the conditions of Haitian migrant workers in the Dominican Republic. Mr Balaguer has publicly opposed the tightening of the embargo on Haiti. Amid reports of suggestions that the Dominican Republic could lose US trade preferences, he has moved to curb the smuggling across the border with Haiti which is violating the economic embargo and has been facilitated by the Dominican military. The president's second big problem will be the country's economy. Some main pillars - sugar, gold and nickel - have been hard hit by high production costs and low market prices. The trade deficit is widening but the pressure has been relieved by growing earnings from tourism. The central bank was forced last month to intervene to stabilise the currency, which slipped after two years of relative stability. Mr Balaguer promises nothing new for the economy, which has been growing moderately in the past three years: 'We should not embark on an adventure and should continue our cautious policy.' There must be doubt over how long he will remain in office. Few Dominicans, including Social Christian party functionaries, expect the president to stand for office again in 1998 when he would be 91. So there is much attention on Mr Jacinto Peynado, a 53-year-old businessman, the grandson of a former president and in line to be Mr Balaguer's new vice-president. Mr Peynado's economic philosophy is less conservative than that of Mr Balaguer.</p>

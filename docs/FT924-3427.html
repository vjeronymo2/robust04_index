			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Rail sell-off rules may be eased: Government to make privatisation plans more attractive THE GOVERNMENT yesterday gave the clearest indication yet that it was prepared to bend its rail privatisation plans to make them more attractive to would-be train operators. It said it was ready to drop its insistence on open access and allow operators effective monopolies on some lines, particularly British Rail's Network SouthEast commuter routes. It also suggested that some companies would be granted 'vertically integrated' franchises which would allow them both to operate trains and control tracks and stations. The hints of a shift in the government's approach follow strong criticisms of the privatisation plans from private sector companies which have expressed an interest in operating trains. The Department of Transport wants as many companies as possible to bid for passenger train franchises, so that privatisation will be seen as a success. Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, yesterday emphasised that the government remained fully committed to rail privatisation. Legislation was ready to be introduced as soon as the necessary paving bill had cleared the Commons, he told a conference in London organised by The Economist. However, royal assent would come in October rather than the summer, and it would be a long time before franchising spread to all of British Rail's services. 'It will take a number of years to cover the whole of Great Britain,' he said. Publication of the rail bill is expected to form part of a vigorous campaign by the government to defend its privatisation plans at the beginning of the new year. Other announcements will include the publication of the track-charging regime and the naming of the first half-dozen or so experimental rail franchises. Mr Freeman said he recognised that some private sector operators might be reluctant to bid for franchises unless they were exclusive. But on some routes, it would be impossible for other operators to set up in opposition because there was no spare track capacity. 'The reality is that on Network SouthEast the franchise will effectively be on an exclusive basis,' he said. However, that might not necessarily apply to Regional Railways or InterCity routes. Mr Freeman said the government had not ruled out the idea that some operators might be allowed control of signals, track maintenance and development of stations. This was most likely in the case of self-contained lines such as the London Tilbury &amp; Southend, the Isle of Wight railway and perhaps some rural branch lines. He also appeared to confirm that some branch lines could be at risk of closure because privatisation would expose the size of the subsidies they were receiving. The resulting debate might 'shift the emphasis a little as between one line and another', he said. Mr Freeman said the government had no plans to franchise out the operation of the channel tunnel express trains due to enter service between London, Paris and Brussels in 1994. Speaking after the conference, he rejected suggestions that the introduction of track charging would result in the large-scale transfer of freight from rail to road.</p>

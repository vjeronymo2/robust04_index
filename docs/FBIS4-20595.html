Golikova, A.F. Ioffe </F> Physico-Technical Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia; and Iwami  Higashi, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research]    [Text] Doping mechanism has been an actual problem of  physics and chemistry of boron-rich compounds. This is a  non-standard problem because of their complex lattices. The  results of MgAlB[.sub]14[/] structure and doping study are  summarized in this paper. MgAlB[.sub]14[/] was prepared by  the solution melting method, Fe introduction (2 at%) was  made  in the process of hot pressing in vacuum.    There are two types of voids I and II in the  MgAlB[.sub]14[/] lattice: I is occupied by Mg and surrounded  by 16 B atoms at 2,379-2,925 Angstrom (filling 78%), II is  occupied by Al and surrounded by 12 B atom at 2,0663[sic]-2,824  Angstrom (filling 75%). Thus, the II void has a lower  size and  a lower symmetry.    The Mossbauer spectrum of MgAlB[.sub]14[/] represents a  single line (isomer shift  = 0,12mms[.sup]-1[/] and  doublet ( = 1,8mms[.sup]-1[/], quadropoule splitting _D_ =  1mms[.sup]-1[/]. This means that Fe[.sup]+3[/] localized  in I voids instead of Mg is a donor but Fe[.sup]+2[/]  localized in II voids is an acceptor. The concentration ratio  Fe[.sup]+3[/]/Fe[.sup]+2[/] = 3:1 which, as a result of  compensation, leads to donor action. It is supported by the  thermoelectric power: S = 400 VK[.sup]-1[/] and 10  VK[.sup]- 1[/] (300K) for undoped and doped material,  respectively.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palm oil stocks down LABOUR SHORTAGE problems and better than expected exports have been blamed for a sharp drop in Malaysia's palm oil stocks. The Malaysian Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) said that the country's palm oil stocks at the end of May stood at 456,000 tonnes  -down more than 10 per cent from a month earlier. Industry forecasts were for holding stocks of between 520,000 and 540,000 tonnes at the end of May. Traders were surprised at the steep fall in stocks and said part of the reason was the absence of some labourers from the palm oil plantations. Illegal immigrant workers, mostly Indonesians, have to register with the Malaysian authorities by the end of this month or face being expelled from the country. Traders said another reason for the fall in stocks was increased exports during May, particularly to Pakistan. PORLA estimated that Malaysia exported 467,000 tonnes of palm oil in May, compared with 409,000 tonnes in April. Malaysia produced 6.1m tonnes of palm oil in 1991, just over half of the total world output. Traders believe that supply shortages could push prices up on the local market in the short term.</p>

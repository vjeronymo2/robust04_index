			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> An announcement by the black American pop group the Commodores that they will  perform in South Africa next month drew criticism Tuesday in Johannesburg where  black South African artists vowed to do everything legally possible to stop the  event. The Commodores are scheduled to appear in Bophuthatswana for seven  performances starting July 7, despite a U.N.-led cultural boycott to protest  South Africa's apartheid policies. Members of the all-black U.S. recording  group acknowledged that their decision made them a target of the anti-apartheid  movement and possible blacklisting but pledged to criticize apartheid while in  South Africa. The South African Musicians Alliance, in turn, said the  Commodores are "an embarrassment to our cause" and failed to consult with  "democratic structures inside and outside South Africa" about their  plans.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

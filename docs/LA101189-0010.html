			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DESCANSO  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies were still searching Tuesday for an inmate who fled the  medium-security Descanso County Jail when an alarm system malfunctioned, a  department spokesman said.  </P> <P> Garth Kelly, who was awaiting transfer to the El Cajon jail because he was  caught with a jail-made knife, escaped about 6:30 p.m. Monday, spokesman Lewis  Jones said.  </P> <P> Kelly reportedly squeezed between a fence and the roof of a temporary holding  area, Jones said. Kelly, who had been left unattended, was discovered missing  when deputies made a 7:30 p.m. check.  </P> <P> An alarm system designed to detect motion along the fence failed to sound when  Kelly made his escape, Jones said. According to Jones, the system is checked  twice a day and was in working condition before the escape.  </P> <P> Kelly was serving time for narcotics violations, Jones said.  </P></p>

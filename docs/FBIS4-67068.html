			<p>BFN     [Text] Beside the serious problem created by the poppy  cultivations found in various regions of the Amazonas  Department, thousands of hectares of illegal coca are being  grown in other regions of this department, specifically in the  Utcubamba and Condorcanqui Provinces.    According to spokesmen of the Army 5th Jungle Infantry  Division, which is headquartered in El Milagro, it is estimated  that in those two provinces about 10,000 hectares of coca are  being grown, much of it in full growth while some has already  been harvested.    "The case is worrisome and if no measures are taken,  Condorcanqui and Utcubamba may become the new bastions of  trafficking" said a high military officer. He revealed that one  month ago a group of U.S. Embassy and DEA officials came to El  Milagro base to verify this information.    He added: "They gathered information, offered aid, but so  far  nothing happened."    Coca is being grown in the mountains in zones which, by  contrast with the Huallaga region, cannot be seen from a  helicopter, they can only be reached by walking.    In Condorcanqui Province, the coca fields begin in El Muyo  settlement (about four hours by car from Bagua Chica) and  continue through Tutuberos, Montenegro, Soldado Oliva,  Shunshunga, Nazareno, Yusabarranca, San Rafael, Mesones Muro,  and end in Imazita.    All the settlements are alongside the Transversal de la  Selva  highway that goes alongside the Maranon River.    At the other extreme, in Utcubamba Province, the coca fields  begin in Tiricon and continue through La Union, Tupac Amaru, El  Paraiso, Yusubarranca, El Tambo, and end in Santa Maria de Nieva.    The 5th Jungle Infantry Division, which is headquartered in  El Milagro, is trying to control trafficking in this zone even  though their exclusive task is to watch over the border zone in  the Condor mountain range.    Their sporadic operations are sometimes wasted, as verified  by reporters of our newspaper when, with a military patrol, they  entered the jungle in Mirana Alta.    There, the soldiers discovered that the six coca maceration  pits they destroyed one month ago were operating again. Even  worse, they found coca already processed.    The work of the Interior Ministry and the Police are  practically null. Their personnel only go after people wanted  for interrogation or they investigate trafficking cases when the  Army gets the means and the personnel, and invites them to go  into the jungle.    And when they go, their work is unbelievable. There in the  mountains they are exposed to the sun and the torrential rains  that sometimes fall.    Alamiro Bustamante, provincial assistant prosecutor of  Bagua,  said: "They should hear in Lima how they have to work.  Truthfully, there is little we can do."</p>

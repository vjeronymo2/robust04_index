			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Risk and Reward: Portfolio managers find comfort in precious metals THE US jobless figures released last Friday offered little comfort to the world's gold bugs, who have been enthusiastically buying precious metals for weeks. With manufacturing jobs in decline during April, and only small gains in the overall workforce, the inflation picture remains cloudy. However indeterminate the immediate economic picture, portfolio managers seem willing to bet that the inflation rate will rise sooner or later, as reflected in the steep slope in the US Treasury bond yield curve. That attitude has not been lost on the world's investment bankers, who are busy designing commodity-backed derivatives to serve as a form of inflation-backstop in diversified portfolios. Riding the wave of Mr George Soros' well-publicised shift into gold options, five large banking houses have issued gold warrants in the past four weeks. Merrill Lynch was agile enough to issue silver warrants as well, much to the admiring chagrin of its close competitors. Warrants differ from the usual put and call options in that they are issued for periods of one year or longer. Like an option, they allow the holder to buy or sell the underlying commodity at a given price and time. Warrants do not require the day-to-day margin maintenance needed for exchange-traded futures and options, and, because they resemble securities, are acceptable to some portfolios that cannot trade other forms of derivatives. Whether it was inflation-hedging, copy-cat admiration, or a bullish shift in the supply-demand situation for precious metals, issuers said the gold warrants - mostly calls - sold briskly, and followed the gold market higher most of last week. Less easily marketed will be a series of new warrants to be issued in London today by Goldman Sachs. Each warrant represents one unit of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Total Return index, a barometer of mostly industrial commodity futures. The firm says the index is more representative of the overall inflation situation than precious metals. A glance at the components of the index make clear that the GSCI warrants will lack the appeal of gold. Oil prices, which have the heaviest weighting in the index, have been moving sideways. Farm products, particularly cereals, are flat, and prices for industrial metals, like copper and aluminium, have tumbled since January. Since April 1, the GSCI Total Return index has fallen from 2,506 to 2,464, and a brief chat with a copper, aluminium, or maize producer will reveal that overcapacity and accumulating stocks will keep prices in those industries under pressure for some time. Mr Neil Bresolin, executive director of commodity derivatives for Goldman Sachs, agrees the index price has been sagging, but argues that, regardless of its direction, it provides a strong inflation hedge. 'If the prices of all of these items go up, your business costs are going to go up,' he says. The index, he says, has a strong correlation to the US consumer price index, and a strong negative correlation to US bond prices. A portfolio manager scanning the inflation horizon might do well to question why precious metals are rallying as an industrial commodities index sags. Take out the threat of war, unstable currencies, or outright speculation, it simply may be the supply-demand picture for precious metals is brightening. Silver, for example, has been subject to a supply glut and a steady price slide since the Hunt Brothers' silver bubble burst in 1980. Prices moved below production costs in most of the Americas, forcing many mines to close or reduce output. Silver is often mined as a by-product of copper, and as copper prices drop, those mines are also expected to cut production. At the same time, historically low prices have stimulated world demand. In the past three months, spot silver prices have risen 25 per cent, from Dollars 3.50 per ounce to Dollars 4.35. But the rally is likely to stall when prices hit Dollars 5, the level US producers need to reopen mothballed mines.</p>

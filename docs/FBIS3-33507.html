Based on that interpretation by the officials close to the  minister, the entire mechanism surrounding the imminent visit is  oriented in that direction. But when questions are asked, the  officials only respond with gestures that are supposed to be  eloquent.    Camilion will be in Brasilia on 21 February to start a  series  of meetings with top military officials, and he also will visit  Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The invitation last December came,  strangely, from the Brazilian Foreign Ministry and not from any  of the three military ministries since there is no defense  ministry in Brazil.    Several issues will be discussed.    The two countries' policy began to go in different  directions  at some point. It could have been when Argentina gave up its  missile project or when it became the only Latin American  country that sent troops to the Persian Gulf. Washington is far  away but it is known that its look goes far.    Some ideas about Argentine desires to join NAFTA, which in  Brasilia is an organization considered as a competitor of  Mercosur [Common Market of the South], also could have had an  influence.    For some analysts the main site of friction is not Buenos  Aires or Brasilia but the United Nations. Argentina worked hard  to get a seat on the Security Council that took office on 1  January for the next two years.    Brazil is also a temporary member and ends its term this  year.    If a decision is made in the United Nations to increase the  permanent council members, Argentina will support Germany and  Japan over the desires Brazil may have in this regard.    Brazilian military officers have emphasized the  Argentine-U.S. military exercises held last September in  Misiones Province close to the Brazilian border in their  reports. The exercises are not new. There were other joint  exercises but this time the Brazilians seem to be more sensible.    To prevent future irritation, our country will propose a  reciprocal information mechanism establishing that when either  of the two countries will hold military exercises in border  regions with third countries, notification will be made several  months in advance.    Camilion plans to carry out a work of high diplomacy as in  his best years as foreign minister and ambassador to Brazil.  According to his aides, that background was evaluated by the  Brazilian Foreign Ministry at the time of making the invitation.</p>

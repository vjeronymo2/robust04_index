			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Today, the first session of the Executive  Committee of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] was held after  its number was filled at the last convention of the party on 25  and 26 March.    The implementation of the Constitution of the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- adopted at the recent session of the  Constituent Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina --  was discussed, inter alia, at the session. It was concluded  that Mr. Alija Izetbegovic should be incorporated into the  institution of the presidency of the future federation, and he  would have the first presidential mandate. The SDA Executive  Committee believes that there are very significant reasons --  arising from political and moral interests of the Bosniak Muslim  people -- that demand such a solution. Regional and communal  committees of the SDA in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be informed  about this decision. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / German rate cut may stave off UK increase: Sterling up against D-Mark but still close to ERM floor THE FIRST cut in official German interest rates for nearly five years, staving off the immediate possibility of a damaging rise in UK borrowing costs and heralding the possibility of lower rates for the rest of Europe, received a mixed welcome yesterday. The move led to sharp rises on Wall Street and in European share and bond markets. But politicians and industrialists said more cuts would be needed to help economic recovery in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Yesterday's announcement followed months of intense pressure on Germany to ease borrowing conditions and so boost European growth. The Bundesbank, at a special council meeting in Frankfurt, reduced the Lombard rate by a quarter of a point to 9.5 per cent and the discount rate by half a point to 8.25 per cent. The Lombard rate is a benchmark for other European borrowing rates. The German rate cut was agreed in principle over the weekend as part of an unprecedented financial package finalised by European Community nations. It included a 7 per cent devaluation of the Italian lira in the ERM grid. In Britain, Downing Street put on a brave face in response to the small reduction in German rates. While admitting the German move might be 'a one-off', officials sought to portray it as the start of a trend towards lower interest rates throughout Europe and said there had been 'a significant change of mood'. Officials said the cut in German rates had 'probably brought forward the time when British interest rates will move'. However, there was no indication by monetary officials of any early moves to cut UK base rates, now at 10 per cent, to help economic activity. Downing Street reiterated last week's uncompromising message from Mr John Major, the prime minister, that he would not allow sterling's value in the European exchange rate mechanism to be undermined. The probability of a realignment of the pound's ERM parity was 'zero'. In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares, which opened yesterday morning 99 points higher on anticipation of the Bundesbank announcement, shed some of its early gains on news of the relatively modest nature of the central bank's cuts. It closed up 51.2 on the day, at 2,422.1. The mood of optimism was shared on other European stock markets, with the bourses in Frankfurt, Paris and Milan closing between 3 per cent and 5 per cent higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Average closed up 70.52 at 3,376.22 Investors were prompted to switch funds out of D-Marks and into dollars in a development which reduced the recent strains in the exchange rate mechanism. However, there was some disappointment that rate cuts were not greater. Optimism over the wider effects of the Bundesbank's policy change was also tempered by continuing nervousness on currency markets ahead of Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. A No vote next weekend could halt the moves towards European economic and monetary union and lead to a fresh wave of selling pressures on weak European currencies, including the pound, forcing the British government ment into a damaging rise in interest rates. In Frankfurt, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German central bank, said it had not been possible to cut the Lombard rate by more than a quarter of a point because of the bank's policy of targeting monetary growth. 'With our targets for monetary policy there is no room for more. We saw no room to manoeuvre further.' He said the decision to cut rates 'was not an easy one for us' and that the central bank had been caught in 'a foreign exchange trap'. Last week's intervention by the Bundesbank to support the Italian lira by selling D-Marks had led to flows back into Germany of DM24bn (Pounds 8.6bn), far more than in any previous currency crisis. This explained why it was cutting rates as its contribution to alleviating exchange rate tensions, although German inflation was still too high and money supply targets not being met. Mr Schlesinger denied that the bank had been forced into cutting interest rates. Although the rate reductions could be seen as being in line in with the needs of a weakening economy and as a gesture ahead of efforts in Bonn to bring about more moderate wage and fiscal policies, he stressed it was market pressures that had forced the Bundesbank to act. Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland - countries which traditionally closely follow the level of borrowing rates in Germany - all moved yesterday to cut their interest rates. Bonds also benefited on indications that borrowing costs across Europe may come down in the wake of the Bundesbank move. German, Italian and French government bonds all gained up to 2 points, while UK gilts closed 1 3/4 points higher. On currency markets, the D-Mark lost ground substantially to the dollar, after weeks in which it had gained on the US currency. The dollar, after hitting DM1.5155 prior to the news of the exact size of the Bundesbank's cuts, closed in London at DM1.4855, up nearly 4 pfennigs on Friday's London close. Sterling peaked at DM2.8250 in early trading yesterday, and closed in London at DM2.8125, up more than 2 pfennigs on the Friday close. At this level it is less than 3 pfennigs above its DM2.778 ERM floor against the D-Mark, comfortably above its recent levels but still too near the floor for the UK government to be contemplating early reductions in base rates. In late New York trading the pound was at DM2.80935.

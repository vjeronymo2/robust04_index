			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Need for Showing of Intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations provide that ``false certification'' must relate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the school's intent to deceive and not include a clerical error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The participants at the New York meeting, who also discussed this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue, did not reach a consensus regarding the requirement for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showing of intent by the school.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> c. Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only the attendees at the Atlanta meeting discussed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures that should be utilized in implementing the provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for discharge of loans in cases of false certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations provide that the determination of a false  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification can be made by the Department, the guaranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency, or the courts. They also recommended that if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agency makes the decision, the regulations should allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the school to appeal that decision to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants at that meeting also recommended that a lender be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to notify the guaranty agency within 30 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving a complaint that a loan was falsely certified and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection activity be suspended while the agency investigates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claim. The agency would be required to complete its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation within 6 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Repayment of Bankruptcy Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 102&hyph;325 changed the procedure for payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bankruptcy claims by the Department and requires the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repay the loan if collection of the loan is stayed under Title 11  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Bankruptcy Code. Participants at all of the regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meetings recommended that the Department define ``stay'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the current definition in the Bankruptcy Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in response to the Department's question regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate procedure for handling loans that are not ultimately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharged in bankruptcy, there were differences of opinion. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that if a loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not likely to be discharged by the bankruptcy court, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agency should obtain the loan from the lender and hold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it until the bankruptcy court action is completed and then return  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it to the lender. Attendees at the New York meeting recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that lenders be permitted to file bankruptcy claims for payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly to the Secretary and if the Secretary wanted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agency to service the account, the agency should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted to receive at least a portion of any repayment. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also recommended that the lender be given the option to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repurchase any loan that is not discharged in bankruptcy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that lenders be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to repurchase any loans not discharged on which a claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was paid. Because this amendment has now been superseded by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 2(c)(63) of Public Law 103&hyph;208, which incorporated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions found in current FFEL Program regulations, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments are now moot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Garnishment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The last statutory provision reflected in these proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations is section 488A of the HEA, which establishes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national wage garnishment law. That section was added by Public Law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 102&hyph;164, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not discussed during the regional meetings or the negotiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Negotiated Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After completion of the regional meetings, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared draft proposed regulations to implement the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Public Law 102&hyph;325 relating to the FFEL Program. In accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the requirements of section 492(b) of the HEA, those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations were submitted to a negotiated rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the weeks of January 4&hyph;8 and February 1&hyph;5, 1993, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department met with negotiators selected from among individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nominated by attendees at the regional meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discussion below of the proposed regulations reflects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those areas where the negotiators reached a consensus and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations reflect that agreement. The discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below also indicates where consensus was not reached during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations. However, the negotiators did not choose to discuss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every part of the proposed regulations. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion below of those issues not discussed during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations reflects only the views of the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

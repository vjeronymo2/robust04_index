			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> JAPAN SWITCHES, AGREES TO ABIDE BY WORLD BAN ON IVORY IMPORTS  </P> <P> Japan, the world's largest consumer of ivory, reversed itself and agreed today  to abide by an international ban on ivory imports, a move seen as vital to the  effort to save the African elephant from extinction.  </P> <P> Japan announced its acceptance on the last day of a two-week conference of  CITES, the French acronym for the International Convention on Trade in  Endangered Species.  </P> <P> "Japanese observation of the ban was vital because it could never be effective  without Japan, which accounts for around 40% of world imports of ivory," a  CITES spokesman said.  </P> <P> The announcement followed a decision earlier in the day by the Japanese Cabinet  in Tokyo. Officials said Environment Agency Director General Setsu Shiga urged  Japan to reverse its position as a major importer in order to avoid isolation  in the international community.  </P> <P> Some conservationists estimate that numbers of African elephants have plunged  in the last decade from about 1.3 million to 625,000.  </P></p>

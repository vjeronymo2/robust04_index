			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / FT-SE falls on gloomy statements: UK market unsettled THE UK stock market yesterday turned back from last week's peak levels following discouraging trading statements from companies such as Tate &amp; Lyle, Courtaulds and BPB. The FT-SE 100 Index abandoned the 3,100 territory captured so triumphantly on Friday, falling 14.9 points to 3,085.1. However, equities drew some comfort in late dealings from a rally in the bond market. Dealers noted an absence of buying support in London from the US investment funds which had been driving share prices ahead. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, has advised fund managers to favour equity investment in France and Spain and on other continental bourses. With the Bundesbank council not due to meet this week, hopes for early cuts in interest rates have been put on hold, leaving the London stock market vulnerable to bad news from company boardrooms. A reaction from last week's UK equity peaks was not unexpected and market strategists have not changed predictions for their FT-SE Index year-end targets. These range from 2,900 at SG Warburg to 3,500 at Nomura International. However, some analysts predict a downwards correction in the short term, perhaps to FT-SE 3,030 or lower. Securities firms are taking a cautious stance while awaiting further trading reports from UK companies today. They are also aware of the likelihood of further rights issues.

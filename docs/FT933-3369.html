			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bekaert ahead in first half BEKAERT, the Belgian producer of steel wire and cord, beat worsening economic conditions in the EC to increase net consolidated profits by 15 per cent in the first half of 1993, to BFr951m (Dollars 27.7m) from BFr828m. However, the group predicted that markets in the EC and North America would weaken still further in the second half of the year. It expects to achieve a full-year profit on current operations similar to the 1992 figure of BFr1.66bn. Since 1990, when Bekaert's profits collapsed and cash flow halved, the group has undergone drastic restructuring. In the first half, cost savings and efficiency improvements helped the group enhance profits in spite of price reductions. Turnover fell from BFr28.7bn to BFr27.8bn but the group said it had 'substantially increased its competitiveness'. Sales volume rose in the first half by 9.7 per cent, or by 4 per cent if a recent acquisition in Mexico is excluded. Volume in Europe declined, but only slightly, the group said. The volume of wire sold in the first six months dropped by only 1 per cent, for example, compared with the first half of 1992. The group blamed depressed investment levels and reduced consumption in western Europe for a slump in demand.</p>

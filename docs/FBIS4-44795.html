			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Sextant to Take Over Mors's </F> Aviation Instrument Business"; first paragraph is AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] Instruments generate 55 million French francs  [Fr] in sales and employ fewer than 100 people in Blanc-Mesnil.  They will be incorporated into Sextant's Vendome plant for  on-board instruments.    The Mors group is heading for a second fiscal year in the  red, with annual sales that plummeted from Fr650 million in 1992  to Fr522 million last year. Its new president, Claude Manceau,  presented a recovery plan for the company last 18 February. The  scheme calls for Mors to sell its aviation instrument business  to Sextant, and part with its 50-percent capital interest in  CEIS TM, its joint venture with Technicatome. The Cogifer group  will purchase Mors's share of CEIS TM, which earns annual sales  of about Fr130 million from the production of medium-power  turbines for nuclear submarines and Argos and Cospas-Sarsat  beacons.    Though the sale of the joint venture to Cogifer has already  been ratified, the Sextant Avionique deal must still be  submitted for approval to the two groups' central  worker-management committees sometime in the next two weeks. The  selloff essentially involves on-board electromechanical  equipment for airplane and helicopter engines, which currently  generate Fr55 million a year in sales and employ a tiny staff of  100 in the Paris suburb of Blanc-Mesnil. Sextant expects to  incorporate production of the equipment into its on-board  instruments plant in Vendome. The acquisition will add  approximately 300 new product numbers to the already vast  catalog of Sextant's on-board equipment.    For now, the exact details of the transaction with regard to  the manufacture of certain computers are still fuzzy. The engine  vibration control computers (installed on the Falcon 2000) and  brake temperature monitoring computers that equip the entire  Airbus line, the Boeing 747-400, and McDonnell Douglas's MD-11  will reportedly transfer to Sextant. The tire pressure indicator  (TPIS) computers that Mors developed in collaboration with the  English firm Westland are tied up in an unfair competition suit  brought by the Labinal group. Once it is settled, the TPISs  could also pass into Sextant's hands.    Finally, Mors will hang on to business in two emerging  fields: modular avionics, for which it is developing a HUMS  (Health and Usage Monitoring System) computer to track the aging  of helicopters in cooperation with Eurocopter; and aircraft  mobile telephones (TFTS). It has been chosen as the supplier of  Jetphone, a joint venture of France Telecom and British Telecom.</p>

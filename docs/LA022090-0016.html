			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USE OF COMPUTER TO MATCH LOANS, HOME BUYERS DRAWING FIRE;  </P> <P> LENDING: SOME FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SAY PAYMENTS MADE TO BROKERS ARE REALLY  ILLEGAL REFERRAL FEES. BUT BROKERS DEFEND THE PRACTICE AS BEING IN CONSUMERS'  INTEREST.  </P> <P> An obscure legal dispute could affect the way in which mortgages totaling  billions of dollars are marketed to home buyers.  </P> <P> Once a quiet argument between lobbyists and bureaucrats at the Department of  Housing and Urban Development, the dispute has spread to Capitol Hill, where a  House hearing is scheduled for April 19.  </P> <P> Here's the background: Citicorp, Prudential Real Estate Affiliates of Costa  Mesa and a few other companies use computers to match home buyers with suitable  mortgages. In Prudential's case, the lender pays Prudential $425 per customer.  Prudential then pays its broker $100 to defray the cost of operating the  computer system.  </P> <P> The Mortgage Bankers Assn. contends that the $100 payments are, in fact,  referral fees, which are barred by federal law. The reason: Consumers might not  get the best deal from a lender who is paying brokers to refer customers to  him.  </P> <P> Prudential's computer system, for instance, offers a choice of, at most, eight  lenders. Citicorp's system offers just one: Citicorp.  </P> <P> Interest on Citicorp loans, the mortgage bankers contend, averages one-quarter  to one-half a percentage point higher than that on most loans. Citicorp  counters that its rates are "competitive."  </P> <P> "These programs are a very expensive convenience," said Sharon Canavan, a  lobbyist for the mortgage bankers. "Borrowers should take the time to go out  and shop."  </P> <P> That's nonsense, says the National Assn. of Realtors: The Prudential system,  for instance, actually offers consumers a wider choice by offering loans from  as many as eight lenders in one place. And the $100 only reimburses the broker  for costs incurred, says the realtors association.  </P> <P> It's perfectly legal, and both Citicorp and Prudential have letters from HUD  saying so.  </P> <P> "You can't tell people to work for nothing," said William North, executive vice  president of the realtors group, "and HUD agrees with that."  </P> <P> The dispute is the latest turf fight in the financial services industry after  nearly a decade of sweeping changes that saw savings and loans gain some of the  powers of banks and banks push into such new businesses as stock brokerages.  This fight wouldn't even have been possible 10 years ago, when computerized  mortgage systems were just emerging.  </P> <P> But as the new systems proliferate, they threaten to move much of the marketing  of mortgages out of the offices of the thrifts and mortgage companies and into  real estate brokerages. Prudential, for instance, estimates that as many as a  fifth of the mortgages in some cities could eventually be marketed through its  2-year-old system -- or about $10 billion worth of mortgages.  </P> <P> "It's clear (the mortgage bankers) are upset because the brokers are doing  something they've never done before: marketing mortgages," said Stanley M.  Gordon, a Newport Beach lawyer and lobbyist for Prudential.  </P> <P> When the mortgage bankers' group couldn't persuade HUD to declare the payments  illegal, it began lobbying Congress to change the law. This is now the group's  top priority.  </P> <P> HUD declined to issue clearer regulations and put an end to the argument,  partly for fear of offending the heavy-duty players involved and partly because  it's still digging out from last year's huge influence-peddling scandal,  according to sources familiar with the agency.  </P> <P> The politicians may be reluctant to make major changes too.  </P> <P> "It's going to be tough to get anybody to take sides on this," said one House  staffer. "Everybody's going to want to punt because, if you're able to link the  big real estate brokerages with the big banks, eventually you're going to knock  out the middle man, the small thrifts and the mortgage bankers.  </P> <P> "That's why this issue is such a screamer."  </P> <P> This could be the mortgage bankers' last chance: The group can't afford to keep  spending large sums on lobbying. And some of the trade association's own  members -- including Citicorp and some Prudential subsidiaries -- disagree with  its stand. Furthermore, it's up against one of Washington's most powerful  lobbies, the National Assn. of Realtors.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Congress may be in a mood to listen. Housing will be a major  issue on Capitol Hill this year, as the House and the Bush Administration  prepare housing plans. And the mortgage bankers are trying to line up consumer  groups on their side.  </P> <P> The law behind the debate is called RESPA, the Real Estate Settlement and  Procedures Act of 1974, which sought to protect consumers from unscrupulous  brokers and lenders. The act bans referral fees but says a lender can give  "reasonable value for services provided."  </P> <P> It's that line, the realtor group says, that justifies reimbursing brokers for  operating the computer systems.  </P> <P> HUD agreed and gave letters approving the practice to Citicorp's MortgagePower  in 1986 and Prudential's Computerized Loan Origination System, or CLOS, in  1988. These are by far the two biggest networks, although the mortgage bankers  complain that other, smaller systems are starting up around the nation.  </P> <P> Citicorp is the largest mortgage lender in the country. Most of the $12 billion  in mortgages that it wrote last year came through the 4,000 MortgagePower  computer systems installed in the offices of real estate and mortgage brokers  in 37 states.  </P> <P> Unlike Prudential, Citicorp does not reimburse the broker, but charges brokers  for using the system and leaves it up to them whether to pass the cost on to  their customers.  </P> <P> This might seem much ado about nothing -- except for the potentially huge  amounts of money involved and the importance of CLOS, in particular, to  Prudential's corporate strategy.  </P> <P> Prudential began selling its franchises to brokers in 1988, long after most  other real estate franchises started. Many brokerages -- and many of the best  ones -- are already affiliated with other franchise companies, such as Century  21 and Coldwell Banker.  </P> <P> In order to grow, Prudential needed a "hook" to get brokers to sign up, and its  hook was CLOS. Another selling point for these systems is that they speed loan  approval for borrowers. In less than two years, Prudential has signed up 500  brokerages nationwide.  </P> <P> The issue is so important to Prudential and Citicorp that they have put their  own lobbyists on the case. While the debate so far has attracted little  attention outside the industry, it may heat up if politicians begin holding  hearings.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, mortgage bankers are getting ready to roll the dice, having voted  recently to spend $250,000 to lobby Congress.  </P> <P> "This year is their big shot at it," said Gordon, the Prudential lobbyist.  "They can't afford to keep spending that kind of money."  </P></p>

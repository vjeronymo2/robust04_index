			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 21 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The National Social  Defense Secretariat reported here today (21 May) that a  "National Border Control Program" will be implemented to monitor  the import and export of chemical precursors in Bolivia.    Victor Hugo Canelas, under secretary for controlled  substances, noted that the program is still under study and will  be implemented all year round in regions and zones of the  country vulnerable to the illegal drug trade.    Canelas noted that the program the government is determined  to implement in the short term will be supported by the United  Nations and by countries that are "major producers" of chemical  substances.    Canelas added that the program will consolidate logistical  support for customs checkpoints in border areas having  difficulties in carrying out their monitoring work.    Canelas said: "The proposal envisions training personnel, a  modernization of communications and liaison, and the  establishment of permanent customs and police checkpoints."    Canelas described remote areas located in the south  (Yacuiba,  Villazon), the west (Oruro, Charana, Desaguadero), and the  Bolivian Amazon (Guayaramerin, Riberalta, and San Matias) as  "vulnerable points" through which chemical products usually are  introduced illegally into the country.</p>

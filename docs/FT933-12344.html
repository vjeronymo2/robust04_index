			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: German hopes Opportunities in the German market pepped up the fortunes of RMC after NatWest Securities recommended it as being in a prime position to take advantage of building developments there. Pushing the stock as a buy, NatWest said that although the German picture can be mixed, RMC is well poised for good results, especially as it has the lion's share of the Berlin market. The share price rose 8 to 776p although the market was relatively thin. Redland also saw an improvement in its fortunes along similar lines and it advanced 6 to 477p. Shares in chemicals group ICI added 6 to 651p, ahead of its first post merger results on Thursday. Hoare Govett, the broker, is predicting interim profits of Pounds 135m, and an interim dividend of 10.5p. It said the results 'are likely to reflect a patchy six months trading'. Zeneca, demerged from ICI at the begining of June, also reports on Thursday. The shares gained 14 to 613p, ahead of the results in trade of 4.9m. The favourable figures announced earlier this week by SmithKline Beecham continued to boost the stock and the shares gained another 10 to 435p. Profit-taking left Wellcome trailing 3 at 638p. Property stocks boasted a couple of success stories. Hammerson Ord added 10 to 355p while the 'A' shares went up 10 to 324p after the Pounds 87m sale of Woolgate House, one of its City office properties. Asda Properties advanced 2 to 90p after announcing a 97.2 per cent take-up of its recent rights issue. Shaftesbury fell back 2 to 96 on news that it aimed to raise Pounds 20.8m to fund expansion via a placing and open offer with new shares priced at 88p. A standstill agreement with its bankers gave Hartstone, the leather and hosiery company, a breathing space that pleased the market. Its share price moved ahead 7 to 56p. It was the successful culmination of banking negotiations that the company had worked very hard on, said one industry specialist. Power companies staged a recovery. National Power went ahead 3 to 354p and PowerGen put on 5 to 377p. Among transport stocks, recent favourable figures from US airlines brought US investors to British Airways. The shares gained 6 to 326p, with some 4.7m shares having been dealt by the close. Bid-speculation continued to surround container transport group Tiphook. The shares added a further 6 to 250p, as some US investors used the renewed strength of the share price to bale out of the stock. Hints from Taiwan that the regional jets joint venture with British Aerospace would be signed shortly boosted trading, sending the shares 8 forward to 404p. Bargain hunters in Rolls-Royce helped the shares bounce 2 1/2 to 140p. British Steel, a penny better at 108p, was the subject of a two-way pull which brought volume of 24m. A profits warning from Computer services group Rolfe &amp; Nolan sent the shares falling 28 to 255p. Chemicals stocks were quiet all day. Laporte, oversold over the last couple of weeks while waiting for market analysts to assess the results, recovered 7p to 593p. Yorkshire Chemicals, which started at 330p against 350p the previous night, managed to climb back to 345p. Jeremy Chantry with Kleinwort Benson said the movement was more technical than fundamental, pointing to turnover of only 63,000 shares. Waste Management continued the decline prompted by the announcement on Monday of a 15 per cent earnings increase in the first half of the year, which disappointed market expectations. The shares slid 12p to 555p yesterday. In the textile sector, Parkland 'A' shed 9p to 141p while Courtauld Textile closed up 3p at 537p. De La Rue did well in the printing sector, gaining 10p to 649p. BAT Industries hit 452p in the afternoon session but fell back to close up 5 to 449p.</p>

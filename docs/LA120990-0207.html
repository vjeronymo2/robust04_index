			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANDARD TIME  </P> <P> Poor Alex Ferguson, the letter-writer (Oct. 7) who bemoaned the loss of beauty  and the loss of soul caused by his 2,000-year-old tradition's loss of  exclusivity. I'd recognize him anywhere.  </P> <P> He's the same man with the same "beauty" and the same "soul" who asks, "What  about standards?"  </P> <P> Excuse me for not being terribly moved by the tragedy of the loss of form, but  I for one would rather hear from all those whose backs his precious tradition  stood on in order to wave its banner -- and I'd rather hear it from them, the  way they say it, not the way Mr. Ferguson prefers to hear it said in order to  keep himself cozy.  </P> <P> Standards? Yes. I think it's time we had some.  </P> <P> KATE McFADDEN  </P> <P> ARCADIA  </P></p>

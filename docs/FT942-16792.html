			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / People: US/UK policy adviser joins BitC Cay Stratton, one of the leading architects of radical change in the delivery of training in the UK, has joined Business in the Community. BitC is undergoing a regular three-year review and a number of job titles, including Stratton's, are yet to be determined. It is likely, however, that Stratton will lead new initiatives by BitC to promote partnerships between the public and private sectors. Stratton, who was policy adviser to three successive employment secretaries in the UK, returned to the US last year to become senior policy adviser to Douglas Ross, assistant secretary at the Department of Labor. She returned to the UK earlier this year. In the late 1980s, Stratton was chief executive of the Boston Pic. Private Industry Councils are employer-led organisations which involve the private sector in education and training. Norman Fowler, the then employment secretary, met her on a visit to learn about Pics and US vocational training and in 1987 she accepted a one-year post as his special adviser. She stayed nearly six, also advising his successors, Michael Howard and Gillian Shephard. Stratton was part of a small team which laid the foundations for the government's current policies on training. This included setting up Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer government-funded training and promote local economic development.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Lloyd's underwriters earnings down only slightly AT LEAST 150 Lloyd's underwriters earned Pounds 100,000 or more last year, according to figures to be published today by the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest organisation of Names. The scale of remuneration - only marginally less than that paid in 1991 - is likely to cause controversy at the market, where many Names face ruin after losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Brandreth business details demanded Labour yesterday tabled a parliamentary question seeking details of the liquidation of Unicorn Heritage, a tourism company formerly run by Mr Gyles Brandreth, Conservative MP for Chester. Mr Tom Pendry, shadow tourism minister, said he was 'determined to get to the bottom' of the 1990 liquidation of Unicorn, which led the Treasury to write-off a Pounds 200,000 English Tourist Board grant. Mr Brandreth, who denies any impropriety, has rejected calls for his resignation as parliamentary private secretary to Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. Mr Brandreth said he was considering legal action over reports of the collapse of Unicorn Heritage. His refusal to quit was supported by Downing Street, which said the decision to write off the grant was taken by the Treasury in line with a recommendation from the National Heritage Department, which is responsible for the tourist board. A senior government official said the decision was taken after consultation with Cork Gully, the liquidator, which said there was no possibility that the grant could be repaid. Downing Street stressed that both the initial recommendation and the decision to write off the grant were taken by officials without the involvement of ministers. Mr Pendry has tabled a question to Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary. He said: 'His department is responsible for the English Tourist Board, and if there has been any impropriety then they will have to face the music as well.'</p>

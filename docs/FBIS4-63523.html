			<p>BFN     [Text] At negotiations with Ukrainian legislators in Kiev  on May 24 Crimean lawmakers will pursue exclusively  "consultative goals," a Ukrainian parliament spokesman reported  to INTERFAX on Monday [23 May].    Simferopol believes that a solution to Crimea's economic  problems largely depends on compliance with the Ukrainian  President's decree "On an Open Economy Regime in Crimea." The  spokesman noted that disregard for the decree was one of the  economic reasons why the law on the restoration of the  constitutional basis of Crimea as a state had been passed on 20  May.    As Interfax has learned, at a meeting Sunday morning Crimean  legislators considered what actions Ukraine was likely to take  if no agreement were reached. It was suggested that Kiev might  resort to an economic blockade or supply commodities to Crimea  only at world prices.    In such an event, Crimean lawmakers proposed charging for  the  lease of land by Ukrainian armed forces and the Black Sea Fleet  at world levels. According to their estimates, payment at world  prices for the 50,000 hectares of land occupied by the Ukrainian  army, and for the 52,000 hectares of land held by the Black Sea  Fleet "will surpass expenditures for electricity and water from  Ukraine."    "The Crimean delegation is going to Kiev with such an  approach. At its evening conference, only concrete proposals  will be made," the spokesman said.</p>

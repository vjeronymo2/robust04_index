			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- If Europe is capable of  coping with the problems of laundering dirty money, crime, tax  evasions and others, "we will cope with them as well," Czech  Economics Minister Karel Dyba says in the latest issue of the  Czech weekly MLADY SVET. He does not dismiss the information  that the amount of dirty money -- originating from tax and  customs evasions, sales of smuggled goods and drugs -- reaches  some 25 million USD [U.S. Dollars] on Czech territory. "25  million USD seems to be a big amount, but it is negligible in  percentage," Dyba states. He explains that it makes up some 0.1  percent of the total of 600 billion crowns (about 20 billion  USD) annually loaned by the banking sector to the economy. "Of  course... it is necessary to strive to eliminate the existence  of any dirty money. But not at any cost, as we must not  discourage the `pure' money, which might flow out from our  banks," Dyba stresses.    Asked what the real problems of the Czech economy in 1993  were, Dyba says that "from the point of view of healthy economic  growth," he considers "emerging new internal relations within  enterprises one of the problems." Others are the slow pace of  courts' giving rulings, excessive bureaucracy, and others, he  adds. Dyba states that "social consensus still exists in our  country." He defines it as an agreement by most people with the  reform, with the fast tempo set by the state.    "I think that this government not only speaks about a market  economy without social attributes for instance, but it also  promotes it in practice," Dyba emphasises. But on the other  hand, the government cares for changes such as further  liberalisation of prices to be scheduled evenly and for  compensation for them to be paid "to certain layers of society,  which objectively, in the present phase of economic development,  need it,... to people who are objectively handicapped in some  way," Dyba says. "Although the Czech Republic is carrying out  massive changes, which took Western Europe a decade to be  realised, within a far shorter time, most people accept this,"  Dyba states. He praises the people who "have realised that  nobody would do anything for them, that the world is opened up  for them, that they have a chance, but that they have to strive  hard if they want to be successful. This is of key importance,"  Dyba stresses.    Asked what he thinks about the country's prospects for 1994,  he says that he expects the price rises to be the lowest of all  reform years (since 1990), and not to surpass 10 percent. Dyba  says that if he were an independent economist, he would make his  own estimate of economic growth in 1994, but being a politician,  he sticks to the government prediction of a 2 to 3 percent  growth in the gross domestic product. He stresses that growth  depends on many circumstances, including improvement of the  competitiveness of the Czech economy. "We do not expect any  essential changes such as the introduction of a new taxation  system and the split of the republic... this is favourable for  the economic growth," Dyba says.    "Unemployment will slightly rise but not dramatically," he  states, adding that he expects this to "be positive in a certain  sense, mainly with regard to better labour discipline which  usually accompanies the increase in unemployment." Dyba says he  is not one of those considering bankruptcies an essential  question and insisting that no key change can be made without  enterprises going bankrupt. "Bankruptcies will simply come and  I hope that they will be in proportion to the general economic  development. I would particularly like the dynamic sector of  small- and medium-sized businesses to develop, and a number of  big enterprises to be reshaped," Dyba says.    Asked what the results of the next parliamentary elections  slated for 1996 he expects, Dyba says he believes that the  latest 1992 election winner, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS),  of which he is a member, will be successful again. It will  require hard work which would result in everybody benefiting  from good economic developments," he concludes in MLADY SVET.</p>

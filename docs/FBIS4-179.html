			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It seems as if all is, for now at least, pretty much  quiet between the factions within the ULIMO [United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia] rebel movement in Liberia.  This calm follows weeks of a split and fighting between the  Mandingos loyal to the leader, Alhaji Koromah, and the Krahns  who support the ULIMO military head, Roosevelt Johnson. The two  men went to neighboring Sierra Leone last week to talk peace and  at the end of it they issued a communique saying they have  patched up their differences, and now the West African force,  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group], have begun deploying troops in the ULIMO town of  Tubmanburg. Jonathan Pay Laile, who normally reports for us  from Gbarnga, was taken to Tubmanburg today. He sent this  report:    Tension is easing in Tubmanburg following the deployment of  ECOMOG troops last Thursday [31 March]. Some 200 ECOMOG troops  have arrived in the town. However, armed soldiers loyal to  Alhaji Koromah, are patrolling the streets 24 hours a day. Some  civilians are slowly beginning to return to the town. Most had  fled following fighting between competing factions within the  ULIMO.    This afternoon, a senior ECOMOG soldier told me in  Tubmanburg  that the deployment of ECOMOG troops will be completed by  tomorrow. He said since the arrival of the troops there has been  no fighting. A chief operations officer with the UN force,  UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia], also confirmed that the  town has been calm for some days now. He also said that troops  loyal to Roosevelt Johnson attacked Bomi last week but were  pushed back by fighters loyal to Alhaji Koromah. The town of  Congo on the Sierra Leone-Liberia border, he said changed hands  three times last week before ECOMOG troops were deployed there.  As I returned to Monrovia this afternoon, I passed several  trucks carrying ECOMOG soldiers into Cape Mount County.</p>

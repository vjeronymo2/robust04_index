			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium crashes to 8-year low ALUMINIUM'S PRICE crashed through an important technical support level yesterday to end the day on the London Metal Exchange at its lowest point for eight years. The fall triggered widespread selling on the LME, driving copper prices down to fresh six-year lows and taking zinc to near six-year lows, lead and nickel to near seven-year lows while tin was near its lowest point for 20 years. Analysts suggested this reflected the fundamentally gloomy world economic situation, huge and rising stock levels and unrestrained exports from the former Soviet Union. No improvement could be expected until at least half-way through 1994, they said. Three-month aluminium was Dollars 1,074.75 a tonne at the close on the LME, down Dollars 38.50, helped on its way by news that stocks in exchange warehouses had risen by another 3,625 tonnes to a record 2,260,175 tonnes. Analysts said the next technical support point was Dollars 1,050. The price is now perilously near 45 cents a lb (Dollars 991 a tonne) which the Anthony Bird consultancy group recently described as 'a disaster price' that would quickly force western producers to close another 2m tonnes of annual capacity on top of the 1.4m tonnes already temporarily shut down.  ------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium          +3,625    to    2,260,175 Copper             +6,850    to      612,900 Lead                 +875    to      289,000 Nickel               +516    to      118,620 Zinc               +4,400    to      827,400 Tin                  +190    to       20,630  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

When the first indorsement has been made by one other than the payee personally, the presenting bank and the indorsers are deemed to guarantee, in addition to other warranties, that the person who so indorsed had unqualified capacity and authority to indorse the check on behalf of the payee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A presenting bank makes the warranties required of a sender under Subpart A of 12 CFR part 210 (Regulation J). This section does not limit any warranty by a presenter or other party arising under State law. Neither the Department, an agency nor a Reserve Bank is barred from recovering on a breach of warranty solely because:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The negligence of the Department, an agency or of a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had contributed to a fraudulent indorsement or material alteration;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Department, an agency or a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had failed to discover promptly an unauthorized signature or alteration;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An imposter had fraudulently caused the issuance of a FedSelect check in the name of any existing payee or fictitious payee; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) An employee of the Department, an agency or a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had caused the fraudulent issuance of a FedSelect check in the name of any existing payee or fictitious payee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In the event of a breach of warranty, the payor Reserve Bank may either return the item to the presenting bank or send to the presenting bank notice of the breach. If, upon receipt of the returned check or notice of the breach, the presenting bank does not make prompt restitution, the Department, an agency or the payor Reserve Bank may begin appropriate collection procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

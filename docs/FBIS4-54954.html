			<p>BFN     [Text] A Public Order Ministry report confirms that  yesterday afternoon 150 to 200 residents from the villages  flooded by Fierze lake began a hunger strike and occupied the  committee building of Kukes city. Their demands consisted of an  annual rent for the flooded land, compensation for the flooded  houses and other buildings, an organized transfer to other  areas, and long-term loans. As seen, some of these demands  cannot be met and are unreasonable. The democratic government  considered some other demands to be reasonable and promised to  put them into effect.    For this reason, four ministers of the democratic government  held a meeting with the strike commission yesterday. After  lengthy discussions on these problems, they asked the commission  to liberate the occupied building.    After this meeting, several strikers abandoned the strike.  More than half of them categorically refused to leave and  attacked the public order forces, as they attempted to evict  them according to the law. Consequently, 26 persons were  wounded with stones and other hard objects -- of whom 14 were  from the Public Order forces -- with two suffering fractures.    The Public Order Ministry stresses that certain extremist  elements stand behind these offenders, who are former Labor  Party leaders and collaborators of the secret police and who,  besides this, have today committed the grave crime of blocking  the national road. The Public Order Ministry stresses that  measures according to the law will be initiated against the  persons responsible.</p>

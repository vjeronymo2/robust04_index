			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S PRO VOLLEYBALL / HUNTINGTON BEACH OPEN;  </P> <P> PARTNERS CHANGE, RESULTS DON'T  </P> <P> As they have done all season, Jackie Silva and Janice Opalinski were thrilling  the crowd with their line-drive serves in the Huntington Beach Open women's pro  volleyball tournament Saturday.  </P> <P> A few feet away, Rita Crockett-Royster and her partner, Dennie Knoop, were  struggling with their second-round match.  </P> <P> It would be easy for Crockett-Royster to be a bit upset with Silva, a friend  and former partner who has won the first five stops on the tour with Opalinski  of San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Crockett-Royster of Costa Mesa was the odd-player-out in May, when she returned  from playing indoor pro volleyball in Italy.  </P> <P> Silva, who has won 16 of the past 18 beach tournaments the past two years with  four different partners, had agreed to team with Crockett-Royster. But after  Silva and Opalinski won the first three tournaments, they decided to extend  their partnership through at least mid-season.  </P> <P> "I knew before I came back from Italy that Jackie and I wouldn't be playing  together," said Crockett-Royster, who is in her second season on the pro beach  tour. "Italy is my commitment. Beach volleyball just keeps me in shape. Jackie  makes her living at this. She needs a serious partner who's ready to play.  </P> <P> "Jackie and I figured that since they were winning, why change partners? I  needed someone to play with who could keep me in the top five, too."  </P> <P> Crockett-Royster and Knoop lost to Lori Zeno-Biller and Kathy Hanley, 15-9, in  their second-round match, but rallied with two victories to advance to today's  losers' bracket of the double-elimination tournament.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Silva and Opalinski, meanwhile, cruised into the winners' bracket  semifinal against fourth-seeded Gail Castro and Lori Kotas, who defeated  fifth-seeded Angela Rock and Julie Schaar-Thornton in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Linda Chisholm-Carrillo and Linda Robertson, seeded sixth, upset second-seeded  Elaine Roque and Nina Matthies, 15-12, in the quarterfinals. Chisholm-Carrillo  and Robertson will meet Patty Dodd and Karolyn Kirby in the other winners'  bracket semifinal.  </P> <P> The losers' bracket semifinals begin at 8:30 today and the winners' bracket  semifinals at 9:30. The championship game is scheduled for 3 p.m.  </P> <P> Crockett-Royster and Knoop, seeded seventh, have advanced through the losers'  bracket before. They finished fifth in last week's tournament at Santa Cruz  after an early-round loss. They finished fourth in their first tournament at  Hermosa Beach.  </P> <P> Crockett-Royster and Knopp need at least a ninth-place finish at Huntington  Beach to secure eighth place in the overall standings. The top eight teams on  the tour are invited to a July 7-8 tournament in Hawaii.  </P> <P> "Our goal when we started playing was to make the top eight," Crockett-Royster  said. "Our other goal is to win at Japan (July 28-29) and finish the season in  the top three."  </P> <P> Crockett-Royster hopes her play on the beach tour will parallel her success  indoors. A member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, she signed a two-year,  six-figure contract last year to play in the Italian indoor league, which runs  from October to May.  </P> <P> "The (Italian league) offered enough money to make me leave America,"  Crockett-Royster said. "I can see (that much money) on the beach tour in a  couple of years."  </P> <P> Silva led the money winners on the beach tour last season with $32,000.  </P> <P> Crockett-Royster apparently was worth every penny of her contract, earning most  valuable player honors and leading her team, Matera, to the championship game.  </P> <P> And if Crockett-Royster wins a beach championship this summer, it probably  won't be with Silva.  </P> <P> Silva is known for changing teammates often, but Crockett-Royster has ruled out  any possibility of reuniting their partnership this season.  </P> <P> "I've made a commitment to Dennie," she said. "Dennie is helping me make money  and I'm helping her make money. It wouldn't be fair to her or I if one of us  left later in the season."  </P></p>

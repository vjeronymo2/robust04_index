			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Democratic heart beats on: Confusion surrounding the US action in Haiti has not destroyed optimism The American embassy in Port-au-Prince does not know the code name for the deployment of US troops in Haiti. It might be 'Operation Uphold Democracy', or it might be 'Operation Restore Democracy'. After a week's grilling on the operation, US officials are in no mood to quibble. The confusion over the code name is indicative of the military operation's ill-defined sense of mission. In sending more than 10,000 soldiers to oversee the return to power of elected but ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the US seems uncertain whether bringing democracy to Haiti means working with, or replacing, the existing authorities. The entrenched legacy of repression in the conservative establishment would make either an achievement. However, when the US forces arrived in Haiti, their operational strategy was still being hammered out. American soldiers, who on Sunday night had been expecting to invade and inflict a humiliating defeat on military leader General Raoul Cedras and 'his armed thugs', were on Monday morning required to work with that same Haitian military to assist in the departure of its leadership. The leaders of the two armies, General Henry Shelton and Gen Cedras, started working out the logistics of their unlikely partnership with US servicemen already on the ground. But Haiti's law enforcers, described by US President Bill Clinton 10 days ago as 'deadly police thugs', were quick to embarrass their new comrades in arms. A group of civilians, some marvelling at US military gizmos and others celebrating the imminent return of Aristide, was beaten up by Haitian police. US soldiers were not allowed to intervene. By Wednesday night, the Clinton administration had reversed its decision to leave law and order enforcement to the Haitian authorities. US military officials later acknowledged 'some confusion' as 'policy evolved in meetings with Gen Cedras', but asserted US forces' constant sense of purpose. Of the changes in operating guidelines, one officer said: 'There is no change of mission; there is a change of focus.' The commitment to working with Gen Cedras remains. Last night, US soldiers slept under the same roof as their Haitian counterparts, after moving into the Cap d'Application military base the previous day. In case the combination of restraint and re-education does not produce an armed force that respects democracy, the US is planning a buy-back programme of some of the 20,000 weapons in Haiti. But many in Port-au-Prince, not least the city's ousted mayor who has been forced into hiding, question the wisdom of working with Gen Cedras's men. 'President Clinton just said these people were criminals,' said Evans Paul. 'He can't send his troops to collaborate with criminals. The Haitian people don't trust these people.' Evidence of the violent crime of the Haitian authorities is distressingly easy to come by. The last anyone saw of Idil Blanc's son, Eric, an Aristide sympathiser, was when he was bundled into a police car 10 months ago. In the wealthy suburb of Petionville, Mr Bobby Burnette, a US missionary, came home one night to find three people flayed to death by machete at the end of his drive. 'The police are cold-blooded killers,' he says. Habits, especially vicious ones, die hard. Haiti's history of political thuggery dates back to the formation of Francois 'Baby Doc' Duvalier's Tonton Macoute private army, after his election in 1957. 'This generation of politicians grew up with the Duvalier philosophy,' says Lionel, one of many made redundant since the embargo against Haiti crippled the economy. 'If you're in opposition, then you shouldn't be around.' He foresees recrimination in his middle-class neighbourhood, after President Aristide returns: 'You've been living on a block, terrorising the people, killing the people, and they know you. Now, you've got no power, no guns. They're definitely going to kill you.' The speed with which popular demonstrations gathered momentum last week, turning from a dancing throng into a leaping frenzy in minutes, brought back unwelcome memories for the city's conservative bourgeoisie. The Lavalas (flood) alliance of populist movements, which includes Ti Legliz (the little church), gwoupman (farming co-operatives) and the unions, swept Aristide to power three years ago. Last week, it was reviving its biblical rhetoric and gearing itself up to wash away the nation's villains. But the existence of two diametrically opposed political camps in Haiti did not dampen the euphoria in Port-au-Prince last week. Haiti's democratic heart beats on, people said jubilantly: political violence is a thing of the past. And, anyway, there was the US panacea. 'The change has been perfect,' said one. 'Violence is Haitian history today. The US soldiers are our democrats,' said another. Mr Emanuel Constant, head of the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, declared that 1994 would be 'the year of the ballot, not the bullet'. Speaking outside the front's headquarters in a residential suburb of the city, his words of reconciliation were punctuated by the paramilitaries around him: 'Democracy yes] Democracy yes] Violence no]' Less than a year ago, the same men had stood on the quayside of Port-au-Prince harbour - and blocked the USS Harlan County from entering Haiti to assist in the restoration of President Aristide under the last agreement.</p>

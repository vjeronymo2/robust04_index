			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The People's Understanding Needed for </F> Government Loans to China"]    [Text] "It is questionable that the government should  continue to extend a huge amount of financial aid to China,  which enjoys an annual growth rate of over 10 percent, when  there is a recession in Japan." "There is a possibility that  Japan's provision of aid to China will run counter to the  principle of the Official Development Assistance [ODA]." We  often hear such doubtful voices every time the issue of Japan's  fourth yen-dominated loans to China comes to the surface.    The total amount of Japan's financial contributions to China  through yen-dominated loans has reached over Y1.39 trillion in  the 15 years from fiscal 1979 to fiscal 1993. Of this, Japan,  in its third yen loan to China, which began in fiscal 1990, is  scheduled to extend approximately Y810 billion in six years. As  of fiscal 1993, a little over Y528 billion has already been  extended to China in total.    In preparation for the fourth yen loan program, which will  begin in fiscal year 1996, Japan hopes to decide on the total  amount of loans by the fall of this year. Although Japan is  facing a serious financial situation, we have no objection to  Japan's continuous provision of loans if the amount and purposes  of the loans are reasonable.    However, there is a possibility that future yen loans will  not meet the changing needs of the times. We hope that this  issue will be discussed at various places and levels so that the  government will be able to win the people's understanding of and  support for its financial aid.    First, the government is required to give the people a  satisfactory explanation concerning the total amount of  financial contributions. For example, Japan's financial aid to  East Asian nations is increasing. It seems that Japan's aid to  Vietnam and the Philippines, in particular, will further  increase in the future. Given such a situation, it may not be as  easy for the government to increase its aid to China as in the  past.    Foreign Minister Hata, who visited China last week, in a  series of talks with Chinese leaders agreed in principle to set  a three-year period for the fourth yen loans instead of the  usual five- to six-year period. Although the reason given for  setting up a three-year period is that such a period will enable  Japan to respond flexibly to situational changes, what lies  behind this plan is the government's concern that "if the  established loan period is six years, the total loan amount  would reach over one trillion yen. Therefore, provisions for  such a huge amount may invite the people's criticism." But in  providing loans, the government needs to promote thorough  discussion.    From now on, before extending loans, the government has to  be  careful in choosing projects, particularly in coastal provinces,  which now enjoy rapid economic growth. It is stipulated in the  ODA plan that yen loans should be provided to areas or regions  where annual per capita income is less than $2,695, and grant  aid should be extended to areas or regions where annual per  capita income is less than $1,305. The average income of the  Chinese people is still low. But in some areas of the coastal  provinces, the average annual income may exceed the financial  conditions noted above for yen loans.    However, it is hoped that financial aid to poverty-stricken  inland areas will increase. It is also suggested that Japan  will drastically increase its grand aid aimed at promoting  agricultural development. Moreover, we believe that Japan's aid  aimed at helping China promote the market economy will also be  effective.    Meanwhile, the Japanese Government should watch over China's  increase in its military expenditures, development of missiles  and other weapons of mass destruction, and exports and imports  of arms. In talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Foreign  Minister Hata succeeded in having Jiang Zemin comment that  "(China's increase in military expenditures) is only for  purposes of defense, not expansion." In the future, Japan  should urge China to come up with concrete measures -- including  advance notice of military exercises and disclosure of  information on military arrangements -- so that China's military  affairs will be more transparent.</p>

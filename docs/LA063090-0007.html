			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDATORY SAVING WATER RESTRICTIONS  </P> <P> I was amazed to read the article "2013: Odyssey in the Desert" (June 18) in  that here are women performing and encouraging the kind of planting that is  done in the Midwest when they live in the desert community of Ridgecrest. What  amazed me even more was that you printed the article from an aspect of  reporting a job well done, when what really needs to be said is that these  women are uninformed about the drought the state is suffering.  </P> <P> You have printed any number of articles in recent years and months about the  state of emergency existing in California with our extreme shortage of  rain/snowfall, and reported that, even though the sprawling metropolis of Los  Angeles is only considering a 10% rationing of water in the upcoming year,  communities such as Santa Barbara are undergoing severe rationing.  </P> <P> I think responsible reporting would be to point out that these Desert Planters  of Ridgecrest haven't yet got the message that we are in trouble in this state  and, instead of planting all the "gardens, trees and manicured lawns" that they  are, they should be installing rock and cactus gardens and using real  California ingenuity!  </P> <P> JANET GOLDBERG  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

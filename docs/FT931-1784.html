			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Legal threat ends blockade of port A FLOTILLA of fishing boats from north-east England blockaded one of Britain's biggest ports yesterday to publicise fishermen's opposition to the government's fisheries policy. The 8-hour blockade, from dawn, of the mouth of the River Tees disrupted shipping movements in and out of the Port of Tees and Hartlepool. It delayed 10 vessels, including two carriers exporting Sunderland-made Nissan cars. The protest was called off after threats of legal action against the fishermen from the Port of Tees and Hartlepool Authority. As they sailed away the men warned of more action, at unspecified locations, this week, despite fisheries minister Mr David Curry's condemnation of the protest as 'a waste of time' which would not influence government policy. Yesterday's action by men from ports from North Shields to Scarborough was organised by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which represents most fishermen in England and Wales. NFFO chief executive Mr Richard Banks joined the blockade on board the Whitby trawler Sarb J. He highlighted two main objectives of the protest. One was to press for import controls, particularly on cheap Russian fish entering Britain. Fishermen claim that Russian cod is entering the UK at roughly half the minimum EC price. The second aim is to force the government to abandon the new Sea Fish Conservation Act which will restrict the number of days British fishermen can go to sea. Mr Banks claimed the act would cut up to 30 days off the average total that fishermen work at present. He said this was equivalent to a 10 per cent or Pounds 2,000 drop in annual income. The decision to disrupt shipping had not been taken lightly, he added. 'We want to bring to everybody's attention we are in dire straits,' he said. The fishermen also called for more advertising of fish and immediate implementation of the EC's payment scheme for decommissioning fishing vessels. Mr Curry is tomorrow meeting the NFFO and the fish processors, who depend heavily on imports. Responding to Mr Banks' comments, he said British fishermen must accept the need to take action to conserve stocks. Mr Curry said the industry's problems included insufficient consumer demand for fish and large landings by British fishermen, glutting the marketplace. 'The whole problems of the industry can't all be blamed on other people,' he said. Last week's Brussels meeting of the European Council of Fisheries Ministers had, he said, ruled out a blanket ban on non-EC imports. The protectionism wanted by the protesting fishermen contradicted moves towards liberalising trade. Shipowners and agents using Teesport expressed concern at the protest. 'I'm very disappointed the fishermen should take an illegal step,' said Mr Derek Munt, managing director of ferry owner Ferrymasters. The departure of the company's MV Elk was delayed. Two of the 10 vessels affected yesterday were diverted to Hull.</p>

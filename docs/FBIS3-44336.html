Guangdong has also seen its electric power output leaping to  first place in the whole country this year.    Since 1991 the provincial government has allocated about six  million yuan a year to help provide and rebuild electric power  facilities in remote rural areas.    During the past few years Guangdong has actively absorbed  foreign investment and raised funds through different channels  to develop its power industry.    The total installed capacity had reached ten million kw by  the end of 1992, and an increase of about 3 million kw to 4  million kw is expected this year.</p>

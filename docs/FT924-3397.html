			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wellman retreats to Pounds 321,000 WELLMAN, the West Midlands-based engineer, saw profits dip to Pounds 321,000 pre-tax for the six months to September 30. The downturn from the previous Pounds 344,000 came on turnover of Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 13.7m), although Mr Geoffrey Iley, chairman, said comparisons were distorted by the purchase in May of Midcast Engineering. The acquisition, which took the group into the North American market, made a contribution to trading profits on turnover of Pounds 900,000, although UK deliveries were lower than anticipated; benefits from rationalisation were being realised, Mr Iley. Midcast has won orders worth Dollars 3.4m (Pounds 2.2m) from North America. Other group businesses showed little change in profits, but overseas subsidiaries in South Africa and Australia incurred small losses. Fully diluted earnings fell to 0.6p (0.7p) per share. The interim dividend is cut from 0.8p to 0.3p; a final of not less than 0.6p is forecast.</p>

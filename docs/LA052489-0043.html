			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEASE SALE HELD ALMOST CERTAIN TO LEAD TO SPILL  </P> <P> Proposed new oil drilling off the coast of Southern California would  appreciably increase the chance of a large oil spill in the region and make a  major spill almost certain within the next 31 years, according to a new  assessment by the Department of the Interior.  </P> <P> The study, the government's first official estimate of oil spill risks from the  sale of new Southern California leases, found 1 chance in 7 of a "large" spill  of 1,000 barrels or more resulting from the proposed federal Lease Sale 95,  which would include sites off the coast from Ventura County south to the  Mexican border.  </P> <P> That prospect would make all but certain a large spill resulting from Lease  Sale 95 or continuing Southern California offshore oil drilling under existing  federal and state leases, according to the assessment. This calculation  includes the possibility of a spill not only from the drilling but also from  associated tanker traffic.  </P> <P> The risk assessment, prepared for the White House task force weighing whether  the Southern California lease sale should proceed, was presented to the panel's  working group last week. A briefing paper was made available to The Times on  Tuesday, and its conclusions were confirmed by Administration officials.  </P> <P> The report, assembled by the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service,  did not attempt to estimate the odds of a major oil spill from existing  offshore operations, if Lease Sale 95 is not approved.  </P> <P> But it contended that the proposed drilling in the Lease Sale 95 area would be  far less likely to cause a spill than other continuing oil-related activity off  the Southern California shore.  </P> <P> For example, the report showed that new offshore drilling would account for  just 4% of the overall risk to Southern California of a "very large" spill of  10,000 barrels or more. In contrast, tankers carrying Alaskan oil make up  nearly half of that risk.  </P> <P> The prospect that new drilling would result in such a "very large" spill was  put at 1 in 20. Approval of such activity would raise to 94% the overall  likelihood that the region would suffer such a 10,000-barrel-plus spill in the  next three decades, the report said.  </P> <P> By comparison, 77,000 barrels of oil were spilled in the Santa Barbara platform  blowout of 1969. About 240,000 barrels were spilled this spring in Prince  William Sound when the Exxon Valdez ran aground on a submerged reef.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urge Cancellation  </P> <P> Leading opponents of offshore drilling pointed to the projected increased risk  as further reason that the proposed lease sale off Southern California -- and  other plans for drilling off the coasts of Central and Northern California --  ought to be canceled.  </P> <P> At the same time, some argued that the prospect of a drilling-related spill is  far greater than the Interior Department contended, and accused the Bush  Administration of seeking to play down the risk.  </P> <P> "They're doctoring numbers again," charged Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica),  noting that the assessment formula used by Interior's Minerals Management  Service had previously been criticized as biased by other government agencies.  </P> <P> "Given the fact that they are trying to come to the most benign possible  conclusion, even that conclusion should raise concerns," Levine said.  </P> <P> The disclosure of the Interior Department risk assessment came as the task  force was preparing to convene in Los Angeles today to hear testimony about the  lease sale from public officials and private citizens.  </P> <P> The risk analysis by the Minerals Management Service was to have been included  in an Interior Department study assessing the environmental impact of the  proposed lease sale. Its publication was postponed until after the White House  task force completes its deliberations at the end of the year, Interior  officials said.  </P> <P> The task force, headed by Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr., has been  ordered to examine whether the offshore drilling plans should be modified or  canceled out of concern that such activity might cause significant  environmental harm.  </P> <P> Estimates of "oil spill occurrence risk" for Southern California were presented  to the task force in bar graph form, with the prospect that Lease Sale 95 might  result in a large oil spill in coming decades portrayed as hovering near 15%.  </P> <P> However, Robert P. LaBelle, a senior MMS official involved in drafting the  report, cautioned that the statistics should not be interpreted as "predictions  of future spill events."  </P> <P> "These are estimates to be given in an environmental analysis," LaBelle said.  </P> <P> Estimates by the MMS of the oil spill risk posed by Lease Sale 95 were based  initially on the assumption that the new drilling would yield 230 million  barrels of oil that would have to be produced and transported to shore over the  next 31 years.  </P> <P> Other assessments took account of U.S. experience, which has shown that tankers  and pipelines pose a considerably greater risk of spills than do oil platforms.  </P></p>

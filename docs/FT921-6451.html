			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock says party 'ready to win' - Labour National Executive Committee THE LABOUR leadership yesterday defied the government to call off an April 9 general election, claiming the voters' would not forgive the Tories if they failed to announce the ballot by the end of Budget week - a fateful Friday March 13. In an upbeat farewell to his national executive committee at what Labour is certain was its last meeting before a poll, Mr Neil Kinnock claimed that the party had never been more prepared for an election. He went on to warn that any postponement of the election would be read by voters as evidence of the desperation of a government that had run out of ideas. In a rallying call as much for the media as his colleagues, the Labour leader told the executive: 'We are ready to run, ready to win and ready to serve.' Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, reiterated the warning that the Tories would damage themselves if they delayed until later in the year. Mr David Hill, Labour's communications director, added that in the event of a postponment the whole focus of the pre-election campaign would switch to the reasons behind the delay. In the interim, Labour is planning to convene its specially constituted joint shadow cabinet-executive group, known as the Clause Five committee, immediately after the dissolution to approve the manifesto. The document will then be published within the first week of the campaign. The party's parliamentary planners are expected not to attempt to disrupt the Budget, preferring instead to use the televised proceedings of parliament to make its case for public expenditure in place of tax cuts. Labour's own detailed tax and spending proposals, including a decision on whether the removal of the ceiling on national insurance contributions will be phased in or done at once, will only be revealed in the week after the Budget. An aide to Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said Labour would need some time to analyse the Budget figures and did not want to make its announcement when press attention was focused on rallies launching the start of the election campaign proper. Party officials expressed confidence that when the real campaign does get under way, the pressure will be on Mr John Major, the prime minister, and not Mr Kinnock whose greater experience on the hustings as a party leader would give him a natural advantage. The executive cleared the decks of party business yesterday by approving candidates, recently elected by local parties, to contest a number of hitherto vacant seats. They included candidates for Wallasey and Nottingham East and replacements for Mr Terry Fields, MP for Liverpool Broadgreen, and Mr Dave Nellist, MP for Coventry South East, who were expelled from the party for their alleged links with the proscribed Militant group.</p>

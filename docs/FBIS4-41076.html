			<p>BFN     [Text] This information came from the Defense Ministry  press service.    On 21 June, Lieutenant General Vardiko Nadibaidze, defense  minister of the Republic of Georgia, received Kent Brown, U.S.  ambassador to Georgia, who was accompanied by high-ranking  officials from the U.S. Department of Defense. The meeting was  attended by Major General Nodar Tatarashvili, chief of the  General Staff.    The defense minister told guests about changes in the Armed  Forces, which had begun following his appointment as minister.  The main purpose of these changes is to create a small but  capable and modern Georgian Army. In order to attain this  difficult objective, we are receiving a great deal of assistance  from our partners--the command of the Russian troops in the  Transcaucasus. However, we would also be pleased to receive  assistance from our U.S. colleagues and are ready to cooperate  with them within the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace  program in order to safeguard peace in the region, Nadibaidze  said.    At the end of the meeting, the minister thanked guests for  the visit and for the attention that the United States was  giving to Georgia and its army construction, adding that  contacts between the the two countries' military would develop  further.</p>

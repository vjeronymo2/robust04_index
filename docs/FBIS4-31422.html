			<p>BFN     [Text] In honor of the upcoming Yugoslav Army Day, 16  June, Colonel-General Momcilo Perisic, chief of the Yugoslav  Army General Staff, met in the Yugoslav Army Club with  representatives of the media, editors in chief, and journalists  specializing in the military field. Mijusko Tomic reports.    [Begin recording] [Tomic] Despite the sanctions that have  been imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav  Army does not lag behind other countries and armies, while its  combat readiness is significantly higher and stronger than that  of any other neighboring country, said General Perisic. It is  founded on the best traditions of the Serbian and Montenegrin  people, and it is ready to defend the independence and  territorial integrity of our country, said Chief of General  Staff Colonel-General Momcilo Perisic, and stressed:    [Perisic] I am saying that there is no direct or immediate  danger of war. A danger of war exists because the enemy -- the  creator of the new world order -- has embarked on destroying the  state of the Serbs and Montenegrins. Once he destroys their  state, then we will behave in the manner of stateless people,  and you know what stateless peoples are like. [sentence as  heard] Better any kind of state than no state at all.  Therefore, there is a great danger of war breaking out, great  [danger], but I am saying that currently there is no immediate  [danger], precisely because of the people's heroic resistance  whom the Yugoslav People's Army [as heard] first trained, then  armed, and lastly, organized and gave them the initial impulse  to defend and succeed in defending what it has accomplished so  far. I might also add the following: militarily speaking, more  could not have been accomplished, of course, in areas where the  people embraced this army as their own. [sentence as heard]    [Tomic] Members of the Yugoslav Army are satisfied with  journalists' approach regarding the presentation of the  comprehensive combat readiness and ability of the Yugoslav Army.  It is necessary for a journalist to spread the truth about the  army, rather than lies, which is what some journalists are  doing, said Chief of General Staff Colonel-General Momcilo  Perisic.

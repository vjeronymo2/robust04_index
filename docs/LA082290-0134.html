			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RECALCITRANT BATHER MEETS A SOAPY FATE  </P> <P> enyan man who did not bathe for three years met a soapy fate when an  exasperated mob pursued him through the streets, peeled off his clothes and  forcibly washed him in public, the semiofficial Kenya Times newspaper reported  today.  </P> <P> The man, whose name was withheld, was set upon by odor-sensitive colleagues  after he repeatedly declined invitations to break his 36-month ablutionary  fast, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> Fellow artisans in Othaya, 60 miles north of Nairobi, chased the pungent  offender through the streets, held him down and scrubbed him with soap and a  rough piece of gunnysack. The sacking helped remove the accumulated layers of  filth, the paper explained.  </P> <P> The man's clothes were burned, and he was given a new set after friends held a  collection for him.  </P> <P> The crowd also force-marched the man to a barber shop, where the victim had his  hair cut and his beard trimmed.  </P></p>

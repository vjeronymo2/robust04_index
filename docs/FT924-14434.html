			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Cool welcome for revised economic framework THE new framework for economic policy met with a mix of cautious approval, scepticism and outright hostility from the markets and industry. There was some praise for the chancellor's effort to set out an explicit inflation target, but doubts were expressed as to whether it would stick. There were also some worries about whether the fall in the exchange rate since sterling's devaluation would be enough to produce an economic recovery without lower base rates soon. The Confederation of British Industry said the inflation target appeared 'realistic and sensible', and it welcomed the recognition of the importance of the exchange rate in the conduct of monetary policy. Against that, it said the burden of controlling inflation had to be spread more evenly between public and private sectors, without endangering public investment programmes. The Institute of Directors welcomed the indication of tighter control on public expenditure and hoped confidence generated by the policy would allow further cuts in interest rates. The Federation of Small Businesses said there was nothing to lift confidence. Mr Ian Handford, chairman of the federation's policy unit, said: 'Concentration on lower and lower inflation, cutting public expenditure and lower taxation implies more of the same medicine, at whatever cost in terms of business failures and job losses.' In the City, Mr Gwyn Hacche, an economist at stockbrokers James Capel, said: 'Much of the detail of what Mr Lamont had to say reflects old ideas which we saw in the 1980s, when they were not very successful.' Mr Gerry Holtham, chief economist at the London office of Lehman Brothers, the US investment group, said: 'While Mr Lamont appeared to be tough on inflation, he has given us very little new information. His performance yesterday was a long way short of first division.' Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said he was worried by the idea of an inflation target, a lagging indicator. That might mean that when inflationary pressures built up causing the target to be exceeded, it might be too late for the government to take avoiding action. Some in industry were more openly hostile. Mr David Holloway, president of the Housebuilders' Federation, said the government was 'sleepwalking to disaster' by continuing to pursue inappropriate policies. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the construction group, said the failure to address Britain's economic troubles was a 'ferocious blow' to industry, which was dying while the economy stagnated. He said Britain needed a structured, economic programme for stimulating recovery. Industry recognised the need for cuts in public-sector borrowing but said current spending should be reined back and not capital projects. Unions also reacted angrily. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, called Mr Lamont a 'do-little' chancellor and urged him to restart the economy through more targeted expansion of public spending on housing, transport and the inner cities. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical union said: 'It was a limp speech from a wilting government. We are waiting for an economic strategy to revitalise industry and it was not forthcoming.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed that &sect;4.115 be amended to allow separate evaluation of coexisting ``heart disease'' in the event of an absent kidney, or when chronic renal disease has progressed to the point where regular dialysis is required. One commenter pointed out that in addition to heart disease, hypertension is often manifested in cases of renal disease, but that the proposed regulatory language would preclude a separate evaluation for hypertension. He suggested that we substitute the term ``cardiovascular disease'' for ``heart disease.'' Although we agree that this provision should apply to hypertension as well as heart disease, we believe that the term ``cardiovascular'' is too broad since it might be interpreted to include cardiovascular conditions unrelated to renal dysfunction. We have therefore amended &sect;4.115 to specify that coexisting heart disease or hypertension may be separately evaluated in the absence of one kidney or when the claimant requires dialysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our proposed rating formula for renal dysfunction under &sect;4.115a included a requirement at the 100 percent level for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine thresholds of more than 100mg% and 10mg%, respectively. One commenter felt that the proposed requirements are too high and suggested that 80mg% and 8mg% would be more appropriate. Upon further review, we have concluded that measurements over 80/8mg% suggest a need for dialysis and would therefore be a more appropriate threshold. We have accordingly amended the criteria for a 100 percent evaluation in &sect;4.115a. In keeping with that change, we have also amended the ranges of BUN and creatinine readings required for an 80 percent evaluation to 40&hyph;80mg% and 4&hyph;8mg%, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters felt that the word ``invalidism'' in the proposed criteria for the 100 and 80 percent levels for renal dysfunction is inappropriate because it is archaic, too subjective, and in fact suggests a level of severity more consistent with entitlement to special monthly compensation. VA agrees, and has substituted the phrase ``precluding more than sedentary activity'' for the 100 percent evaluation, and the phrase ``generalized poor health characterized by *&blank;*&blank;*'' for the 80 percent evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the 60 percent evaluation level for renal dysfunction, we had proposed that qualifying manifestations of hypertension be referred to as ``moderate hypertension'' whereas under the 30 percent level we had proposed that hypertension be ``minimally compensable under diagnostic code 7101.'' One commenter recommended that hypertension be described consistently in terms of diagnostic code 7101 throughout the criteria for renal dysfunction. We agree. Such a change would promote not only a clearer understanding of the rule, but internal consistency within the rating schedule as well. We have therefore modified the criteria for a 60 percent evaluation to require hypertension at least 40 percent disabling under diagnostic code 7101, for a 30 percent evaluation to require hypertension at least 10 percent disabling under diagnostic code 7101, and the zero percent evaluation to include hypertension non-compensable under diagnostic code 7101.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter felt that either albumin and casts with a history of acute nephritis or renal dysfunction with mild hypertension warrants a 10 percent evaluation rather than the zero percent we had proposed under the criteria for renal dysfunction. We do not concur. Albuminuria and granular casts are clinical findings which may or may not indicate active kidney disease, but which themselves are not inherently disabling. Since the level of compensation is determined primarily by the extent to which a condition is disabling, and since an asymptomatic condition, or combination of asymptomatic conditions, imposing no discernible industrial impairment does not warrant a compensable evaluation, we find no reason to assign these conditions a compensable evaluation in the absence of chronic kidney disease or hypertension which is compensable under diagnostic code 7101.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters questioned the reduction of the evaluation for loss of a single kidney from 30 percent to zero percent disabling. Although long-term renal function returns to near normal due to hypertrophy of the remaining kidney, the significant anatomical alteration caused by removal of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kidney, the resulting surgical scar, and the precautions which must be taken to protect the remaining kidney, could reasonably be expected to prevent a veteran from engaging in certain, but by no means all, occupations. Upon further reconsideration, we have therefore elected to retain the minimum 30 percent evaluation for loss of a single kidney under diagnostic code 7500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter felt that the proposed criteria for rating voiding dysfunction under &sect;4.115a would be inadequate for evaluating veterans with neurogenic bladders who use either indwelling or intermittent catheterization to void, and suggested a separate diagnostic code for neurogenic bladder. Although a need for separate rating criteria was implied, the commenter offered no alternative criteria for our consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VA agrees that it would be useful to have a separate diagnostic code for this disability, which is common in cases of severe spinal cord injury. We have therefore added diagnostic code 7542 for neurogenic bladder with instructions to rate the condition under the criteria for voiding dysfunction, which we believe are adequate to evaluate neurogenic bladder. Neurogenic bladder is manifested as urine leakage or frequent urination, both of which correspond to categories of voiding dysfunction as proposed. In addition, the word ``appliance'' as used in the criteria for incontinence clearly includes all types of catheters as well as any other assistive device for urination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

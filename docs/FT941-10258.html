			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Economic Viewpoint: A rather curious base rate cut Here is a good question for a teenager aspiring to become an economic scribbler. After the monthly meeting between the UK chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, and the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, on January 12 they decided against an interest rate cut. At their next meeting on February 2, they decided to make one after all. What could have happened in three short weeks to make them change their minds? (An answer in terms of personalities will be disallowed, at least until the coffee break after the formal interview.) The uneasy feature of the latest interest rate cut is the preponderance of short-term influences. The current move has been triggered by a few months of better-than-expected inflation figures, which in turn have been projected into the period ahead. 'Interest rates should be as low as possible and as high as necessary' is not a quotation from Kenneth Clarke, but is a good guide to what he is likely to do. Is it an adequate principle? The more tangible influences on the base rate decision are conveniently listed in the Bank's new February inflation report. The Bank quite rightly publishes a variety of inflation indicators. The message from all of them is that inflation is now in the neighbourhood of 2 to 2 1/2 per cent per annum  -only slightly above the headline RPI rate. It expects its new index of the core rate - which excludes indirect and local authority taxes as well as mortgage interest - to level out in this range for the rest of 1994 and 1995. This is between  1/2 and 1 per cent below what the Bank projected in November. (The underlying rate including these taxes is expected to rise slightly in the wake of the Budget and then level off at slightly more than 3 per cent.) The Bank also takes comfort from its chart of financial market expectations in the more distant future, which it derives by subtracting the yield on indexed gilts from that on conventional gilts of comparable maturity. The expectation on February 2 was that inflation would peak at about 4 per cent around the year 2000, and then drift back towards 3 per cent. The Bank's chart does not, however, show the deterioration resulting from the fall in gilt-edged prices, which began in late January and has accelerated since the base rate cut. The key to all forecasts is that they follow unexpected changes in current data. In this case, the main reason for the change in the Bank's 1994-95 forecast was the surprisingly low RPI figures for three months in succession, re-flecting in its view 'not only greater competition among retailers, but also stronger than expected disinflationary forces in the economy as a whole'. These are all reasons to present to someone who is against cutting interest rates. What are the positive reasons in support of a cut? The main threat to the pace of recovery mentioned by the Bank is 'the deflationary impact of the November Budget's tax and spending announcements in the short run'. The Bank estimates that personal disposable income will be squeezed by a cumulative 3 per cent over 1994-95. The squeeze will not begin in earnest until the income and national insurance increases take effect in the year starting in April. I was concerned about the size and timing of some of these increases before there was firm enough evidence of adequate economic recovery. But having decided that the man in the City or Commons bar was right about the evils of budget deficits, Mr Clarke should not have tried to offset his own measures by monetary relaxation merely on the basis of forecasts. There have been several past fiscal packages of comparable severity which have not brought any undesirable slowing down of economic activity; and I would have preferred to wait and see. Treasury and Bank officials are obviously worried that workers will try to recoup the tax squeeze on their take-home pay by pressing for and obtaining higher wage awards. That could lead to a reacceleration of nominal pre-tax earnings growth from its present annual 3 per cent - the lowest for more than 25 years. But that surely is an argument for making pay increases more difficult to obtain rather than relaxing credit. Interestingly enough, nearly all the other factors listed by the Bank, both real and monetary, weaken the case for an interest rate cut. These are: confirmation of the recovery in both output and employment, as well as an acceleration of monetary growth. The Bank's writers could hardly be more explicit when they say that these forces are 'likely to reduce the downward pressure on inflation', which they do not expect to fall much further from its present low but still decidedly positive level. Indeed, since the chancellor and the governor met, we have had more very bullish indicators, including a spectacular rise in housing starts and a survey showing a fall in bankruptcies to the lowest level since December 1989. Looking ahead, the Bank sees improving personal debt positions, an upturn in stock building and a modest turnround in the continental economies. New CBI regional surveys show the recovery spreading for the first time to all regions except Northern Ireland. My own worries relate to the gap between output and productive capacity. Underlying inflation depends both on the size of the output gap and the rate at which it is changing. When the gap is already shrinking - which is a good definition of genuine recovery - why take risks? Whatever the size of the output gap, the Bank has little doubt that it is beginning to narrow - as is, indeed, obvious from the pickup in labour demand and the answers to questions on capacity in the CBI Trends survey. It is the small chances taken early in a recovery that sow the seeds of much larger inflationary pressures later. The Bank itself says that the risks to its central inflation projections are asymmetrical - 'a rise in underlying inflation seems more likely than a further fall'. It reaches this conclusion on the somewhat different grounds that inflationary expectations have - despite the evidence cited earlier - not yet fully adjusted to the sharp falls in inflation experienced over the last two years or so. Surveys suggest that ordinary citizens are more pessimistic than financial markets about inflation and expect something worse than the recently experienced rate. This may be the sheer cussedness of human nature or the triumph of experience over hope. The clue as to why the Bank went along with the base rate cut may well lie in the recent increase in the US federal funds rate from 3 to 3 1/4 per cent  -of which the Bank would have had some advance hint. It is still not difficult for Britain - or other European countries - to move in the opposite direction to the US, given the large interest rate differential in their favour. But the supplementary thought could well have occurred: 'We had better act now before US rates rise too far or political events in the UK undermine confidence and reductions here become too difficult.' If the Bank had any doubts about its intention to put its toe into the water with a  1/4 per cent move before going any further, then the Fed's action will have removed them. Changing base rates in small jumps of  1/4 per cent, instead of the minimum of  1/2 per cent we have seen in the past nine years, may help depoliticise monetary policy. If so, fine. But the debate about whether to take many small interest rate steps or a few large ones is the kind of issue, cloaked in market mystique, on which too many of the best brains of the Bank of England spend too much time. We all know that, in a real emergency, rates will still be changed by leaps of one or two percentage points - either way. The main advantage of the latest cut in UK base rates is that it brings nearer the time when people will realise that the next interest rate move may as readily be upwards as downwards. It is impossible to have stability in everything; and some movement of interest rates in both directions is the price for achieving low, stable rates of inflation and avoiding unnecessary fluctuations in output and employment.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Bolivia rewards radical reformer: Christina Lamb on an unlikely victor in presidential elections MR GONZALO Sanchez de Lozada is living proof that radical economic reform can bring political rewards. Since implementing a tough structural adjustment programme as Bolivia's planning minister in 1985, he has twice finished ahead of his rivals in presidential elections and this time seems assured of winning his prize by actually being named president. After polling strongly in the popular vote on Sunday, he found his way virtually clear yesterday when former military ruler General Hugo Banzer, his nearest rival, withdrew from a run-off vote in Congress in August. Gen Banzer said that Mr Sanchez de Lozada would be named president. He is an unlikely head for South America's poorest country. Raised in the US, 62-year-old Mr Sanchez de Lozada owns Bolivia's largest private mining concern and is one of the country's richest citizens. He jokes: 'When I was campaigning in the interior, many people thought I was a foreigner who'd got off a plane in La Paz and decided to run for president.' But he is deadly serious in his desire to build on his neo-liberal reforms of 1985 which brought down inflation from 24,000 per cent and created a market economy - the first Latin American country to do so under democratic government. After eight years of austerity, Bolivia now has inflation of 9 per cent - the lowest in South America and both democracy and stability seem consolidated. But growth has been minimal and poverty is described by the World Bank as at sub-Saharan Africa levels. 'The problem now is to get the economy moving again, get the money to the people and make sure no one steals it,' says Mr Sanchez de Lozada. His ambitious targets are for 8 per cent annual growth for the first three years in office and 11 per cent in the last, creating 500,000 jobs and practically wiping out unemployment. An obvious way to start raising investment would be to privatise the main utilities following the lead of neighbouring Argentina. But it was Mr Sanchez de Lozada's party, the MNR, which nationalised these companies in the 1950s and privatisation is sensitive in highly unionised Bolivia. He explains: 'The state oil company was born out of the Chaco war in which 50,000 Bolivians died. How can I sell it to foreigners?' Instead, he has devised an innovative 'capitalisation' plan under which investors can buy 49 per cent of the companies. While this leaves control nominally with the state, the companies will be run by a foundation comprising 'notables' and the private investors. Once the companies are running efficiently, the state's part will be handed back to the Bolivian people as freely tradeable shares worth an estimated Dollars 4,000 per person - five times per capita income. Mr Sanchez de Lozada believes in this way he can transfer 50 per cent of gross national product to the people in five years, easing the massive income gap. To carry out this 'popular capitalism' will require foreign investment. Although local businessmen are doubtful about the attraction of investing in companies of which they do not have control, they say that Mr Sanchez de Lozada with his native English, sharp mind and considerable charisma is the best possible salesman for the country. Pointing out that 'in a country with just 7m people, a small amount of investment has tremendous impact', he believes that capitalisation of the six largest state companies will be 'like a motor to start up the economy'. Estimating their assets at Dollars 2bn, he hopes to attract as much again, boosting state and private investment, including borrowings, to Dollars 8bn over four years - double the current rate. Before he can do all this, Mr Sanchez de Lozada must be formally approved as president by Congress. In the 1989 elections, he narrowly topped the polls but a deal between the runners-up led Congress to choose the third-placed candidate. This time his main rival has cleared the path by stepping out of the run-off. 'I'd like to be president, not just the guy who keeps winning elections,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> OBSERVERS SAY IRVINE CO. COULD LAND DIRECT LINE TO WILSON;  </P> <P> POLITICS: SOME SEE TOO MANY PERSONAL AND POLITICAL TIES BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND  THE CANDIDATE TO DISMISS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A WILSON GUBERNATORIAL VICTORY.  </P> <P> If elected governor, Pete Wilson will have more than the usual reasons to  accept telephone calls from the Newport Beach headquarters of the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> The caller may be his former mayoral press secretary and campaign manager:  Larry Thomas, now the Irvine Co.'s vice president of corporate communications.  </P> <P> It may be another former campaign manager: Jack Flanigan, now the Irvine Co.'s  vice president of government relations.  </P> <P> Or it may be his friend, Donald L. Bren, the billionaire owner of the Irvine  Co. who last year hosted a Wilson fund-raiser in his home.  </P> <P> All three are at the top of a company that is widely considered one of the most  aggressive behind-the-scenes players in state government, where the single  stroke of a governor's pen can lead to millions of dollars in benefits -- or  costs -- to the company. And if Wilson is elected, some say, the company will  have easy access to the state's chief executive.  </P> <P> "They will get -- I'm not sure I'd like to say preferential treatment -- but  they get access," said a Republican fund-raiser, who asked not to be  identified. "They will get their telephone calls to the governor returned on  the first, rather than the fifth, try."  </P> <P> Observed Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who has received contributions  from and butted heads with the Irvine Co.: "I'd say the Irvine Co. is a major  player in California politics. I think they're even bigger (if Wilson is  elected), because there are personal relationships as well as political  relationships."  </P> <P> One of those relationships was underscored on Oct. 26, when the publicity-shy  Bren played host and co-chairman of a $400,000 Republican Party breakfast  fund-raiser at the Irvine Hyatt Hotel featuring President Bush.  </P> <P> "This is the county that is going to put Pete Wilson into the corner office of  the Capitol in Sacramento," Bren told the crowd.  </P> <P> Irvine Co. spokesman Thomas, however, argued that any close political and  personal ties to Wilson will not translate into special treatment from the  governor's suite.  </P> <P> "I can just tell you that the whole political playing field on which Pete has  played for 20 years is strewn with people who have supported his candidacy but  have found him to make judgments on individual issues that have disappointed  them," said Thomas. "I've known Pete Wilson for years, and Pete is  independent."  </P> <P> Wilson, who readily acknowledges that Bren is a political supporter and "a  friend," says the company's position on an issue won't be his guide as  governor.  </P> <P> "The test is: Is it coincident with or is it in opposition to the public  interest? If it is in opposition, then it doesn't go," he said.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co.'s interests in Sacramento are proportionate to its size: It  holds title to one-sixth of Orange County -- the largest private ownership in  any major American metropolitan area. As owner of about 10,000 apartments, the  company worked to kill legislation this year that would require landlords to  pay interest on security deposits. When its development rights were threatened  by a move to list two rare plants as as endangered plant species, the company  persuaded the Fish and Game Commission to overrule its own staff and deny  special protection for the flora.  </P> <P> Records show that the Irvine Co. paid lobbyists more than $250,000 over the  last two years to support or oppose 74 bills, 36 of which were signed into law.  </P> <P> The company also gave at least $125,000 to an initiative sponsored by Gov.  George Deukmejian that increased the gasoline sales tax by 9 cents a gallon to  fund transportation projects and freeways. And perhaps its biggest coup was  helping to convince a reluctant Legislature that southern Orange County needed  three private toll roads, 50% of which would run through Irvine Co. land.  </P> <P> In addition to lobbying, the company spends substantial sums on political  races. Since 1987, records show, it has donated more than $2 million to a  variety of local and state races. Although it is most closely aligned with the  Republican Party, the firm has made a point to extend its largess to powerful  Democrats such as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco).  </P> <P> So far this year in the governor's race, the company and its officials have  given at least $19,000 to the Wilson campaign. Those giving $1,000 include the  company itself, Bren, Thomas and Senior Vice President Gary H. Hunt, public  records show. Flanigan and his wife, Janet, each gave $2,000.  </P> <P> Records also show a number of Irvine Co. board members and their spouses  contributing to Wilson. They include Richard F. Alden and his wife, Marjorie;  Orange County developer Donald M. Koll and his wife, Dorothy; William McFarland  and his wife, Rose Marie; Raymond L. Watson; and Howard A. Marguleas and his  wife, Ardith.  </P> <P> In addition, Bren served as intermediary in the Wilson campaign by hosting an  $86,200 fund-raiser at his home late last year. And Flanigan has taken a  month's vacation to help the Republican Party get out the vote.  </P> <P> Two Irvine Co. board members and their families have given a total of $3,000 to  the Feinstein campaign, records show.  </P> <P> "Whoever is the next governor . . . we just want to be in the position to  advocate our position at the negotiating table when things are discussed," said  Jim Barich, the Irvine Co.'s senior director of government relations.  </P> <P> Thomas said that he and other Irvine Co. executives with past ties to Wilson  are supporting the Republican for personal reasons, and not because of their  affiliation with the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> "These are people who have known Wilson long before they knew Donald Bren,"  Thomas said of himself and Flanigan in particular. "The fact that we are all  here is not because we know Pete Wilson."  </P> <P> "I'm an old friend of Pete's and I'm a supporter of Pete's and an enthusiastic  one . . . but my involvement in the support of his candidacy is unrelated to  the Irvine Co." he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP IRVINE CO. OFFICIALS WITH TIES TO WILSON AND HIS CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> (Compiled by Times staff writer Ralph Frammolino)  </P> <P> Donald L. Bren, 58, owner of 93% of the Irvine Co., first joined political  forces with Pete Wilson in 1975, when Wilson was running for his second term as  San Diego mayor. Wilson faced bitter opposition from local developers, who were  angry at his forceful moves to impose controls on suburban sprawl.  </P> <P> Bren dined with Wilson in San Diego one night during the campaign and offered  his help, said one former Wilson aide who attended the meeting but declined to  be identified.  </P> <P> "He was the only developer in Southern California offering help," the former  aide said. "I remember being impressed by the fact that he was stepping up and  saying, 'You (Wilson) are on the right track with your philosophy of growth,  that it has to be managed."'  </P> <P> Bren also was among the inner circle of supporters who helped persuade Wilson  to abandon his campaign for governor in 1982 and instead focus on a successful  U.S. Senate race, an Irvine Co. spokesman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gary H. Hunt, 41, the Irvine Co.'s senior vice president for strategic planning  and corporate affairs, is a close friend of Wilson's general campaign manager,  George Gorton. Their personal relationship goes back to the early 1970s, when  both were young men living in Washington. At one point, Gorton said, when he  was between residences, Hunt allowed him to stay at his home for two weeks.  </P> <P> At the time, Gorton was working as national college director for President  Richard M. Nixon's Committee to Reelect the President. Later, after Gorton was  quoted in 1973 as saying he helped spy on radicals in 38 states, he was fired  from his job at the Interior Department and banished from Republican politics  by George Bush, then national party chairman.  </P> <P> A year later, Hunt played a crucial role in getting Gorton's career back on  track, giving him a favorable recommendation when Gorton was hired to be  assistant finance director of the Republican State Central Committee. Gorton,  credited with engineering Wilson's come-from-behind 1982 Senate victory, is  considered one of the politician's closest advisers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jack Flanigan, 45, the Irvine Co.'s liaison with state and federal officials,  got his start in state politics with Wilson. Party insiders say Flanigan is  behind Bren's political involvement and makes fund-raising telephone calls on  his behalf.  </P> <P> Then-Assemblyman Wilson hired Flanigan, then a San Diego college student, to be  his first summer intern in Sacramento. Flanigan worked out of a small office in  the top floor of the Capitol, answering phones and researching issues.  </P> <P> Flanigan, a self-professed "political junkie," was serving a tour of duty in  Vietnam when Wilson ran for San Diego mayor in 1971. But he had returned to  California and finished law school just in time to help his former boss with  the 1975 reelection campaign. He ran Wilson's unsuccessful 1978 gubernatorial  bid. Four years later, he took a six-week leave from his job at the CORO  Foundation in Los Angeles to travel around the state with Wilson during the  politician's successful Senate campaign.  </P> <P> Flanigan's younger brother, Terry, is Gov. George Deukmejian's appointment  secretary, responsible for overseeing judicial selections.  </P> <P> Larry Thomas, 43, the Irvine Co.'s vice president of corporate communications,  first met Wilson while working as a political reporter for the San Diego Union.  After Wilson was elected San Diego mayor in 1971, Thomas became his press  secretary. He kept thepost until 1977 -- six years that were some of Wilson's  most dynamic at City Hall, as he pushed controls on growth, construction of a  trolley and redevelopment of San Diego's seedy downtown.  </P> <P> Thomas left the mayoral payroll to be press secretary for Wilson's ill-fated  1978 gubernatorial campaign, during which he met Bren. After the campaign,  Thomas left San Diego altogether for a private industry job with the Bechtel  Corp. in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Thomas returned to politics in 1982, when Gov. Deukmejian appointed him as  gubernatorial press secretary. In 1986, he left state employment to run  Deukmejian's successful reelection campaign. Then Thomas went to Washington to  be press secretary for Vice President Bush. He kept that job for three months,  then took his present job with the Irvine Co. in mid-1987.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: 'REGGAE SUNSPLASH' FINISHES WITHOUT A SPLASH  </P> <P> Talk about a case of skankus interruptus.  </P> <P>  Steel Pulse was building momentum for a triumphant finale to its headlining  set at the "Reggae Sunsplash" concert at the Greek Theatre on Saturday. But the  English band abruptly concluded its performance at 8 p.m. sharp -- exactly four  hours after the first of the weekend's two sold-out shows began.  </P> <P> The audience didn't seem to mind the anticlimactic ending -- there wasn't even  much of an uproar over the lack of an encore. In fact, Steel Pulse had to vie  for the audience's attention with a beach ball bouncing around in the crowd and  the dude scaling a 60-foot light tower.  </P> <P> That was pretty much the tone of the day: The young, racially mixed,  party-minded crowd was clearly out to enjoy itself at the first event of the  Greek summer season, whether milling about and dancing in the aisles near the  stage or strolling out to sample to the T-shirt, crafts and food booths in a  parking area adjoining the theater.  </P> <P> Also on the bill were singers Sugar Minott, Half Pint, Sophia George and Marcia  Griffiths. The "Sunsplash" tour is due at San Diego's Open Air Theatre on  Thursday and the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on Friday. DON SNOWDEN  </P></p>

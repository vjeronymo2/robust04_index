			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Major warns rebel MPs not to risk Tory legacy: Rallying call for united front at conference MR JOHN MAJOR warned rebel Conservative MPs last night that a display of disunity at this week's party conference would put at risk the legacy of 14 years of Tory government. 'We have got to pull ourselves together and we have to start this week at this conference,' the prime minister told a gathering of 150 Conservative election agents. He coupled his appeal for unity with a wide-ranging attack on the opposition parties, and a pledge that the Tories would fight next year's crucial European parliamentary elections on a 'clear and distinctive' anti-federalist manifesto. Mr Major also unveiled moves to strengthen the party organisation by setting up a Pounds 250,000 fund to help cash-strapped constituency associations to retain agents threatened with redundancy. He was rewarded with enthusiastic applause and a declaration of '100 per cent loyalty to the prime minister and the government' by Ms Judy Jamieson, chairman of the national society of Conservative agents and formerly the party's agent in the Christchurch by-election in July. Mr Major's rallying call followed earlier warnings from other senior Conservatives to dissident MPs not to undermine attempts to rebuild support for Mr Major at the conference. Sir Basil Feldman, chairman of the national union, which organises the conference, said grass roots Tories were 'fed up' with disunity in the parliamentary party. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, said members wanted to 'draw a line' under the disagreements of the past 12 months and 'get behind John Major'. Leading dissident MPs appeared unwilling to challenge the demand for unity, which was supported over the weekend by Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister. Mrs Teresa Gorman, an arch-critic of Mr Major, said she wanted him to change course, but it would be 'completely inappropriate' to change the leader at the moment. Her comments reflected a widespread view among rightwing critics of Mr Major that no potential challenger to his leadership could win this year. However, the nervousness among party leaders was illustrated by more than usually vigorous vetting of potential speakers in an attempt to head off criticism from the floor of conference. Some ministers said the tactic could backfire by provoking a disruptive demonstration by representatives excluded from the rostrum. The most likely flashpoint is the government's proposal to impose value added tax on heating fuel, which attracted 25 critical resolutions from constituency parties. None of the resolutions will be debated. Eve of the conference, Page 12 Joe Rogaly, Page 18</p>

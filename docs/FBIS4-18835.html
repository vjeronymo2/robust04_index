			<p>BFN     [Text] In Beijing, Edouard Balladur, the French Prime  Minister, remains unperturbed at Chinese provocations. In the  middle of the French prime minister's visit the police have  arrested another dissident, Xu Wenli, a leading figure of the  opposition and a known francophile. Our reporter asked Mr.  Balladur about the arrest; however, the prime minister shied  away from any direct comment.    [Begin Balladur recording] I emphasized the importance that  France, the birthplace of human rights, attaches to the respect  of human rights in all its relations with different countries  around the world. It is quite true that to do this we must take  account of everyone's traditions, and of the rhythm of evolution  appropriate to each country. Moreover, it is true that economic  and commercial progress, which increasingly tends to unite the  world, is accompanied by what I would call an intellectual and  cultural unification, so that a sort of community of the spirit  grows around the world from which no country can entirely opt  out. It indeed seemed useful to me to have a more restricted  conversation with my Chinese counterpart. I have one more word  to add, and this is all I will say: on this subject, efficiency  is more often better served by discretion than by publicity.  [end recording]    Chinese President Jiang Zemin has officially been invited to  France on a date of his choosing. According to Balladur, this  invitation marks the new era in the two countries' relations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zvornik, March 1 (TANJUG) -- The army of the Bosnian  Serb Republic (VRS) continues investigating all details  presented by NATO in connection with the air incident in the  region of Banja Luka on Monday morning, TANJUG learned on  Tuesday from VRS sources. The VRS for the time being has no new  elements about the incident, in which, according to NATO, four  planes were downed.    VRS sources reiterated the categorical stand of the VRS  General Staff that no VRS planes had taken off from Banja Luka  airfield on Monday, and stressed that U.N. military observers  had been deployed at the military base near Banja Luka, the only  of its kind in the Serb Republic (R.S.) for quite some time.    The duty of the U.N. military observers is in fact to  monitor  the implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolution  banning flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina, the same sources  recalled.    An element which could help the effort to establish whose  the  four downed planes were could be the report carried by  Muslim-held Radio Sarajevo on Monday that Croatian planes had  fired missiles at targets in the area of Novi Travnik, central  Bosnia, on Monday. The given time of the attack coincided with  the time of the air incident given by NATO.    Although the circumstances in which the NATO action was  launched remain unknown, as does also the identity of the planes  which NATO says have been shot down, foreign media rushed to  accuse the Bosnian Serbs, alleging that the planes were theirs.</p>

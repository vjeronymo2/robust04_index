			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (6): Contacts spur trade - Eastern Europe GIVEN THAT, until recently, the Cyprus Communist Party (Akel) was assured of winning one-third of the vote in any election, it is not surprising that Greek Cypriots from all walks of life have a network of contacts in eastern Europe. One of the ways that Akel retained voter loyalty as the island grew wealthier was by offering scholarships to eastern European universities to bright offspring of its supporters. As a result, a sizeable number of Greek Cypriots are well-placed to offer their services to local companies seeking opportunities in the former Soviet Union and its satellites. Some of the infrastructure is already in place. Cyprus is a shareholder in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, though its stake amounts to just 1 per cent. It has signed double taxation treaties with all the eastern European countries except Poland and Albania. There are direct flights to their capitals since Cyprus has long been a popular destination for tourists from eastern Europe. Several Cypriot companies are looking for service sector niches in which to operate. 'They're prepared to invest time and energy in something that might well be overlooked or dismissed by larger foreign companies, even though it offers promising medium or long-term prospects,' says a foreign banker. Over the past year, executives from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and Kazakhstan have been attending two-week management seminars in Nicosia, organised by Ioannou Zampelas, the local member of Coopers and Lybrand. Most of them hold senior jobs in medium-sized factories, struggling to make the transition from a command system to a new economic reality. Because these enterprises have training budgets, they are able to cover the cost of a seminar abroad, according to Mr Nicos Nicolaides of Ioannou Zampelas. 'It's much cheaper for them to come to Cyprus than go to London or Paris. It's also a less intimidating place for people who've never been abroad before,' he says. The seminars, held in English with simultaneous translation into Russian, focus on explaining essential western business techniques, from marketing and incentive schemes to cash flow forecasts and stock level controls. Principles of banking, finance and insurance are also covered. 'We thought we'd mainly be doing accounting but found a much broader approach was needed. We've grown more flexible, getting into more discussion both in the seminars and during the socialising afterward,' says Mr Dimitri Khenkin, the company's Russian specialist. In the meantime, the Louis Organisation, the largest travel agency on the island, is expanding into Russia, Poland and Bulgaria. The opening up of eastern Europe came just as Louis, which owns a chain of 30 hotels, plus three cruise ships and a catering and duty-free operation, was starting to look for new business outside Cyprus. 'It's difficult for a company like ours, big here but small by international standards, to go into western Europe. But we can make our mark in eastern Europe,' says Mr Stelios Kiliaris, the company's financial director. Louis has signed joint venture agreements to manage duty-free shops and provide catering services, both at Warsaw's new international airport, and at Vnukovo airport in Moscow. The company is also taking over management of a 700-bed hotel complex at Sudol, near Moscow. In Bulgaria, Louis is cashing in on local enthusiasm for all things American by launching a fast-food restaurant in the centre of Sofia. This, it is hoped, will be the first in a chain of hamburger outlets named Americana. 'Our total outlay in eastern Europe is not as much as you'd think ' well under Dollars 10m,' says Mr Kiliaris. Still, negotiating each deal proved a long drawn-out process, according to Mr Nicos Antoniades, a Minsk-trained engineer in charge of Louis's eastern European activities. Also in Bulgaria, Mr Nikos Vassiliou, a Nicosia-based technical consultant is putting together a joint venture intended to revive a plant at a large collective farm outside Sofia that produces electricity from cow manure. The fertiliser and bio-gas installation at Podgumar state farm, completed six years ago at a cost of Dollars 3m, was intended to be an environmental showpiece. But, according to Mr Vassiliou: 'It only worked for about six months and now it's become a pollution hazard because of the huge build-up of slurry.' Mr Vassiliou is looking for Dollars 1.6m to cover reviving and expanding the plant, partly from the European Community investment partners programme, with the remainder to be raised through supplier credits and a commercial loan. 'Opportunities are there in privatisation. With a fairly small amount of capital you can turn around a semi-bankrupt enterprise in a short time. It would take about six months for Podgumar to become profitable,' Mr Vassiliou says. At the same time, Mr Vassiliou found himself running an informal employment agency, finding Greek- and English-speaking Bulgarians for jobs available in Cyprus in hotels and factories, the two areas where the island's labour shortage is most sorely felt. About 600 skilled workers are now registered with Mr Vassiliou's office. After a government-led trip to Russia for Cypriot businessmen, he is also receiving applications from Pontians, ethnic Greeks from the southern republics of the former Soviet Union. 'We can offer them contracts to fill a specific vacancy, usually for a limited period,' he says. 'If their skills fit well, it can be longer. One of our successes was finding Bulgarian tobacco workers for the British American Tobacco factory here.'</p>

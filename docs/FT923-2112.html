			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Aux armes, citoyens: Andrew Adonis wants a British referendum on Maastricht I AM convinced there is something in the British psyche that despises democracy. It is not just cynicism about politics: we want to be led and governed, and short of a poll tax will submit to the most harebrained nonsense coming from a minister. Yet watching the citoyens prepare to exercise their sovereignty, even I am amazed that the British public should be so blase at the democratic enormity of enacting the Maastricht treaty without even a semblance of popular consent. To John Major, it is a special British quality. 'Uniquely in the Community,' he boasted to an assemblage of Eurocrats in London last week, 'we in Britain will scrutinise the (Maastricht) Bill line by line, clause by clause and vote on it in the same way.' But 'We in Britain' are the 651 MPs. In case any of the applauding throng missed a heartbeat by thinking that we might include us - you and me - the prime minister spelt it out: 'I believe myself that this - Parliament's unique scrutiny - is a more effective scrutiny than referenda where many votes may be cast on matters wholly unrelated to the Treaty.' Were the issue not so grave, we might be forgiven for thinking this another of Major's elaborate jokes - you know, like 'there is going to be no devaluation.' One can just picture the Community's leaders wise-cracking over a jolly week-end of treaty making. ('Submit it to the people? Ha ha] Who knows what might they might be thinking about in the polling booth] Come to think of it, isn't that true of elections too, Helmut?') Other jokes in the same speech give credence to the charitable view. Such as: 'The Maastricht Treaty is a product of compromises by 12 nations.' Silly us, who thought it was 12 governments who negotiated the treaty, subject to the consent of their nations afterwards. To be fair, Major's slip was Freudian. For in Britain, the all too serious truth is that the government is the nation so far as European Community affairs are concerned. However long they waffle on about the lines and clauses, MPs are not able to change a dot or comma of Maastricht. It would fall if they did. They can give only a straight vote for or against - which makes ratification an ideally simple issue to put to a referendum. If the French people give them the chance, it is a foregone conclusion that Britain's MPs will vote 'yes'. Whisper it not, but many will cast their votes on matters wholly unrelated to the Treaty. Three-line whips are not the best incentives for objective scrutiny. Some Tories opposed to the treaty will vote for it out of party loyalty; others in the hope of promotion; a few so as not to endanger that constituency favour or foreign trip. True, we had a general election. But with all three parties agreed on Maastricht, it offered precisely zero choice on a single European currency and common Community foreign and security policy. The parties engaged in a conspiracy of silence. So British ratification of Maastricht will be no more than Major assenting to his own treaty. Only a referendum will prevent that democratic fraud. Maastricht is among the most significant changes to the UK constitution this century. Parliament should not agree to it without a positive expression of the electorate's will. Since the election manifestly failed to provide one, a referendum is imperative. Forget the 'parliamentary sovereignty' wails. If we are indeed a democracy, MPs have no moral right to reshape our constitution if they have good reason to believe a majority of citizens may be opposed to them. Imagine the outcry if, in response to the current titbits, the government next year tried to abolish the monarchy. Yet a currency union is of far more constitutional significance than the survival of the monarchy - as this week's turmoil should have brought home to the meanest mortgagee. Moreover, the referendum is not foreign to Britain. Internationally, it is increasingly employed as a democratic hurdle for major constitutional change. There are only four democracies in the world which have never used one for that purpose: India, Israel, Japan and - did you guess? - the Netherlands. I would vote 'yes' should we be asked our view. Britain is already part of a federation, and Maastricht, for all its shortcomings, is necessary to strengthen and codify it. Nothing, though, is more calculated to generate bitter disillusion with the Community, even to destroy it, than to impose it on the voters by royal decree.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza -- Attorney Khalid al-Qidrah, head of the  Cairo talks Legal Committee, has said that it has been agreed  that all Palestinians who were registered in the Gaza Strip, the  Jericho area, and the West Bank up to 4 June 1967 will be  repatriated to their homeland and families.    Al-Qidrah said that the agreement does not include only  those  who resided in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the  occupation and emigrated, but also those who lived there before  the occupation. Agreement has been reached on the repatriation  of these Palestinians as well.    Al-Qidrah noted that if a resident of the Gaza Strip or  Jericho was traveling, studying, or employed abroad when the  occupation took place, he has the right to return in accordance  with the Declaration of Principles accord signed on 13 September.    Al-Qidrah said that talks over the timetable of this  repatriation will be held within the coming days.</p>

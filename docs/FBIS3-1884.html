In an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency, Koleshikov  stressed, "all kinds of the Russian armed forces without  exception will be reorganized in the near future for the purpose  of the reduction of the Army."    However, he continued, so far the Defense Ministry is not  prepared "to switch over to a different structural system," he  believed that any reorganization inevitably entails the  destruction of the command system which cannot be allowed.    The colonel-general also said Russia plans to have about  thirty military bases in other former Soviet republics, some of  the bases would be created from the existing Russian divisions  deployed in some of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)  republics, such as the 201th Division in Tajikistan.    In other places, as for instance in Azerbaijan, the base  would be created around anti-missile warning systems, Koleshikov  said.    He said Russia plans no military bases in Ukraine, where the  Black Sea Fleet will have its special status, he did not exclude  that Russia's 14th Army in Moldova's breakaway Dniester region  will also be reorganized into a military base, but added that it  well could be pulled out.    According to the chief of General Staff, almost all the  republics of the former Soviet Union have themselves expressed  willingness to have Russian military bases on their territory.    The three Baltic states are an exception, the  colonel-general  pointed out.</p>

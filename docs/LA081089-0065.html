			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> AUDIENCE IN EARTHA'S ORBIT AT THE CINEGRILL  </P> <P> The name, with its sensual resonances, still fits, even after all these years.  Eartha Kitt: the suggestion of deep primal energies connected to a playful  feline association. The perfect appellation for a performer whose almost  shamanistic earthiness is energized with flashes of cat-like high voltage.  </P> <P> Returning to the Southland for the first time in two years, Kitt's  opening-night performance at the Cinegrill Tuesday night was a classic  presentation of the original Cat Woman on the prowl. Looking almost as lithe  and supple as she did in her early years as a dancer, Kitt stalked around the  tiny stage restlessly, pausing occasionally to capture a member of the audience  with a penetrating gaze, then moving on with a hearty, growling burst of  laughter.  </P> <P> She sang many of her big songs from the '50s: "C'est Si Bon," "I Wanna Be  Evil," "An Old-Fashioned Girl." Each typified her enormously successful  characterization of a worldly wise woman who knew the value of a dollar -- and  then some.  </P> <P> But her best work took place on other numbers -- especially the medleys of  "Guess Who I Saw Today"/"Could I Leave You?" and "The Blues"/"St. Louis Blues"  -- in which she displayed her rich skills as a chanteuse in the archetypal  French style. Like Edith Piaf, Kitt is a superb actress and storyteller. Her  dramatic sense of timing -- with an occasional pause in the rhythm and a  penetrating flash of her eyes -- even made songs like "I'm Still Here" and "I  Will Survive" something more than bitter reminiscences of past glories.  </P> <P> Clearly, Eartha Kitt is doing a lot more than surviving. Far from the one-note  characterization that first made her reputation, she now is a consummate  cabaret performer, one of the best in the world. Her two-week engagement is a  must-attend for anyone who cares to experience the glory of a mature and  exhilarating artist at the peak of her skills.  </P> <P> Kitt continues at the Cinegrill tonight through Saturday and Tuesday through  next Thursday.DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

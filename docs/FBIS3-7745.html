			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Egyutteles Chairman Miklos Duray by Anna </F> Vargova; place and date not given: "A Power and Financial  Struggle"]    [Text] [Vargova] Mr. Chairman, J. Carnogursky said in an  interview for SLOVENSKY DENNIK last week that it would be no  problem to recall the government. The main problem would be to  form a government that was not dependent on the votes of the  Hungarian deputies. It seems that, at the moment, you and the  opposition cannot find common ground....    [Duray] Your observation is correct from both the political  and the tactical points of view. If the participation in the  government of a specific political structure is not being given  consideration, there is not sufficient reason for talking about  support for a government in which it will not be represented. A  vote of no confidence in V. Meciar is not connected with support  for another government. This issue is associated with the  political legitimacy of the parties in parliament, of which  none, apart from the Slovak National Party, had an independent  state in its program.    The fact that the government of the current prime minister  has abused its power is something else. It wants to place  economically loyal people around itself--loyal on account of  their share in privatization. This is in fact causing cracks in  the opposition, which is also interested in a share of  privatization so that it can reward its supporters with "gifts"  from it. This is partially a power and partially a financial  struggle.    [Vargova] Mr. Duka-Zolyomi has emphasized that, if a grand  coalition was discussed at the opposition's talks last year, it  was a grand coalition in the broadest sense of the word. Does  this mean that you were given specific promises?    [Duray] No one discussed a grand coalition with us. We  declared our readiness to take part in such a government, but we  received no offer. If I remember correctly, a grand coalition  has been on the agenda since the beginning of last December,  and, since that time, it has been clear that no consideration is  being given to our participation in it.    [Vargova] If the situation were to change, which department  would you be interested in?    [Duray] We are prepared for certain posts, including  ministerial ones, in health care, the economy, education, and  culture. We have experts capable of filling such posts, and I  am convinced that they will do better than the current  government.</p>

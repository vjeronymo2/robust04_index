			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Mitsui and Carlyle in Dollars 1m Asian ventures link Mitsui, a leading Japanese trading company, will invest Dollars 1m in the international division of the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment group, to take part in joint projects in Vietnam, China and the former Soviet Union. Mitsui, which will acquire 10 per cent of the international arm of the US group, said its extensive network in China and South East Asia had attracted Carlyle. The investment group holds equity holdings in companies covering activities such as defence, telecommunications, property and services, and sees new opportunities for investments in the Asian region and Russia. Mitsui, which has 45 joint ventures in China, and has several offices in Vietnam, in turn hopes Carlyle's extensive political links will create business opportunities in the US. The chairman of Carlyle, founded in 1987, is Mr Frank Carlucci, secretary of defence in the Reagan administration; and Mr James Baker, former US secretary of state, is a partner. The international division is led by Mr Alton Keel, a former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan. Mitsui said it would not deal in defence or military-related equipment, but intended to help defence-linked companies suffering from a fall in demand to shift to civilian businesses.</p>

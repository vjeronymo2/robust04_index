			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, today received Vitaliy Churkin, special  envoy to the Russian president for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  talks were attended by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. Churkin  expressed interest in Bosnia-Herzegovina's stands regarding the  cease-fire with the Serbian aggressor and the possible  participation of a Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation at the  negotiations on the political solution to the crisis.    Izetbegovic informed Churkin of the positions he had also  presented to the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian  envoy said that he expected Serbs to withdraw from the Gorazde  protected zone, something that Izetbegovic had set as a  condition for negotiations to continue. The Bosnian side has no  objections to the Serbian population remaining in the Gorazde  region, but only if the people involved are those who had lived  on the said territory before the war. It is known that the  Serbian aggressor forces are trying to colonize the Gorazde  region, which was also pointed out to [words indistinct].</p>

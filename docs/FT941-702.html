			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / People: Insurance companies pick new chairmen - Economic Insurance Allen Sykes, a former finance director of insurance brokers Willis Corroon, has been appointed chairman of Economic Insurance, which was the subject of a Pounds 11.5m management buy-out at the end of last year. Sykes, 62, is probably best known as the joint author with AJ Merrett of one of the standard works on project finance, The finance and analysis of capital projects which was first published in 1963. He joined Unilever as a management trainee in 1955, and has worked for RTZ, Willis Faber and Consolidated Gold Fields, where he was a managing director at the time of its 1989 takeover by Hanson. The management of Economic Insurance bought the company from Hafnia, the Danish insurer, with the backing of Candover Investments and Causeway Capital. It specialises in providing 'own label' insurance products for a number of insurance brokers as well as marketing policies under its own name. Sykes replaces John Sclater, 53, chairman of Hill Samuel and Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust, who had been chairman since 1992. Economic's new management team has sharply reduced the number of products offered and has transformed the company's financial fortunes. Having reported a net loss of Pounds 5.2m on gross premiums of Pounds 39.5m in 1992, it made a net profit of Pounds 4m on premiums of Pounds 41.7m in the year to end-December 1993. The company, which hopes to get a stockmarket quote within the next two to three years, expects to add another non-executive director to its board.</p>

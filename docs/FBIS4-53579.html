			<p>BFN     [Text] All foreigners participating in the East Timor  Conference will be barred from entering the country. This was  the order given by the president to the Departments of Justice  and Foreign Affairs.    Ramos said that the entry of foreign nationals attending the  conference on East Timor is inimical to national interests.    The eight foreigners who will be banned from entering the  country are: Jose Ramos Horta, Carmel Budjardjo, Jose Gutierrez,  Lim-Siou Liong, A. Perera, Maria Alkatiri, Juan Feberer, and  Jaoa Carrascalao. They will not be given visas. Visas already  issued will be canceled, while those foreigners already in the  country may be deported. Only foreign exchange students will be  allowed to attend the conference.</p>

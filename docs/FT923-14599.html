			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (29): Price quotations with - Case Study / Cambridge Lee, Commodity Company just three keystrokes / Installation success after initial cost shock EVEN IF a specific cost figure is quoted for a project, unexpected price increases can occur. If you are lucky, these will surface early on, before too much work has been done. If not, you may find yourself with a partially written system, and a bill for its completion well in excess of your original budget, writes Michael Powell. Cambridge Lee, of West Byfleet, is an importer and distributor of commodities, such as non-ferrous metals and copper tubing. It uses the Systems Union SunAccount package on its Novell networked machines. The company needed a quotations system to tie in with the SunAccount system, which was already in use. A software supplier which had quoted Pounds 25,000 for the project was chosen. However, after four days' work, the quote was increased to Pounds 100,000. Although this was reduced in negotiation with the supplier's sales department, the figure was still more than Pounds 50,000, so the supplier was abandoned. Finance director David Mulholland had dealt with the replacement software house, Sapphire, in Europe - 'they had done a very good job. They quoted Pounds 20,000 for this project. A couple of subsequent additions cost another Pounds 4,000.' The development language proposed was DataEase, a relational database product, which, according to its suppliers, DataEase UK, enjoys the biggest market share in the UK, with 250,000 users, and is used by 80 per cent of top companies. DataEase UK and Sapphire were de-merged at the end of 1991, Sapphire retaining its position as an authorised consultancy for DataEase. Cambridge Lee's business involves a lot of telephone sales. Every contact entails quotation and negotiation of price. 'The system brings up a quotation in three keystrokes,' says Mr Mulholland. 'This data is saved and the customer's history updated. If the quotation is accepted, it becomes a booking.' At this point, the customer will specify the actual quantities and make-up of the order. This information is passed to Cambridge Lee's transport manager, who arranges transport instructions by modem link. The final data is then exported to the Sun Accounts system, where invoices are generated. The development of the DataEase system took 55 man-days and is described by Mr Mulholland as 'quite sophisticated . . .it involves quotations management, automatic pricing, and movements.' One of the company's staff who is familiar with DataEase adds reports to the system but does not make major changes. The system is stable, so there is little need for further help from its supplier. Although Cambridge Lee has a maintenance contract with Sapphire (at a rate of 10 per cent of contract value), David Mulholland sees little need for support. 'The person who wrote the system was our support, but after the first few weeks there was little need to ask Sapphire for any kind of advice. Their hotline people aren't familiar with our system, so they can't always help anyway if we do have a problem.' The outcome for Cambridge Lee has been a successful system. However, had the company not been warned very early on of the proposed cost over-run, it could have been much less fortunate. Many companies have found themselves backed into a corner, unable to avoid increased charges for the completion of vital systems, or to go elsewhere for a lower price.</p>

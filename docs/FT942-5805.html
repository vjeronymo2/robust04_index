			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Worries on inflation sent bonds tumbling and led to another sharp setback in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The firm opening of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,970 was described by traders as follow-through buying after the late recovery towards the close of business on Tuesday. The improvement in European bond markets also did much to boost sentiment in the first hour of trading. However, the decline in German bonds following worse than anticipated output figures brought a reversal in the fortunes of June, and the contract came under heavy selling pressure, pulling the underlying cash market lower. A brief respite over the lunch time period was undermined by the release of US purchasing managers' data. This led to renewed selling and the contract fell to the day's low of 2,899. At one point June was trading at a discount of 30 points to cash. June ended at 2,908, down 51 from its previous close and around 27 points below its fair value premium to cash of about minus 3 points. Volume was 18,278 lots. Turnover in traded options improved to 36,389 contracts, with most of the sector's activity concentrated in the index options. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 18,189 lots and the Euro FT-SE 7,433 lots. Marks and Spencer was the most active stock option, with 1,417 contracts dealt.</p>

This interest rate is established quarterly by the Internal Revenue Service. This document also sets forth the interest rates for valuing unfunded vested benefits for premium purposes for plan years beginning in November 1993 through January 1994. These interest rates are established pursuant to section 4006 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The effect of these amendments is to advise plan sponsors and pension practitioners of these new interest rates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> January 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0065 forcenewline --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Harold J. Ashner, Assistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD).

Under the single-employer program, the PBGC also collects employer liability from those persons described in ERISA section 4062(a). Under ERISA section 4007 and 29 CFR 2610.7, the interest rate to be charged on unpaid premiums is the rate established under section 6601 of the Internal Revenue Code (``Code''). Similarly, under 29 CFR 2622.7, the interest rate to be credited or charged with respect to overpayments or underpayments of employer liability is the section 6601 rate. These interest rates are published by the PBGC in appendix A to the premium regulation and appendix A to the employer liability regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Internal Revenue Service has announced that for the quarter beginning January 1, 1994, the interest charged on the underpayment of taxes will be at a rate of 7 percent. Accordingly, the PBGC is amending appendix A to 29 CFR part 2610 and appendix A to 29 CFR part 2622 to set forth this rate for the January 1, 1994, through March 31, 1994, quarter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii)(II), in determining a single-employer plan's unfunded vested benefits for premium computation purposes, plans must use an interest rate equal to 80% of the annual yield on 30-year Treasury securities for the month preceding the beginning of the plan year for which premiums are being paid. Under &sect;2610.23(b)(1) of the premium regulation, this value is determined by reference to 30-year Treasury constant maturities as reported in Federal Reserve Statistical Releases G.13 and H.15. The PBGC publishes these rates in appendix B to the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PBGC publishes these monthly interest rates in appendix B on a quarterly basis to coincide with the publication of the late payment interest rate set forth in appendix A. (The PBGC publishes the appendix A rates every quarter, regardless of whether the rate has changed.) Unlike the appendix A rate, which is determined prospectively, the appendix B rate is not known until a short time after the first of the month for which it applies. Accordingly, the PBGC is hereby amending appendix B to part 2610 to add the vested benefits valuation rates for plan years beginning in November 1993 through January 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The appendices to 29 CFR parts 2610 and 2622 do not prescribe the interest rates under these regulations. Under both regulations, the appendix A rates are the rates determined under section 6601(a) of the Code. The interest rates in appendix B to part 2610 are prescribed by ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii)(II) and &sect;2610.23(b)(1) of the regulation. These appendices merely collect and republish the interest rates in a convenient place. Thus, the interest rates in the appendices are informational only. Accordingly, the PBGC finds that notice of and public comment on these amendments would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. For the above reasons, the PBGC also believes that good cause exists for making these amendments effective immediately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PBGC has determined that none of these actions is a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866, because they will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because no general notice of proposed rulemaking is required for these amendments, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 29 CFR Part 2610 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Employee benefit plans, Penalties, Pension insurance, Pensions, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

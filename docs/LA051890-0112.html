			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIDS TESTS AGAIN URGED FOR TRANSFUSION  PATIENTS  </P> <P> The Hospital Council of Southern California and the Los Angeles County Medical  Assn. on Thursday reiterated earlier recommendations that people who received  blood transfusions between 1978 and June, 1985, have their blood tested for  AIDS antibodies.  </P> <P> At a news conference, the two organizations announced "The AIDS Notification  Campaign," designed to increase early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus  infection, the cause of AIDS.  </P> <P> "With the recent findings that early diagnosis and AZT therapy can prolong the  life of HIV-infected patients, we feel that everyone who received transfusions  during that time should now be tested," David Langness, vice president of the  hospital council, said in a prepared statement. "This is especially important  for children, who could see major advancement in the treatment of AIDS in their  lifetime."  </P></p>

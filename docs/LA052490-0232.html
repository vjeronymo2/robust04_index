			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> DRUG PROGRAM SITE OPPOSED  </P> <P> The Board of Directors, responding to a query by Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los  Angeles), unanimously voted Tuesday to reject a proposal to house a drug  rehabilitation program in a federally owned building on Green Street east of  Lake Avenue.  </P> <P> "It's a neighborhood of smaller businesses -- antique stores, tailors,  restaurants -- and it's surrounded by residences," Director William Thomson  said.  </P> <P> "It ought not to be used for institutional purposes."  </P> <P> Roybal, who represents part of Pasadena and is a member of the House  Appropriations Committee, had sought the city's reaction to a plan to let  Phoenix House, a New York-based drug treatment program, take over the vacant  building at 1030 E. Green St.  </P> <P> The U.S. General Services Administration has proposed using $2 million in  federal funds to rehabilitate the building for the program, but owners of  neighborhood businesses have objected.  </P> <P> The final decision rests with federal authorities.  </P></p>

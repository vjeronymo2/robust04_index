			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUMAN EMBRYOS CUSTODY CASE  </P> <P> I am disturbed by Judge Young's ruling. I feel that his verdict, hinging on the  controversial and yet un-codified statement that "human life begins at  conception," is irresponsible and exceeds his legal parameters. I concur with  the ex-husband, Junior Davis, that the key issue in the case has to do with  whether the man should be compelled to father any number of children against  his will, especially subsequent to his divorce.  </P> <P> Even if he is absolved of financial obligation for these potential children (a  dilemma which Judge Young avoided, despite his 57-page decision), Junior Davis  undoubtedly will be bound emotionally. As husband, he and his wife would share  the decision about how many children to have, if any. Now, the court has  usurped his rights.  </P> <P> I applaud pro-choice activists for aligning themselves with Mr. Davis; it  demonstrates they are consistent in their efforts to preserve reproductive  freedom in this country, sensitive to the rights of both genders. For Judge  Young to term these clusters of cells "children" is sentimentally manipulative,  and stretches both the scientific and dictionary definitions of the word  "children." Children exist in the open air, not in test tubes.  </P> <P> BEN ROSENFELD  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

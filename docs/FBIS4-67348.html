			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Ailian [2799 1947 5571] </F>   [Text] Grassland is one of China's six primary resources,  totalling 6 billion mu in area (400 million hectares), amounting  to 40 percent of the total area of the country. China's  grasslands are not only extensive, but they are widespread,  stretching from 310 to 610 longitude. China's grasslands are  divided into 17 major types, over 30 subtypes, and over 1,000  specific varieties where more than 7,000 species of natural  pasture grasses and feed plants grow. Within China's  21,000-kilometer borderline, 14,000 are on grasslands. Most of  these grasslands are on the frontier in remote areas where  diverse minority peoples live, and much of it ancient and poor.    The protection, practical utilization, and development of  grassland resources are not only of strategic economic  importance, but also of strategic importance for strengthening  the solidarity of the people, turning poverty into riches,  strengthening border defenses, administering the national  territory, and protecting and improving the ecological  environment.    1.113 billion mu of China's 6 billion mu of grasslands are  southern mountain grasslands or grazing lands, and in the north  there are 378 million mu of grasslands, more than half of which,  on average, are not in use. About 400 million mu of grazing  lands are arid or summertime pasturage not yet fully developed  for use, and over 1 billion more are depleted grassland that  need to be renewed to greatly raise their level of productivity.  Although the utilization of China's grasslands is presently in a  period of transition in the level of productivity and method of  management and utilization, moving away from the natural grazing  stage to one of intensified management, they are still largely  being plundered by the old style of grazing. Grassland resources  have not been used to their fullest advantage and have not yet  reached full production potential, and their present level of  production is very low. In 1989, livestock production per 100 mu  of grassland was one-twentieth of that of the U.S., one-tenth  that of Austria, and one-eightieth that of New Zealand.    The low productivity of China's grasslands does not arise  from lack of actual natural resources, but from historical  social and circumstantial causes, mainly:    1. Poor, unconstructive and backward management of  grasslands  for pasturage has caused grasslands to recede markedly.  Grassland laws and protective controls are weak, and more than  100 million mu of grassland has been destroyed through  exploitation in recent decades. Grassland management has for a  long time been a practice of "eating from the big pot", and the  management, construction, and utilization rights,  responsibilities and benefits have not been driven home to the  people, and that's why there has been an increase in  over-grazing. Grasslands have been simply used and not  replenished for a long time, and for decades, for every yuan of  annual output from every mu of grassland, only 2 or 3 fen have  been re-invested. Being unable to make ends meet has led to  predatory management and relentless disappearance of grasslands  which have turned to sand and salt, causing the depletion of  over 1 billion mu of grassland. Grass production is down to  two-thirds or one-half of what it was in the 1950's, hastening  the loss of grasslands and wetlands, and increasing the hazards  of sandstorms and pestilence.    2. Although the water and temperature conditions of mountain  grasslands and grazing areas in the south are good, traditional  farming mentality hinders the advance of efficient grass and  pasturing technology and methodologies, and progress has been  made in only a few places, while in most areas resources are  still being wasted. In many places grass on mountain slopes has  been removed to plant cereal crops, causing loss of wetlands,  ecological damage, and bringing poverty to the mountain and the  people, or creating a situation comparable to going begging with  a gold cup.    3. Damage caused by mixed farming and grazing of mountain  grasslands and grazing areas in the north has been serious.  Although conditions are good for grasses and excellent for mixed  farming and grazing, the attitude of favoring farming over  grazing, and using grasslands for cereal crops has been  detrimental to the development of grasslands, such as on the  Sanjiang plain, the loess plateau, and the Huanghai coastal  grasslands where the land has been turned to sand and salt, the  ecological environment has been damaged, and use of grassland  resources has been counter-productive.    A national program for the development of grassland has been  formulated to improve grasslands in order to meet the demand for  wool, milk, beef and mutton, the needs for economic development  of grassland areas and management of the national territory. A  policy for a ten-year goal for grassland development has been  formulated to integrate key-point development with overall  administration, construction and management, and to make full  use of the advantages in the north and south. Along with  enforcement of national grassland laws and a compensatory  contract responsibility system, and nationwide administration  for development of vanishing grasslands, good grazing stock  processing facilities should be built and commercial grazing  stock product bases should be created in key development areas,  in the northern mountain grassland and grazing locations, and in  southern mountain grassland and grazing areas. Key projects  should be implemented to build livestock feeding and shelter  facilities on grasslands, meat and hides projects on northern  grasslands, projects to emulate New Zealand on southern  grasslands, green-light projects to control the depletion of  grasslands, and other capital construction projects in grassland  areas.    The following development policies must be adopted to  realize  the above targets:    1. Put more effort into publicizing "grassland laws", enact  better grassland laws and perfect the legal system as soon as  possible, set up stronger enforcement organizations, raise the  quality of law-enforcement units, resolve and eradicate  grassland destruction, put a time limit on effecting property  and utility rights, and credentials, put the compensatory  responsibility system into full force, put teeth into grassland  protection, ensure practical use and effective construction of  grasslands.    2. Development and utilization of grassland resources should  be brought into capital construction planning and financial  business development plans to guarantee a steady input and  supply of materials;    3. Nationally and locally financed grassland development  foundation systems should be set up, mainly through financial  outlays or land occupation and utilization taxes, grassland  resource management fees, pasturage taxes, slaughterhouse taxes,  part of which should be used for development of grassland  resources. These foundations could be used for repayments, and  managed by livestock (grassland) handling departments, and  supervised and checked by financial departments;    4. Grassland resource administrative organizations should be  strengthened. Among China's 6 major resources, grasslands occupy  the largest area, but there is only one office-level (grassland  office) unit with management responsibility, which, as the  socialist market economy develops, will become unsuitable for  handling the development and utilization of grassland resources.  China must setup competent management organizations for  effective macro-controls, supervision, and inspection of  grassland resources.</p>

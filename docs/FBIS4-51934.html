			<p>BFN     [Text] Local autonomous governments are now in the process  of reviewing their tender systems for public works projects  following a series of financial scandals involving general  contractors, chiefs of local autonomous governments, and  politicians. ASAHI SHIMBUN has conducted a survey of 47  prefectural governments and 12 municipal governments with a  population of more than 500,000 each and the survey showed that  almost all of the prefectural and municipal governments surveyed  had experimented with an open competitive tender system with  some conditions attached, and 20 prefectural and six municipal  governments had already adopted, or had decided to adopt, the  open competitive tender system. The survey found that many  local autonomous governments had set prices for public works  project at below the standard amount set by the central  government and they have had the problem of a heavy workload  with their offices understaffed in dealing with the open  competitive tender system.    In January this year, the central government decided on "the  action plan for improvement in the procedures of bids and  contracts for public works projects" in an attempt to shift from  the conventional designated tender system to the open  competitive tender system for the public works projects. The  central government and its agencies intend to put the action  plan into effect within this year, at the latest and the  prefectural and municipal governments are in the process of  reviewing their conventional designated tender systems in  accordance with the action plan.    According to the action plan, the standard amount for the  prefectural and municipal governments to adopt the open  competitive tender system for public works projects is more than  2.43 billion yen, far higher than "more than 730 million yen"  for the central government. Explaining the reason for the  difference, the Construction Ministry says if the standard  amount is set at a low level from the beginning for the  prefectural and municipal governments, it would create a heavy  workload and confusion for the governments.    Twenty prefectural governments, including Hokkaido,  Kanakawa,  Osaka, and Kumamoto, have already adopted the open competitive  tender system or decided when to adopt the new tender system.  Of the municipal governments, Sendai, Niigata, Kyoto, Sapporo,  Kawasaki, and Fukuoka have decided to adopt the new tender  system. Twenty-five other prefectural and five municipal  governments, including Tokyo, Chiba, and Nagoya, are  experimenting with the open competitive tender system.    Of the 20 prefectural governments, 10, including Hokkaido,  Osaka, and Saga, have decided to adopt the open competitive  tender system for public works projects worth more than 2.43  billion yen in accordance with the action plan, with the  exception of Akita Prefecture that has decided to adopt the new  tender system for public works projects worth more than 2.5  billion yen. The remaining 10 prefectural governments have  decided to lower the standard amount to about 0.5-1 billion yen,  citing the small size of their public works projects. They have  vowed to "increase the transparency of their biddings."    Of six municipal governments that have already adopted the  open competitive tender system or decided to adopt the new  tender system, Sapporo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Fukuoka have  decided to adopt the new tender system in accordance with the  action plan, but Sendai has decided to lower the standard amount.    Of 25 prefectural governments that are experimenting with  the  new tender system, only four -- Iwate, Fukuoka, Miyazaki, and  Kagoshima -- have decided to apply the open competitive tender  system to public works projects worth more than 2.43 billion yen  and the remaining prefectural governments have lowered the  standard amount at the experimental stage.    Almost all prefectural and municipal governments pointed out  the high cost of handling the new tender system when they  experimented with it. In the case of the prefectural  governments: "It took 60 days for them to announce biddings and  hold them, and the amount is about four times that taken under  the conventional designated tender system" (according to Iwate  Prefecture). Osaka city says: "The cost of printing bid  materials was high because a large number of construction firms  participated in bids for the public works projects." Ehime  Prefecture points out that "in the past, four staff spent only  15 minutes handling the designated tender system, but 14 staff  members have to spend as long as one hour handling the open  competitive tender system."    Many prefectural governments point out: 1) the need to deal  with grievances by construction companies that fail to win  contracts; 2) substandard work resulting from underbidding; and,  3) the monopoly of contracts by financially powerful  construction firms based in other prefectures.</p>

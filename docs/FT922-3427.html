			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Danger of UPI closure tomorrow UNITED Press International, the loss-ridden news agency, last night was in danger of closure tomorrow, the Rev Pat Robertson, a US television evangelist who once had presidential ambitions, having decided not to proceed with his Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.2m) takeover. He had told a Washington news conference yesterday that a review of UPI's finances and operations showed 'its economics just don't seem to make sense'. He said he might bid for one or two of the company's assets, including possibly its name, later in the day. Last night, the agency stated that it would cease operations at the end of tomorrow if additional funds were not found. Lawyers for UPI said the agency was negotiating with other potential buyers, but the company president conceded that it faced an uphill battle. Mr Robertson, who runs the Christian Broadcasting Network, emerged as the only bidder for all of UPI at a bankruptcy hearing last month. He was given 30 days to inspect its books, during which time he has been paying the 500 staff still working at the agency. Advisers had told him he would have to spend about Dollars 31m on UPI over the next 18 months to make it notionally viable, but with no guarantee of commercial success. He noted wryly that his broadcasting company had recently dropped UPI's service in favour of Associated Press.</p>

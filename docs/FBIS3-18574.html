Here is what  Croatian TV correspondent Jozo Curic has to say about it:    [Curic] French Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppe said  that  his country supported and valued the Washington agreement  between the Croats and the Muslims. During a meeting with  Granic here in Paris this afternoon, Juppe described the  agreement as the first step and stressed the need for a  demarcation and talks with the Serbs. France especially greeted  America's greater involvement, saying that finding a solution  was both a global and European problem. The diplomatic stimulus  must come from both the European Union and the United States,  and Russia, Juppe said. Speaking to journalists after the  talks, Juppe said that Paris supported the Croat-Muslim  arrangement.    Granic spoke about the problem of UNPA's [United Nations  Protected Areas] in Croatia. Juppe responded by saying that  UNPA's were part of the Kinkel-Juppe plan. Granic said that  Croatia insisted on a more relevant UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] mandate, especially in protecting borders and  communications, disarmament, confidence-building measures, and  economic recovery in the UNPA's. Croatia calls for a stricter  UNPROFOR mandate including the use of an ultimatum. To this  end, Croatia asked for France's help.    Official Paris supported the efforts to normalize Croatia's  relations with the Serbs and approved of the Croatian  Government's political approach, Granic said following the  talks. He told journalists in the French Ministry of Foreign  Affairs that Croatia wanted to normalize relations with Belgrade  but wanted to do so in conjunction with the resolution of the  UNPA issue. We wish to revitalize the Kinkel-Juppe initiative.  To this end, we expect support from the EU [European Union],  the United States, and the UN Security Council, Granic said. He  added: We fully agree with the French standpoint that there can  be no peace without the third side. An agreement will be  offered to the third side.    Granic said that he highly valued Frances' role and Juppe's  role, in particular, in the efforts to resolve the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and especially in Croatia. France favors a  realistic solution.    The talks were attended by Ambassador Salaj and Matek, head  of (?Granic's) office. Granic informed Juppe about the details  of the interim Washington agreement.</p>

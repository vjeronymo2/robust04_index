			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Freeze that will squeeze - Taxation / The Budget and You The chancellor effectively increased taxes by freezing most allowances in this week's Budget. The personal allowance, the higher-rate band, the capital gains tax and inheritance tax thresholds - all will be left at their 1993-94 levels. The impact of inflation on wages means that if allowances are unchanged, more people are drawn into the tax net, or the higher rate bands, with each succeeding year. The Rooker-Wise amendment in the 1970s tried to build index-linking into the tax system, but recent chancellors have felt free to ignore it. Not uprating the personal allowance in 1994-95 will cost 20 per cent taxpayers Pounds 14 a year, and basic-rate taxpayers Pounds 17.50 a year. Failing to uprate the personal allowance and the higher-rate band will cost top-rate taxpayers Pounds 103 a year. There were a few allowances which escaped the Budget freeze. The blind person's allowance will rise in April 1994 from Pounds 1,080 to Pounds 1,200, having been frozen for the past four tax years. The earnings cap - the maximum level of earnings for which pensions provision may be made with tax relief - will rise from Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 76,800 in April 1994. In addition, the 20 per cent income tax band will increase from Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000 in the tax year 1994-95, a measure already trailed in Norman Lamont's March Budget. But it saves taxpayers a maximum of only Pounds 25 a year. Another hangover from the Lamont era is the increase in employee national insurance contributions from 9 to 10 per cent. The band on which this rate applies has been increased - from Pounds 56 to Pounds 57 at the lower end, and from Pounds 420 to Pounds 430 at the upper. The combined effect of the changes will mean that anyone earning more than Pounds 22,360 will be Pounds 237 a year worse off. One reform which some predicted - the restriction of tax relief on the personal allowance to 20 per cent - did not occur. But relief on the married couple's allowance (still frozen at Pounds 1,720) had been restricted already to 20 per cent, from April 1994; it will be restricted further to 15 per cent from April 1995. The changes will cost a basic-rate taxpaying couple Pounds 86 in 1994-95 and a further Pounds 86 in 1995-96; higher-rate couples will lose Pounds 344 in 1994-95 and a further Pounds 86 in 1995-96. Couples aged between 65 and 74, while affected adversely by the above restrictions, will see their allowances rise from Pounds 2,465 to Pounds 2,665 in 1994-95; the allowance for those aged over 75 will increase from Pounds 2,505 to Pounds 2,705. Each allowance will rise by a further Pounds 330 in 1995-96. The income limit for age-related allowances, however, stays at Pounds 14,200. Income tax rates were unchanged. So, for single people in 1994-95, there will be no tax payable on the first Pounds 3,445 20 per cent on the next Pounds 3,000, 25 per cent on the next Pounds 20,700, and 40 per cent above that. The CGT threshold for 1994-95 will be Pounds 5,800 and IHT Pounds 150,000.</p>

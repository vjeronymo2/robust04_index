			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Smiths wins contract for F-22 power controllers SMITHS INDUSTRIES has won a contract to develop the power controllers on the F-22, the next generation fighter aircraft for the US Air Force. The deal, understood to be worth about Dollars 10m, could lead to a production contract worth Dollars 150m, several times that amount. It is the latest in a series of avionics development contracts that could bring in more than Pounds 50m a year by the end of the decade if they result in production deals, said Mr Norman Barber, chairman of Smiths' aerospace division, yesterday. The shares rose 5p to 368p. The company beat two US rivals to the contract, Rocketdyne, part of Rockwell International, and Sunstrand of Illinois. The contract follows deals to design similar controllers for the McDonnell-Douglas Apache attack helicopter, Boeing's new 777 airliner and the European Fighter Aircraft, being developed by a consortium of European aerospace companies. The first two could move into production in the next year or two. The programme for the Boeing 777 has been particularly successful. A controller, originally designed to run four sub-systems, will be installed to run 54. Each 777 will contain Smith's equipment worth more than Dollars 400,000. Mr Barber said that the F-22 contract was unlikely to lead to new jobs but would help preserve existing skills. The Dollars 87bn F-22 fighter programme is a survivor of the Clinton administration's defence review last month. The aircraft is designed to replace the F-15 and is two-thirds owned by Lockheed with Boeing holding the remainder. The equipment for the F-22 is a computerised controller for various mechanical, hydraulic and electronic systems on the aircraft. It will be worth about Dollars 250m an aircraft, but this could rise if its size is increased as with the 777 version. Lockheed plans to produce more than 600 F-22s. Mr Barber said: 'With this bridgehead into the F-22, we can bid for other power management systems.' The power distribution centres are the first use in tactical fighters of 270-volt direct current distribution through programmable switching technology. The contract is the first Smiths will meet through its US operations based in New Jersey and Florida. Previous contracts have been met out of UK sites.</p>

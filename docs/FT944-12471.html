			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee recovery falls short of bonanza for Colombia - Improved returns will allow farmers to repay loans and renew plantations High coffee prices are bringing relief and recovery but it is too soon to talk about a bonanza, according to Colombian coffee growers. Just as the National Coffee Fund will be able to pay off debts and move into the black, so too the farmers are planning to repay loans and renew plantations as they gather in the main harvest. 'Many of the farms here are in a poor state,' says Mr Alberto Restrepo, director of the Risaralda coffee growers' committee. 'But the small farmers, who make up 80 per cent of the producers in Risaralda, were not so badly affected by the crisis because they supply their own labour and grow their own food. Even so, the growers should be getting a bigger share of the international price so that production can recover quickly.' The support price paid to coffee growers in Colombia has been increasing steadily and now stands at the equivalent of about USDollars 1.10 a pound. It is the most important of several instruments used by the government and the coffee growers' federation, Federacafe, to control production and protect farmers from the ups and downs of the international market. If the support price is too generous it can start another cycle leading to over-production. Colombia's 1993-94 coffee harvest is estimated at 11.6m bags (60kg each), probably rising to 12.3m bags in 1994-95. Compared with the 1991-92 peak of more than 17m bags, these figures are low, largely because of the spread of broca disease, a low rate of plantation renewal and minimal use of fertiliser. About 50,000 hectares out of the total 1.1m devoted to coffee in Colombia have also been eradicated over the last two years. However, some farmers have kept their plantations in good order. Luis Alberto Arcila, who has 3.5 ha under coffee on steep hillsides in Risaralda, co-ordinates one of the Federacafe farmers' groups in his area and has been learning how to live with broca, applying insecticide and a fungus he himself prepares. The broca insect enters the coffee cherry about 100 days after flowering; in Colombia the plants flower so often that the producer has to pick the fruit constantly through the year to prevent broca infestation and this puts his costs up by about 8 per cent. Mr Arcila says that only 3 per cent of his coffee is affected by broca. Despite Federacafe's intensive education efforts, many farmers are less careful and some 10 per cent of Risaralda's crop is damaged. 'Now the price is better I'm working with more spirit. Last year I cleared one lot of coffee plants but I couldn't renew them because of the economic situation. With this harvest I can pay my debts and put something back into the farm,' says Mr Arcila. Although the previous two years were particularly lean ones for Colombia's 300,000 coffee producers, decades of investment in roads, electricity and social welfare programmes have given the coffee growing region a relatively high standard of living and low level of violence. Now Federacafe is introducing 'greener' methods using far less water for the de-pulping process and, instead of tipping the pulp on to valley slopes where it will contaminate streams, farmers are mixing it with other organic rubbish and worms to make rich humus. 'We're reforesting to protect the springs and watersheds. The only thing to do about the water problem is to educate, educate, educate,' says Mr Restrepo. 'The spending cuts affected infrastructure projects but not the technical assistance programmes. The small grower here is technified and very receptive to new things like fish breeding ponds, rabbits, worms - everything.' Colombia's 1994 coffee income is forecast at over USDollars 1.7bn, compared with USDollars 1.2bn in 1993. Even the most conservative estimates suggest that next year's earnings will be above USDollars 2 bn, which means that USDollars 600m or more can be saved abroad for difficult times. Over the past five years Federacafe has slashed all budgets, nearly halved its staff and cut marketing costs. As a result the federation - which handles about half the country's exports on average - is now as efficient as the private exporting companies. The special commission set up to study Colombia's coffee sector recommended earlier this year that Federacafe should not play such a big part in exports. 'The federation thinks that it's not possible to divorce marketing from stability; the commission wants to keep the domestic support price system in place, so we need a cash flow to maintain stocks and so on,' says Mr Diego Pizano at Federacafe. 'Missions from other producer countries have been coming to see how the Colombian model works. By managing three variables - support pice, credit and technical assistance - we have control over the production level.' Production is well below the ideal level of 15m bags defined by the commission, but should reach this in 1996-97. With suppliers agreements covering over 13m bags and domestic consumption of about 1.5m bags, the 15m target is realistic, says Mr Pizano. But if prices drop again in two years' time and the revaluation of the peso continues, there could come a moment when Colombia's ability to compete will be seriously undermined.</p>

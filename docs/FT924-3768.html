			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Oil slide worries Opec ministers THE EXTENT of oil traders' disappointment with the production agreement reached at the recent meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Country's in Vienna became clear this week as the slide in crude prices accelerated. The March delivery crude oil futures contract at London's International Petroleum Exchange, which fell 41 US cents a barrel while the Opec meeting was being held last week, slipped another 81 cents to Dollars 18.10 a barrel at Thursday's close before steadying yesterday. In view of the underlying weakness of the market traders had been hoping that Opec ministers would agree a much bigger cut in pumping levels than the effective 100,00 barrels a day reduction that emerged from last week's meeting. Alarmed at the continuing price fall Opec ministers tried to talk the market up on Thursday, stressing that the 24.58m b/d supply level they had agreed covered overall sales to the market and not just well-head production - indicating that stocks would not be released if supply became tight this winter. Their assurances achieved only a brief pause in the price slide, however. Traders said yesterday's steadier tone represented an end-of-week reaction against the earlier steep fall. At the London Metal Exchange base metals relinquished most of last week's gains. Copper traders tried to keep the rally going on Monday, but when that move faltered the sellers quickly got the upper hand and the three months position closed yesterday at Pounds 1,423.75 a tonne, down Pounds 50.50 on the week. About Pounds 45 of the fall was a reflection of sterling's strength against the dollar, however. The currency factor was also a major contributor to weakness in the lead market, the LME's other sterling-denominated contract. Three months lead closed at Pounds 305.25 a tonne, down on the week by Pounds 16.25 or Dollars 10.50. A sharp fall in nickel prices was in defiance of news of significant output cuts by two major producers. On Monday Falconbridge, jointly owned by Noranda of Canada and Trelleborg of Sweden, announced cuts in production from its operations at Sudbury, Ontario, Norway and the Dominican Republic that would reduce supply by 11,700 tonnes in 1993. That was on top of 7,000 tonnes of cuts announced last month. The scale of the cuts caught the market unawares but was not sufficient to reverse the retracement from last week's Dollars 600-a-tonne rise that was already under way. Neither were the bears deflected from their purpose by Wednesday's news that Western Mining Corporation of Australia was cutting nickel output by an estimated 2,000 tonnes in the year to the end of June. With LME warehouse stocks of nickel remaining uncomfortably high and CIS supplies continuing to flood into the western market traders believe nothing short of a strong revival in demand from the stainless steel sector, the biggest user of nickel, can bring a substantial revival in nickel prices - and there is as yet no sign of that. At yesterday's close the three months nickel price on the LME was quoted at Dollars 5,630 a tonne, down Dollars 57.50 on the day and Dollars 380 on the week. The aluminium market proved more responsive to bullish production news when Pechiney of France announced on Monday that it was closing permanently its high-cost, 31,000-tonnes-a-year smelter at Venthon and reducing production by 20 per cent at other operations - resulting in an overall cut in annual output of 79,000 tonnes. That pushed prices higher initially but was not enough to keep at bay the selling that was afflicting other LME markets. Nevertheless aluminium got off comparatively lightly with an Dollars 18 fall on the week to Dollars 1,201.50 a tonne for three months metal. At the London Futures and Options Exchange robusta coffee prices benefited from the strength of the New York arabica market and concern about technical tightness developing around the March position, which closed at Dollars 1,010 a tonne, up Dollars 5 on the day and Dollars 34 on the week. The price had reached a 10-month high of Dollars 1,014 a tonne earlier in the day. International Coffee Organisation talks in London ended on Tuesday with the extension of the deadline for renegotiating the International Coffee Agreement for three months as the only definite development. But that came as no surprise and did not dampen the more bullish mood that has characterised the market recently.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  -------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium  +3,375 to 1,483,725 Copper       +425 to   327,375 Lead       +1,750 to   201,650 Nickel       +456 to    64,182 Zinc       -1,125 to   379,050 Tin           -55 to    14,435  --------------------------------------</p>

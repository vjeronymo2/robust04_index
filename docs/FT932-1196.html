			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Three-month COPPER continued to trade in a narrow range between Dollars 1,900 and Dollars 1,870 a tonne on the LME. Although Chile's labour contracts at Chuquicamata have now been settled, the market remained cautious ahead of end-June US contract expiries. ALUMINIUM was resilient, following Tuesday's shake-out. Dealers said the market continued to shrug off negative factors, such as rising stocks, with supportive buying re-emerging on dips. TIN's recent technical rally is now concluded, and the market once again focused on bearish fundamentals. Prices fell away from the outset, and three-month metal equalled the recent 20-year low of Dollars 5,070 a tonne. NICKEL continued to decline on the perception that physical supplies of Russian nickel are on their way to Europe. The strength of the dollar weighed on the GOLD market. 'People thought gold was holding up well against the strong dollar but now currency factors are taking their toll,' one London dealer said. Prices in Canadian and Australian dollars, and South African rand were high enough to encourage limited amounts of producer selling, adding to pressure on prices. Compiled from Reuters</p>

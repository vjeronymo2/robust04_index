			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CANDIDATES OVERCHARGED FOR RADIO-TV TIME;  </P> <P> POLITICS: A SURPRISE FCC AUDIT OF 30 STATIONS FINDS WIDESPREAD VIOLATIONS OF  THE LAW. EDUCATION EFFORTS ARE SLATED.  </P> <P> A surprise audit of 30 radio and TV stations found widespread overcharging of  political candidates for advertising, a Federal Communications Commission  official said today.  </P> <P> However, the official, Roy Stewart, said the commission will not levy sanctions  against the stations at this time. Instead, the commission will increase its  efforts to educate station executives in the intricacies of the political  advertising laws, he said.  </P> <P> Stewart, chief of the FCC's mass media bureau, said sanctions are possible  after the bureau further investigates the 30 stations. He said no more audits  are planned at this time.  </P> <P> He said the purpose of the July 16 audit was "to assist" broadcasters in  complying with the law, which was passed in 1972. He would not characterize the  violations as deliberate.  </P> <P> "I would prefer to think they (broadcasters) are not aware of their full range  of responsibilities . . . in carrying out the law," Stewart said.  </P> <P> He did not identify which of the audited stations were in violation.  </P> <P> The audit reviewed the stations' compliance with federal rules requiring that  candidates have equal opportunities -- commonly referred to as equal time -- to  appear on stations and whether stations are selling ads to candidates at the  lowest rates for specific time slots.  </P> <P> The audit found widespread overcharging at 16 of 20 TV stations audited. During  a particular time at one of the stations, candidates paid $5,500 for a  30-second ad, while commercial advertisers paid no more than $3,000 for a  30-second spot.  </P> <P> The bureau said broadcasters' "sales techniques encouraged (candidates) to buy  higher-priced classes of time."  </P> <P> The audit also found that many stations were not keeping good enough records to  allow candidates to ascertain whether they should be getting equal time with  opponents.  </P> <P> The inspections -- the first of their kind -- were carried out in Cincinnati,  Dallas-Ft. Worth, Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco. The  commission said the stations were chosen because of their diverse locations and  because they serve large areas.  </P> <P> The commission in April fined an Indianapolis television station, WXIN, $10,000  for violating the political ad rules.  </P></p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: German side steadies RMC at Pounds 167m STRONG GROWTH in profits from Germany almost offset reductions in RMC Group's other locations to leave pre-tax profits for 1992 at Pounds 166.6m, barely changed from the previous Pounds 167.4m. The ready-mixed concrete group has benefited from high levels of house building, reflecting immigration to western Germany and the improvement in infrastructure in eastern Germany. RMC also announced that Mr Jim Owen, group managing director, will become executive chairman on May 1. Mr John Camden, the current chairman who has been with the group since 1952, is retiring because of ill health but will become president. Mr Peter Young, deputy managing director, will step up to Mr Owen's job. Mr Owen said the high level of demand for housing in Germany would continue to support the operations there, although margins of 9.7 per cent were already high. Possibilities in eastern Germany were 'very exciting indeed'. Operating profits from Germany rose 36 per cent to Pounds 123.2m, making up two-thirds of the group total of Pounds 186.9m, down 4 per cent from Pounds 194.6m in 1991. The rise in profits from associates, which includes RMC's Berlin operation, from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 14.1m, also reflected strong demand in Germany. Figures also gained from translation at lower sterling rates. RMC uses year-end exchange rates, and the effect of the pound's fall was to add 4p to earnings per share of 31.2p (36p), down 13 per cent. Earnings also suffered through a rise in minority interests to Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 38.5m), again reflecting the strength of German profits. The three other geographical areas suffered falls. In the UK operating profits fell 71 per cent to Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 34.9m) although turnover was only 5 per cent lower at Pounds 859.6m. In 1989 UK profits were Pounds 132m. Mr John Cooper, head of the UK concrete operations, said since the market peak RMC had taken 352 truck mixers off the road, cutting capacity by about 30 per cent. Operating profits from other EC countries dropped 28 per cent to Pounds 39.7m (Pounds 55.1m). The completion of large projects in Spain had cut volumes by 14-15 per cent and a further fall was expected in 1993. Demand in France had weakened too. Profits from outside the EC fell to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 14.2m). Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director, said that gearing at 31 per cent (35 per cent) was not a problem. Interest charges of Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 33.9m) were covered 5.8 times by operating profits. He said that capital expenditure had been cut to Pounds 114.2m from Pounds 248m in 1991 and Pounds 311m in 1990. In 1993 it will be about Pounds 125m. The depreciation charge was Pounds 131.7m (Pounds 117.5m). An unchanged final dividend of 13.4p is proposed to give a maintained total of 20p. See Lex</p>

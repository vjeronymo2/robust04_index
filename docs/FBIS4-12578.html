			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Khalid 'Abd-al-Rahman] </F>   [Text] Nicolas Rodriguez, under secretary of the Cuban  Foreign Ministry, has said that the economic embargo Iraq is  facing is the same embargo Cuba has been facing for 32 years.    In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, he said that the embargo is an  expression of a tendency by the superpowers not to respect the  will of peoples and nations seeking to achieve progress. He  added that this embargo is beginning to show its negative  effects on Iraq and Cuba.    Assessing Cuban-Iraqi relations, Rodriguez said: Relations  between our two friendly countries, Cuba and Iraq, are  deep-rooted and have been continuously developing in various  fields. We believe that continuing the policy of reinforcing  relations and improving cooperation between our peoples will  serve the interests and objectives of both countries. We also  believe that this cooperation is necessary, useful, and  important, in light of the difficult circumstances our two  countries are facing.    On the objective of his visit to Iraq and his talks with  Iraqi officials, the Cuban guest said: My visit to Iraq is  aimed at furthering cooperation and developing relations of  friendship between our two countries and peoples, not just under  the current circumstances, but also in the future. My visit is  also aimed at getting a broader outlook on the circumstances our  friends in Iraq are facing. At the same time, I hope to brief  our friends on the situation in Cuba.    I was happy with the talks I held with our friends, the  officials in Iraq. I was even happier to find that our friends,  the Iraqi officials, understand the circumstances facing Cuba.  My talks were brotherly and very fruitful.</p>

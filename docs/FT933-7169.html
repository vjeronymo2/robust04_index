			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Kohl and Scharping feed rumour mill: Press speculates on coalition after German polls CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl and Mr Rudolf Scharping, recently-elected leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD), met behind closed doors yesterday for wide-ranging talks, fuelling press speculation that they will be forced to form a grand coalition after next year's elections. Both political leaders have flatly rejected the idea, each insisting that he is campaigning for outright victory, but the very fact that they are prepared to meet and talk privately has stoked the overheated rumour mill in Bonn. The meeting underlines the fact that both men belong firmly in Germany's tradition of consensual politics, where cross-party compromises are the regular answer to resolving their conflicts. It also confirms Mr Scharping's style as the new opposition leader, in which he is determined to demonstrate that his party is capable of becoming an alternative government. The talks, the first since Mr Scharping was elected SPD party leader in June, lasted 90 minutes and when he emerged Mr Scharping said they covered 'everything currently on the political agenda'. They were set to discuss the current state of the German economy, and how to stem the rapid rise in unemployment and revive ailing east German manufacturing industry. In spite of the fact that both signed the cross-party solidarity pact last March on financing unification, both are now keen to stress their different economic policies. There is room for manoeuvre on the issue of German participation in UN peacekeeping exercises. Mr Scharping is clearly attempting to push his party, with a strong anti-military, pacifist wing, into permitting wider international participation for the Bundeswehr. The SPD and Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats are condemned to reach compromises on any issues which require changes in Germany's strict constitution - such as privatisation of state companies, including Deutsche Telekom and the railways. They also have to negotiate on issues which require the approval of the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, where the SPD has an effective majority. Mr Kohl therefore needs Mr Scharping's support to gain approval for his entire package of budget cuts, though most can be passed by the Bundestag, the lower house, alone. He also needs support for plans to launch a new social security system to pay for residential care for the old and handicapped: the government's current project to finance it by cancelling paid sick leave for workers has been furiously opposed by the unions. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the Free Democrats, who would be excluded from any grand coalition, said he would meet Mr Scharping on Friday.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Blunkett warns of 'shambles' - Local Government Reorganisation THE 'PIECEMEAL' approach proposed by ministers for re-organising local government would lead to shambles and a period of blight, Mr David Blunkett, the opposition local government spokesman, warned yesterday. Speaking during the final Commons stages of the legislation that sets up a commission to review local government, Mr Blunkett said an incoming Labour government would ensure that the review covered the country as a whole comprehensively, and produced plans - ideally within two years - followed by a period of consultation. In this way, he said, people 'would be able to see the pattern of local government emerging across the country'. There would then be a single vesting day to avoid a time when staff left councils which were to be abolished and services began to disintegrate, but new authorities were not yet in place. The government's ideologically driven approach, he said, meant that it had missed the opportunity of consensus and lasting change. Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, accused Labour of manufacturing disagreement with the government, and described the bill as 'unusually enlightened'. He condemned Labour's commitment to a system of unitary authorities rather than allowing some two-tier local government, describing it as 'devised in Whitehall, imposed on local people, all at one go in one big bang, standardised and socialist'. Responding to pressure from Tory backbenchers, Mr Portillo said the government would look again at the guidance to the commission. This should ensure that it reflected the differences between people's expectations of the localities which should meet their needs and the areas through which services could be provided efficiently.</p>

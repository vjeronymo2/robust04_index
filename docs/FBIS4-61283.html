			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the Russian Federation Foreign Minister `On a </F> Third Peace Conference'" -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI headline]    [Text] The centenary of the First Peace Conference,  convened on Russia's initiative in The Hague in 1899, is  approaching. This forum and the subsequent Second Peace  Conference in 1907 were very important milestones in the world  community's life, in the establishment of the principles of the  international rule of law. The conventions, declarations, and  other decisions adopted at it imparted powerful momentum to the  creation of a system of peaceful settlement of disputes and  humanization of the military sphere, and placed the problem of  arms limitation and disarmament on a practical footing.    Although they were unable to prevent the conflagration of  two  world wars, the conferences in The Hague were a great beginning,  determining the main direction of the development of  international life in the 20th century -- the desire for peace  and the establishment of the foundations of philanthropy and  justice.    Today, as we approach the third millennium, mankind has no  right to pass up an opportunity of strengthening international  peace and asserting the principles of law which, in the  conditions of the current multipolar world structure, must form  the basis of a new global equilibrium. Vigorous steps will be  needed to translate this age-old dream into reality.    On behalf of President B.N. Yeltsin and on behalf of Russia  as chairman of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conferences, the Russian  Federation foreign minister proposes that all states discuss the  idea of convening a Third International Peace Conference in 1999.    In making this proposal Russia is guided primarily by the  decisions of the Second Hague Conference in 1907, which  recommended that the participating states "gather for a third  Peace Conference." We are expecting interest in this proposal,  in view of the position of the Nonaligned Movement, the  decisions of the UN General Assembly, which declared 1990-1999  the Decade of International Law, and the recommendations in this  sphere by the 1993 conference of the Permanent Court of  Arbitration.    The preliminary agenda for the third conference might be as  follows:    -- improving the system for settling disputes, including the  possible amendment or revision of the 1899 and 1907 conventions;    -- filling the gaps in international humanitarian law to be  applied during armed conflicts, and developing it;    -- creating a system of international criminal justice in  respect of crimes against peace and mankind and other  international offenses.    If there is support for these proposals, Russia is prepared  to submit for examination by the states ideas on the program for  the forum, as happened during the preparations for the First and  Second Hague Peace Conferences. For our part, we are amenable  to a dialogue on the content, organization, and holding of a  Third Peace Conference.    In accordance with the 1907 decisions, it is necessary to  institute a preparatory committee two years before it opens in  order to study proposals and to draft documents and also  recommendations on the organization of its work and the  procedure to be applied. We are willing to participate actively  in the establishment and work of this body.    Russia favors the formation of a steering committee within  the framework of the Court of Arbitration Administrative Council  to prepare proposals connected with revising the 1899 and 1907  conventions on the peaceful settlement of disputes. The  Administrative Council's recommendations on the results of the  steering committee's work could be a significant contribution to  the preparation of a third conference.    Of course, the organizational measures must be implemented  in  collaboration with the United Nations, within the framework of  the Decade of International Law it has proclaimed.    As for the venue of the Third Peace Conference, if the Dutch  Government agrees, then, like the two previous conferences, it  could be held in The Hague.    One hundred years, particularly in the context of the  dynamic  20th century, is an enormously long time. Although, leafing  through old documents relating to the 1899 and 1907 Hague  Conferences, one never ceases to be amazed that the values laid  down then have not depreciated over the years. The link between  the eras is eloquently demonstrated in the 12 August 1898  Russian Foreign Ministry note on convening the First Hague Peace  Conference: "...This conference could augur well for the next  century. It would join in one mighty force the efforts of all  states that sincerely want the great idea of universal peace to  triumph over the realm of trouble and strife. At the same time,  it would seal their agreement through the joint recognition of  the principles of law and justice on which the security of  states and prosperity of the peoples are based."    How relevant these words are to us now.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Cattle's to seek listing for Rosebys CATTLE'S (Holdings), the financial services group, is to seek a separate listing for Rosebys, its household textiles, curtains and accessories retailing subsidiary, later this month by way of a placing. The additional capital will allow Rosebys to repay its indebtedness of Pounds 2.6m with Cattle's and provide for continued expansion. Cattle's would receive total net funds in excess of Pounds 7m and retain about 45 per cent of Rosebys' enlarged capital. Cattle's believes it can achieve a price for the shares it will sell which adequately reflects Rosebys current value and prospects. For 1991, Rosebys is expected to produce pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m. A special interim dividend of 0.5p, for 1992 only, will be declared by Cattle's, to be paid with the final dividend for 1991.</p>

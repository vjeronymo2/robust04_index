			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: EU urged to shift focus to Asian markets The European Union yesterday turned its attention eastwards, amid mounting criticism that Europe risks losing out on Asia's 'economic miracle' by being too slow to develop political and economic ties. At a conference in Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner responsible for foreign affairs, warned the European Union needed to shift its focus rapidly towards greater trade with Asian markets. 'The task is now to make a reality of what we all accept as an objective - better economic ties between the EU and Asia,' said Sir Leon. But Mr Nicolas Maclean, the chairman for Asia of Unice, the European employers' federation, said: 'This forum is about 20 years overdue. For far too long, many EU companies have held Asian markets at arm's length and have now woken up to the fact that they are missing out.' Over the summer, the Commission published its first ever strategy document on Asia designed to launch a radical rethink of EU strategy. It warned that if European companies were unable to earn an adequate share of Asian growth over the next decade, their worldwide profits and competitiveness would be affected. This in turn could exacerbate calls for more protectionist policies from those in Europe who view Asia as a threat, rather than a lucrative opportunity. Last month, foreign ministers from the EU and the six Asean countries agreed to intensify political and economic relations, as well as to reinforce dialogue in such areas as security and the environment. However, significant differences in view also emerged from the meeting, in particular Asean opposition to EU efforts to link trade to human rights and the conditions of workers. At yesterday's conference of 150 business leaders, organised by the European Commission and the Financial Times, the opening speeches by Sir Leon and Mr Manuel Marin, commissioner responsible for co-operation and development with Asia, avoided such issues. Both speakers concentrated instead on Europe's enthusiasm to develop links. Mr Marin said a positive message on Asia had to be communicated to Europe's citizens: 'Increased demand in Asia for European products, services and expertise will obviously boost job growth and prospects in Europe.' However, he pointed out that collaboration with Asian companies did not appear to be a top priority with most European companies. According to the Commission paper, a number of factors are at play. These include a lack of understanding of the Asian business environment and the lack of a clearly defined image of Europe in Asia. Mr Maclean said three things had to happen if Europe was to be truly effective in trading with Asia. First, bureaucratic pressure had to be eased in Europe, to allow companies to be as competitive as possible. The member states also had to act in co-ordination, and make real attempts to understand the different Asian cultures. 'If we ignore this, then culture will remain the greatest non-tariff barrier to our chances of strengthening our economic presence in Asia,' he said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article in two installments: "Tax Reform Takes </F> Center Stage--Fluid Political Situation"] [14 Apr 94 p 5]    [Text] Following the coalition parties' Tax Reform  Committee, the government Tax Commission (prime minister's  advisory organ) was installed on 8 April. The main focus will be  to provide a response to the issue of raising the consumption  tax rate, which had been shelved, since the national welfare tax  concept was brought up. An investigation was made as to how the  tax reform might progress amidst turbid circumstances, including  the fluid political situation.  <H5>  "Lead Tax Reform" </H5>   "Ultimately, regardless of the political regime that is  formed, only the government Tax Commission can lead the reform."  These words were spoken by a certain senior official of the  Ministry of Finance [MOF] on the morning of 13 April when  speculations became rife about "Prime Minister Hata" succeeding  Hosokawa.    A senior official of the MOF Tax Bureau states: "The final  decision might be left to politics, but as long as there was a  consultative inquiry, the government Tax Commission must  naturally conduct deliberations to formulate a reply." Even if a  Hata regime favoring tax reforms emerges, a political base in  which a split has occurred might waver again at any time.    In past tax reforms, the Liberal Democratic Party's  Researach  Commission on the Tax System played the leading role and the  government Tax Commission had the supporting role. Replacing the  inexperienced government which emerged with the inauguation of  the coalition regime last July, the government Tax Commission  took the lead in discussions and proposed the consumption tax  rate hikes. However, from the yearend into early this year, the  ruling coalition parties expressed great dissatisfaction about  MOF leadership so the Tax Commission was forced to hide in the  political shadows.    Then came the sudden announcement of the national welfare  tax  concept in February. The MOF was criticized severely again for  its high-handed action and, since March, it has cooperated  patiently with the coalition parties' tax reform committee and  adopted the strategy of laying the groundwork to present the  government's "consumption tax rate hikes." However, the MOF  posture is changing subtly because of the political instability.    The situation is such now that the tax reform bill will not  progress unless the government Tax Commission steps into the  forefront. The Tax Commission had planned to time the  presentation of its consultative reply with the end of the  ruling party's tax committee deliberations in late June, but the  possibility is strong now that the release date of substantive  conclusions will be advanced to impose a framework beforehand on  the ruling parties' tax reform deliberations. Tax Commission  chairman, Hiroshi Kato, who shares the MOF's thinking, is "firm"  that "moving deliberations forward is a national task regardless  of the makeup of the political regime."  <H5>  Fact Is "Consultative Inquiry Was Requested" </H5>   Justifications to push tax reforms are supporting that  "firm"  attitude. One justifying fact is that the consultative inquiry  had already been requested when the prime minister announced his  resignation.    There are claims that since the prime minister announced his  resignation immediately after the inquiry was requested, the  deliberations themselves should be done all over again, but the  MOF asserts that, "as long as was precedent when the prime  minister requesting the inquiry and the prime minister receiving  the reply have not been the same person, the government Tax  Commission receiving the consultative request had every right to  enter into deliberations."    A senior official of the MOF Tax Bureau admits, "If Prime  Minister Hosokawa had announced his resignation before the  request was made to the Tax Commission, the schedule would have  been disrupted greatly." Although it was a "close call," there  is a world of a difference between receiving and not receiving  the advisory request.    Actually, since 5 April, when Prime Minister Hosokawa leaked  his intention to resign to upper house councilors Shimomura and  Nishikawa, the MOF is believed to have sensed the changes in the  prime minister's position and maneuvered behind the scenes to  "have him, at least, submit a request for advisory  deliberations." On 5 April, a ministerial secretariat's senior  official judged that "situation appears serious--the coming week  will be critical," and started to gather information.    The other justification is the revision of the fixed-rate  tax  reduction law. It was passed by the Diet in late March and, on  that occasion, a "supplementary provision" was appended that  income tax reductions would not be limited to the single fiscal  year of 1994 but continued after 1995 on the assumption that  drastic tax reforms will be carried out.    Actually, though there is only an understanding that both  the  ruling and opposition parties agreed to carry out the tax  reforms faithfully, the MOF is making maximum use of the  supplementary provision, claiming "it has the responsibility to  carry out a law decided by the Diet."    The MOF adheres to that viewpoint in spite of the fact that  at the time the law was passed, many remarked tauntingly that,  "this is a strange law with the main provision limiting the tax  reduction to 1994 and the supplementary provision mentioning the  year after and later." After coordinating with the Prime  Minister's Official Residence staff, the MOF incorporated this  supplementary provision as an official commitment of "continued  tax reductions" in the external economic reform plan announced  in late March.    The MOF views the tax reform plan as being well buttressed.  <H5>  Reform Is Uncertain </H5>   The scenario could be disrupted if the political base wavers  again, for some reason, forcing dissolution and general  elections. If that happens, the government Tax Commission can  suggest options but the political mechanism to consider them  would be unavailable temporarily. For MOF authorities who were  contemplating tax increases, the surprising support rate  exceeding 70 percent recorded by the Hosokawa regime at the time  of its installation was an unexpected reinforcement but the  uncertain factor remains of what the support rate would be for  the next regime.    The MOF believes that the next government would be a "tax  reform regime." However, the people hate tax increases. Looking  back, many cases can be found where political regimes and  parties campaigning for tax reforms lost elections. It is still  unclear as to whether the next government can really carry out  the reforms.  <H5>  [15 Apr 94 p 5] </H5>   [Text] MOF Prepares Strategy Carefully--7-Percent  Consumption Tax    It it were "a measure to cope with recession" last year,  then  it is "a measure to cope with aging" this year. The government  Tax Commission officials think that this year's key words for  tax reforms should be different from last year's.    The reason is that bright signs have begun to appear in the  economy and the environment will now permit, accoding to Hiroshi  Kato, Tax Commission chairman, "return to basic tax reform  discussions on the best ways for the people to shoulder the  burden of an aging society."  <H5>  "National Consensus" and Understanding </H5>   From 5.1 persons in 1990 to 3.6 in 2000 and 2.1 in  2025--these figures show the number of workers (between 20 and  64 years) supporting a single person, 65 years of age or older.  With the increase in social security benefits, the tax burden  must increase but under the current tax system which relies  excessively on workers' income taxes, the weight of the tax  burden will be felt even more. This led to the concept that,  through graduated structural easing of income taxes and  increases in indirect taxes, "it is necessary to equalize the  generational tax burdens" (Tax Commission's interim reply made  last November).    In its current deliberations, the Tax Commission will move  another step forward and focus on the quantitative analysis of  the people's tax burden required in the future. With the  understanding that a national consensus was obtained to increase  the ratio of indirect taxes, i.e., consumption taxes, the  commission will even take up the concrete question of the rate  of tax hikes.    The commission's deliberations will be focused on the  scenario of increased people's burden in the future revealed in  late March by the "welfare vision for an aging society  discussion group" (unofficial discussion group of the welfare  minister). This vision, which was revealed officially after  detailed adjustments between the MOF and the Ministry of  Welfare, was actually so designed that it will lead to a set  conclusion. It might be said this is a schemed calculation to  yield again the tax rate of 7 percent which Prime Ministger  Hosokawa mentioned as a "rough estimate" in his national welfare  tax concept.    If this scenario is viewed as the "most realistic case" (Tax  Bureau senior official) to upgrade pension payments and medical  services and improve nursing and child care, with respect to the  future social welfare system, the ratio of the social welfare  burden in the national income will rise from 13 percent in FY93  to between 15 and 15.5 percent in FY2000. Keeping pace with  this, the tax burden ratio of social welfare benefits will  increase from 4.8 percent in FY93 to 6.5 percent in FY2000.    Including other charges (20.8 percent), separate from social  security benefits, the entire tax burden ratio will rise from  25.6 percent in FY93 to 27.3 percent in FY2000. Calculated on  the basis of FY93 national income, that would be an increase of  more than 6.1 trillion yen in the tax burden. The sales tax  revenue was 6.822 trillion yen in FY93 (revised budget base) and  converted to sales tax ratio, the tax burden increase would be  approximately 2.7 percent. To obtain a round figure, the simple  calculation is to add 3 percent to the current consumption tax  ratio and round it off at 6 percent.  <H5>  Vision Includes Social Assets </H5>   The MOF must incorporate tax increase measures to make up  for  future income tax reductions. This is the reason why the MOF  (Tax Bureau senior official) is asserting that the "minimum  level of the consumption tax rate should be 7 percent," which  includes an addition of little over 1 percent to the tax hike of  little less than 3 percent mentioned in the vision. The basic  plan drawn up by the MOF is already incorporated in the vision.    At the press interview following the second general meeting  of the Tax Commission, chairman Kato stated, "The welfare  expansion project is not limited to such matters as nursing care  and includes public works investments for road improvements,  etc." It was a statement indicating that consideration will be  given to the tax burden of not only the welfare vision but of a  wide range of financial demands that will arise in the future.    This is also related to the "external economic reform  outline" of late March which stipulated supplementary additions  to the basic public works investment plan to spend a total of  430 trillion yen over a 10-year period from FY91 to FY2000. The  reason is that the outline mentions that securing adequate  revenue sources had been the preconditon to the inclusion of  supplementary additions.    Is it possible to finance through tax hikes all of the  steadily expanding fiscal demands, such as securing revenue  sources to cover anticipated income tax losses for augmentation  of the welfare program and providing for supplementary public  works investments? In that case, "the consumption tax rate might  climb to 10 or 15 percent" (Tax Commission official). However,  such sudden tax hikes are not likely to be supported by the  people.  <H5>  Hesitant About Reassessing Expenditures </H5>   To gain the people's support, a certain official states, "it  is necessary to bring up the idea of conducting a radical  reassessment of the expenditure structure which is being slanted  to vested privileges by politics persuaded by special  interests." However, the MOF is perplexed that "legally and  realistically, the Tax Commission was not given the function to  delve into and consider concrete details involving  expenditures." The said ministry knows through experience that  it is difficult to cut expenditures dominated by vested  interests.    Increasing taxes while shelving the idea of reassessing the  rigidified expenditure structure--if deliberations have to  proceed under these conditions, the ideal of "creating a tax  system to cope with an aging society," which the Tax Commission  touts, might simply fade away.</p>

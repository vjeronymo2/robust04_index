			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tetyana Khomych: "Leonid Kuchma: `In Order To </F> Overpower the Mafia, One Needs To Head It'"]    [Text] It is good to get registered as a presidential  candidate in Chernihiv and forge one's political image in the  east. This truth was recently once again proved by Leonid  Kuchma, who paid a short, but rich visit to the Dnieper Region.  The ex-prime minister and present leader of Ukraine's Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and a claimant to the post of  president of the state launched a decisive attack on the  consciousness of his former fellow countrymen and associates,  whose support at the forthcoming presidential elections he is  seriously counting upon.    At the "conference," which was hastily convened by the  Interregional Block of Reforms [MBR], those present were  showered with not quite radiant forecasts. In this, the  people's deputy and one of the MBR leaders may successfully  compete with yet another fellow-countryman -- Pavlo Hloba [not  further identified]. It is true, though, that the proponent of  the strong hand and single power in the state, unlike the  psychic, does not specialize in collapses in the city  underground or similar trifles: Leonid Danylovych [Kuchma]'s  line of business is economic and sociopolitical cataclysms.    However, this time, the former head of government and  presently, according to him, a dissident Ukrainian politician  ("I said at the news conference in the United States -- I am not  allowed to go anywhere...") failed to amuse the public. Old  cliches were mainly played back -- that Ukraine on its own will  not be able to emerge from the crisis, that it must urgently  decide with whom it is going to side, that, without Russia,  former USSR republics, or CEMA countries, we will not survive,  and that as early as in June there will be a social explosion,  not to mention economic paralysis (therefore, it is pointless to  postpone the presidential elections), that contradictions  between western and eastern Ukrainian regions are on the rise,  and this may lead to unpredictable consequences.... However, a  number of ideas voiced by him indicated that it is too early to  brand Kuchma as a steadfast political dogmatist. Since he has  not been in power and in view of the new realities, his views  have undergone a gradual evolution. For example, perhaps for  the first time in his numerous interviews, which have abounded  in eastern Ukrainian newspapers over recent months, the advocate  of Ukraine's federal-land structure came out against the  immediate territorial revolution in Ukraine and explained that  we can get "26 Crimeas" -- in the opinion of the ex-prime  minister, federal-land structure is a long-term prospect for the  state.    L. Kuchma also spoke harshly against elections to local  councils. He argued his position with the circumstance that "due  to the apparatus games of the leadership of the former Supreme  Council, we tried to return the Soviet regime, but in a more  monstrous form." Having destroyed the vertical structure and  having thereby endowed leaders of regions with powers "similar  to those of the president" in the sphere of resolving not only  economic, but also political issues, the state, in the opinion  of the claimant to the post of its leader, risks much.    With all the ardor of the former head of the Cabinet of  Ministers, L. Kuchma also touched upon prospects of the  Ukrainian economy. In his firm opinion, most radical reforms  are imminent there, since "70 percent of everything that we  manufacture takes the form of assembly parts for CIS countries."  The general of the defense industry compared Ukraine with a  huge base for the building up of the Russian military-industrial  complex and emphasized that Ukraine neither did nor does  manufacture a single type of weapon in its finite form, and that  "somebody took good care of that." For many people, the  following discovery made by Leonid Danylovych, an old-time and  frank proponent of "a closer union" between Ukraine and Russia,  came as a surprise. "I am not calling for the return to the  Soviet Union, because it is impossible. This is because in such  a situation, even if, tomorrow, we were suddenly to wake up in  the Union, Moscow will never invest anything in provinces. Nor  can Ukraine go back to the ruble zone, although such voices do  sound today among the directorate -- for this is a single policy  with regard to taxation and a single emission bank. This is  really a complete loss of statehood...."    In short, there were enough political passages to succeed in  confusing the audience on which was the true Kuchma and which  the politician, counting on obtaining as many votes as possible  at the elections and, in practice, constructing a pyramid of  political autocratic rule in Ukraine. At that point, the  audience was offered, on the rebound, a model of the following  type of administration: Leonid Kuchma did not conceal either  his admiration for the fact that [Yuriy] Andropov [former Soviet  leader] established order in the country "without a single tank"  or his disposition to "cruel" [zhorstoki] measures for  establishing order in the state. "It is not a slip of the  tongue," pointed out the politician, "not stringent [zhorstki],  but precisely cruel" and explained that, by this, he implies  unconditional fulfillment of current laws by everybody without  exception.    The speech and the answers to journalists' questions  generally attested to the well-considered nature of Kuchma's  presidency program and also to the fact that the MBR leader is  seriously counting upon this victory. However, Leonid Kuchma  did not sound like a candidate for the post from this specific  alliance, and, in Dnipropetrovsk, he does not stress his close  affinity to it, thereby giving yet another reason to think that  great politicians never remain lifelong friends with losers.  Instead, Kuchma did not persist in denying that his program  coincides with the program of left-wing forces -- he pointed out  his readiness, whenever necessary and possible, to cooperate  with Communists and even with National Radicals, however, it  looks like this is also up to certain point, because he does not  recognize coalition governments, or governments of confidence,  or such things.    "I can say that I made the trip to the United States in  order  to ask what kind of Ukraine the Americans wanted to see,"  admitted the politician, having stressed yet another time that  not only was he proceeding to power by the path beaten by the  Russian president, but that he was also confident of victory in  the elections. But will Leonid Danylovych have enough  like-minded supporters?</p>

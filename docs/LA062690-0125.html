			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> D.A. TO FILE SUIT AGAINST O.C. PROPERTY MANAGER;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: FORMER TENANTS HAVE ACCUSED THE GARDEN GROVE FIRM OF FAILING TO  RETURN SECURITY DEPOSITS.  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office announced Monday that it intends  to file an unfair-business-practice lawsuit against a property management firm  accused of denying refunds of apartment security deposits to hundreds of Orange  County renters.  </P> <P> "The extent of the problem appears to be major . . . and we certainly plan to  go to court this week," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Nolan, who is in charge of  the office's consumer and environmental protection unit.  </P> <P> On Sunday, The Times reported that at least 113 small-claims suits had been  filed against Elerding Properties of Garden Grove and that the Marine Corps had  taken the extraordinary step of removing the firm's 10 Orange County and two  Los Angeles County complexes from its approved-housing list.  </P> <P> Officials with the firm, operated by the sons of late Newport Beach millionaire  Charles E. Elerding Jr., have repeatedly declined to comment and did so again  on Monday. Arthur Morello, an attorney for the corporation, also declined to  say if officials were aware of the district attorney's investigation.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Nolan said investigators opened their inquiry two weeks ago upon  receiving two complaints from tenants who accused the firm of failing to refund  their security deposits -- typically between $300 and $650 -- as required by  state law.  </P> <P> So far, Nolan said, investigators have secured certified copies of at least 50  unsatisfied default judgments against Elerding Properties.  </P> <P> "The only reason we have not been to court is because it takes some time to get  these certified judgments from the various (small-claims) courts," she added.  </P> <P> Nolan said the district attorney will seek restitution for the affected tenants  as well as at least $125,000 in penalties -- $2,500 for each case in which  court judgments are yet to be paid. "We want to get those (default judgments)  satisfied for those former tenants," she said.  </P> <P> Several hundred other former renters have not filed suit to recover their  security deposits but have written letters of complaint to Elerding Properties,  according to two company employees who asked not to be identified for fear that  they will be fired.  </P> <P> Nolan said that she expects many of those potential victims to call the  consumer protection unit and that, "if and when we are able to secure  restitutions, they will benefit."  </P> <P> In addition to seeking restitution for the affected renters, Nolan said,  prosecutors will ask a Superior Court judge to grant a temporary injunction  restraining Elerding Properties and its officials from continuing to deny bona  fide refunds to former renters.  </P> <P> "The preliminary injunction would force (Elerding Properties) to return the  deposits in a timely fashion," Nolan explained.  </P> <P> The Orange County complexes owned by Elerding Properties include: Amberwood, in  Buena Park; Casa Madrid, in Cypress; Mountain View Apartments and Villa Viejo  Apartments, in El Toro; City Park Plaza, in Garden Grove; Huntington Apartments  and Bahia Puerto, in Huntington Beach; Tustin Arms Apartments, in Orange; and  Cerritos Apartments and Pine Tree Apartments, in Stanton.  </P> <P> The Times also reported that the Orange County Environmental Health Division  had received at least 43 complaints since January of last year that substandard  housing conditions exist at some of the firm's apartments.  </P> <P> Nolan said investigators will also look into health and safety complaints,  adding, however, that the district attorney's office is limited in the kind of  action it can take in such matters. But, she said, "we will contact the proper  regulatory agencies and have them do it."  </P></p>

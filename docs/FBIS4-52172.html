			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Fay Case: Note the Disquiet"] </F>   [Text] Based on calls to our offices and a limited street  sampling, the gut feeling of a fair number of Singaporeans about  the Michael Fay conclusion seems to be regret that reducing the  number of caning strokes from six to four was giving in to  American pressure, regardless of how the Government explains  geopolitical realities. Most people, it is noted, accept the  rationale implied in the president's response to the clemency  appeal. But the government must acknowledge that this view is  liable to gain currency: the United States government wanted  nothing less than commutation, which rightly was a non-starter  where Singapore was concerned, so why the need to compromise?  In wanting to meet President Bill Clinton part of the way, as  the government says, it has dismayed a section of Singaporean  opinion which holds that the authorities should have stuck it  out as it has the commanding heights in moralism and  jurisdictional rights. Neither could it mollify Washington and  the merchants of hysteria and disinformation in the American  liberal establishment, whose campaign against Singapore has been  asking that the basis of its penology be scrapped as it does not  conform to American values. That said, this was, still,  arguably the least controversial approach to a troublesome  episode. There are a number of reasons.    The first, which is crucial as it bears directly on the rule  of law, is that a legal principle had not been subverted. Fay  was sentenced to be caned because he had vandalised property.  He received swift justice yesterday. The Americans offended  Singaporean sensibilities when they moved heaven and earth to  save his skin but Fay was not spared the punishment; reducing  the number of strokes fell within the realm of constitutional  discretion. This reinforces the message the government has been  consistent about since the case broke, which is that the law is  inviolate and nationality-blind. Would foreigners please note.    A second factor has to do with balancing domestic political  realities with the conduct of foreign relations. Not caning Fay  would not just have made a mockery of the law, it would injure  the Government's mandate in managing the state. Preserving the  integrity of the judicial system, then, is the fount of the  moral right to ruIe. A dogged adherence to this position could,  however, expose the government to charges of being not  sufficiently mindful of external factors in a world rendered  interdependent by trade, security and diplomatic obligations.  That is the substance of the government's concession. Much  play is made in the official statement of the good relations  with the US and of its economic and security contributions to  Asia-Pacific stability. To those in favour of giving the  Americans some latitude, taking into account the special  relations between the two countries, the justification would  make more palatable an uncharacteristic pliability. But this  would barely pass muster with those Singaporeans who are either  incensed by gorilla heaviness of some American media advocates  whose chutzpah they see as exceeded only by their ignorance, or  view the trade and diplomatic angle as irrelevant to a judicial  matter.    In the end, this has been a case of exercising political  judgment. Time will tell if the government had acted correctly.  For now it would have to take note of the unhappiness expressed  by concerned Singaporeans who had backed it fully in taking the  hard line, not out of jingoism but on a point of principle. But  more troubling is the opening its decision would provide for  special interests and foreign governments to intercede on behalf  of their nationals in controversial cases in the future, or  cases with "media possibilities". The government says this is  "an exceptional decision which will not be a precedent for  future cases". The commitment is one which Singaporeans will  expect it to uphold -- come hell or high water.</p>

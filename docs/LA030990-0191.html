			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HAITI TURMOIL GROWS OVER GIRL'S DEATH;  </P> <P> CARIBBEAN: STREETS DESERTED AS DEMONSTRATIONS SPREAD IN CAPITAL. OFFICIAL  DENIES AVRIL WILL RESIGN.  </P> <P> Hundreds of people, some throwing rocks, blocked streets in the capital today  on the fourth day of protests triggered by the army's killing of a schoolgirl.  </P> <P> The normally bustling Port-au-Prince, a city of 1 million, was virtually  deserted this morning, with schools and stores closed. Protesters blocked all  main streets, and rocks were thrown at cars on the seafront.  </P> <P> On Thursday, thousands of people demonstrated in the capital and several  provincial towns, setting fires and calling for the resignation of Haiti's  military leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.  </P> <P> Three people were killed in the protests Thursday, including a soldier beaten  to death by a mob, independent radio reports said. Fifteen people were injured  in clashes with soldiers, according to witnesses and a doctor at the state  hospital in Port-au-Prince.  </P> <P> The government has made no comment on the unrest, but a high-ranking government  official said today that Avril has no plans to resign.  </P> <P> "Avril is ready to make concessions, but a hasty departure is out of the  question," said the official, speaking on condition he not be further  identified. He gave no indication what concessions were contemplated.  </P> <P> Avril indicated Wednesday he would resign if it was "the will of the people"  but said that would cause "revolution and chaos."  </P> <P> The protests were triggered by the killing of 11-year-old Rosaline Vaval Monday  in the town of Petit Goave, where 10,000 mourners attended her burial Thursday.  The girl was shot by a soldier breaking up an anti-government demonstration.  </P> <P> Radio Lumiere, a Protestant radio station, said today that a mob went on a  rampage in Petit Goave, a town of 15,000, on Tuesday night, burning an army  outpost, ransacking a government building and the mayor's house.  </P> <P> In Gonaives, a western port city of 40,000, mobs plundered the house of Mayor  Alexandre Louissaint, a Baptist pastor, and ransacked his church and a  government building, according to a resident who spoke anonymously.  </P> <P> Earlier, about 3,000 people, shouting "Liberty!" and slogans against Avril,  marched on the Presidential Palace in Port-au-Prince. Soldiers then fired in  the air and beat demonstrators with billy clubs.  </P> <P> "The will of the people is for Avril to step down," said a communique released  Thursday night by a coalition of 11 opposition parties that earlier had called  on Haitians to rise against the military government.  </P></p>

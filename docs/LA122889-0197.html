			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SPANIEL DINES FROM SILVER PLATE  </P> <P> Staff at a plush restaurant found themselves serving turkey on a silver platter  to a dog whose name was chosen in a raffle over hundreds of human contestants.  </P> <P> The cocker spaniel, appropriately named Lucky, was entered in the competition  by his owner, Phyllis Walmsley of Shanklin, on the Isle of Wight, off England's  southern coast.  </P> <P> Hundreds of people entered the raffle organized by the 1st Shanklin Scouts  group, but Lucky was the winner of the first prize of a Christmas meal at a top  restaurant on the island.  </P> <P> Alan Priddle, owner of the Cottage Restaurant, said today that he settled Lucky  down at a table with a platter of turkey Dec. 18. The restaurant owner skipped  the potatoes and turnip.  </P> <P> "We thought we'd just stick to the meat," Priddle said. "He ate all the turkey,  yes."  </P> <P> He added: "The dog was very well behaved. The only time he growled was when we  tried to put a party hat on his head."  </P></p>

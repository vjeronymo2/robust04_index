			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paulo Sotero] </F>   [Text] Washington -- An effort of almost three years of  difficult negotiations -- which were marked by the turbulence of  the Collor era and by five replacements at the head of the  Finance Ministry -- will end today in New York, with the signing  of an agreement for reducing and rescheduling the debt that  Brazil owes to private foreign creditors.    Central Bank President Pedro Malan, who designed the  strategy  of negotiations with the banks and led the implementation of  that strategy, will be in New York to supervise the formality  during which old debt certificates will be exchanged for  rescheduled debt bonds, making the agreement come into force.  No ceremonies have been scheduled. The agreement will be  announced through a press communique which might be followed by  a brief conference -- which has yet to be confirmed -- hosted by  Malan and Citibank Vice President William R. Rhodes, who  represented the banks at the negotiations.    Official Brazilian sources and sources from the creditor  banks committee yesterday said they do not believe that U.S.  investor Kenneth Dart, who owes 3.4 percent of the Brazilian  foreign debt, will try to block the agreement. If he attempts  to do so he will cause a still steeper drop in the value of his  Brazilian certificates, which are worth approximately $1.4  billion and have suffered a strong devaluation over the past 45  days as a consequence of the storm that high interest rates in  the United States has provoked on the foreign debt's secondary  market.    Early this week in Guadalajara, where Malan represented  Brazil at an Inter-American Development Bank meeting, he said  that the doors of the Central Bank remain open to Dart. "Yet  the Central Bank will be ready to respond if he attacks," Malan  added. A platoon of Central Bank and banks committee lawyers,  who are engaged in clarifying a lot of the technical details of  the agreement, is in a state of readiness.  <H5>  Option </H5>   The main U.S. manufacturer of thermal insulators [isopor],  Dart bought the Brazilian debt papers with a discount of more  than 70 percent, hoping to earn hundreds of millions of dollars  with the revaluation of these papers. His initial option was  for the capitalization bonds, one of the six refinancing papers  offered by Brazil, and he has for months refused to accept the  final terms of the renegotiation, which have already been  endorsed by the other creditors (more than 750). All creditors  agreed to a second option, which was provided for in the  contracts, and invested at least 35 percent of their papers in  discount bonds.    Asked about the plans of his client, Dart's lawyer in New  York, Martin London, replied mysteriously: "No comment." Even  though Dart is a peculiar person -- he recently changed his U.S.  citizenship for Belizean citizenship, and moved his residence to  this small Central American country to stop paying income tax to  Washington -- financial executives yesterday said that he would  not burn money or take foolish steps. Consequently, there is  hope that the agreement will actually be concluded.    Just in case, the Central Bank has over the past few days  adopted several measures to protect Brazilian assets abroad from  a possible court-ordered embargo. Government legal advisers  have said that from a technical viewpoint it would be very  difficult for Dart to justify an action of that kind before a  judge, because of the terms of the contracts. They are sure,  however, that Dart will take legal action against the Central  Bank after implementation of the agreement. The advisers are  getting ready to reply, and they believe that Dart will also  find it difficult to convince a judge of the merit of his  complaint.</p>

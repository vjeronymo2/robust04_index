			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Simpson aims to accelerate change at Lucas: New strategy will focus on core aerospace, automotive and electronics activities Mr George Simpson has measured up Lucas Industries for a new suit of clothes designed to permit the group to sit comfortably at the table of the great and the good of the automotive and aerospace sectors. Yesterday the new chief executive of one of the UK's best, but not always flatteringly, known international engineering groups displayed his new regime. Announcements of new divestments, restructuring provisions, stock value revaluations and goodwill write-offs suggested a new broom sweeping clean. Here was a new management team taking the nasty financial decisions which would be more difficult after three years of responsibility. There were the hints of the Simpson style, honed at Rover, where the corporate culture shifted to the notion that customers need to like the cars they buy. 'There's been a little bit of a tendency at Lucas to have technology for technology's sake,' he said, adding that a 'refocusing of the businesses will allow us to do things more quickly than we did before.' Mr Simpson said: 'Lucas has been held back by too many businesses in the portfolio which have been underperforming.' But by getting rid of small businesses on the edge of Lucas's mainline automotive, aerospace and electronic activities, Mr Simpson is doing nothing new. He is following a restructuring policy which started with the provision, during 1991-92, of Pounds 88.4m, which has all been used. In another respect, his arrival suggests continuum rather than any break with the past. He has the blessing of Sir Anthony Gill, his retiring predecessor. Mr Simpson was, said Sir Anthony yesterday, 'worth waiting for'. Indeed, given the size of Sir Anthony's shareholding in Lucas, Mr Simpson is the guardian of his pension. Mr Simpson's aim is to accelerate change, to use the technological base of Lucas more forcefully. 'What has been missing has been consistent financial success,' he noted. Underlying that is the fear that unless there can be forged a closer alliance between technology and revenue, Lucas will be picking up the crumbs of the major players in the automotive and aerospace industries. These players are reducing the number of their component suppliers. They are forming long-term relationships, but at a price. They expect them to play a design and supply role which demands both the ability to fund front-end development and the manufacturing skills which continually drive down costs. Lucas intends to play in that group; thus it needs to expand. The main restructuring effort at Lucas is directed at the aerospace activities precisely because they need, in Mr Simpson's view, to be welded into a base on which there can be expansion to give Lucas more weight in the industry. Emphasis on the automotive side is different. There the problem is organising enough capacity to meet demands for diesel fuel systems which already exist. Technology has run ahead of manufacturing capacity. Additional financial power - and Mr Simpson thinks it will take two years for the full effects of the restructuring to come through - would take Lucas out of the league of takeover targets and into the ranks of the predators. Lucas has been the subject of persistent bid speculation by larger and more powerful companies. As it is, the costs of staying a supplier, not of parts but of systems, are such that Lucas will seek collaboration with other groups on particular projects. Mergers have been ruled out, if only on the grounds that such an idea would create substantial regulatory difficulties. Lucas and Bosch of Germany, for example, between them already have overwhelming dominance in the market for diesel engine fuel injection systems. Mr Simpson's plans emerge from a review of Lucas since he took over last April. It has already led to management changes which broke up portfolios of businesses into product-dominated groups, each with a managing director. He has chosen a good time to make changes, 'to create a new impetus', as he put it. The fortunes of Lucas, regardless of internal changes, are turning. The market for automotive products has been improving to the extent that Lucas was able to push up margins by two percentage points last year. The aerospace market's return to health is unlikely for 1 1/2 -2 years, but Lucas thinks that it has at least bottomed out. Margins in the automotive sector were 5 per cent while margins in the aerospace business were 2 1/2 per cent. It is an indication of the distance Mr Simpson wants to travel when he said that 'double digit margins would be fantastic.'

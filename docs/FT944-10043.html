			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BAe extends offer for VSEL British Aerospace yesterday extended its offer for VSEL, the nuclear submarine maker, after attracting acceptances of just 0.4 per cent of the shares, writes Richard Wolffe. BAe's offer of 2.747 shares for each VSEL share, and its cash alternative of Pounds 11.40, were accepted by shareholders representing a total of 165,645 shares. More than 115,000 shares came from VSEL directors, who have made irrevocable undertakings to accept BAe. BAe said its offer would remain open until November 24, but closed the cash alternative. Its own shares rose 4p to 461p yesterday, increasing the value of its offer to Pounds 12.66 per share. VSEL shares added 5p to Pounds 13.73. GEC's cash offer, which was launched two weeks after BAe's bid, stands at Pounds 14 a share. Mr Den Dover, Conservative MP for Chorley, yesterday called for GEC's bid to be referred to the MMC. He said MPs were concerned that GEC's bid was 'only a springboard' for a bid for BAe, which could give GEC control of the UK defence industry.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> In another move against avant-garde art exhibits in Beijing, Chinese police  have raided a controversial exhibition of nude paintings influenced by Tibetan  Buddhism, artists told Reuters on Sunday. The raid came just days after a  controversial exhibition of nude paintings in Beijing's national art gallery  was closed down for the second time by police. Uniformed policemen confiscated  six paintings from the Beijing Artists Gallery on Saturday evening and  questioned artist Cao Yong about their content, a witness said. The exhibition  had been on display to the public for five days and was being packed up when  the police arrived. Earlier Saturday, officials from the legal department of  Beijing's cultural office visited Cao's exhibition to tell him that members of  the public had complained about his work. (One painting shows a heap of naked  women below Buddhist monk-like figures, and another depicts a woman dragging  two men out of a fire by their genitalia.)  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 16 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela  was "not keen to be an additional person" trying to resolve the  conflict in Rwanda, he told a media conference at the Union  Buildings in Pretoria on Thursday [16 June]. With three  experienced presidents already trying to mediate in the conflict  it was not advisable to bring in a newcomer, he said. It had  not been possible for him to mediate in the situation because of  the large number of bilateral meetings in which he had  participated while in Tunisia for the Organisation of African  Unity's summit. However, he would like to hear what the various  Rwandan parties had to say.    Mr Mandela said the cabinet had decided to provide  humanitarian aid to Rwanda through medical assistance and funds.    South Africa had been asked to supply 50 armoured personnel  carriers with drivers to the United Nations for use in Rwanda  "but this will have to be investigated", the president said.    Several churches in South Africa had raised supplies for  Rwanda.    Referring to Angola, President Mandela adopted a similar  stance to that on Rwanda, saying "as a newcomer I cannot take  over initiatives started by others". President Joachim Chissano  of Mozambique had already assisted Angola.    Mr Mandela said he had met Mr Chissano, Angola's President  Eduardo dos Santos and President Mabuto Sese Seko of Zaire on  Wednesday. "It seems there is a realisation that they (Angola)  should form a government of national unity," he said.    Intervention in Lesotho was also being investigated by a  task  force appointed to investigate the situation in that country.  "We are discussing the matter and co-ordinating with the  secretary- general of the UN, the secretary-general of the  Commonwealth and the OAU," Mr Mandela said. "As soon as our  investigations are completed we will announce the decision," he  said.</p>

			<p>-- FOR OOFFICIAL USE ONLY  <F P=103> OW2405224894 </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> BFN     [Excerpt] On 23 May, general interpellations on the  government-proposed budget bill for fiscal 1994 began at the  House of Representatives' Budget Committee. The committee  session opened at 10:00 AM and was attended by all Cabinet  members, including Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. This was the  first full Diet deliberation following the Hata Cabinet's  inauguration. The first interpellator was Takashi Fukaya, a  Budget Committee director and member of the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP]. He questioned the government's views on the  relationships between "universal security" and "collective  security." In response, the prime minister said: "Universal  security is a bit broader in concept than collective security,  as defined by the UN Charter. But since collective security  constitutes an important factor of universal security, I think  it is almost the same as universal security." In this way, the  prime minister made clear that the concepts of collective and  universal security are the same. Moreover, he said the term  "international security" "could be used the same as universal  security in meaning."    Asked whether the Constitution overrides the UN Charter in  deciding policies such as international contributions, the prime  minister said: "The Constitution prevails over international  agreements and thus, it overrides the UN Charter." He also  said: "Japan will act within the Constitution's framework"  although Chapter Seven of the UN Charter calls for military  actions by member states.    [passage omitted on reasons for the delay in holding  deliberations and on another question raised by Fukaya  concerning recent remarks by Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party)  Secretary General Ozawa that were considered to be disrespectful  toward women]</p>

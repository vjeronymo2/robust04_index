			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has said that the Cyprus  problem is speedily advancing toward a decision. Pointing out  that the Greek Cypriots are taking unilateral steps to join the  European Union [EU], Denktas added: This course of events will  quickly take us somewhere. We should be morally and financially  ready for this.    Addressing the Turkish Peace Operation War Veterans  Association's 10th General Council meeting in Lefkosa [Nicosia]  today, Denktas said that more solidarity and unity are needed at  the current stage of the Cyprus problem. Denktas said the Greek  Cypriots have, with an unacceptable determination and  insistence, begun to take steps toward joining the EU while  Greece is trying to increase its territorial waters to 12  nautical miles. He added that the people's complaints regarding  land registry problems should be solved in a bid to put a stop  to this development. Denktas called on the government to open a  new page and give land ownership to the people, adding that he  has been fighting for this all along. Pointing out that he is  speaking on behalf of the people and that his demands are on the  half of the people, Denktas added: If this is not done, then I  will choose to be with the people. He noted that one cannot  achieve anything by saying that the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus will exist, adding that as long as the people do not say  this is my country, land, and house, then nothing much can be  achieved by empty words. He asked Prime Minister Hakki Atun to  grant the people the ownership of their land and real estate.    Also addressing the meeting, Atun said he shares Denktas'  views and sentiments, adding that it is his duty to solve the  problems of war veterans. He noted that priority will be given  to the land registry problem, stressing that it will be solved  soon. [passage omitted]</p>

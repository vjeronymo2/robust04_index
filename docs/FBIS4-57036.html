			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The indigenous groups living in the eastern part  of Bolivia will for the first time have an opportunity to  participate in planning policies for the development of their  people, who number approximately 500,000. A consultative group  that groups together all of the grassroots indigenous  organizations represented in the Confederation of Indigenous  People of Eastern Bolivia has been created.    The consultative group will meet every so often with the  Ethnic Affairs Secretariat to discuss and approve programs. It  is worth noting that the secretariat respects the indigenous  peoples' organizational structure, which is divided into three  groups: a people's directorate, an intermediate organization,  and the grassroots, with which the dialogue must be held through  the mechanisms established for that purpose.

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Limiting security risk The Basle-based committee of banking regulators has not been idle since its capital adequacy rules were published in 1988. The complex standard proposed last week is based on market risk rather than credit risk and amounts to another turn of the screw. Banks which trade bonds, equities and currencies will in future have to hold more capital. If that blows some froth off the foreign exchange and derivatives markets, so much the better. But the new rules will have less impact than the earlier Basle guidelines, which arguably encouraged banks to buy government bonds rather than lend to companies. Depending on the level of market risk on its books, the proposals might lift the average international bank's capital requirement one percentage point from the current 8 per cent of risk-weighted assets. Most already exceed that target, so liquidity in securities markets where banks play a leading role should not suffer. There is anyway the separate promise that banks will be allowed to net off credit exposures to each other. Such a relaxation of the 1988 rules would free up capital, especially for banks active in swaps. Bankers will doubtless still grumble that the regulations do not take into account the sophisticated hedging strategies they put in place to guard against market movements. More importantly, the Basle proposals are tougher in some respects than last year's EC directive on capital adequacy. How Basle will be reconciled with Brussels, and whether tough-minded regulators such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission are prepared to relax their harsher rules, remain open questions. Without harmony among regulators, capital will simply flow to where regulation is most relaxed.</p>

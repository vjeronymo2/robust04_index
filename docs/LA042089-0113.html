			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Striking workers and radical students fought police in at least 10 South Korean  cities, and protesters in Seoul threw a score of firebombs into a U.S. military  base. Thousands of students hurled rocks and firebombs at police on the  anniversary of a student uprising April 19, 1960, that brought down the  authoritarian government of President Syngman Rhee. In Seoul, protesters hurled  about 20 firebombs into Camp Isabell, a U.S. Army storage facility. American  military officials reported minor damage. U.S. facilities have been the focus  of attacks by students pressing for the withdrawal of the 40,000 American  troops based in South Korea.  </P></p>

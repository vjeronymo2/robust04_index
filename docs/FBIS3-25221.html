Reacting to a NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA  (NAN) report on a fresh attack by Cameroonian gendarmes on  Nigerians in the Bakassi Peninsula in south-eastern Akwa Ibom  State, Akinyemi said the "Maroua Declaration" signed by former  Nigerian head of state Yakubu Gowon and President Ahmadu Ahidjo  in the 70s, should be revisited.    "Arising out of that (declaration), where is the boundary?  Asked Akinyemi, who as director-general of the Nigerian  Institute of International Affairs, was a member of a Nigerian  task-force set up in the late 80s "to examine and prepare a  report on the Bakassi Peninsula in all its ramifications". The  former minister said that both countries could use the various  organs set up for conflict resolution in the world. "But until  it is resolved, if they (Cameroon) put their troops there, you  put your troops there, too", declared Akinyemi, whose comments  were reported by the press in Lagos on Thursday.    NAN reported Tuesday that some 18,000 Nigerians had been  forced to flee their homes in the latest gendarmes' attack.  Nigeria responded to a similar attack last December by  deploying troops to the Bakassi Peninsula. Foreign Minister  Baba Gana Kingibe also visited Cameroon over the incident, after  which both counties agreed to set up a joint patrol to stem  future border clashes.</p>

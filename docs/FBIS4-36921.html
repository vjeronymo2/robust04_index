			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Our country's foreign minister, who is in  Germany at present, met the German foreign minister today to  discuss bilateral relations and regional and international  issues. We draw your attention to our correspondent's report  from Bonn.    [Unidentified correspondent] Foreign Affairs Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati met and conferred with German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel. In this meeting, which lasted for over two hours,  bilateral relations in various fields, the expansion of economic  ties between the two countries, as well as regional and  international issues were discussed. [passage omitted]    At the end of the meeting, the German foreign minister took  part in an interview with the Voice and Vision of the Islamic  Republic of Iran correspondent, and considered the talks as  positive and constructive.    Our country's foreign minister also spoke to us at the  conclusion of the meeting. Referring to the outcome of his  talks, he said:    [Begin Velayati recording] In the name of God, the merciful,  the compassionate. The meeting with his excellency Mr. Kinkel  was very positive and constructive. In this long meeting we  discussed and reviewed relations between Iran and Germany in  various areas. One of the key topics for our discussion was our  bilateral cooperation during the forthcoming term of German  presidency of the European Union. It was decided that such  cooperation should take a more serious aspect once Germany  assumes the EU presidency. In view of the fact that after  Germany, France, and then Spain take over the presidency of the  EU, we seek to give a more positive tone to our talks with these  three countries. In today's meeting, however, we decided to  hold meetings during the forthcoming UN General Assembly in New  York between the foreign ministers of the said countries and the  ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] member countries.    Cultural and economic cooperation between Iran and Germany  will be pursued in a better and more positive way from now on.  Mr. Kinkel is busy with elections right now, and we hope that  the present German Government can continue and enhance its  future cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran and the  countries of our region, especially the ECO members.

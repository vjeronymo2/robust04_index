The agreement was reached on Tuesday night [15 March] after  Spain and Portugal accepted an extra quota of 6,000 tonnes of  fish from Norwegian waters. The EU will take control of Norway's  fishing grounds in 1998.    The prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, said Norway had  achieved a fair deal. "I believe we have gone a long way to  meeting the goals we set ourselves," she said. A referendum is  due to be held later this year.    Jan Henry Olsen, the fisheries minister, said during  negotiations that Norway had "not one single cod" to give the  EU, but had to give way to placate Spain and Portugal.    Mr Olsen, who had long been an opponent of EU membership,  said he had been converted to the yes camp by the merits of the  deal.    But Einar Hepsoe, chairman of the Norwegian fishermen's  association, said the deal was a disaster, which gave "no  guarantee for our futures, nor for our children's futures."    Although Norway's fishing fleets employ only 26,000 people  and contribute less than 3 percent of GDP (Gross Domestic  Product), the industry is a precious national symbol. Fishing  communities are dotted along the 1,700-mile coastline and  keeping them alive through generous state aid is fundamental to  government policy.    Although the EU has promised to adopt Norwegian rules for  control of catches and resource management after 1998, fishermen  are anxious about what happens when EU fishery policy is  reviewed in 2002. They fear EU vessels will be allowed into  Norway's 12 mile exclusion zone, where 70 percent of the  nation's fish is caught.    Discontent in fishing communities is mirrored among farmers,  who face the loss of high state subsidies. Farming  organisations claim half of Norway's 90,000 agricultural workers  will be forced out of business in an open market.    Bjorn Iversen, leader of the Norwegian Farmers' Union, said  farmers would unite with fishermen in campaigning for a no vote  in the referendum.    In 1972, Norwegians voted against membership of the then EEC  after Brussels adopted a common fisheries policy without  consulting Norway. The political fallout split the ruling Labour  Party.    Opinion polls do not augur well for a positive result now.  Around 44 percent oppose membership and 28 percent are in  favour, although the gap has narrowed in recent weeks.</p>

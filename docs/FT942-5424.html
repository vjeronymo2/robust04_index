			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Brussels set to revive rescue plan for steel: Compromise reached after Delors intervenes The European Commission looks set next week to perform a U-turn over its rescue plan for the steel industry, confounding predictions that the plan was dead and buried. Senior officials predicted the Commission was likely to back a fresh effort to revive the steel plan under the joint auspices of Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner. A compromise under review in Brussels calls for the Italian government to repackage proposals for subsidising plant closures in the northern Brescia region, raising hopes that the steel plan's ambitious target of cutting 19m tonnes in capacity can be met. Just three weeks ago, Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner for competition policy and co-architect of the steel rescue, pronounced the plan 'dead'. He criticised colleagues for voting down his proposals for monitoring the Bresciani cuts, and said he would play no part in future talks. Mr Van Miert's decision to dissociate himself from the steel plan led to a crisis within the Commission and baffled European steel producers. Despite a lack of enthusiasm within the private sector, most steel groups argued the plan provided a useful framework for cutting excess capacity and curbing state aid. Mr Delors is believed to have held talks with Mr Van Miert yesterday in an effort to bring him back on board. 'This is all about saving Van Miert's face,' said one senior official. Under a complex compromise, the Commission is likely to examine a report on the European steel industry, which includes a request to the Italian government to refine its aid proposals for the Bresciani plants in order to produce cuts of between 5m and 6m tonnes in capacity. The Commission will also consider Mr Van Miert's request for the preparation of possible legal proceedings against the Italians for paying unfair subsidies to producers. However, officials said the inclusion of possible proceedings was a token gesture. The real message from the Commission was a request to Rome to repackage its aid proposals for the Bresciani steel mills. Mr Van Miert's original plan was outvoted after legal objections from Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator. He questioned the principle of allowing state aid for partial closures of steel companies, and warned that it could damage his efforts to reach a multilateral steel agreement with the US. Yesterday, officials close to Mr Van Miert questioned whether Sir Leon would risk bearing the blame for a second collapse of the steel plan, not least because his long-shot campaign to succeed Mr Delors depended heavily on Italian government support.</p>

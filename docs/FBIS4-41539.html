			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev June 25 TASS -- "In keeping with the  current legislation all investigative and operational activities  will affect people's rights in one way or another. Without this  it will be impossible to fight crime," Russian  Counterintelligence Service Chief Sergey Stepashin said.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday,  Stepashin said that "any operational activities inevitably limit  the rights of criminals. This is an axiom. In this connection  I would like to say again that I am for violation of the `right'  of criminals to kill, rob, rape and encroach upon the rights of  other people and their life. I am for such limitations,  provided all procedural norms ensuring the calm life of the  citizens of Russia are observed."</p>

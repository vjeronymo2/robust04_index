			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> A LONGER LIFE FOR PRODUCE?  </P> <P> Scientists are working on a safe-to-eat, nearly invisible coating made from  milk that could dramatically extend the shelf life of fruit and vegetables, the  California Agriculture Department announced last week.  </P> <P> Chemist Attila E. Pavlath of the department said that in tests of an  experimental coating made from the milk protein casein, small pieces of sliced  and peeled apple dipped in the coating stayed fresh for several days while  unprotected pieces shriveled and turned brown within a few hours.  </P> <P> Pavlath said that scientists hope to eventually make the film thinner and to  produce films that "the tongue cannot feel and the taste buds cannot detect"  from proteins in soybeans, corn and wheat.  </P> <P> "Some people who like fresh produce don't necessarily want to spend time in  their kitchen washing, slicing, peeling, pitting and paring," Pavlath said.  "It's part of the trend toward buying food that is ready to use and easy to  store."  </P> <P> A successful coating would allow more types of produce to be pre-sliced and  packaged and, unlike waxes on cucumbers or other edible coatings such as the  "skin" on sausages, new films could be modified to add flavors or colors to  standard fare, Pavlath said.  </P></p>

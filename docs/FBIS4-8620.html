			<p>BFN     [Text] An agreement on the release of prisoners from  prisons under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the  Croat Defense Council has been signed.    Those charged with or sentenced for the most serious  criminal  offenses will not be released if the signatories show the Red  Cross by Sunday that charges have been pressed or sentences  passed. An international committee of experts is to be founded  to interview those accused of the most serious criminal acts  within 30 days and examine all evidence relevant to the criminal  procedures. After that the committee will make decisions on the  further detention of the accused. The agreement says that the  Red Cross will determine the dynamics and mode of implementation  of the prisoner release.</p>

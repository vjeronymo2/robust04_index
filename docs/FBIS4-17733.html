			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- The State Duma faction of  the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] ruled on Tuesday  that its leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will personally take a  decision whether to sign or not the memorandum on civic peace  and accord on behalf of the faction.    The main argument in favour of this rather unusual decision  was that Zhirinovskiy's "intuition has never let him down in  such cases".    In turn, Zhirinovskiy said that he will take the final  decision on Thursday morning (the date scheduled for a ceremony  of signing the accord) "maybe after consulting" his party  leadership.    The LDPR faction expressed doubt that Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin has the right to sign the memorandum on behalf of the  lower chamber of the Russian Parliament. The faction is going  to submit their doubts for Duma's consideration on Wednesday.</p>

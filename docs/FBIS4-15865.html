			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Igor Porshnev, </F> Vitaly Trubetskoi and others]    [Text] The Russo-Latvian summit, scheduled for April 20, is  out of the question until Russian President Boris Yeltsin  formally disavows his order on the setting up of military bases  in Latvia, that country's Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs told  Interfax. He added that even contacts of state delegations were  impossible.    Latvia cannot be satisfied with the explanations provided by  Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev or Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev who did not write the order or even know of its  existence, Andrejevs emphasized.    In his words, Latvia's painful response to the incident is  largely attributable to the domestic political situation in the  country. Andrejevs said that the Russian authorities had to be  aware of the fact that the document on military bases in Latvia  had fueled the Latvian radical opposition which had been taking  a dim view of the agreements between the two countries. Now  President Guntis Ulmanis had to do his best to have the passion  calm and find the best possible solution.    Andrejevs said that it would never be late to hold a summit  and sign the initialed agreement on withdrawal of Russian troops  from Latvia. He admitted that even though the incident with the  presidential order had not contributed to better Russo-Latvian  relations, Latvia had no alternative to moving forward to  signing an agreement with Russia.</p>

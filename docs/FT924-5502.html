			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Tate sweetened by market growth MR NEIL Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle, said yesterday that the world sugar market was growing at 2 per cent a year, while the starch market was growing at 6 per cent a year. The growth in sugar consumption was equivalent to a new market the size of the UK opening each year. He said this gave the group plenty of opportunities to grow. During the year to the end of September, it recorded Pounds 172m of capital expenditure, up from a normal level of Pounds 100m to Pounds 115m, while another Pounds 61m was invested in buying companies or setting up joint ventures, such as in Hungary and Slovenia. This included a Pounds 9m investment in a venture owned by a consortium of food processors which would look at opportunities in eastern Europe and Russia. This, a higher dividend, and the expectation of a bounce back in profits, lifted the share price 12p to 368p yesterday despite a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 230.8m to Pounds 189.5m. The previous year's figures were restated for a change in accounting for post-retirement benefits which cost Pounds 3.8m in 1990-91 and Pounds 4.3m in 1991-92. Profits were hit by Pounds 15.7m of reorganisation and redundancy costs, up from Pounds 6m, and a Pounds 7.1m write-off of start-up costs and stock write-downs related to sucralose, the group's new low-calorie sweetener which is awaiting approval from the US authorities. However, there were non-recurring gains including a Pounds 3.3m write-back of a provision no longer required, and a Pounds 11.7m refund, including interest, of US tax. At the pre-interest level profits fell from Pounds 280.5m to Pounds 237.4m. Within that the Canadian sugar division saw profits down to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 10.1m), and in the US to Pounds 30.9m (49.3m). In the UK sugar profits rose to Pounds 50.3m (Pounds 49.9m), in Portugal to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 9.5m) and in Australia to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 3.3m). The group's sugar business in other areas made Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.4m). In cereal sweeteners and starches, North American profits fell to Pounds 65.3m (Pounds 96.8m), but in Europe profits were up from Pounds 51.1m to Pounds 54m. Sugar by-products, such as animal feeds, increased to Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 17.5m). Other activities such as reinsurance which was hit by Hurricane Andrew, lost Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 9.4m loss). Movements in exchange rates cost Pounds 3.6m off pre-interest profits. But this is expected to swing the other way in the current year with every 1 cent movement in the sterling/dollar rate worth Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 700,000 to profits. The balance sheet had net debt of Pounds 641.9m at the year end, gearing of 89 per cent, up from 81 per cent a year earlier. However, Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said the group borrowed at fine rates of interest and most of the debt had a five to 10 year maturity. The 1992-93 financial year should see gearing fall, he said.</p>

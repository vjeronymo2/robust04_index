			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Directors devote effort by the hour: The partnership between the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils and the government is one of the most ambitious forged with the private sector. The performance of the Tecs, which handle Pounds 2.3bn of public money each year, will help determine the private sector's willingness to push ahead with other programmes BEING an unpaid director of one of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales is a time-consuming activity. A total of 56 per cent of the 506 respondents to the survey of 1,220 Tec directors said they spent more than three hours a week on Tec-related activities. Twenty eight per cent of those said the Tec took more than six hours a week - an increase from 16 per cent last year. The recession has caused many directors, particularly from the private sector - who have to be of chief-executive status - to question their commitment to outside activities. But only one said he was leaving his Tec because of the time factor. And 91 per cent said they intended to spend more than two years with their Tec - only 45 per cent expressed such a committment last year. Representatives of trade unions, who made up nearly 5 per cent of the survey, were as prepared to stay the course as the private-sector executives, who accounted for 68 per cent of respondents. The remainder were public-sector officers. Most found the overall progress of Tecs to be satisfactory but only 17 per cent were very satisfied compared with 26 per cent last year. Ten per cent said progress was very unsatisfactory compared with 7 per cent last year. Union and public-sector representatives were the most critical.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Modest fall in German jobless rate WEST German unemployment fell by only a modest 0.1 per cent last month in spite of expectations that economic activity would pick up after the summer break. The number of people out of work in west Germany last month was 2.3m, down 26,800 on August. The unemployment rate fell from 7.5 per cent in August to an unadjusted 7.4 per cent. This compares with a 5.8 per cent rate in September last year. 'The reduction in the number of employed people has continued unabated until now,' Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the federal labour office, said. However, the number of people put on short-time work again increased, jumping by nearly 200,000 to 590,400 last month, and on an adjusted basis the number out of work rose to 2.38m from 2.34m in August. Short-time workers are defined as employees who stay on their companies payrolls but work less than the normal 38 hours a week. Part of the salary is covered by the federal labour office. In eastern Germany, the unemployment rate fell slightly from 15.4 per cent in August to 15.2 per cent last month. The number of people out of work in the east is now 1.1m. The number on short-time work remained unchanged at about 143,000, which is some 100,000 more than the same time last year. The figures confirmed warnings by economists that the recession was lasting longer than expected because of continuing low domestic demand. Leaders of German business associations have been cautioning against government statements forecasting recovery in the coming months. Meanwhile, the number of people in job creation schemes continued its steady decrease. The federal labour office, faced with a growing deficit now standing at DM27bn (Pounds 10.9bn), stopped creating new state-subsidised schemes earlier this year. Just over 39,000 people were in job creation schemes in the west, nearly half the number recorded in the same month a year ago. In eastern Germany, 1.4m people were in retraining programmes, down from 1.8m last year. The labour office said it had saved DM400m in the last six months after introducing stricter controls over recipients of unemployment benefits.</p>

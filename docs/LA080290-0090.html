			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> LARROCHA, ZINMAN AT BOWL  </P> <P> Strength and delicacy, substance and lightness, steel and gossamer -- the  familiar antipodes in the musics of Mozart and Ravel -- correspond exactly, one  has learned over the years, with the achievements and predilections of both  Alicia de Larrocha and David Zinman.  </P> <P> The Spanish pianist and American conductor again revealed these virtues at the  Hollywood Bowl Tuesday night in a Mozart-Ravel program of uncommon thrust and  accomplishment. Even those harboring antipathy to outdoor concerts might have  been moved by this demonstration of expertise at work -- on a night when the  sound system was unobtrusive, few aircraft passed over or hovered, and  extraneous sounds, in general, were at a minimum. The Los Angeles Philharmonic,  playing at its higher standard of attention, care and musicality, proved a  worthy partner to these distinguished guests.  </P> <P> The orchestra's transparent and affectionate readings of "Alborada del  gracioso," the "Pavane pour une infante defunte" and the Second Suite from  "Daphnis et Chloe".  </P> <P> What came before was no mere warm-up, however. The Overture to "Die Entfuhrung  aus dem Serail" has exposed weaknesses in many an arrogant orchestra. This  infectious and clarified performance exposed only Mozartean joys.  </P> <P> Larrocha's latest Philharmonic appearance showed the pianist, a beloved musical  icon in Southern California years before Ivo Pogorelich was born, maintaining  her Olympian standards as ever.  </P> <P> She brought to the aristocratic C-major Concerto, K. 503 -- previous  generations used to call it the Concerto No. 25 -- elegance, articulation, a  generous palette of colors and perfect weight of statement.  </P> <P> And she did all this within tempos her younger colleagues might dispute as  lacking bounce or propulsion; in fact, her moderate pacing let the work speak  as it seldom does, and lent a sense of unhurried inevitability to all  movements, but especially to the often-rushed finale. May Larrocha -- whose  playing at 67 still projects the no-nonsense air of the dissatisfied  middle-aged genius -- be with us another 35 years. We still have much to learn  from her.  </P> <P> Attendance: 9,706.  </P></p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets: Clearer picture from big five - The Bottom Line Two things are clear after the first round this week of the results season for Britain's five biggest composite insurance companies. One: the sector is now emphatically back in profit after its weather and recession-related problems of recent years: Guardian Royal Exchange started the ball rolling on Tuesday with Pounds 183m (compared to Pounds 3m), Commercial Union followed with Pounds 211m (against Pounds 27m) and Royal Insurance - with a profit of Pounds 143m - is back in the black after losses of nearly Pounds 600m over the last three years. Two: the trading outlook over the medium term is marred by the prospect of a re-emergence of price competition, already visible in what has historically been the industry's most competitive market - motor insurance. The fear here is that the entry of the new 'direct writers', telephone-based motor insurers like Direct Line, and a renewal of interest in the UK by European companies, as markets in France and Germany recover, will undermine pricing. Next week Guardian Royal Exchange will increase competition in the motor sector by launching its own direct writing company, Guardian Direct, bringing the total of 'direct writers' to about a dozen. Already direct writers are beginning to tackle the home insurance market. John Chester, analyst at SG Warburg, noted: 'From the composites' perspective, the normal cyclical influences are being overlaid by the secular trend towards direct writing and consolidation in Europe. While many lessons have been learnt from the heavy losses of recent years, the battle ahead may be no less bloody. It would be particularly inconvenient if the more recent favourable trends in claims reverses.' Certainly this sentiment already seems to be affecting investor perceptions of the sector. Insurers have underperformed the FT-SE A All-Share by about 20 per cent since last summer and by 7.1 per cent since the beginning of the year. GRE's warnings of price competition on Tuesday were enough to send the prices of all the composites firmly south, with the sector this week underperforming by 3 per cent. Profits are still expected to increase over the next 12 months as the effect of price increases introduced between 1991 and 1993 feed through and losses from recession-related claims, such as those from domestic mortgage indemnity insurance, decline. On some bases, therefore, a few of the stocks look attractive - although analysts differ in their assessments. Chester's view that Commercial Union should be the core holding in the sector has many adherents. CU was the only composite to gain market share in 1992 and 1993, allowing it maximise profitability and placing it in a strong position to shed business in the downturn. Tom Bennett, of Banque Paribas Capital Markets, says: 'The general view in insurance - like any other cyclical stock - is to buy when they are losing money and sell when they are making profits.' Even so, he has buy recommendations on both General Accident and a hold/buy for CU, partly because both companies have higher than average exposure either to the US and Canada or to Europe. Higher than average yields should also provide comfort for CU and GA. Supporters of Royal Insurance argue that the company's shares are significantly undervalued at its present level. On Thursday's closing price of 278p, the shares were trading on a prospective multiple of only 7 - assuming 1994 profits of Pounds 290m. And, like Guardian Royal Exchange, Royal is trading at a discount to its net asset value, while Sun Alliance, Commercial Union and particularly General Accident are all trading at premiums to NAV. Paul Hodges, analyst with James Capel, disagrees. He suggests, that Royal has potentially significant exposures to US pollution claims. Even assuming that Royal is able to increase its 1994 dividend by the same rate at which it has increased the 1993 payout, the share still yields a prospective of only 4.4 (on Thursday's closing price), lower than available elsewhere, says Hodges.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / People: Strategic planners choose chairman Chris Clarke, below, has been appointed the new chairman of the Strategic Planning Society, a charitable foundation of some 2,000 members, including most of the publicly-quoted UK companies. The society's brief is to promote strategic management in the widest sense. Clarke, 44, is a vice-president of management consultants AT Kearney. His particular expertise is in advising companies on mergers, acquisitions and alliances. He feels that one of his prime tasks is more clearly to demarcate the distinct roles of the Confederation of British Industry or Institute of Directors and that of his own society. 'Unlike the CBI or IOD, our focus is entirely on strategic thinking,' says Clarke, an economics graduate from UMIST in Manchester. Clarke started his career as a brand manager with Barker &amp; Dobson, the confectioners who once produced a famous comestible called the Everton mint, which featured a soft centre - something Clarke hopes the society will avoid. His view is that the society needs to raise its public profile, since 'although we are well known among the corporate sector we need to have a bigger influence on government. I hope we will reach a point where the society becomes recognised as providing 'thought leadership''.</p>

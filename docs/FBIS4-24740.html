			<p>BFN     [Text] On 21 May, the key theoretical study group of the  municipal party committee and the municipal government held a  report meeting on studying the "decision" adopted at the third  plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee. Comrade  Wang Zhongyu, chairman of the State Economic and Trade  Commission, delivered a report "on further giving considerations  to the issues of achieving state-owned enterprises." Chen  Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, attended the  report meeting. Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal  party committee, chaired the meeting.    Comrade Wang Zhongyu pointed out in his report: State-owned  enterprises, as the pillar of the national economy, have made  great contributions to reform. The reform of state-owned  enterprises is the key and a difficult point of economic system  reform. The party Central Committee and the State Council have  paid full attention to the problems of state-owned enterprises.    Comrade Wang Zhongyu introduced: The current development  trend of state-owned enterprises is very good. The situation of  enterprises has been improved. These enterprises' real profits  have noticeably increased. The number of money-losing  state-owned enterprises has really been reduced. In line with  the situation that the number of money-losing state-owned  enterprises is to be expanded and the amounts of deficits are to  increase this year, Comrade Wang Zhongyu said: All this results  from the facts that since the implementation of "the general  rule for enterprises' financial affairs," "the criterion for  enterprises' accounting," and the law on manufacturing costs  from last July, state-owned enterprises have increased the  depreciation rate of enterprises' equipment and have had to  transfer some funds from enterprises' profits, such as long-term  loan interests, newly added wages, and bonuses, to production  costs. Although this has caused a decrease in enterprises'  profits as kept in their accounts, changed some enterprises from  ones with small profits into ones with deficits and from ones  with covert deficits into ones with overt deficits, the  enterprises' real results have increased.    Comrade Wang Zhongyu stressed: We should pay high attention  to the difficulties and problems that state-owned enterprises  are confronted with, and conscientiously solve these  difficulties and problems. He analyzed the reasons for causing  some enterprises' deficits, suspension of production, operation  under capacity, and strain on capital; and then pointed out that  state-owned enterprises have prospects and are able to enliven  themselves.    In regard to the issue of how to achieve state-owned  enterprises, Comrade Wang Zhongyu said: First, state-owned  enterprises should change their ideas to suit the changes in the  socialist market economic situation. Second, we should grasp  favorable opportunities to deepen reform and to comprehensively  reform the auxiliary systems, make key breakthroughs, and set up  new restriction and encouragement mechanisms for enterprises.  Third, according to different actual conditions, we should work  out countermeasures to help state-owned enterprises handle their  major and difficult problems. Fourth, we should expand the  dynamics of technological reform and accelerate the readjustment  of structures. Fifth, we should strengthen enterprise  management and comprehensively upgrade enterprises' quality.  Sixth, we should create conditions to set up a modern  enterprise system and to promote the implementation of this  system in a step-by-step manner. Seventh, we should set up a  social guarantee system to create external conditions for  deepening enterprises' reform.    Chen Xitong made a speech at the report meeting. He said:  Setting up the frame of the socialist market economic system is  a long-term and arduous task. So, we should not only grasp  favorable opportunities to speed up the pace of reform but also  make progress step by step. Advancing step-by-step is a special  feature and an advantage of China's reform. This is a  successful experience to stably push the large ship of reform  forward.    He also said: State-owned enterprises are our foundation.  Enterprises are still the standpoints of the overall reform. If  we fail to enliven state-owned enterprises, it will be  impossible for us to make a success in reform. The overall  situation at present is not bad. We should try every possible  means to help enliven the enterprises with difficulties so long  as they have markets for their products and have efficiency.  This is conducive to maintaining stability. The central  authorities, the municipal party committee, and the municipal  government have paid attention to the difficulties of  state-owned enterprises. They have adopted many measures to  help resolve their difficulties. Simultaneously, enterprises  should be inspired with enthusiasm, strive to make explorations,  and make efforts to study the problems of their own. Only by so  doing will they be able to resolve their difficulties and  problems and will we be able to attain our targets.    Present at the meeting were leading comrades of the  municipal  party committee and the municipal government, including Chen  Guangwen and Wang Baosen; responsible comrades of the  departments, commissions, and offices under the municipal party  committee and the municipal government; and secretaries of party  committees of the bureaus, general companies, and some large  plants under the industrial work commission of the municipal  party committee.</p>

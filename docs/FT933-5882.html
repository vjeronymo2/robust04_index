			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Price rises not only BR option Sir, Lex, prompted apparently by reports of decisions still to be taken, is ungenerous in accusing BR's management of seeing higher prices as the only way to increase net revenues ('British Rail', August 24). All three passenger businesses have continuing promotional programmes to boost passenger numbers, especially off-peak. When a coach operator complains to the Office of Fair Trading (unsuccessfully I hasten to add) that InterCity is offering fares that are too cheap, it is apparent that British Rail managers are not lacking in the competitive imagination you are looking for. Similarly, when hundreds of thousands of new customers are introduced to rail travel through joint promotions with Boots and Shell, BR is clearly expanding and developing its customer base. For the railways, like any major business, pricing is only one element of financial management and is considered in conjunction with cost-control measures and marketing initiatives as well as the need - particularly important in the public sector - to meet stringent annual cash limits. John K Welsby, chief executive, railways, British Railways Board, Euston House, Eversholt Street, London NW1 1DZ</p>

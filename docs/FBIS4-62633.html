			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Prosvetov] </F>   [Text] Windhoek May 17 TASS -- The "Vostochnoye Okno"  (Eastern Window), a Vladivostok-based shipping company, failed  in its attempt to "open a window" to southern Africa. The  trawler "Vostochnoye Okno-1", belonging to this Russian firm,  has been arrested in the Walvis Bay port on the Atlantic Coast  of Namibia, under a supreme court of Namibia decision. The  Namibian branch of the company owes a huge sum to its partners.    Two fishing companies of Namibia, "Erongo Sea Products" and  "T.N.P. Fishing", sued the Russian company for over two million  Namibian dollars (about 550,000 U.S. dollars). This amount was  made up from the cost of supplying ships and credits paid  against future fishings. Recently the court ruled the claims  justified.    The Namibian representation of the "Vostochnoye Okno" was  fishing in Namibia's coastal zone with the help of four  trawlers. Now this fleet is disintegrated. The "Vostochnoye  Okno-2", one of the vessels, was transferred to recover debts to  the "Sovrybflot", the joint-stock company set up to replace  former all-union foreign trade amalgamation. The crew of the  second ship, "Alma", has established direct ties with Namibians.  At last, the leased trawler "Venera-4" from Odessa, suspecting  something wrong, headed home on "French leave" in March together  with its fish catch, which was to be delivered to Zaire. As a  result, the Odessa-based fishing amalgamation "Antarktida" has  been declared company non-grata in the southern Africa.    Currently there are about 30 trawlers from Russia, Ukraine,  Lithuania and Estonia, fishing for four companies off the  Namibian coasts.</p>

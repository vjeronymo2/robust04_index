			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Turner plans new European TV station MR TED Turner, the television magnate, is launching a new satellite television channel for Europe in September. Turner Network Television Europe yesterday announced plans for a 24-hours-a-day channel that will show 14 hours of cartoons a day, from 6am to 8pm, with films making up the rest of the schedule. The new channel, which will be broadcast by the Astra satellite to cable networks and home dishes, is being put together from two Turner satellite networks in the US, The Cartoon Network and Turner Network Television. 'The popularity of our cartoons, films and other entertainment programming in Europe prompted us to bring these two services to the region,' Mr Turner, chairman of the Turner Broadcasting System, said yesterday. The new channel will draw upon more than 8,500 cartoons made by MGM, Warner Bros and Hanna-Barbera and the Turner library of around 2,500 feature films. It will intensify competition in the European market for children's programming on satellite television. The long-established Children's Channel - whose main shareholders include TCI, the Denver-based cable television company, and Flextech of the UK - will now face two rivals by the autumn. Viacom has announced it is bringing Nickelodeon, its children's channel, to the UK in a joint venture with British Sky Broadcasting. The Cartoon Network and TNT will be delivered in English, although some programmes will be subtitled and dubbed. Mr Turner's Cable News Network is already broadcast throughout Europe on the Astra system. The new channel will initially be financed by advertising, although it could later become a subscription service.</p>

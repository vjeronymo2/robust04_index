			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Cuito by correspondent Faria Horacio] </F>   [Text] The calm that had prevailed in Cuito in the past 72  hours, was this morning disrupted by small weapons fire and  mortar explosions. It all happened at about 0900 [0800 GMT]  when UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  rebels began firing light weapons and launching shells at  government forces deployed in the southern part of the city. It  lasted for about 15 minutes, and sources say two people were  killed and five others wounded. There was agitation among the  residents, and the streets were deserted for about an hour. As  is usually the case, the men in the service of Savimbi fire  shells at the defenseless residents because they are unable to  face government forces.</p>

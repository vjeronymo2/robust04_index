			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed FDS: "Airplane Manufacturer Wants To Build </F> Factory in Brustem; Investment Worth 7 Billion Francs and 300  Jobs"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At last year end, a businessman  from Limburg contacted Flemish Minister Johan Sauwens (The  People's Union) with the good news that his customer, a  "naturalized Dutchman," according to official sources, while  other sources refer to two rather questionable Germans from  Dsseldorf, would like to invest some $200 million in Limburg.  The purpose is to service Russian-built helicopters and to  assemble small Russian airplanes in the new plant. Since the  fall of the Berlin wall and the elimination of the Iron Curtain,  the Russian aviation industry is trying to acquire a share of  the Western market through dumping prices. Giant Russian  helicopters are frequently used in the West because they have a  bigger lifting capacity than their Western counterparts, so it  makes perfect sense that their servicing also take place in the  West.    The Russian airplanes are allegedly worthy equivalents of  U.S.-built Cessnas or German-Dutch Fokkers, and are said to be  interesting on account of their price-quality ratio and their  cargo capacity. An aid organization such as Doctors Without  Frontiers, for instance, could easily convert them into  ambulance airplanes, a tempting argument that the potential  investors eagerly put forward. In addition, the investors also  have Russian exclusive contracts for the servicing of  helicopters and for the delivery of the necessary spare parts.  [passage omitted]</p>

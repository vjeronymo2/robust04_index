			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Museums seek lottery aid THE MUSEUMS and Galleries Commission appealed yesterday for about half the expected Pounds 500m income from the national lottery when it is set up in 1994. Mr Peter Longman, the commission's director, said it could spend Pounds 250m a year from the lottery for 10 years on improving museums. The commission set out a national policy yesterday for the UK's 2,000 museums in a document, Museums Matter, that it is delivering to Mr David Mellor, national heritage secretary. Similar lobbying is expected shortly from the Arts Council and the Sports Council. Mr Longman believes that, over a decade, the national museums need at least Pounds 1bn to maintain deteriorating - mainly Victorian - structures. He says the underfunded local-authority, university, and independent museums require a similar sum, while Pounds 500m is needed to create endowments for important private museums such as the Dulwich Art Gallery and Charleston Farmhouse, the shrine of the Bloomsbury Group. He said that independent museums should receive 'fair treatment' when lottery proceeds are shared out. 'This would accord with the government's expressed intention to safeguard our national heritage with the proceeds of the lottery.' Museums at present cost national and local government slightly more than Pounds 400m a year, with two thirds going to the 19 national museums such as the British Museum and the National Gallery. Mr Greene pointed out that museums attracted 74m visitors a year. 'More people visit museums each year than go to football matches and the theatre combined,' he said. The commission has grown in influence and importance in recent years. In 1982 it had a revenue of Pounds 700,000. It now receives Pounds 9m from the government and would expect to distribute the museum share of lottery income if existing institutions were used for the task in preference to the establishment of a Lotteries Commission. The commission wants a Pounds 25m annual increase in museum purchasing grants, frozen since 1985. That should make sure no work of national importance goes overseas.</p>

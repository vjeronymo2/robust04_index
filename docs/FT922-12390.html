			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Private View: The nine lives of Chaim Herzog A CORPORAL was taking the names of a batch of new recruits at an infantry barracks in Maidstone, Kent, in the early days of the Second World War. He stopped in front of a young volunteer. 'Name?' 'Herzog', said the young man, in a distinct Dublin accent. 'First name?' 'Chaim.' The corporal swore. 'What the hell's that?' 'That's Hebrew, corporal.' 'We don't 'ave no 'Ebrew round 'ere. This is the British Army.' 'But that's my name. What am I supposed to do about it?' Another recruit intervened: Chaim means Life, he said, and the English name would be Vivien. 'Right,' said the corporal. 'From now on you're Vivien and we'll have no ******* Hebrew in the British Army.' To his wife and friends, 'Vivien' is what the president of Israel has been ever since. He finished the anecdote, dropped his Cockney impersonation and exclaimed in his own gentle Irish accent: 'It could only happen in England]' That was how Chaim Herzog, the rabbi's son, born in Belfast and raised in Dublin, became a British major and embarked on the first of his nine lives - from soldier to businessman, broadcaster, diplomat, historian, pilot, politician and elder statesman. At 73, Herzog is old enough to remember the violent birth of the two states, Ireland and Israel, which sit alphabetically adjacent at the UN table. As a child he saw shooting in the streets outside the house in Dublin where his father Isaac, chief rabbi of the small Jewish community, frequently entertained Eamon de Valera, future head of the republic. When he was 18 he acquired his own rifle in the Jewish underground, the Haganah, during the Arab revolt of 1936-8, the family having emigrated to Palestine for Herzog Senior's appointment as chief rabbi there. When you meet the Israeli president, as I did in Jerusalem last week, it is the Irishman that you notice first. And it was as such that I began to address him. Herzog corrected me. 'You can't call me an Irishman. But I have imbibed a lot. I honestly believe that if there's anybody who should really understand us, given the circumstances in which we're living, then it should be the Irish.' The parallels between the two nations are compelling, as Conor Cruise O'Brien (who, like Herzog, was once his country's ambassador to the UN) has written. Religion is one obvious connection. So I asked the rabbi's son if he regretted the loss of faith among Israeli Jews. 'No, I regret the loss of the bridge we had between religious and secular.' He described how the demise of the National Religious Party had allowed the ultra-Orthodox, whose disproportionate political power is resented by many non-religious Jews, to fill the vacuum. How would you put yourself on the religious spectrum? 'I'm an observing Jew, but I wouldn't say I am extreme in any way. I find myself at home with everybody. In this job I have to be - with Jew, Arab, Christian or Druze, even with the extreme religious elements. Is religious sectarianism in Northern Ireland a warning parallel for Israel? 'I don't think there is anything as bitter as a religious war, and that's what you've got today in Northern Ireland. I've done my best in my period of office to prevent that happening here. Here there's a lot more commonsense.' Israel's unending conflict with the Palestinians and the Arab states (that is, apart from Egypt) was due to lack of leadership on the other side, not religion, Herzog said. Islamic fundamentalism was a growing threat but that was problem for many countries other than Israel. As he spoke, the windows were rattled as if by some distant explosion. The presidency has become politically a great deal more delicate as the Israeli electorate has moved to the Right: in his nine years at the helm Herzog has had to stitch together six precarious governments and may be called upon to do so again after the general election in June. I tried to discover whether Herzog, a former Labour member of the Knesset, had himself moved to the Right over the years. Did you imbibe socialism as a youth in Ireland? I asked. 'No, not necessarily. My late father always maintained that true socialism was preached in the Bible. He used to classify himself as a socialist but based on the philosophy of the Bible, not of Marx.' You have the reputation of being a right-winger on questions like settlements in the occupied territories, I said. Herzog countered that he had never made his views known and would not do so now. But he went on: 'There is a tendency to be facile about this issue. One of the great problems of the West is they don't understand the Middle East. I've said this on many occasions. To say settlements are an obstacle to peace is not borne out by the facts.' Like many Israelis, Herzog has spent much of his life in uniform. He joined the British Army from Cambridge University. He fought in Normandy, saw the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after its liberation and encountered the SS commander Heinrich Himmler before his suicide. After World War Two and training for the English Bar, he became the first head of Israeli military intelligence and rose through various commands to the rank of major-general. Retiring from regular service he went into business, and for ten years was managing director of GUS Industries. But in June 1967, he rode into Jerusalem as the first military governor of the West Bank. I asked him whether Israel's preoccupation with its own security had not left its leaders unable to address the problems of peace. 'No. It's been somewhat miraculous here. We are an entire nation in the military and yet we are the least militant country that I know. Nobody likes it. Everybody sees it as a necessary evil, to guarantee our future. No more. There's no spit and polish. You don't seen any plumes and medals here.' I thought of the dishevelled soldiers I had seen patrolling the Gaza Strip four years ago, of the tear-gas raids on hospitals, the alleged beatings of children in detention. I asked: As a military man, doesn't the indiscipline concern you? 'I do speak out on issues of discipline. I'm going soon to visit Gaza - so I'll be able to tell you then.' The president smiled benignly. 'But look at eastern Europe. Look at Yugoslavia and then at our experience. We've done not so bad. 'Our problem is to maintain a situation in which you can negotiate without it deteriorating into another Beirut or Yugoslavia.' But what about those soldiers who lose their cool completely? 'Why don't you ask the people that send their children out to fight? When a child threw a Molotov cocktail at a bus in Jericho a few years ago and a Jewish mother and her three children were burnt to death, she was no less dead because the bomb had been thrown by a child. 'I'm not saying that everything is delightful. It's a difficult situation and unfortunate things happen. But we have courts and the Arabs do go to the courts. And the courts on more than one occasion have called the Israel authorities to book.' (The president did not mention his controversial commuting of sentences on Israelis convicted of murdering Arabs.) Outsiders find it difficult to reconcile the idealism of Israel's early pioneers with today's Right-wing expansionism. I asked Herzog whether he himself found modern Israel an unfamiliar place. 'We tend to idealise the past and to look back on it with nostalgia. But the fact is, nobody ever dreamt that we would achieve what we have. I think with all the shortcomings - and I don't hesitate to talk about them - we have very much to be proud of.' Your supporters abroad complain that the world requires higher standards of Israel than of any other country. 'I've often said that myself, but the fact is we have a high standard and we ought to be proud of it and maintain it - and we do. As I say, the courts are open. There's a free press here. We've lived under this threat of terrorism all these years and we haven't hanged a single terrorist. Not one.' Herzog recalled being provoked in the Council of Europe recently by a British Labour MP. 'I began to compare our behaviour towards the Palestinians with the British government's behaviour towards the IRA. And believe me, if he could blush, he did blush. 'I told him nobody of the IRA can appear on TV or radio in Britain. Here you can see an interview with Arafat and his people on the TV any night. And we certainly did not ambush unarmed people, including a woman, as they did in Gibraltar. 'So my advice to all those who criticise us is to look in their own back garden first.' Chaim Herzog's two-term tenure of the presidency expires soon. He says he will not go back into politics. What ambitions do you have left? 'I wouldn't mind if I got a hole-in-one playing golf. Seriously, I would like to continue what I do. I fly light planes, I play golf, I sail. Really, I would like to go back to what I was doing before, which is writing. I have so much to write.'</p>

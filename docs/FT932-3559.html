			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Solicitor launches group to protect whistleblowers employees who disclose confidential information in what they judge to be the public interest - has been formed to provide guidance to companies as well as independent help to individuals. Separate codes of practice on how to deal with whistleblowers are being set up for a number of sectors, including accounting, auditing and eduction. The primary aim of the group will be to persuade companies to adopt the codes of practice. The group, Public Concern at Work, is headed by Mr Guy Dehn, a solicitor formerly with the National Consumer Council. Professor Gerald Vinten of Luton University College, who is also involved in the group, told a recent conference of the Institute of Personnel Management that organisations should not necessarily view whistleblowing negatively. Research had shown that whistleblowers were often regarded as a model employees in all other respects, so it was a waste for companies to forfeit their services, he said. Prof Vinten said a survey of 87 whistleblowers in the US had found that all but one had experienced retaliation, with harassment coming from peers as well as superiors. Most of those in private industry and half of those in the Civil Service had lost their jobs. Prof Vinten said organisations should make clear that they 'valued employees being ethically alert and, therefore, individuals who did blow the whistle would not be discriminated against'. Codes of practice would give employees a reference point to enable them to identify when it was valid for them to take up a particular issue and how to go about it, he told the IPM. Codes should include guidance on who an employee should speak to, ethical dilemmas and ways of coping, and give a clear statement from the company of the ethical conduct it intended to follow.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Alarm over chip alliances flares again - A look at fears that the US is giving Japan crucial technology THE growing number of strategic alliances between US and Japanese semiconductor companies is again raising concern in the US that groups there are giving away crucial technology too easily to competitors. The joint development programme for advanced memory chips, recently agreed between IBM, the world's biggest chip maker, Siemens of Germany and Toshiba of Japan, is the latest in a line of partnerships triggering alarm in press and government. Critics say links with foreign competitors give away technology developed with taxpayers' money through organisations such as Sematech, a collaborative effort to improve US chip groups' competitiveness and partly funded by the government. The National Research Council (NRC), operating arm of the US National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineers, warns* the technology flow through strategic US-Japanese semiconductor alliances has been mainly from the US to Japan. Such a flow, if continued over the 1990s, could erode US capacity to innovate in this industry. The council raises concerns over link-ups between small-to-medium US companies, many of them start-up entities, and big, vertically integrated Japanese corporations. Its research, based on data from Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy, shows such alliances account for some two-thirds of US-Japanese chip alliances. The increase in these has been spurred by the rising importance of the Japanese market, which US companies needed to join. Japanese thirst for new technologies has led them to invest heavily in US chip companies, mainly start-up ones needing funds. The NRC report cites another study indicating Japanese chip investments make up about 90 per cent of all the industry's investments. Recent developments include the high cost of investing in factories and the need for greater resources than any one company can muster to market a product quickly. Japanese companies' manufacturing capability has been a compelling factor for US chip companies which face the need to bring a product to the market quickly, as well as second-source their product. The council argues that while individual companies may benefit from alliances with Japanese ones by gaining funds and market access, these alliances may not provide the US chip industry with the stronger manufacturing infrastructure it needs. Historically, US companies did not necessarily come out at the top end of an alliance, says Mr Howard High of Intel, the US semiconductor company which recently agreed jointly to make flash memory chips with Sharp of Japan. But 'the structure of the deals and the attitude is quite different to what you used to see in the early to mid-1980s'. Now Japanese companies are recognised as major players in the industry, US groups are trying to improve safeguards against one-way technology flows. IBM, a target of concern for its development pact with Toshiba and Siemens, says its alliances bring benefits beyond sharing the financial burden, including skills helping speed development processes. 'The idea is speed to market,' an IBM official says. Concern that developments funded by tax were being given away to foreigners was misfounded. 'Sematech focuses on manufacturing processes, where alliances focus on products.' Even for big chip companies, the need to invest huge sums in manufacturing capacity and be quick to the market with new technology, means 'it's a tough call,' Mr High says. Intel is a leader in flash memories, a market likely to grow. Flash is a chip retaining memory after switch-off. Intel knew it needed greater capacity to bring the product to the market quickly, as the Japanese makers were working on it too. No advanced chip plants were readily available for extra output in the US, and because setting up a new plant takes time and money, that option meant it might miss the boat. Such are the pressures US chip groups face in trying to lead a fast-changing market. The council says that without efforts to ensure foreign alliances bring benefits to the US, the possibility of the US supplying new ideas to foreigners who then derive most of the value-added, 'is a real concern'. Chip groups say cross-border co-operation is essential. No company, or nation, can adequately serve all markets; they must increasingly co-operate, says Mr Pat Weber of Texas Instruments. Policies to keep technologies in the US are obsolete. Enabling US companies to serve global markets 'is, in the end, in the US national interest.' *US-Japan Strategic Alliances in the Semiconductor Industry.

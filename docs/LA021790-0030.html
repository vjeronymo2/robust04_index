			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAMEWORTH RUNS 4:13.1 IN TIMES GAMES  </P> <P> Bryan Dameworth lost a race for the first time in nearly a year, but it took a  field full of Olympians to do it Friday in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games at the  Forum.  </P> <P> Dameworth, an Agoura High senior, finished ninth in the men's Open Mile despite  running a lifetime best of 4 minutes 13.1 seconds.  </P> <P> But that time was nearly 18 seconds slower than winner Peter Elliott. The  two-time British Olympian ran 3:55.51 to beat Algerian Nourredine Morcelli,  running for Riverside Junior College.  </P> <P> Dameworth's previous best was 4:14.4, run last summer at UCLA. He ran 4:14.52  two weeks ago in winning a featured high school mile in Millrose Games at  Madison Square Garden in New York City.  </P></p>

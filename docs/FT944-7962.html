			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BCE takes step into electronic games BCE Holdings, the USM-traded snooker and pool products distributor, yesterday moved into the electronics games business and placed 100m new shares at 11p each. Shares in the group were suspended at 9 1/2 p last month after the group announced that it was acquiring two companies engaged in the development of video and computer games. The acquisitions will quadruple the size of the group, which is valued at Pounds 24m at the issue price. It is paying Pounds 3.85m for the entire issued share capital of Rage and Pounds 9.98m for Software Creations. The consideration for both companies is made up of a mixture of shares, loan notes and cash, with Rage taking 18.2m shares and Software Creations 36.1m shares. The loan notes are subject to penalties if profit targets are not met. Rage has among its games Striker, a soccer-based game, and includes Sega among its customers. Games developed by Software Creations include Terminator 2 and Spiderman, and it has Nintendo and Sony among its customers. The placing - of which 74.8m shares will be firm with the remainder subject to a 2-for-5 open offer to existing shareholders - will raise Pounds 11m. Of the total, about Pounds 1m will be taken up with expenses, while Pounds 5m will go to the company and Pounds 5m to help finance the acquisitions. After the deal is completed, there will be more than 217m shares in issue. The group will operate with two divisions - multimedia, which is expected to account for 75 per cent of profits, and leisure. Shareholders will vote on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting on December 14. Dealings in the ordinary shares are expected to begin on the USM the following day. Mr Robin Jones, managing director, said yesterday that the revamped group would be seeking a full listing as soon as possible, probably in autumn next year.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Olivetti plans L500bn bond issue Olivetti, the Italian information technology group, could raise as much as L500bn (Dollars 302m) with a convertible bond issue, announced yesterday, to finance the new mobile telephone venture in which it is one of the largest shareholders. Olivetti also revealed yesterday that it had cut net losses to L465bn in 1993, compared with L650bn the previous year, and increased sales for the first time since 1990. Net debt was cut to L798bn from L960bn. The group said it would ask shareholders at a special meeting on May 11 and 12 to approve the issue of up to 250m shares as part of a convertible bond issue to institutional investors. The price of the issue has yet to be fixed, but at current market values should raise more than L450bn. Last year the company, headed by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, pushed through a L902bn rights issue to fund expansion into the information technology and telecommunications sectors, provoking a sharp drop in the share price. The computer group, based at Ivrea near Turin, is still celebrating its success last week in winning the licence for Italy's GSM mobile telecommunications network, at the head of the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium. Omnitel will have to invest some L3,000bn to build up the network, of which Olivetti will provide 35 per cent, in line with its stake in the consortium. Analysts believe the group may have to raise further loans to cover the investment. Olivetti revealed that in 1993 it failed to break even at the operating level as it had hoped to do. It was hit by the 1991 devaluation of the Italian lira, which increased the cost of components for computer hardware and office equipment. The company said it hoped to break even in 1994. In 1993, Olivetti reduced its operating losses slightly from L229bn to L206bn, on sales of L8,613bn compared to L8,025bn. The group said sales had continued to increase in the first quarter of 1994, raising hopes that the computer and information technology market may be starting to pull out of the international recession which has plagued Olivetti and its competitors during the 1990s. Olivetti also hopes to complete its wide-ranging restructuring programme in the first half of this year. Since 1989 the group's workforce has been cut from 57,000 to 35,000, and last year's redundancy package cost the company L255bn in extraordinary charges. The computer group believes it is now emerging from its recent difficulties, which culminated in last year's admission by Mr De Benedetti that Olivetti was forced to pay bribes to the Italian Posts Ministry to avoid being cut out of lucrative contracts. Rome magistrates insisted on Mr De Benedetti's arrest in November, although he was later released and no further action has been taken.</p>

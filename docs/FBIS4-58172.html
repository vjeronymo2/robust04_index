			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, </F> head of the Islamic Propaganda Organization and acting Friday  prayers leader, in Tehran on 29 April -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is being said that in the  future instead of an oil war we will have a water war in the  world. Even now, Israel is stealing water. It is trying to  divert the waters of Lebanon and take them to its own side. In  other places also there is fighting over water. They sit down  with Turkey and talk about water.    May God bestow some intelligence on those who, due to  distorted thinking, provide a foothold for the Israelis to come  to the Islamic countries. They do not realize that they are  inciting their own people against themselves. Turkey is an  Islamic country. Even if the Turkish officials turn the world  upside down, Turkey is an Islamic country. The Turkish nation  has not deserted Islam. No matter what Ataturk said, he said it  simply for his own benefit. The Turkish people are Muslims. Can  Muslim people tolerate the fact that Israel, which is killing  Muslims, will find a foothold in their country, and that Turkish  officials are making such arrangements?    In any case, we need to make savings in water, in  electricity, and in other things. [passage omitted]</p>

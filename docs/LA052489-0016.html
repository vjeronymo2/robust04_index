			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP  </P> <P> Controversial Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union, who was at the top of her  game this time last year while making it all the way to the French Open final,  may be behind schedule this year. Or, she may have learned the art of tanking a  match.  </P> <P> With the start of the French in Paris five days away, Zvereva entered a tuneup  tournament in Geneva and quickly was ousted by U.S. qualifier Shaun Stafford.  Stafford, 20, of Gainesville, Fla., who has been on the pro tour since February  and is ranked 92nd in the world, beat Zvereva, 6-3, 7-6 (6-3).  </P> <P> Zvereva, who created a stir recently by announcing that she will now take  larger portions of her winnings instead of letting the vast percentage of it go  to the Soviet tennis federation, said afterward that she wasn't surprised that  she lost, since she entered "to play doubles." She said she was surprised to  learn that all entrants had to play both singles and doubles.  </P> <P> A U.S. men's team swept its first-round match against Switzerland in the World  Team Cup tournament in Dusseldorf, West Germany. Tim Mayotte beat Jacob Hlasek,  3-6, 6-4, 6-1; Aaron Krickstein beat Claudio Mezzadri, 5-7, 6-4, 6-0, and the  doubles team of Rick Leach and Jim Pugh beat Hlasek and Heinz Guenthardt, 6-3,  6-4.  </P></p>

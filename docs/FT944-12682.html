			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Clinton seeks to stem party losses President Bill Clinton yesterday launched a week-long drive to minimise expected Democratic party losses in the mid-term elections on November 8. Mr David Wilhelm, the party's national chairman, travelled with the president to Philadelphia and proclaimed 'the tide is turning.' But he added that he was under no illusion how tough the elections would be. Indeed, in the first three states on Mr Clinton's itinerary - Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan - polls found Democratic candidates falling behind Republican opponents in seats the party already holds. In Pennsylvania, a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette survey gave Congressman Rick Santorum, the Republican, a 46-35 point lead over Senator Harris Wofford. Though the poll had a small sample, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5 per cent, and was dismissed as unreliable by the senator's campaign, the two had previously appeared neck-and-neck. As an indication of the importance Republicans attach to the state, Mr Santorum was chosen to give the party's official response to the president's regular weekly radio broadcast on Saturday. He charged that the Democrats had secret plans to raise taxes and said 'it is time for you to tell Washington that you want to keep your hard-earned income.' In Michigan Mr Spence Abraham, the Republican, was given a 46-34 lead over Congressman Bob Carr. Another survey a week ago had given the Democrat a small lead, but the popularity of Governor John Engler, the Republican certain of re-election, appears to be pulling Mr Abraham along. All the recent Ohio surveys show Lt Governor Michael DeWine with a double digit lead over Mr Joel Hyatt, who is bidding to succeed his father-in-law, Senator Howard Metzenbaum. Mr Hyatt has started to dig into his own considerable private resources to finance a last-minute drive but most experts consider it too little and too late. But both Mr Hyatt and Congressman Carr are to campaign with Mr Clinton today, in contrast to the president's previous visit, when both shunned him. Mr Mark Singel, now apparently trailing as the Democratic candidate for governor in Pennsylvania, also appeared with the president yesterday having failed to show up last month at a Washington fundraiser on his behalf at which Mr Clinton was present. The president's upwards move in the polls on the strength of foreign policy achievements may help his party, though by how much is unclear. Mr William Schneider, political analyst for the CNN-USA Today-Gallup national poll, said recently that every 2 point rise in the president's popularity was worth a seat in the House and every 8 points one in the Senate. By that logic, Mr Clinton has just saved four House seats and one in the Senate. In New York the Democrats were able to take heart from the latest large sample New York Times/WCBS-TV poll out yesterday which gave Governor Mario Cuomo a 44-34 point lead over Mr George Pataki.</p>

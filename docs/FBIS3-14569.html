In his statement, Waqqad referred to the civil war as a  factor marring the image of Islam and responsible for the  destruction of Afghanistan.    He added that he has called on the belligerent parties to  bury the hatchet and initiate peace efforts.    The statment reads that Afghan people are in need of a  healthy system, peace and security, and those in authority  should not resort to arms which were used for the sacred defence  of Afghanistan (against Soviet occupation), to mar the image of  Islam and destroy the country.    The statement issued in response to the press release of  Hezb-e Eslami, criticized Hekmatyar for his recent claims.    In a statement which appeared in press on Sunday [27 March]  Hekmatyar had claimed that his party had not nomiated Waqqad to  any post nor does the post of deputy leader exists in his party.    Waqqad in his statement named himself as one of the founders  of the Hezb-e Eslami and said Hekmatyar's recent claims were to  please his new comrades.</p>

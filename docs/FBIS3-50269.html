			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by R.W.: "Against a Purge of Voivodes"] </F>   [Text] "Voivodes that belong to parties other than the  governing ones are recalled unfairly," say more than half of the  respondents to an opinion poll conducted by the Sopot Public  Opinion Research Institute [PBS] at the request of  RZECZPOSPOLITA. "The issue of who should fill the post of a  voivode should not be determined by party membership," believe  almost three-fourths of respondents. The replacement of  voivodship heads of the state administration, announced by the  peasant-social democratic government, is rather moderately  supported by the public.    So far the Pawlak government has recalled ten voivodes (the  eleventh voivode is supposed to be recalled toward the end of  January, when he returns from sick leave); eight new voivodes  have been appointed. The vacant posts are in Lublin and  Rzeszow. Representatives of the governing coalition said more  than once that only the future of ten, or maybe a little over a  dozen voivodes, could be classified as safe. The main criterion  for the central authorities was supposed to be the fact whether  a given voivode had good or bad relations with the local  structures of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic  Left Alliance [SLD]. Any protests by activists of these parties  is the first step to dismiss the head of the local governmental  administration. There appear statements that the issue of  filling this post should be decided by the party that won the  parliamentary elections in the particular voivodship. It is  worth recalling that SLD won in 25 voivodships, PSL in 21,  Democratic Union [UD] in 2, and the German minority in one. In  a radio statement, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said jokingly  that for him the unparalleled model is Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who  had replaced all the voivodes. His opponents point out that the  situation is incomparable, because in 1989 and 1990 a most  fundamental change in the political system was under way. On  New Year's Eve, the present government recalled five voivodes;  this is half as many as the Suchocka government did during its  entire time in office.    It is still unclear of what nature the post of a voivode  should be: whether it should be an apolitical representative of  the "civil service" [preceding two words in English], or a  representative of the governing coalition who is at its full  political disposal. The law on the state civil service, which  many people hope will finally settle this issue, has still not  even reached a session of the Council of Ministers.    Most of the representatives of all the groups questioned by  PBS are convinced that the issue of filling a voivode post  should not be determined by party membership (74 percent of the  answers, whereas 18 percent of the respondents are of the  opposite opinion). Acceptance of the idea of making the voivode  post party-related is most often expressed by supporters of SLD  and the Union for Real Politics.    The recalls that have been made so far -- recalls of  voivodes  who belong to parties other than the governing ones -- are  approved by 26 percent of respondents; they are disapproved of  by 55 percent, and 18 percent refrain from expressing an opinion  either way. Support for such changes are most often declared by  supporters of SLD, PSL, as well as the Union of Labor and the  Confederation for an Independent Poland; however, even in these  groups they are in the minority. The greatest doubts are  expressed by supporters of the parties that not long ago were  still in power: UD, Liberal-Democratic Congress, as well as the  groupings comprising the former "Fatherland" coalition.    The opinion poll was conducted on 15 and 16 January with a  representative sample of 1,064 adult Poles.  <H5>  [Box, p 1] </H5>   Should the issue of the filling the post of a voivode be  determined by party membership?    42 percent -- definitely not    32 percent -- probably not    13 percent -- probably yes    5 percent -- definitely yes    8 percent -- hard to say</p>

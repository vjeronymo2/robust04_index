			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Second part" of interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, </F> chairman of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, by an  unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "The Key  Is Equal Rights"]    [Text] [Correspondent] The fire of the international  opinion industry against you keeps mounting and is gradually  turning into an inferno, which has hardly been conceivable  before. For the past few days you have not been accused of  plans to destroy Germany but of something much worse in the eyes  of the mass media: You would welcome it if the Oder-Neisse line  were revised and Germany got back its eastern parts, including  Stettin [Szczecin], Danzig [Gdansk], Koenigsberg [Kaliningrad],  and Breslau [Wroclaw]. Moreover, you want to give Poland access  to the sea between Gdansk and Kaliningrad and, at the same time,  expand Poland eastward with the area around Lemberg [Lvov] as  compensation. A revision of the injustice of the deportation of  the east Germans is certainly the worst that the tabloid press  in Germany can imagine. After all, how these people have  suffered because of the unification of FRG and GDR!    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, this was certainly a terrible shock for  the enemies of the Germans. I have been involved in geopolitics  ever since my youth. I am also the chairman of the Geopolitical  Committee of the Russian parliament, the Duma. Naturally, I  think very much about just solutions. A U.S. president once  said that nothing is settled that is not settled justly. Why  should it not be permitted to discuss a revision, that is, a  completely peaceful solution for eastern Germany, which would  conform to international law and would be achieved by means of  negotiations? Why should a lesser law be applied to the German  people? After all, it is not as though Poland has derived any  benefit from Germany's eastern areas and that eastern Germany is  now a flourishing land. Such considerations cannot be taboo any  more. I rely on a healthy and strong, self-confident,  sovereign, and once again German Germany as an equal partner  with Russia.    [Correspondent] You have also commented on the problem of  South Tirol.    [Zhirinovskiy] So much is being talked about the right to  self-determination. Hardly anyone in the world will doubt that  the South Tiroleans are Germans. No one will want to deny that  about three-quarters of the population of South Tirol belong to  the German ethnic Group and the Ladinian ethnic group, which is  closely linked to the German group. Why should this issue not  best be settled by the voters, as in the Crimea? Why do we not  let ourselves be guided by democratic principles?    [Correspondent] How do you see the development of democracy  in Central Europe?    [Zhirinovskiy] To what extent is it a democracy and to what  extent is it a media democracy? To what extent do the masses of  the voters decide and to what extent are decisions made by a few  thousand journalists, some of whom bitterly hate their  fatherland? To what extent does the law decide whether  undesirable events are permitted, and to what extent is this  decision made by a few thousand bandits of the so-called  autonomous scene? The state is strong enough to show criminals  their place. Desired rallies take place without problems. The  rule-of-law state is called upon to punish criminal gangs, which  are specialized in terror against rallies.    [Correspondent] The judiciary in our country is overtaxed  when, half a century after World War II, it is still having to  pursue proceedings against more than 8,000 accused on the  defeated side for war crimes or Nazi crimes that were committed  half a century ago or more.    [Zhirinovskiy] What is the purpose of that supposed to be?  How is one supposed to reach just judgments such a long time  after the alleged deeds? These defendants must be very old and  seriously ill. How can a clever and intelligent people like the  German people permit this to be done to it? Germany must be  freed from this Babylonian captivity, and it can be freed by  Russia as a partner and a friend, by a Russia that loves the  Germans.    [Correspondent] Such statements....    [Zhirinovskiy] ...will increase the hatred of the  anti-German opinion industry against me.    [Correspondent] It is implied that you do not want to  withdraw Russian troops from Germany but increase them by a  factor of 10.    [Zhirinovskiy] Quite the contrary: I have repeatedly  demanded that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Germany. I  cannot understand that, on the one hand, the Bundeswehr is to be  reduced and, on the other hand, U.S. soldiers, British, French,  Belgians, Dutch, and even 100 Canadians are to remain stationed  in Germany. Do the German people expect any protection by a few  tens of thousands of foreign soldiers? Naturally, Germany needs  effective, strong armed forces, but it needs German armed  forces. Anyone who does not want to afford a sufficiently  strong army of his own incurs the danger of having a foreign  army put into his country.    And what is the purpose of splitting the Bundeswehr into  multinational units, in particular under foreign command? Why  is the German army not solely subordinate to a German General  Staff? After all, the Germans certainly need not be ashamed of  their soldiers and their military tradition.    [Correspondent] The opinion industry does not like your  views at all.    [Zhirinovksiy] Yes, unfortunately this is true. But the  Germans must understand that I, as a Russian, pursue a Russian  policy, and that I love the Russian people and also the German  people. What kind of a Russian would I be, if I were to pursue  an anti-Russian policy and the carving up of Russia? When I  advocate a large and strong Russia, I do not want to build up  any conflict with Washington. But having several great powers,  to which Russia and others belong, in addition to Germany and  the United States, is better for the world than a single  globocop, to whose tune the world dances.    Equal rights in the family of peoples and states is the key  to real partnership. I abhor war and any kind of military  conflict, but I am for the peoples' right to self-determination.  When, for instance, the people in the Crimea, in free  self-determination and in democratic elections, are of an  opinion that differs from the one of the Ukrainian Khrushchev,  who "gave" the Crimea to Ukraine, for me it is the opinion of  the people that counts and not the decision of a dictator.    [Correspondent] Attempts are being made to present you to  the people as an opponent or even an enemy of President Yeltsin.    [Zhirinovskiy] But this is not so at all. I respect and  value President Yeltsin, and this is mutual. President Yeltsin  may occasionally make mistakes, but he wants the best for  Russia. I was not involved at all in the putsch against him  and, as is generally known; I had nothing to do with it. By the  way, at that time I was with the German People's Union in the  Nibelungen Hall [in Passau].    [Correspondent] But you have a constructive and not at all  hostile or even just opposition relationship with the Russian  communists in the Duma.    [Zhirinovskiy] The communists in the Duma are in no way  responsible for what happened under Stalin. Today's Russians  and today's Germans should live and work and shape their future  freely and completely free of the burden of the pasts. Today's  Russian communists are, by the way, honorable people and not  traitors who served a foreign power at some time in the past.  Why should we dig artificial trenches and establish  contradictions in the current, terrible situation in Russia,  which reminds us of Germany's situation after the war.    [Correspondent] If no miracle happens, and no murder or any  other evil deed prevents it, you will be Russia's next  president. How will you tackle the country's internal problems?    [Zhirinovskiy] We will pursue a mixture of well thought-out  planned economy and moderate market economy and give the people  in Russia hope and work again; we will stop inflation and help  the Russians to live a dignified life. Within three months I  will destroy the several hundred mafia gangs that dominate  business in our country by, among other things, so-called  protection money, and every kind of serious criminals, who make  our streets unsafe, with the entire rigor of the law and a  police force that is free of any corruption. Law and order must  be restored. I guarantee it. And the Russians know that.</p>

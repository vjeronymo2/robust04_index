			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Gold Fields of SA to merge units GOLD Fields of South Africa, one of the country's largest mining houses, plans to merge the operations of two of its marginal gold mines, Libanon and Venterspost, with Kloof, one of the richest mines. The merger arises from the precarious financial position of the Venterspost mine, which would otherwise have been forced to close with severe knock-on implications for Libanon and Kloof. Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said: 'The race against time has been lost.' The merger needs to be approved by shareholders. Venterspost made losses of nearly R9m (Dollars 3.25m) in the year to June, while its cash assets declined to R14m compared with R139m two years previously. Libanon made less than R0.5m profit compared with capital expenditure of R6.4m in the year to June. Kloof is one of the richest mines in the world, with an average grade of 13.5 grams per tonne in the year to June and working profits of R388m. The three Western Transvaal mines are contiguous, and closure of the marginal operations would have created a serious water problem for Kloof. To deal with this problem, Kloof would have had to make investments of about R100m for new pumps. It would have faced extra pumping costs of about R70m a year, and production losses of about R1bn, said Mr Munro. Pumping at Venterspost and Libanon will cost only about R48m a year. The merger involves shareholders in Libanon and Venterspost being given shares in Kloof at a ratio of nine Kloof shares for every 100 Libanon shares and six Kloof shares for every 100 Venterspost shares. Kloof will issue 6.6m shares, a dilution of about 5 per cent on the current issued share capital of 121m shares. The deal places a joint value of about R165m on Venterspost and Libanon. Mr Munro said he was confident that the integrated operation could lift profits by the necessary 5 per cent in order to maintain the dividend at its current level. If the deal gets shareholder approval the restructured Kloof will have three operating arms: the existing Kloof division, the new Leeudoorn extention to Kloof and a composite Libanon/Venterspost operation. The new division will produce at a rate of about 145,000 tonnes per month - significantly less than current joint production level of about 190,000 tonnes at the two mines. The gold mines in the Gold Fields group lifted their average grade to 8.6 grams per tonne in the June quarter, from 8.4 grams in the March quarter. This helped lift gold production by a tonne to 30.6 tonnes. The gold price received dropped to R31,086 per kg from R31,911 per kg in the March quarter. This saw working profit drop to R299m from R317m. A lower tax bill, due to a doubling in the level of capital expenditure, and higher sundry revenue helped push after-tax profit up to R287m from R208m in March. Doornfontein Gold Mining, a company managed by Gold Fields of South Africa, yesterday announced a net loss of R4.91m for the second quarter ending on June 30, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. This is an improvement on the R7.01m net loss for the previous quarter. Gold output rose sharply from just over 1 tonne in the first quarter to 1.534 tonnes in the second quarter.</p>

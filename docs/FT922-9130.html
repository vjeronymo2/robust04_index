			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Daihatsu to launch Malaysian car venture DAIHATSU is to help launch Malaysia's second national car project, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. Daihatsu, which is partly owned by Toyota, was asked by Malaysian prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, last year to help build a car of below 1,000cc and costing not more than 20,000 ringgit (Pounds 4,400). Malaysia's first national car, the Proton Saga with engine capacity of 1,300 and 1,500 cc, was launched in 1985 in a joint-venture between the government and Mitsubishi. Its cost has shot up from around 18,000 ringgit to between 35,000 and 40,000 ringgit. Proton produces about 100,000 vehicles a year, with 15,000 exported. Dr Mahathir said the second car project will be a venture between Daihatsu and the private sector but the government would offer the same incentives it gave to Proton. These would include exemption from import duty of components from Japan. Daihatsu's local partners are to be UMW Holdings, which assembles Toyota cars in Malaysia, state-owned investment agency Permodalan Nasional which has a controlling stake in UMW, and the local Daihatsu distributor. The car will be based on Daihatsu's K-car (mini-car).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 75 (565) -- </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] The idea of a single economic area is being put into  practice, if slowly, said Kyrgyzstan Prime Minister Abbas  Dzhumagulov. Speaking in parliament, he commended Moscow's  recent CIS summit. He said Russia and Kyrgyzstan had signed a  cooperation agreement during it, under which Kyrgyzstan is to  receive a credit of 50 billion rubles.    Dzhumagulov said that, among the priority measures taken by  his government since the beginning of the year, were tighter  financial control, abolition of the practice of customs and tax  concessions, and increasing local government's responsibility  for the execution of the central government's decisions.    Nevertheless, the economic situation remains "extremely  grave," the prime minister said. "There are still no efficient  economic ties, the mutual nonpayment crisis is continuing, the  economy is out of control, and there is a gap between the  production and marketing of output," he said. IF Note:  President Askar Akayev is more optimistic. He said in  parliament on April 13 that the republic's reforms had produced  positive results, "pushing forward the ossified, totally  state-run economy." There are "reassuring signs of  normalization of the economic situation," Akayev said. He said  free prices and the tight monetary policy had had a beneficial  effect on Kyrgyzstan's social life. People had started taking  interest in business enterprise, which had served to increase  goods supplies, he said.    "Unless the government in the immediate future raises funds  to restructure industry, the latter will destroy itself,"  Dzhumagulov said.    He expressed especial concern over the bankruptcy problem,  complaining that not a single enterprise had yet been declared  bankrupt, although a law on bankruptcy had come out. The  economy would have no future unless unprofitable enterprises  were liquidated, he said.    Another serious problem is the visible trade deficit, which  has topped 400 million soms, the premier said. He said the  situation where the country is importing more than it is  exporting is bringing to naught all the anti-inflationary  measures taken by the government, because, in his view, it is  the imported goods that are fueling inflation.    For this reason, the government ought to concentrate on  measures to stimulate domestic production, he said, vowing once  again that all conditions would be provided for small-scale  business. He said the government would temporarily reduce taxes  to encourage production.    Dzhumagulov also said that this year the government, in its  economic policy, would give priority to social objectives. It  is for this purpose that the government has set up a fund to  support poorer population strata.    He said it was essential to start the development of the  Kumtor gold field as soon as possible, which "would not solve  all the problems" but "would be a serious help for the economy  of the republic."    To the objections of parliament members who had repeatedly  demanded that Kyrgyzstan break its agreement on Kumtor, a  deposit estimated to contain 516 tonnes of gold, with the  Canadian company Cameco and instead put up a tender for its  development, Dzhumagulov responded that a tender "would mean  nothing but extra expenses and a loss of time."</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> KGIL radio (1260 AM) on Wednesday will present 12-plus hours on "Abortion 1989:  Both Sides Now," the first time the station has devoted a full broadcast day to  one topic. From 5:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., the regular program hosts will be talking  to guests about legal issues and recent court decisions, rights of the unborn,  the aftermath of abortion and personal stories of women who have had abortions.  Mike Lundy, the station's director of programming and operations, said recent  activities of anti-abortionists and "the changing climate on the issue were the  catalysts" for the special. "We decided this would be an opportune time to  really do an in-depth examination." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

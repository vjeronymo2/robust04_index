			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Injunction granted against Blockbuster A DALLAS court has granted a temporary injunction against Blockbuster, the US video rental chain which owns the Cityvision group in the UK, restricting its activities in certain US east coast areas. The order follows the filing of a lawsuit against Blockbuster by Capitol Entertainment, a Blockbuster franchisee and largely owned by the Zale jewellery store family. The dispute results from Blockbuster's purchase of the sizeable Erol's Video Store chain in the US last year. Capitol, whose franchise area encompasses some of the Erol area, has alleged that Blockbuster promised not to acquire Erol until it had a deal to sell Capitol the Erol stores in Capitol's territories; that it went ahead regardless and then offered the stores on 'the most onerous terms'. A trial date has now been set for January 11, 1993. However, in the meantime the court found that Blockbuster had 'competed unfairly' with the plaintiffs, and that there were grounds for restraining the group's activities in the area. Blockbuster claimed that 'the court had found no evidence to support Capitol Entertainment's contention that it had an agreement with the company to purchase certain Erol's video stores at an agreed-upon price', and heralded this as 'a major victory'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Grafov under the rubric "Privatization": </F> "Americans Failed To See Capitalism"]    [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod was selected as the  exhibition and demonstration city. This was where foreign  delegations and teams of journalists were taken to be vividly  shown the "locomotive of privatization" with all its tenders,  check auctions for pistons, and investment trading sessions for  boilers.    However, a year later the American nonprofit organization  Heritage Foundation published the results of its independent  expert review of the operation of this "locomotive." The authors  met with a number of entrepreneurs engaging in production and  commercial operations and familiarized themselves directly with  the operation of privatized enterprises and shops in the city.    The fact that large state enterprises try in every way  possible to avoid the sale of their shares on the open market in  the course of privatization was the first discovery the  Americans made. The enterprises resort to reserving a  considerable proportion of the stock for the management of the  enterprise and distributing shares among the workers at symbolic  prices, as well as transforming the most profitable state  enterprises into privately held joint-stock companies.    A note of surprise can be felt in another observation: Large  investors are buying state enterprises out of...state credit,  although in civilized countries, the seed capital for such  purchases is generated by the investors themselves through  issuing their stock, before the credit is extended. Moreover,  Russian officials extend credit in a somewhat suspect manner,  "without appropriate security," being guided in the process by  "motives far removed from those of a market economy" (what a  cultured way to put it!).    Following a discourse about a shortage of capital for  privatization, vouchers were faulted too. So far, this "measure  has failed to produce real results and was a political rather  than economic measure" called upon to mitigate social tensions,  which is what some of us guessed long ago. Of course, a  profitable and effective enterprise can be sold to its employees  in the expectation that it will keep working just as smoothly.  However, as the experience of the Americans indicated, the  expectation that workers would work better on becoming owners  has not been confirmed in reality. The management is not capable  of managing the enterprise effectively, knowing that it may be  fired at any moment by employees who are unhappy with the high  requirements imposed on them.    The Americans encountered one eye-opener after another:  Model  samples of contracts between the management of enterprises and  the former organ of property management as represented by the  state or municipality are foisted on enterprises. The system of  issuing licenses to operate becomes an additional source of  pressure on privatized enterprises brought to bear by state  structures.    The authors of the analytical review plunged into the thick  of the entrepreneurial masses, unlike the small groups of  Western experts who, it is noted with a measure of sarcasm, pay  sporadic visits to Nizhniy Novgorod, where they spend a few days  in consultation with representatives of the power structure.  Glaring facts are stated with alarm: Producers pay value-added  tax, although the goods may not have been purchased by  consumers. Retroactive amendments to tax legislation compel the  payment of taxes on operations which at the moment of their  performance were not taxed. Any reporting by state officials on  the disbursement of funds collected for a certain "highway fund"  is absent. Although everyone to a man pays this strange tax, the  condition of the roads in Nizhniy Novgorod remains poor. There  have been no changes in the tax system conducive to  privatization in Nizhniy Novgorod; on the contrary, a new tax  for maintenance of the housing stock (1.5 percent) has been  introduced. The discovery of the last "eye-opener" caused the  altogether divine horror: The total of all taxes comes to 75-85  percent, world practice pointing to no more than 35 percent.    The fact remains, the authors themselves stress, that  privatization of state property is proceeding at a high rate,  but "genuine" results have not been registered so far. Why?    I also visited a demonstration check auction together with  one of the teams of journalists. At a cocktail party given by  Western consultants I tormented several directors with this  question--will "their" privatized enterprises operate  "capitalist-style," i.e., in an effective and competitive  manner? The captains of industry kept their enigmatic silence  and smiled politely in response to the naive question. Their  smiles betrayed the wisdom of life and the knowledge of  something that was obvious to them but beyond me. The answer to  this question also remains a mystery to the authors of the  analytical review, although they did share their thinking on  this account.    First, privatization is not carried out to find additional  sources for replenishing the budget. Second (the hint is not as  heavy but likewise understandable), with our type of  privatization, some officials are getting an opportunity to  pressure private investors (apparently, the Russian word  "extortion" is meant), while other officials "who are privy to  privatization" are getting a chance to "keep their positions in  the economic sphere." At this point we would like to add that  the "former" and the "latter" may be one and the same.    Third, it turns out that state structures that are burdened  by debt strive to sell enterprises placed under their control at  the highest possible prices to--oh horror!--foreigners. In turn,  the foreigners have to pay not only the state but also directly  the officials responsible for privatization.    Easy credit is necessary for the buyout of small trade,  public catering, and consumer-service enterprises (oh holy  simplicity!) instead of the endless discussion by the state  authorities of the dilemma as to whether leased enterprises (for  which leasing rights were purchased at auctions, to boot) are to  be transferred to lessees as their property or not.    The authors observed that the model of providing Western  assistance should be revised. The funds are used mainly to  enrich the individuals engaging in their distribution; technical  assistance boils down to organizing seminars abroad for the  officials of state establishments. In an elegant bow, the  authors hope that the issues raised in their analytical review  will generate a discussion. We hope so too.</p>

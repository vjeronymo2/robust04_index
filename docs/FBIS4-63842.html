			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Zheglov report: "Moscow Denies Claim of </F> Recognition for DRY"]    [Text] Almost exactly four years after the unification of  North and South Yemen into a single state, a real threat of a  split has emerged. At the end of last week 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  deputy chairman of the Yemen Republic's Presidential Council,  announced the secession of the south of the country and the  formation of a new independent state -- the Democratic Republic  of Yemen [DRY]. Moreover, elections to the Presidential Council  were held almost immediately in the southern capital of Aden,  and it is planned to form a government of the republic in the  very near future.    In a statement on this issue, an ITAR-TASS correspondent  reports, 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that the new state is "part  of the Arab nation and its political system is based on the  principles of party and political pluralism." The DRY sees its  main aim as being to restore Yemeni unity on the basis of the  Document of National Accord and Reconciliation signed 20  February this year. At the same time, the leader of the  "Southerners" called on Arab states to recognize the DRY and  give it every possible assistance.    This development of events has forced 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  the leader of the "Northerners," to issue an order to resume the  offensive on Aden which was suspended for the Muslim feast of  'Id al-Adha. Bloody battles have again been launched in the  vicinity of the al-'Anad Air Base, 56 km from the southern  capital. Judging by everything, the "Northerners" have succeed  in establishing control over this strategically most important  installation. Indirect confirmation of that was the statement  from the "Southerners'" military command to evacuate arms dumps  and stores of material and technical resources from the region.  At the same time, there have been reports of the construction  of defensive fortifications in the suburbs of Aden.    Meanwhile, almost a month of fighting has shown that neither  side has been able to win the strategic initiative. Different  sources in Sanaa have admitted that the resistance from the  "Southerners" has been "unexpectedly stubborn." In 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih's opinion, this is also happening because  "certain countries are continuing to supply arms to Aden."    In this connection 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih stated that these  actions will be seen as blatant interference in the country's  internal affairs, with all the ensuing consequences. He also  warned against any attempts to voice support for or to recognize  the DRY.    Strangely enough, there are some stubborn rumors in Sanaa  that the first state to recognize the independence of South  Yemen has been Russia. This has forced Russian Foreign Ministry  representatives to categorically deny these fabrications.  Viktor Posuvalyuk, director of the Department for Near East and  North African Countries, stated that Moscow is expressing  extreme concern about the continuation of hostilities in Yemen  and is calling for a cease-fire, which would benefit the entire  Yemeni people.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARNESS RACING RETURNS TO LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> Harness racing will return to Southern California tonight at Los Alamitos Race  Course.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Lloyd Arnold completed the purchase of the track for $71  million from Hollywood Park, which bought it from Millie Vessels in 1983.  Arnold managed harness races at Los Alamitos from 1979 to 1983.  </P> <P> Racing will be held on Tuesday through Saturday through April 21, starting  nightly at 7:30.  </P> <P> Arnold said the track has spent more than $400,000 on renovations, including  600 new chairs and 100 televisions in the Turf Club.  </P> <P> Part of Arnold's marketing strategy will be to improve the sport's public  image, which has been damaged by allegations of race fixing.  </P> <P> "Qualified drivers with past suspicions, but no proof of wrongdoing, will start  the meeting with a clean slate," he said. "But all drivers have been put on  notice that if something doesn't look right, they're gone immediately. We have  $71 million invested and we don't want to be put out by a few bad apples."  </P></p>

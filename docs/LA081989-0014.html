			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURCHASING RAILROAD RIGHTS OF WAY FOR TRANSIT  </P> <P> In your editorial, you urge that we, the overburdened taxpayers, purchase a  railroad business in which even private companies are losing money. We already  know that Amtrak and the RTD are big losers, that MetroRail is over budget, and  now we've got this. I am sure a "Light Rail Bond Initiative" is just around the  corner.  </P> <P> Rail proponents wrongfully assume that people want to go downtown and that 10  years down the road they'll still be going downtown.  </P> <P> To spur more flexible transportation, we'll have to repeal licensing laws that  make it impossible for the little guy to have a taxi, mini-van, big bus or limo  business, and that allow established companies to charge monopoly prices that  hurt the consumer.  </P> <P> KRIS DIMITROV  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

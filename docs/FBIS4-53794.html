			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- North Korea seems to have  stopped sending teams to international athletic events this year  due to severe food and foreign currency shortages, a government  official here observed Thursday.    The official disclosed that Pyongyang has not taken part in  any international athletic meetings this year. "Almost 10  international sports events have been held this year and it  should have participated in at least seven, but it did not send  any team," he said.    He went on to say that North Korea did not send a team to  the  Winter Olympics held last February in Lillehammer, Norway.  "North Korea applied for entry to the 11th Asia-Pacific Junior  Ice Hockey Tournament held in Beijing last March, but it gave  notification that it would not attend at the last minute, he  said.    "The deepening food and foreign currency shortages in North  Korea are believed to be major reasons not to send its  representative teams to athletic events overseas," he said.    Last year, North Korea dispatched teams to more than 30  international events including the 16th Winter Universiad held  in Poland, he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good evening! It was a dull afternoon here in  Lusaka. Almost nothing took place this afternoon. The  government negotiating team remained in its hotel waiting to  hear from the representatives of the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], who this morning asked for  more time to reflect and find solutions considered most  appropriate for the future of the Voice of Resistance of the  Black Cockerel [Vorgan].    Regarding this issue, the government remains firm: The  country's laws governing radio stations must be applied. This  being the case, the government negotiating team will only agree  to move on to other issues after the conclusion of discussions  on the future of Vorgan.    Meanwhile, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim is cited by the  DAILY MAIL newspaper as having said that the more government  victories in the military field, the more serious difficulties  the peace talks will face. He said UNITA will fight to survive.    In turn, the government's General Eugenio Carneiro is cited  by the DAILY MAIL as having said that the government is ready to  resume talks and that UNITA's participation in the government is  a fait accompli. All the same, Gen. Carneiro said, the  government does not agree that UNITA should impose specific  conditions. He said the international community should continue  to pressure UNITA to become more flexible. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURDER SUSPECT'S 'OBSESSION' FORETOLD IN STUDIO VISIT  </P> <P> Carrying a huge teddy bear and a bouquet of flowers, the man accused of killing  actress Rebecca Schaeffer appeared at the studio where she was taping a  television show two years ago and begged to see her.  </P> <P> But security guards, one of whom would later describe "something haywire" about  Robert John Bardo, removed him from the lot and talked him into returning home  to Arizona.  </P> <P> The incident, recalled this week by Jack Egger, chief of security for The  Burbank Studios, provided one more glimpse into what authorities maintain  became Bardo's fatal obsession with the 21-year-old actress, who was shot to  death July 18 when she opened the security door of the Fairfax District  apartment building where she lived.  </P> <P> Egger, a former Beverly Hills police captain, said he followed standard  procedure in informing Schaeffer's production unit of what happened that June  afternoon in 1987. But whether anyone alerted Schaeffer to Bardo's appearance  remains unclear.  </P> <P> People who were present remember hearing about a persistent fan trying to gain  access to the set but are unsure whether Schaeffer was told. Two producers of  the television series segment Schaeffer was taping, thought to be the people  most likely to have advised her, did not return The Times' phone calls.  </P> <P> What is clear is that it may not have made much difference whether she was  notified. The young actress already had received apparently normal fan letters  from Bardo.  </P> <P> In retrospect, it seems that she should have been warned; in reality, few gave  a second thought to the lovesick youth with the teddy bear.  </P> <P> "So a fan tried to get on the lot. So what? Who's going to think he's a  potential murderer?" asked Mimi Weber, vice president of the production company  for "My Sister Sam," the 1986-88 sitcom that featured Schaeffer. "It would have  seemed harmless: another young kid who's star-struck. We have tons of those.  Lots are lovable; some are crazy. But who's to know?"  </P> <P> In the wake of the Schaeffer shooting, security is being tightened at the  studio lot where Warner Bros. Television, co-producer of "My Sister Sam,"  operates, according to spokesmen. They declined to provide details, but said  part of the reenforced security will focus on audiences that attend live  tapings.  </P> <P> Warner Bros. Television says its policy has always been to inform actors of  potential threats from fans or other people who stalk sets, make provocative  phone calls or are otherwise perceived as being dangerous.  </P> <P> But studio executives concede that the incident involving Bardo two years ago  may have seemed too insignificant, too run-of-the-mill to have aroused unusual  suspicion.  </P> <P> "Actors are apprised when the situation is considered threatening," Warner  spokesman Doug Duitsman said, adding that he did not recall the Bardo studio  incident.  </P> <P> Police in Tucson, Bardo's hometown, where he was arrested July 19 and charged  with Schaeffer's murder, said interviews with the suspect's family confirmed  his trip to the studio.  </P> <P> And, Tucson Police Capt. Michael Ulichny said, Bardo over the last five years  also traveled to Maine, apparently to seek out Samantha Smith, the schoolgirl  who became pen pal to then-Soviet Premier Yuri Andropov, and to New York as  part of a fascination with pop music stars Tiffany and Debbie Gibson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Obsessed' Youth  </P> <P> In describing his meeting with Bardo, then 17, Egger recalled that the  "obsessed" youth first made numerous telephone calls to the production office,  asking to speak to Schaeffer.  </P> <P> Then, on June 2, Bardo arrived at the lot, a facility known as The Ranch, where  "My Sister Sam" was taping and insisted on seeing the actress to give her the  flowers and teddy bear.  </P> <P> "I thought he was just lovesick, which I think he was," said Egger, 62. "He was  terribly insistent on being let in. 'Rebecca Schaeffer' was every other word.  'I gotta see her. I love her. If I could just see her for a minute.' "  </P> <P> Egger said his security guards escorted Bardo from The Ranch to Egger's office  so the two could chat. The security chief told the youth that he could not  interrupt the taping of the television show. He said he finally persuaded Bardo  to give up and go home.  </P> <P> Egger said he drove Bardo to the run-down motel in Hollywood where the youth  was staying. He said Bardo promised to return to Tucson soon. And Bardo called  Egger the next day, saying he was about to board the bus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Raving Lunatic'  </P> <P> "He seemed to be an intelligent kid, no raving lunatic, no dumbbell, but  something was definitely wrong, mentally," Egger said. "There was something  haywire going on, but I didn't perceive it as potentially violent."  </P> <P> Egger, the studio's security chief for 10 years, said that his staff is always  in tune to potentially dangerous fans and that he felt the Bardo problem had  been taken care of.  </P> <P> After sending Bardo home, he informed the production company of what had  happened and alerted his staff to be on the lookout in case the man returned.  He said he could not have had Bardo arrested because he had not committed a  crime; he had not even trespassed.  </P> <P> "We get 100 (cases) in a year, people trying to get in, fans writing letters,"  the security chief said. "What more could I have done?"  </P> <P> Bardo's appearance at the studio came at a time that Schaeffer's co-star,  actress Pam Dawber, had been receiving threatening telegrams, Egger recalled.  Those were reported to the FBI.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Notification  </P> <P> Sue Cameron, Schaeffer's agent at the time, said she felt sure the young  actress had been notified that an overly persistent fan had tried to get onto  the lot. But security had "taken care of it," the incident had passed and it  was forgotten.  </P> <P> Such casualness is changing, the agent said. She now urges all of her clients  to obtain post office boxes as a way to remain more anonymous and less  accessible and to take extra precautions when answering their doorbells.  </P> <P> In the past, she said, "we have treated these things too cavalierly."  </P> <P> In response to the Schaeffer slaying, a state legislator Tuesday announced  legislation to restrict public access to information held by the Department of  Motor Vehicles.  </P> <P> Bardo was allegedly able to locate Schaeffer through a private investigator's  routine check with the DMV, which makes home addresses available to any state  resident for a small fee.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) said he will introduce a bill that will  allow drivers to list a business or agent's address or a post office box.  Access to home addresses would be restricted to law enforcement agencies,  insurance companies and others deemed "appropriate," he said.  </P> <P> "Anyone with $1 to $5 can fill out (a DMV form) . . . and in a short time, get  the home address of their favorite anchor person, favorite movie star, favorite  Dodger or favorite politician," Roos told a press conference.  </P> <P> He said the DMV received 16 million such inquiries last year.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Paul Feldman contributed to this story.  </P></p>

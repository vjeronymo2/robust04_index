			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jacek Swidzinski: "Second Round of Concessions: </F> Oil and Gas Prospecting"]    [Text] On 12 April 1994 expires the deadline for the  submission of bids during the second round of bidding for  licenses to prospect for and explore deposits of crude petroleum  and natural gas in the Lublin region and the Polish part of the  Carpathians. The bidding, organized by the Ministry for  Environmental Protection, Natural Resources, and Forestry, is  restricted to foreign bidders.    Consider that the first round of the bidding resulted in  granting licenses for oil and gas prospecting in Poland to the  following companies: Amoco, to prospect for and explore oil and  gas deposits in central and southeastern Poland and methane in  black-coal seams in Upper Silesia; and British Gas, to prospect  for and explore oil and gas deposits in central Poland. A  similar license for another segment of central Poland was  granted to the Exxon-Shell Consortium. The above-named companies  also intend to participate in the second round of bidding, and  such renowned companies as Mobil, Texaco, and Pan Canadian are  also expected to participate.    Prospecting in the zones allocated as a result of the first  bidding could commence as early as this spring, except that the  absence of suitable agreements with the Polish Ministry of  Finance is an impediment. That is because the prospecting  companies try, as is the custom worldwide in such situations, to  debit investment start-up expenditures to operating expenses.  Under the regulations in force, they are tax-exempt during the  first three years of their operation, but the start-up period  (which may involve expenditures roughly totaling $150 million)  may last as long as six years. Accordingly, the prospecting  companies desire tax deferment for seven to 10 years in a row,  and the capitalization of their expenditures after the start-up  period. In addition, they desire exemption from the VAT  [value-added tax].    Such terms appear to be highly preferential, slanted in  favor  of oil and gas prospectors (or rather prospectors for gas and  eventually oil), especially considering how well-heeled they  are. But several other factors have to be considered here.  First, it is not that Exxon-Shell, Amoco, or Texaco needs  Poland. On the contrary, by letting these companies in, we could  save $150 million that would otherwise have to be paid from our  budget. Second, these companies are too mighty to place them in  the role of a petitioner for something that is normally granted  worldwide to oil and gas prospectors. For them to include Poland  is no big deal, whereas to us this is highly important.    There still remains the sensitive issue of the role and  place  of a domestic prospector--namely, Polish Oil and Gas Extraction  Corporation (PGNiG).    "Our agreement with the PGNiG divides Poland into two  zones,"  explained Director Marek Hofman at the Department of Natural  Resources, in the Ministry for Environmental Protection, Natural  Resources, and Forestry." The first zone encompasses areas in  which development is already under way and deposits have been  explored and are generally easier to develop. Segments of the  second zone are successively opened to bidding by oil and gas  prospectors. These segments exist in exceptionally difficult  geological conditions and are highly risky."    Because we are on the subject, we will conclude with some  good news. Petrobaltic, by now in its capacity as a purely  Polish company, intends any day now to initiate the development  of Section B-3 in the Baltic, which is considered highly  promising. Prospecting in the Polish shelf [of the Baltic Sea]  is to be continued.</p>

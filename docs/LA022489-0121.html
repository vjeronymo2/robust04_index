			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DURAN, WANTING MORE, TAKES ON BARKLEY;  </P> <P> EX-CHAMPION, NOW 37, SEEKS A FOURTH TITLE  </P> <P> At the dawn of the 1980s, Roberto Duran was stepping out of the ring a loser  after telling Sugar Ray Leonard, no mas. No more.  </P> <P> But as the sun sets on the '80s, here is Duran, still in the ring, still asking  for mas, mas.  </P> <P> At 37, his legendary "hands of stone" having turned, in the opinion of some, to  hands of clay, Duran will return to the ring tonight in search of a fourth  world title. The Panamanian will face Iran Barkley, the World Boxing Council's  middleweight champion, in a 12-round match at the Atlantic City Convention  Center.  </P> <P> Barkley is favored, but the doubters are out in force on both sides.  </P> <P> Barkley couldn't have a more fitting first name than Iran, considering how  explosive and unpredictable his career has been.  </P> <P> He surprised a lot of people by knocking out highly touted Michael Olajide last  March.  </P> <P> Then he shocked people last June when, bloody and seemingly beaten, he reached  back for a devastating, third-round knockout punch against Thomas Hearns to win  the WBC title.  </P> <P> "People said it was a lucky punch," Barkley said, obvious bitterness in his  voice. "Thomas Hearns didn't think it was a lucky punch. There is no such thing  as a lucky punch."  </P> <P> This fight represents vindication for the 28-year-old Barkley, but not for  himself so much. No, this one's for Davey Moore.  </P> <P> Nearly six years ago, Duran knocked out Moore to win the World Boxing Assn.  junior middleweight championship.  </P> <P> Moore and Barkley went even farther back, to common roots in the South Bronx.  Barkley was a sparring partner and Moore's best friend. And he always felt that  Duran cheated to beat his old buddy by thumbing him.  </P> <P> Moore never got a rematch. Then, last June, just three days before the  Barkley-Hearns fight, Moore was killed in a freak accident when his unoccupied  Jeep ran over him in his driveway.  </P> <P> In Barkley's mind, Moore gets his rematch tonight.  </P> <P> "Davey plays a big part in this," Barkley said. "This is going to be  vindication for everything. I told myself a long time ago that Duran would  venture into the middleweight division someday and we would meet."  </P> <P> Barkley believes that Moore was never the same after the Duran fight. "It's not  that Duran killed Davey," Barkley said. "But he killed his spirit."  </P> <P> Duran, who has also held the undisputed world lightweight and WBC welterweight  championships in his 21-year ring career and is the only man to ever beat Sugar  Ray Leonard, in the first of their two fights, isn't impressed with Barkley's  crusade.  </P> <P> "Barkley better fight for himself, not Davey Moore," said Duran through an  interpreter. "Davey Moore is dead, but I didn't kill him."  </P> <P> Also featured on tonight's card are five '88 Olympians making their pro debuts  -- four Americans and welterweight Robert Wangila of Kenya, in separate  four-round fights.  </P> <P> The star of the group is the Olympic heavyweight gold medalist, Ray Mercer,  from Augusta, Ga., who will fight Jerry McGhee of Welch, W. Va. Mercer has yet  to throw a punch for pay but has already set his sights on heavyweight champion  Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> "I'm going to try to fight every two weeks," said Mercer, who is already 27. "I  can see myself fighting Tyson in about 18 months."  </P> <P> Wangila, another winner of gold in Seoul, will face Sidney Gomez of Brazil.  </P> <P> The bantamweight gold medalist, Kennedy McKinney of Memphis, will go up against  David Allers of of Springfield, Mass.  </P> <P> Andrew Maynard, the light-heavyweight gold medalist from Cheverly, Md., meets  Troy Jackson of Rockville, Md.  </P> <P> And Michael Carbajal of Phoenix, silver medalist in the light-flyweight  division, will meet Willy Grigsby of St. Paul, Minn.  </P></p>

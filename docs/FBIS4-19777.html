			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Renaud Girard report: "Juppe: A `Political Plan' Is </F> Needed"]    [Text] [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe said in a news  conference yesterday that the extension of air strikes to  protect all safe areas in Bosnia "is pointless unless it is part  of a political plan." The "armchair strategists" who are  demanding indiscriminate strikes do not want to understand this,  the foreign minister said sarcastically.    Following two years of shelling by the Serbs of the six  Bosnian cities which form the UN safe areas, what "political  plan" are we talking about? For Mr. Juppe, the aim is first to  secure a common stance by Russia, the United States, Europe, and  the United Nations.    The minister found the period of one month "rather long" for  convening an international summit on Bosnia, which Washington  and Moscow have agreed in principle and which has been welcomed  with "satisfaction" by Francois Mitterrand. However, Mr. Juppe  stressed that such a summit should be "conclusive;" it must be  prepared by meetings at the level of ministers and experts.  <H5>  Use of Force </H5>   Mr. Juppe added: "We are permanently on the edge of the  abyss. We must move more quickly in seeking a political solution  to the conflict." The theme has constantly dominated the many  conferences (Geneva, London, or Athens) for two years, "peace  plans" (Vance-Owen, Stoltenberg, and so forth), and other "joint  action programs" which have been dreamed up by the international  community to restore peace to Bosnia. We have seen how  successful they have been.    He admitted that NATO "was wrong" not to strike in Gorazde.  But he also repeated that "there was no question of engaging in  a military reconquest of Bosnia." Alain Juppe is therefore  arguing for a veritable "sanctuarization" of the safe areas.    The minister chided that "sanctuarization" is probably a  word  which would not have been used by the "armchair strategists."  But these "armchairs" are also to be found in New York: in the  UN Security Council where France has a permanent seat, with the  right of veto.    It is at least one year since that body was supposed to have  defined a policy for Bosnia. By its Resolution 836 of 4 June  1993, the Council authorizes the use of force to protect the  safe areas which it had instituted a month earlier. On 31 March  1993 (Resolution 816), the Council had also authorized the use  of force to ensure respect for the "air exclusion zone" decreed  six months earlier. This second resolution has been violated  more than 1,000 times.    One essential question remains unanswered. Is there also an  "armchair policy?"</p>

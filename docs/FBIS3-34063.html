Gunmen opened fire on the supporters of AL mayoral candidate  Mohammad Hanif, who is leading in the weekend polls, in the  Lalbagh area, killing six instantly. Several of the injured were  in critical condition.    "We do not have any details on who fired," one police  officer  at the Lalbagh police station said.    The injured were being treated at a local hospital.    During Sunday's first ever mayoral and city commissioner  elections, one school boy was killed and more than 200 were  injured in sporadic clashes between rival groups.    Hanif is leading with a wide margin against Prime Minister  Khaleda Zia's ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) nominee  Mirza Abbas in Dhaka, while another AL candidate, Mohiuddin  Chowdhury, has won in the port city of Chittagong, according to  preliminary election commission results.    But the BNP clinched victory in the cities of Khulna and  Rajshahi.    The elections are seen here as the first popularity test of  the two main political groups, and political analysts said the  AL sees the municipal vote as a way of rebuilding its strength  in crucial urban areas before the 1996 national polls, after  losing all eight Dhaka seats and most of the other urban seats  to the BNP in the 1991 parliamentary election.</p>

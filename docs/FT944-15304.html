			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: From negative to positive - Prices in Europe have recovered sharply The market for waste paper in Europe has turned around in recent months, making it worthwhile for many countries to recycle material for the first time in years. Some grades of waste paper and board were even priced negatively at the beginning of the year - the authorities would pay processors to take it away  -but have shot up in value as shortages have appeared across the continent. 'Although it looks like a vast increase in waste paper prices, we are actually just getting back to the level we saw in 1989 before we were hit by the recession,' says Geoffrey Jones, national secretary at the British Waste Paper Association. A waste paper index of UK prices, which sets 1990 as 100, has shot up from 59 at the beginning of the year to 122 in August as consumption has increased by 8 per cent. Prices in continental Europe have risen even faster with increases for many grades of between 70 per cent and 100 per cent. 'We have gone from huge surpluses to huge shortages,' said Gerry West, sales director of Severnside Waste Paper in Cardiff, which is part of the St Regis group. Although shortages have eased slightly in the past couple of months, West points to the low levels of stock carried by European paper mills as a measure of tight supplies. He reckons that stocks in the UK were generally at 80,000 tonnes in mid-September compared with the usual 150,000 tonnes. Waste paper prices are to a large extent following the dramatic increases in the virgin pulp market. At the same time, demand from Asian importers has sucked waste paper out of Europe. German waste collectors are also not exporting so much to other European markets and concentrating on developing processing capacity at home. 'In the past couple of years, German recycling laws had encouraged the collection of large amounts of old paper and the country had little capacity to handle it,' says Benedict Southworth, campaigner at Friends of the Earth. 'So it was virtually given away on the European market, forcing down prices,' he adds. The rise in the waste paper market is leading to a hike in newsprint prices as mills seek to recoup raw materials costs. October increases are expected to push the UK market between 7 per cent and 8 per cent higher. West expects the price rises to prompt higher recycling rates in many European countries. For example, recovery rates in Italy and Spain were very low as processors found it cheaper to buy German material. In the UK a new newsprint mill in Aylesford, Kent, will be opened next year with expected demand for an additional 400,000 tonnes of old newspapers a year. Britain consumes 12m tonnes of paper and board products a year. But it collects only 3.5m tonnes of material for recycling. 'Even with a conservative recovery rate of 50 per cent, we ought to be recycling 6m tonnes a year, so there is a lot to go at,' says West.</p>

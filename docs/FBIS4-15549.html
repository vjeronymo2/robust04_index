			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 8 (AFP) -- A senior defense official  said Friday that U.S. and Russian troops would hold joint  exercises in Russia later this year, but the announcement  sparked an angry outcry from hardline lawmakers.    "American troops will never set foot on Russian territory,"  ultranationalist deputy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said shortly after  Deputy Defense Minister Georgi Kondratyev announced the planned  exercises to the State Duma.    "Officers who think they can get an extra star from  organizing this kind of exercise should remember that the regime  here will change one day and they will lose everything,"  Zhirinovskiy stated.    Kondratyev said the joint exercises, agreed to during the  Russian-U.S. summit in January, would be held in July in the  southern Urals region of Orenburg and would be conducted by the  27th Motorized Division of the Russian Army and the U.S. 3d  Mechanized Infantry Division. A total of 250 soldiers from each  country, most of them officers, were to take part in the  exercises, Kondratyev said, adding that they would focus on  exploring ways Russian and U.S. troops could coordinate work in  peacekeeping operations. The Russian side would be equipped  with 10 armoured vehicles and 23 cars while the U.S.  participants would have only 35 cars, he stated.    Kondratyev stressed that the U.S. Government would pay all  expenses for its troops, estimated at two million dollars, and  noted that the U.S. troops would arrive supplied with all the  food needed for the exercises. Russian expenses for the  exercises would be about 100 million rubles (55,000 dollars), he  said.    Zhirinovskiy and other hardline deputies however denounced  the plan and one, Alexander Mikhailov, called on the Duma to  appeal to President Boris Yeltsin and to the government to  cancel the exercises. "Who will keep an eye on the Americans  and who will guarantee us that they will not start recruiting  spies in the heart of Russia!" said Alexander Nevzorov, another  hardline nationalist and former television commentator.</p>

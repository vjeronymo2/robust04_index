The foreign minister, Mr. Velayati, in an interview with our  correspondent, while declaring Iran's readiness to give any  assistance to the innocent people of Palestine and for serious  action against the Zionists, said: Iran's delegation at the  United Nations has called on the Security Council to take  measures to end the Zionist atrocity in occupied Palestine.    Mr. Velayati added: Despite the Zionists' act, Palestinian  Muslims will participate in the arenas of confrontation against  the occupiers and that action [massacre] is an answer for those  naive people who have pinned their hopes on a peace resulting  from the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    Our country's foreign minister also held a telephone  conversation with his Pakistani counterpart and conferred with  him on the need to convene an ICO meeting.</p>

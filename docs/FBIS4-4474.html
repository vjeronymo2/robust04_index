			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Japan on Friday supported a  United Nations call on North Korea to allow full international  inspection of its nuclear facilities suspected of being used to  develop nuclear weapons.    "The UN statement underlined what the international  community  wants North Korea to do to help resolve the issue of Pyongyang's  suspected nuclear program through dialogue," Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "We will  support this statement," the top government spokesman said.    All 15 members of the UN Security Council, including China,  a  traditional ally of North Korea, agreed to issue the statement  Thursday calling for Pyongyang to accept full inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency.    Later in the day, Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Kishichiro Amae also told a press conference that Japan supports  the U.N. presidential [as received] statement on North Korea  because it "clearly shows as a unified opinion of the world  community" what North Korea should do to solve the problem  through dialogue. He added that Japan "strongly wishes North  Korea would pay serious attention to the statement."    "We also consider that the role of China, in her  relationship  with North Korea, is still very, very important," he said.</p>

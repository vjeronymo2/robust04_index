			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Flat profits forecast at Citizen Watch CITIZEN Watch, the Japanese watch and information equipment maker, has blamed slowdown in the domestic economy and a sharp drop in capital spending for a 20.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profit, to Y16.89bn (Dollars 127m), for the year to the end of March. The decline is expected to be characteristic of Japanese companies' fiscal 1991 results, as is the company's forecast of flat sales and profits for the present year. For last year, Citizen reported a 4.7 per cent fall in sales, to Y236.2bn, in spite of a 5.9 per cent increase in unit sales of wrist watches at 162.6m. The company said sluggish sales of luxury models were behind a bare 1 per cent rise in watch revenue. Sales of industrial machinery and equipment fell 18.8 per cent, as Japanese companies cut capital spending, while sales of floppy disk drives fell 24.3 per cent because of troubled computer markets in the US and Europe. However, sales of notebook-style computers rose 5.3 per cent. As with many Japanese companies over the past year, Citizen softened the impact of economic slowdown and high interest rates by tapping its cash reserves, which fell from Y73.17bn to Y54.76bn. Meanwhile, it reduced its exposure in the stock market and sharply increased its holdings of bonds, from Y54m to Y9.4bn. Citizen said the the condition of the domestic economy was 'still critical', while recovery in Europe and the US appears to have been delayed. For the year, pre-tax profit is forecast to rise 0.6 per cent, to Y17bn, on a 1.6 per cent increase in sales to Y240bn.</p>

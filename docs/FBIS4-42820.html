			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- In the communique, the OECD  ministers described the December signing of the Uruguay Round  world trade accords and the planned creation of the WTO as  "historic events which mark an important step toward a universal  trading system."    The ministers then clarified their commitment to "do  everything" to ensure the round's accords will be ratified so  that the WTO can take effect on Jan. 1 next year.    The ministers also agreed the OECD will "resist  protectionism  in all its forms and continue to work toward further trade  liberalization, proper functioning of market mechanisms and  deregulation."    The communique underscored the importance for the OECD to  continue to build up "contact, dialogue and cooperation" with  nonmember countries, which it says are "gaining relevance in the  world economy and are basing their development on market  principles, pluralist democracy and respect for human rights, as  the OECD countries have long done."    Specifically, the communique said the OECD will pursue  policy  coordination with China by exploring "possibilities for dialogue  and cooperation...where mutual interests exist."    The communique supported South Korea's bid to join the OECD  club in 1996.    "(South) Korea has established further close links with the  OECD and is now taking part in a number of activities on the  same footing as member countries," the ministers said, noting  Seoul plans to file a formal application for membership by the  end of the year.    The OECD ministers also called for further dialogue with  other Asian countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, former  communist bloc countries and Latin American nations.    This year's OECD ministerial meeting was divided into three  major topics -- "promoting growth and employment,"  "strengthening the multilateral system" and "the role of the  OECD in an evolving world."    Proposals under the first topic were unveiled on the first  day of the ministerial conference. The unusual advance release  of part of the communique reflects the growing sense of crisis  within the OECD about the world jobless issue.    As prescriptions for the unemployment problem, in which 35  million people are out of work within the OECD group, OECD  Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye issued a special statement  Tuesday [7 June] appealing to OECD member countries to formulate  action programs to rectify structural problems that hamper job  creation in the world.    In order to spur global creation of jobs, Japan and Europe  were indirectly requested under the communique to quicken their  economic recoveries through further fiscal and monetary steps.    "Where recovery is not yet sustained, eased monetary policy  should be maintained...where possible, consistent with the  medium-term policy objective of budget consolidation, fiscal  measures will be implemented as necessary to ensure sustained  noninflationary growth led by strong domestic demand," the  communique said.    After the closing of the ministerial meeting, the 33rd of  its  kind since 1973, the Paris-based think tank signed a cooperation  pact with Russia aimed at smoothing its shift to a market  economy for the country's eventual integration into the world  economy.    During the signing ceremony, the OECD ministers and Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev confirmed mutual cooperation in  crafting a market-oriented reform program that focuses on  establishing a legal, institutional and statistical framework in  Russia.    The pact calls for an annual review of implementation of  reform measures proposed.    The joint communique warned against the use of unilateral  retaliation-oriented measures as a tool for settling bilateral  trade disputes.    "Any trade-restrictive or distortive measures that would  contradict" the Uruguay Round trade accords should be avoided,  the communique said in an apparent reference to the recent U.S.  move to resort to retaliatory steps like the Super 301 trade  clause.    Nobuo Matsunaga, Japanese Government representative for  external affairs, told Tuesday's ministerial session that  unilateral measures run the risk of eroding the multilateral  trade system.    The communique called for any country in trade wrangling to  use dispute settlement procedures under the WTO, which will have  more enforcing power than GATT.    The ministers agreed to promote "effective observance" of  recommended measures intended to curb bribery in international  business transactions.    The measures are targeted at schemes by individuals and  corporations to bribe public servants in other nations to smooth  their business.    The ministers also agreed to extend its anti-money  laundering  program for an additional five years.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking reverses early advance PROFIT-TAKERS made their expected appearance in the UK stock market yesterday but the broad range of shares held on to the gains achieved this week. The FT-SE Index was again held back by determined selling of pharmaceutical stocks, with Fisons hit hard as Tilade, its asthma drug, met criticism from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The session opened strongly as some UK public opinion polls indicated an improvement in the ratings of the Conservative government of Mr John Major. Switching from the pharmaceutical sector into the cyclical stocks continued, with the institutions buying the banks, building and construction and retail stocks. The Footsie quickly advanced by nearly 20 points in early dealings to challenge the 2,560 mark, despite heavy falls in Glaxo, Fisons and SmithKline Beecham which between them represented minus 8.6 on the Footsie scale. The stock market slowed down at midday and profit-takers appeared when Wall Street made a slow start to the new session after IBM disclosed a loss for the final quarter. The early gains in UK stocks were steadily whittled away and, although the Dow edged higher in UK hours, London closed down on the day, at least in index terms. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,536.7, a net loss of 4.9. This week has brought a gain of around 2.4 per cent in the UK stock market as hopes of economic recovery have prompted switching into those stocks thought likely to respond to an improved business climate. The sudden advance in the London market has been the more impressive in that it was triggered by cash-raising selling of the heavyweight pharmaceutical stocks. Trading volume remained high yesterday, with Seaq recording 687.2m shares against 638.4m on Thursday. This week has seen an increase in genuine customer, or retail, business in equities. Thursday, the most active day this week, saw retail volume worth Pounds 1.2bn. European-based funds, which have shown themselves sensitive to political trends in the UK, were buying equities in London yesterday. Domestic investors were also active, taking the view that this week's cuts in mortgage rates may set the scene for further stimulus to the economy at Budget time. The UK retail index figures, showing an annualised rate of 4.5 per cent in December, confirmed expectations in the City of London. Government bonds, the clearest beneficiaries from falling inflation, moved upwards and although below the best, showed gains of around  3/8 at the close. Equity, or customer, volume in equities has picked up sharply since the Christmas holiday and remains above last year's daily averages.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Knin, April 10 (TANJUG) -- Republic of Serb Krajina  (RSK) President Milan Martic said Sunday that the RSK Parliament  maintained that a political solution to the RSK should only be  sought within the conference on the former Yugoslavia.    Martic conferred in Knin with Deputy Co-chairman of the  Conference on the Former Yugoslavia Kai Eide and Russian  Ambassador in Zagreb Leonid Kerestedzhiants at a preliminary  meeting ahead of the second-round RSK-Krajina talks, opened in  March.    The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed in 1991 by the  local Serbs in their ancestral lands within Croatia's  Communist-era arbitrary borders, in response to Croatia's  violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and its  attempt to downgrade the local Serbs' status to that of a  national minority. Krajina became a U.N.-Protected Area in  March 1992.    In two referendums so far, the RSK Serbs have voted against  their return to Zagreb's jurisdiction.    On March 30, RSK and Croatian representatives signed a  ceasefire agreement in the Russian embassy in Zagreb. The  agreement took effect on April 4.    The RSK Parliament believes that the second phase of the  talks, which is to include economic, humanitarian and political  issues, could be held in any Russian embassy, except the one in  Zagreb, said Martic.    After the talks, Martic assessed them as very useful and  voiced his satisfaction with the degree of Eide's and  Kerestedzhiants's understanding for RSK stands. He added that  only an impartial stand towards the relations in the area could  bring about solutions acceptable to all.    Eide, for his part, said that the ceasefire agreement was  reached and observed by both sides, adding that the  international community was very well prepared for the  second-round RSK-Croatia talks which should open as soon as  possible.    The international community platform on RSK-Croatia  humanitarian relations gives priority to the re-opening of  traffic and communications. Also to be discussed in terms of  priority are: Industrial cooperation, cooperation in the field  of energy and water supplies, trade and agriculture and lastly,  social welfare policy and humanitarian relations issues.    It has been confirmed that the RSK is soon to submit a list  of its own priorities.    Eide said that if both sides showed good will and readiness  to cooperate, the way they did with the ceasefire agreement, the  results would soon follow.    Kerestedzhiants said that it was all up to Knin and Zagreb,  adding that reaching a political settlement would also depend on  both sides.</p>

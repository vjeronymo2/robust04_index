Pakistan has been an active supporter of this principle  on humane grounds from the very beginning. However, as any  intelligent person can understand, the only way to protect human  civilization from the nuclear danger is to remove all nuclear  weapons and related technology from the whole world. It is  amazing that the United States and some other powers are using  threats, deceit, avarice, fraud, and other despicable methods  against the countries that have this technology and whom they  think are a danger to world peace. However, the countries that  have the support of the United States and its allies are not  checked and are allowed to have these destructive weapons as if  they are toys. This attitude is totally atrocious, unfair, and  extreme. It is especially used against Pakistan and other  Islamic countries, North Korea, and other third world countries  about which the United States and its allies for some reason do  not have a good opinion. Let us reflect a bit. If India has a  stockpile of nuclear weapons and Pakistan is stopped even from  using this technology for peaceful uses, how can they guarantee  making this region safe from nuclear dangers? This situation can  help only make nuclear weapons available for unilateral  expansionist designs. Had Japan had nuclear weapons, we can  safely say that nuclear bombs would not have been dropped on its  two highly populated cities. Therefore, seriousness and  responsibility calls for the United States and its cohort  nations to either totally end nuclear technology in the whole  world or at least form a fair policy for controlling nuclear  weapons in this region, instead of coming after the Pakistani  nuclear program. If this is not done, then Pakistan has no  reason to have its hands amputated and live at the mercy of a  cruel country like India. Doing this would be more dangerous  than signing one's own death sentence.</p>

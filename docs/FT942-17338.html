			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Construction group breathes again  -Other companies Amec, the building and civil engineering company, will on Thursday announce results for 1993 - a year which looks to have marked the turning point in the UK construction recession. The company, which suffered more badly than most contractors from its excursion into UK housebuilding, is expected to have bounced back into the black. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 22m-Pounds 25m, compared with a Pounds 87.5m loss after provisions of Pounds 114.6m in 1992. The market will be interested to hear Amec's view on the outlook for UK contracting margins following the recent negative comments.</p>

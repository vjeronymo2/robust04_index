			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Institutions agree to share information on governance A more structured approach to exchanging information internationally on attitudes towards corporate governance issues has come a step closer, after an agreement by organisations representing institutional investors. Associations for institutional investors in a range of countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK, have decided to exchange information on a more routine basis about questions such as directors' remuneration and the duties of non-executive board members. The associations, which include the Council for Institutional Investors, an umbrella organisation for US pension funds, will pass each other copies of papers setting out their broad attitudes towards governance issues, so that each is more aware of the practice in other countries and can make that information available to its members. Some organisations would like to see that develop within the next year or two into a network for exchanging more specific information. This would not be intended to lead to the establishment of common positions or to making recommendations on how investors should vote on issues. Instead, the aim would be to ensure that, when questions arise for shareholders to decide, institutional investors are in a better position to know how the approach of a particular company compares with local practice. It is already clear, however, that not all the associations which have agreed to the first stage would want to be involved in dealing with company-specific information. In the UK, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British Insurers, whose members manage more than Pounds 550bn (Dollars 852bn) of investment funds, have been increasingly adopting a high profile on corporate governance. Last month, for example, the ABI wrote to a number of the UK's largest companies expressing concern over large payments to former directors. The question of handling corporate governance questions in an international context will be raised next week at a conference on European investment issues organised by the NAPF.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour attacks trade figures MR NEIL KINNOCK pressed home Labour's claim to be the party of exports and industry yesterday by using a whistlestop visit to the Midlands to launch a 'manufacturing manifesto'. The 'Made In Britain' presentation in Birmingham - Labour's first big election news conference outside London - was stage-managed to coincide with publication of the latest trade figures, which showed that Britain recorded a deficit of Pounds 750m last month. Mr Kinnock described the figures as 'quite dreadful'. He added: 'What is really concerning about them is that we have got an economy which is at best flat and possibly still slipping backwards. 'The government should have taken action recommended by the Labour party a long time ago to get an investment-led recovery.' In what is expected to be the party's last initiative on the economy before a shift to its public services' agenda today, Mr Kinnock argued that tax breaks for investment alongside training and employment schemes would 'stimulate activity and build confidence'. The Labour leader's case was backed by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, who unveiled a modest three-point programme of additional steps to flesh out Labour's already published Pounds 1.1bn industrial recovery programme. The measures included grant aid for engineering investment, an 'Inventions in Britain' project to help small companies bring innovations to production, and the creation of regionally-based export advice centres. Earlier, asked how he would control inflation, Mr Kinnock said that a combination of the constraints imposed by membership of the exchange rate mechanism, supply-side measures and credit controls would prove adequate to contain price rises. He rejected suggestions that a national minimum wage would lead to escalating pay claims. Labour would make economic growth a higher priority than achieving nil inflation if the cost of eliminating price rises was to 'devastate' the economy, Mr Kinnock said. 'We are not prepared to see the economy laid waste in order the get zero inflation when we could have a thriving economy, an investing economy, a high-employment and high-wage economy, with a very modest level of inflation.' He backed comments on Sunday by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, that he would be satisfied by a rate of price rises paralleling the European Community average. Mr Kinnock dismissed a suggestion that his plans for a national economic assessment amounted to a repeat of the National Plan, launched by Labour in the 1960s. The differences lay in ERM membership and a greater emphasis on the government in partnership with the private sector, rather than imposing planning on it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today morning, the notorious youthwingers of  MRND-CDR [Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development, and Coalition for the Defense of the Republic]  numbering 50 and 100, backed by the gendarmes, staged violent  demonstrations blocking the road from Kacyiru [Kigali outskirts]  to the headquarters of UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda]  and committed acts of terror against both motorists and  pedestrians.    It all started at around 0930 AM when armed youthwingers of  MRND- CDR converged at 100 meters from CND [National Development  Council] building where RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front] officials  reside, and erected barricades in the roads. The notorious  supporters of MRND-CDR began to pull people out of cars,  confiscated things, smashed windscreens, and forced the owners  of vehicles to walk on foot. According to an eyewitness, one  person was violently pulled out of the car and slashed with a  panga [machete].    The attackers accused the victims of being tall, and  therefore a Tutsi, according to them. All these acts of terror  took place in the presence of security forces, the local  paramilitary gendarmes. The gendarmes seemed concerned with the  security of the perpetrators of violence instead of  administering law and order. The only vehicles allowed to pass  were those of RTLM [expansion unknown], a radio station used by  MRND-CDR, and that of Mr. [name indistinct] the secretary  general of MRND-CDR party, which passed in the area several  times. At around 1100 AM, the MRND-CDR gang stopped an RPF  vehicle which was taking an RPA [Rwandan Patriotic Army] officer  to the headquarters of UNAMIR to meet Brigadier General Romeo  Dallaire [UNAMIR commander]. In order to pass, the RPA soldiers  escorting the officer had to shoot in the air to disperse those  manning the illegal roadblock. When the RPF vehicle returned  from the headquarters of UNAMIR, it was again stopped by the  MRND-CDR youth. When the RPA soldiers tried to pass they were  shot at by the gendarmes who had led an ambush nearby. The RPA  returned fire and they drove home. The gendarmes continued  shooting and bullets hit the CND building in which the RPF  officials reside.    Contrary to reports by Radio Kigali nobody was injured by  the  bullets during the exchange of fire. The only casualty reported  was the person cut with a panga by the MRND-CDR youthwingers.  According to UNAMIR regulations, demonstrations are supposed to  take place 1.5 km away from the RPF residence. But the MRND-CDR  activists have been staging their demonstration close to the RPF  residence in order to provoke RPF soldiers guarding the place.  Today's illegal roadblock was erected only 100 meters from the  main entrance to the CND building.    Meanwhile, reports from Kigali say that the presidential  guards and the gendarmes have started vacating their families  from the area. The presidential guards are said to be spreading  rumors that RPF soldiers are planning to do something tonight,  which is something the presidential guards did not explain.  Other members of presidential guards in civilian clothes are  reported to have spent the day making reconnaissance around the  RPF residence at CND.    Following President Habyarimana's move to block the setting  up of the broad-based transitional institutions, there have been  increasing acts of provocation by MRND-CDR activists and these  are now being joined by the government forces, the gendarmes,  and presidential guards.</p>

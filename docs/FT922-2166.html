			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (14): Boost for efficiency - Teleworking/Telecommuting WITH plenty of empty office space in many of the world's cities, the growing interest in teleworking - or working from home - may be bad news for hard-hit commercial property markets. A rather formal definition of teleworking (sometimes known as telecommuting) from BT is: 'Any time when an employee, instead of travelling to a central office, stays at home or at a remote site and uses a telephone line to send and receive work.' Though you may not have known it, you have probably teleworked at some time or another - just recall those days when you have worked at home, making extensive use of the phone, perhaps due to a transport strike or because of sickness. Furthermore, many business activities involve work at home. In the UK, more than 500,000 people are thought to telework full-time, with a further 1.5m part-time. Some analysts estimate that by the year 2010, at least 20 per cent of non-manual working in the UK will be working from home, or near it. Teleworking's basic enabling technology is, of course, the telephone, but as well as allowing remote voice-communication, the phone line can be used for fax machines and modems which respectively enable images and data to be sent speedily from one place to another. Here, office memos and correspondence can be prepared on the ubiquitous PC and transported by electronic mail services such as Telecom Gold, Mercury Link 7500 and MCI Mail. These facilities can also be supported in all but the most remote places by means of cellular phones. While developments such as ISDN, Centrex, broadband and intelligent networks will smooth the path to teleworking, the digitalisation of the basic telephone network is arguably the most important factor. Many conventional office activities are suitable for teleworking: specialists, whose work frequently has a high 'independent' content; managers, who need intervals of peace and quiet so that they can concentrate on specific tasks; 'nomads,' such as salesmen or area managers, who often have a roving commission; and clerical staff who may perform data-entry work or telesales from home. In the UK, interest is being shown in a network of 'telecottages' - or work centres in country areas in Devon and the Scottish Highlands where local people call in for faxes, electronic mail and other data. SINCE an underlying feature of teleworking is the use of telecommunications, it is hardly surprising that both Mercury and BT are actively promoting it. Last October, when Mercury produced its Teleworker Portfolio, it published research carried out by Gallup that showed that it is a popular and highly effective option for both the individual and for the employer. They found that of companies operating a teleworking scheme, 97 per cent consider the practice to be effective, giving increased efficiency, (42 per cent); increased productivity, (40 per cent); and cost-savings, (38 per cent) as the most important reasons for teleworking. However, as well as these benefits that are easily quantified and transferred to the balance sheet, there are other issues which need to be addressed. To quote from a BT Research Laboratories report, An Overview of Teleworking: '. . . over the last decade there has been a movement of population from cities leading to an increasing population in urban and rural areas. For many families, their chosen environment would be a country village. Teleworking will help this aspiration to be fulfilled.' Teleworking will be one way of combatting the projected shortages of skilled staff, as it will enable companies to retain staff who would otherwise leave. Since last October, Chris Ridgewell, Mercury's product manager for teleworking, has conducted more than 70 teleworking workshops for groups of up to 200 people. These meetings have often been followed by presentations to companies which have then have set up working parties of staff, executives and trade unions, as they consider moving towards setting up teleworking schemes. Despite the benefits to both employer and employee, care is needed in the introduction of teleworking, if problems are to be avoided. As well as the fear of apparent 'loss of status' by the teleworker as compared to on-site staff, there are other factors such as the risk of social isolation and loneliness; also, the maintenance of company confidentiality, and the provision and insurance of teleworking equipment. Britain is arguably far in advance of the rest of Europe in all aspects of teleworking. Thus, the European Community has shown interest in the proposed code of practice for teleworking by the UK's National Teleworking Advisory Council. It has, as its overriding aim, the encouragement of growth in the teleworking sector; in particular, by responding to the commercial requirements of large companies. Such businesses need appropriate terms of reference to cope with this change in working environments if teleworking is to grow to its full potential in the UK and elsewhere.

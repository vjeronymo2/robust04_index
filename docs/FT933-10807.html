			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Letter: Lesser and greater evils of Israeli bombardment of southern Lebanon Sir, Your editorial, 'Lesson for Israel', is entirely correct. Israel's current military activities serve to heighten the radicalisation of the populations it so mistreats. The emptying of villages, the sacrifice of large numbers of innocent lives and the creation of yet more hundreds of thousands of refugees - at which Israel leads the world by far - will not enable it to achieve its professed aim of destroying Hizbollah, though it will no doubt end in the occupation of a further slice of Lebanon. In the light of previous practice, it must be the presumption that no US-led coalition is going to treat Israel as it did Iraq, imposing sanctions and, if necessary, driving it from territory taken by force. Could it not, however, find it in its conscience to give at least a token indication of its unspoken disapproval of indiscriminate retaliation by, for example, suspending the cultural relations which link countries claiming to be civilised?

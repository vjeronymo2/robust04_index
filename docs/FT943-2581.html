			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Extension urged for Tessa status Different forms of savings - whether in equities or deposits - should receive similar tax treatment, perhaps through the development of a 'personal investment plan', the Building Societies Association argues today. In a paper to the Treasury as part of the government's review of savings, the association calls for the tax-free status of Tessas - tax-exempt special savings accounts - to be extended beyond the five-year period originally intended when they were introduced in the 1990 Budget. It warns that failure to take such action could create de-stabilising flows of personal savings out of building society and bank accounts in January 1996 when the first Tessas mature, as investors seek more tax-efficient places for their money. The Treasury review comes against a background of intense competition for retail savings. Mr Adrian Coles, BSA director-general, said that the tax system should be consistent and 'should not mask the differences between deposits and equity-based products'. The paper highlights the progressive relaxation of the rules for tax-exempt Personal Equity Plans since they were introduced in 1986, particularly in the increasing freedom to use unit trusts, and contrasts this with the position for Tessas. An individual can invest up to Pounds 9,000 a year in Peps, by putting Pounds 6,000 into a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep. The most that can be held in a Tessa is Pounds 9,000 over five years. To make the tax system fairer in this area, the BSA suggests a personal investment plan in which an individual would be entitled to free capital gain and income on a sum of up to, say, Pounds 6,000 a year, whatever the investment. The Association of British Insurers has also used the savings review to attack the favourable tax treatment of Peps.</p>

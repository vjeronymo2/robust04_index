			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd seeks EC blueprint THE GOVERNMENT has set up a high-level committee to draw up a British blueprint for reforms to European Community institutions, aimed at consolidating and entrenching the powers and autonomy of member states. The committee, combining Foreign Office and Cabinet Office personnel, has been set up by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, in anticipation of the 1996 inter-governmental conference on the EC's constitutional arrangements. It reflects Mr Hurd's growing conviction that the controversy over the Maastricht treaty is in part the consequence of 'reactive' as opposed to 'active' diplomacy. Mr Hurd concluded that by promoting a British vision of 'a more flexible and decentralised Community', the Conservative party would be able to reunite after the internal strife provoked by the treaty. A senior official said yesterday there was widespread acknowledgement that Britain had failed to articulate its vision of the Community early enough in the policymaking process, fuelling the impression, he said, that 'we are constantly being shifted by foreigners'. Labour is to challenge the government to publish details of its regional spending plans, in an effort to highlight the extent to which EC aid to high-unemployment areas may be lost because of a failure by Whitehall to provide matching funds.</p>

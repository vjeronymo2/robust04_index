			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Repsol climbs to Pta70.1bn REPSOL, Spain's state-controlled energy group, lifted its post-tax profits last year by 4 per cent to Pta70.1bn (Dollars 680m) after setting aside Pta12.6bn for items such as plant closures, writes Tom Burns. Repsol said the results were good in the light of its decision to adopt prudent accounting criteria in response to an uncertain international oil market, the difficulties of the chemical industry and the development of a liberalised energy market in Spain. Operating income rose 16 per cent to Pta129bn, despite a fall in earnings from the group's chemical interests.</p>

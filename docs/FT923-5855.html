			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Slough Estates The City's deep disillusion with property companies and growing fears of a prolonged recession in the UK are amply reflected in the share price of Slough Estates. Some would even say that at 95p one or two of the more apocalyptic visions of the UK economy are being discounted by investors. Indeed, only a few weeks ago the market would have regarded Slough as a screaming buy on a prospective yield of 11.4 per cent and an admittedly highly unscientific estimate for net assets of 270p per share. With hindsight it is easy to say that Slough should have stuck to industrial property, while recent signals over the dividend have been confusing. The previous payout was never going to be sustainable - and excuses about deteriorating conditions in the last few weeks don't wash  - but now that the deed has been done the company deserves the benefit of the doubt. Adding to earnings that element of the capitalised interest tied to a pre-let development - and taking account of trading property rents not credited to the profit and loss account - this year's total dividend should just about be covered by recurring income. The 50 per cent fall in Slough's shares over the last six months owes much to loss of credibility as well as dawning realisation in the market that the famed industrial portfolio is less defensive than was earlier assumed. Bottom fishers, though, will surely be tempted to have another go.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sonia Silva] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- President Itamar Franco  today signed a law establishing prison terms of from two to five  years to those found guilty of manufacturing, marketing,  distributing, or disseminating symbols, emblems, ornaments,  badges, or advertisement using swastikas with a view toward  fomenting Nazism. The new law, which is designed to stop acts  of violence perpetrated by neo-Nazi groups in Brazil, will  become part of Law 7716, which defines the crimes of racism and  discrimination.    Deputy Alberto Goldman (Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party-Sao Paulo State), who proposed the bill, estimates that  there are at least 13 neo-Nazi groups in Brazil. He cited the  "White Power" and the "ABC Skinheads" in Sao Paulo. In May,  four men armed with knives and handguns tattooed swastikas on a  14-year-old girl who responds to the initials N.M.P.L. in  Taubate, Sao Paulo State. The men had swastikas tattooed on  their faces. The law may be used to bring aggravating  circumstances in assault and battery cases.    Goldman said: "By displaying swastika symbols, these groups  are clearly revealing a menacing attitude, using force and  brutality to discriminate against and affect certain social  groups such as blacks, Jews, residents of northeastern Brazil,  and homosexuals." He does not believe the new law is violating  freedom of expression. He added: "Freedom of expression  promotes ideological debate and democratic discussions, while  swastikas are used to foment racism and intolerance."</p>

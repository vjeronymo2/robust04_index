			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 18 (AFP) -- China said Wednesday the  country's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng was still  under investigation, denying reports that a formal decision had  been reached to bring him to trial. A Public Security Ministry  spokesman made it clear that investigations into alleged "fresh  crimes" committed by Wei had yet to be concluded. "Wei  Jingsheng violated Chinese law while he was released on parole  and his political rights were withdrawn, and the police are in  the process of investigating his case," the spokesman said.  Foreign press reports quoting the ministry as saying Wei's case  had been handed over to the Chinese courts were "completely  false," he said.    Wei, 44, was picked up by police April 1 as he tried to  return to Beijing from a forced exile in nearby Tianjin. The  authorities then announced that he was being investigated for  unspecified new crimes. Wei was released on parole in September  last year, having served all but six months of a 15-year  sentence for counter-revolutionary activities. The Chinese  authorities were incensed when Wei met here in February with  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Humanitarian Affairs John  Shattuck and called on Washington to take a hard line with  Beijing over human rights.</p>

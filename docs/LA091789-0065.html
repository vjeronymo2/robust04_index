			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AT 87, IRASCIBLE MARYLAND LAWYER MAKES A GOOD CASE AS PUBLIC DEFENDER  </P> <P> When people talk about Maryland's public defender, the same adjectives keep  cropping up: Irascible. Irreverent. Independent. Acerbic.  </P> <P> Eighty-seven-year-old Alan H. Murrell is, say friends and foes alike, a unique  individualist.  </P> <P> "He is the antithesis, in a sense, of a bureaucrat," said Robert C. Murphy,  chief judge of Maryland's highest court, the Court of Appeals. He calls Murrell  irreverent and independent, and said: "No matter how important you are, Alan  doesn't take that into account."  </P> <P> "He insults these people with a fair degree of panache and disdain. He treats  them like blathering idiots," said defense lawyer T. Joseph Touhey Jr., who  worked with Murrell in the early years of the public defender's office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recalls Incident  </P> <P> Touhey recalls the time a lawyer, hearing someone say something behind him,  complained that Murrell had called him a name. "Alan says to the judge, 'Your  honor, I said no such thing. He may have been reading my mind, however.' "  </P> <P> Murrell, who is responsible for providing legal services for more than 100,000  people each year, routinely overspends his budget. When lawmakers chide him, he  says he will spend whatever he has to and that is all there is to it.  </P> <P> When they suggest he retire, his response is: "I'm the last person in the world  who would resign under that kind of pressure."  </P> <P> As chief of a system that will spend $27 million this year to defend clients  even he calls "the bottom of the barrel of humanity," Murrell knows his is not  a popular job. "I understand how the public feels," he said. "My house has been  broken into three times."  </P> <P> But as public defender since the office was created in 1971, he believes he  owes allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees that the more than  100,000 men and women whose cases flow through his offices each year have a  right to the best possible defense when they walk into a courtroom.  </P> <P> "We don't get pleasure out of representing these people," he said, adding that  without his agency, there would be chaos in the courts. "The private bar can't  begin to handle . . . the indigent accused."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not 'Fanatical'  </P> <P> While Murrell speaks eloquently of rights, Touhey said he is not "some sort of  fanatical constitutional spouting type. That's just not Alan. He'll do the job  because that's what he was retained to do."  </P> <P> Murrell's major problem with the Legislature involves his budget. He says he  spends more than he gets because he does not get enough. Critics, such as state  Sens. Laurence Levitan and Julian Lapides, say he is a poor manager of money.  </P> <P> It was the dispute over money that prompted calls for his retirement, which  Murrell easily dismisses. "I get cursed and kicked around and batted from  pillar to post. I can't say it has much impact on me.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to step down on the commands of Levitan and poor old Jack  Lapides. Either one of those two bums couldn't find his way into a courtroom  with a Seeing Eye dog."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'He's a Character'  </P> <P> Murphy believes such comments hurt Murrell, but Lapides and Levitan say that is  not true. "I think his irascibility is marvelous," Lapides said. "We all know  he's a character." Told of Murrell's comment about the Seeing Eye dog, he  replied: "I think that's wonderful."  </P> <P> Murphy, who rates Murrell as one of the best criminal lawyers in the country  with "a magnificent courtroom presence," remembers when Murrell,  cross-examining a police officer, suggested that the crime lab employee  "couldn't find an olive in a martini glass."  </P> <P> Even though Murrell will turn 88 two days after Christmas, no one suggests that  he retire because of his age. "When you're 87, you tend to lose a step. Alan  has done that, and I think he'd agree," Murphy said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he said, Murrell "is still a winner."  </P> <P> Murrell says he will not think about retiring until the office is on a sound  financial footing. Only in the last two years, under Gov. William Donald  Schaefer, has he gotten funds to handle his caseload; now he has to pay off  past deficits.  </P></p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Bibby bids Pounds 75m for Caterpillar in Spain J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural conglomerate which is 79 per cent owned by the South African Barlow Rand group, yesterday launched a hostile Pounds 75m bid for Finanzauto, Spain's only authorised Caterpillar dealer. Mr Alan Gresty, Bibby's finance director, said the acquisition would strengthen the UK group's presence in Spain and Portugal, the European countries with the most growth potential. Mr Gresty said he was confident the deal would be acceptable to Finanzauto's shareholders: 'We are offering a very good price . . . and good multiple of 18.7 times 1991 earnings.' The Finanzauto board on Monday night rejected the offer of Pta1,300 per share, a premium of 20.9 per cent over the Spanish company's closing price last Wednesday. Trading in Finanzauto was suspended on the Spanish stock market at Pta1,075 a share on Thursday as rumours of a bid inflated the price. The board says the offer does not conform to the conditions negotiated by the board with Barlow Rand. If the offer goes unconditional with more than 51 per cent of acceptances, Bibby will also acquire Finanzauto's 59 per cent stake in Portugal's only authorised Caterpillar dealer Stet. The acquisition will be funded through bank borrowings which, in addition to Finanzauto's Pounds 117m debt, would force gearing to more than 100 per cent. Mr Gresty said Bibby aimed to have gearing back below 100 per cent by the September year-end. The group said it would reduce debt by selling Finanzauto's peripheral businesses and perhaps a rights issue. Barlow Rand has indicated it would be prepared to take up its rights. Finanzauto reported profits before tax and minority interests of Pta1.4bn (Pounds 7.6m) on sales of Pta53.2bn for the year to December 31. Bibby announced the offer in conjunction with interim results which showed a 2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 17m for the 26 weeks to March 28. A reduction in interest charges from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2m, because of the Pounds 14.6m rights issue last May, and lower base rates in the UK, was the main reason for the profits rise. Earnings per share fell from from 9.68p to 9.23p. The dividend was maintained at 2.85p.</p>

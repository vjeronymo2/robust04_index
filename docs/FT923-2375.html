			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Breaking out of D-Mark's orbit 'Countries .. which have, not without success, mounted domestic battles against inflation would, by devaluing, place at risk the success of these policies. They have good reason to avoid this solution. But, according to circumstances, that is not always possible.' - Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, in speech in Kiel, September 14, 1992 THIS MONTH'S foreign exchange turmoil illustrates the awesome speed with which monetary upheaval can spread through the continent. The Bundesbank has become increasingly suspicious of the way that the European Monetary System (EMS), set up in 1979, has during the last 5 3/4 years started to develop into a fixed exchange rate system. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of Germany's independent central bank, outlined in Kiel how countries which had registered higher inflation than Germany since the last full-scale realignment in January 1987 would sooner or later have to devalue. Aided by his own well-publicised hints the next day of a sterling devaluation, Mr Schlesinger's prediction came true - possibly, more quickly than the 68-year-old Bundesbank chief could imagine. During the last five years, most western European countries, either directly through the EMS's Exchange Rate Mechanism, or indirectly through unilateral pegging arrangements, have anchored themselves to the D-Mark. A primary motivation has been to prepare for the EC's goal of economic and monetary union (Emu) - a goal which the Bundesbank has long regarded with ill-disguised antipathy. Within the space of just over a week, the Bundesbank has helped orchestrate two important coups. What had previously appeared a relatively well ordered system of European exchange rates has suddenly crumbled. Into the EMS, the Bundesbank has injected a large amount of greater flexibility. Into the debate about Emu, it has brought a sizeable dose of realism about the feasibility of the timetable for moving to a single currency by the end of the century. Successive waves of financial market speculation have washed through the currency defences of four countries, and severely tested several others. The EMS, which Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, two years ago called 'a modern-day gold standard with the D-Mark as the anchor', is rapidly losing the 'softer', more inflation-prone currencies at its periphery. Finland has severed its unilateral tie to the European currency unit. Italy has devalued within the EMS by 7 per cent, and is floating - it says - until Tuesday. Spain has devalued by 5 per cent. And Britain has decided to float sterling until 'market conditions' permit re-entry to the system. The Swedish krona has maintained its unilateral link to the Ecu only by dint of massive foreign exchange intervention and overnight interest rates of 500 per cent. Taking into account the intervention necessary to bolster Nordic currencies outside the ERM, as well as the support for weak currencies within the system, total European exchange rate intervention is estimated at DM60bn to DM70bn over the last few weeks. In an exchange rate system unprotected by any form of controls on capital movements, central banks' support ammunition has been rapidly spent. Intervention has had no impact on the tendency for the EMS to split between the 'hard core' grouped around the D-Mark - principally, the Benelux countries, Denmark and France - and the 'wider orbit' currencies outside. Yesterday, as the Danish krone and Irish punt fell to their lowest permitted levels against the D-Mark, and the French franc also came under pressure, the EMS's centrifugal forces again came to the fore. Even if France votes Yes to Maastricht at Sunday's referendum - an outcome which could obviate the need for a further formal realignment - the ERM as it has existed since 1987 now looks unlikely to reappear. 'The EMS seems to be going back to what it was originally: a zone of exchange rate stability with frequent exchange rate changes by mutual consent,' says Mr Brendan Brown, economist at Mitsubishi Finance in London. 'The Bundesbank wants to have the best of both worlds - it wants the system to be flexible enough to allow it to run its own monetary policy, but not so flexible as to lead to competitive devaluations which would be harmful for German exporters.' In the leaner and tougher ERM, the members most likely to keep their places are those which, virtually without condition, place control over their monetary affairs in the Bundesbank's hands. For all practical purposes, these 'hard core' countries are now the only ones that will proceed towards Emu. France, which has weathered a much less severe economic downturn than Britain in its quest for low inflation, has lately shown great restraint in pressing its desire for interest rate cuts. As a reward, France's credibility has risen on the foreign exchanges. This is a vital condition for French success in achieving its long-term goal of Emu - a step which would involve a collective European central bank taking the Bundesbank's position as Europe's monetary arbiter. Before it can reach this destination France must, however, surmount some important hurdles. Through its stern efforts to bring down German inflation during the past two years, the Bundesbank has effectively exported deflation to other ERM members. This process is likely to continue - even though the Bundesbank will almost certainly maintain gentle downward pressure on interest rates in the coming months. As a result of the financial pressures in Germany caused by German unification, members of the ERM will continue to pay a price for the privilege of allowing the Bundesbank to decide their monetary policies. At the same time, the 'outer orbit' countries which have devalued may experience - at least in the short term - a pick-up in their economies. If this happens, electorates in the 'hard core' may look out with some envy to the edges of the D-Mark solar system - and wonder whether there may not be, after all, some advantages in seeking to break free from the D-Mark's gravitational pull.</p>

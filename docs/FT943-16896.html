			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Spanish bank recruits chief executive from rival Banco Central Hispano, the Spanish bank suffering from weak profits, has hired Mr Angel Corcostegui, a former top executive at rival Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), as its chief executive. Mr Corcostegui was a BBV board member and the managing director of its capital markets and international banking division. His move represents an unprecedented upheaval in the top echelons of Spanish banking. Banco Central said the move had the consent of BBV and was in a 'spirit of collaboration' between the two institutions. Earlier this year chairman Mr Jose Maria Amusategui pruned the Banco Central board from 39 to 28 members and disclosed that he was seeking a new chief executive. The decision to bring in an outsider has avoided a choice between senior executives of Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano, the two institutions which merged in 1991 to create Banco Central Hispano. Analysts in Madrid said that Mr Corcostegui had recently been under pressure at BBV because the large government debt positions built up this year could have a potentially negative implication for the bank's results. As Banco Central chief executive, Mr Corcostegui faces the challenge of increasing earnings from the bank's extensive retail network and of overseeing a strategy to pare its industrial portfolio. First-quarter results were disappointing, with an 11.8 per cent fall in attributable net profit. Banco Central expects to post flat profits this year. In recent months Banco Central's image has been severely dented by international rating agencies.</p>

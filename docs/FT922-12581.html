			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Turkish fears grow on foreign business influx THE GROWING openness of Turkey's economy to foreign companies has come in for sharp criticism from domestic businessmen worried about increased competition. The opening tomorrow of a new Dollars 70m cement plant by Societe Ciments Francais (SCF) highlights how opposition to greater foreign involvement has shifted from politicians to the business community. It was politicians who resisted French entry into the cement market. In 1990, Mr Suleyman Demirel, now Turkey's prime minister, filed a suit to have SCF's purchase of five state cement companies declared illegal on the grounds the assets had not been offered to local investors. But he will open the SCF plant tomorrow. Some industrialists are urging the government to freeze privatisation plans in the face of growing foreign interest. 'Turkish business is not yet strong enough to purchase these state companies,' says Mr Can Kirac, former chairman of Koc Holding, Turkey's largest trading company. Mr Demirel is under pressure to give a clear signal on the controversy about foreign ownership, especially as it is planning to sell a further 11 cement companies in a deal expected to raise TL 2,500bn (Pounds 227m). French companies now account for a quarter of Turkish cement production of around 24m tonnes a year which is growing at an annual rate of some 10 per cent. Lafarge Coppee, the world's second largest cement company, and Societe Vicat have also entered the market. The arrival of the French has sparked fierce competition. Last month, two Turkish-owned factories in the Aegean region launched an attempt to try to break into the Istanbul cement market, shipping cement at prices 40 per cent below market levels. The basic investment strategy of most foreign groups is to expand market share in what is seen as a key regional base for the Middle East and the southern republics of the former Soviet Union. But there has been local concern that in so doing, the foreign companies are creating new cartels. 'While trying to destroy one monopoly, the government is creating another one,' says Mr Yazar Zeytinoglu, chairman of a large conglomerate. Industries other than cement have also come under increased scrutiny. In the bottled gas sector, for example, foreign groups, including Mobil of the US, already control 34 per cent of the market. The British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, will visit Turkey and probably Greece next week, Reuter reports from London. Diplomats said Britain and the US viewed Turkey as an increasingly important country in the region. Mr Hurd will discuss the situation in Iraq, Turkey's possible membership of the European Community, the Cyprus issue and Turkey's defence role in Europe.</p>

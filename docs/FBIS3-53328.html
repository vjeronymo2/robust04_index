In an interview with the morning daily HAMSHAHRI published  Wednesday, the minister said that Iran and other non-member  countries would have to join GATT sooner or later. "However, we  have to strengthen the infrastructure and structure of our  economy in such a way to become able to enjoy the facilities  which are to be provided by the agreement," Kalantari stressed.    He believed that Iran can obtain a favorable export market  for its several agricultural products such as vegetables and  green house products. After joining the GATT, the minister  added, Iran has to introduce certain changes in its present  agricultural patterns in the coming years. He noted that in  future Iran should produce strategic products such as wheat,  rice and sugar as much as are needed for domestic use only.    Should Iran be able to benefit from the facilities provided  by GATT, it would get a good chance for exporting its  agricultural products, he maintained.    Moreover, Kalantari added, with implementation of the  agreement, the world prices for Iranian agricultural products  would increase.    Iran should become self-sufficient in wheat production as  soon as possible, because, he said, the world prices for this  strategic product are on the rise.</p>

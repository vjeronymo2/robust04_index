			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Former President Reagan has narrated a half-hour documentary called "The Voice  of Hope" about Project Hope's programs around the world. The film, shot on  location in China, Swaziland, Brazil and Grenada, tells about the nonprofit  organization's dedication to improving the health of the world's poor. The film  will be released in late October to cable, network affiliates and civic  organizations around the United States. Reagan showed he was an old pro at  narration -- it took him only one read-through. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

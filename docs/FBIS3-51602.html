			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari met this evening  at Los Pinos, the presidential palace, with representatives of  118 peasant and Indian organizations from Chiapas. Here is what  President Salinas said:    [Begin Salinas recording] We need peace in the highlands and  in the jungles so that justice can progress. Particularly now  that we have made a commitment, may no one pretend to return to  situations of the past. Rather, what we are seeking, which in  effect has been set out here, is willingness on the part of the  authorities to serve through their organizations, to respect  human rights so that progress can be made in the democratic  system and justice can be fostered. This is the commitment that  has been made. [end recording]    Chiapas peasants and Indians presented some of the region's  problems to President Salinas and gave him their opinions on the  Chiapas conflict. They said that the armed conflict is a sign  of the poverty and social backwardness in which the people of  Chiapas live.    [Begin recording] [Peasant Antonio Hernandez] Peace will  always be a means to achieve high values in a new human  relationship that will produce liberty, democracy, and social  justice. We believe we have made a great deal of progress in  the last few days since you organized the consulting commission.  The social organizations are currently convinced that the road  to solving the people's problems is through dialogue and  consensus.    [Felix Corozo, Indian community leader] We believe that  peace  for the Chiapas peasants should begin in the homes of the  Chiapas community. We need to have decent living conditions,  enough food, health services, and assurances that our children  will attend school and get a good education for the future. We  want peace that leads to infrastructure projects. We want peace  that brings justice for all and on equal terms. We want peace  that represents tranquility on the roads to our fields. We want  peace to go to our coffee fields, peace to go to our bean and  corn fields.    [Lazarno Hernandez, agricultural union leader] We know that  those who made those decisions were following orders and they  believed there was no other road to take. They believed that  with force they would gain their freedom; they believed their  movement was nationalistic. We combated those ideas. We told  them there were many ways to take up the struggle within the law  and within democracy. We told the that weapons do not free us  from poverty nor from ignorance. We told them that the Mexican  people did not want war, but rather peace. [end recording]    They all pointed out to President Salinas that the way to  solve the people's problems is through dialogue and consensus.  Therefore, a commitment has been made to hold a meeting next  weekend during which pacification of the area will be fostered.  Carlos Rojas, secretary of social development, and Beatriz  Paredes Rangel, president of the National Commission for the  Overall Development of and Social Justice for Indian Peoples,  accompanied President Salinas during the meeting. Likewise,  Enrique Del Val, under secretary of social development;  Guillermo Espinosa, director of the National Indian Institute;  and Arturo Warman, agrarian ombudsman, were present at this  meeting at Los Pinos.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> KNBC ADMITS FACE-CREAM REPORT 'MISTAKE'  </P> <P> KNBC Channel 4 has acknowledged that a news report it broadcast about a  cosmetic cream whose manufacturer says it can remove facial wrinkles failed to  note that one of the users seen offering positive comments about the product  was the president of the company that makes it.  </P> <P> After inquiries from The Times, KNBC News Director Nancy Valenta said that "we  made a mistake" in the July 10 report by medical reporter Dr. Bruce Hensel.  </P> <P> Management had not previously known of the error, she said.  </P> <P> Hensel appeared on the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts Friday with a  "clarification," advising viewers that a man who had extolled the benefits of  the product in an interview, Jim Wood, "is the president of ImmuDyne,  manufacturer of the wrinkle cream NAYAD -- a point I failed to mention."  </P> <P> In an effort to clear up what he called "possible misunderstanding about the  use of NAYAD," Hensel also said on the air Friday that state health officials  are concerned that if NAYAD is used in conjunction with Retin-A, a medically  approved wrinkle cream, "it could produce a toxic effect."  </P> <P> Hensel, an associate professor of medicine at UCLA, had said flatly in his  original report that the two products could be used together, even though he  noted then -- and reiterated Friday -- that there have been no controlled  studies done on the safety or effectiveness of NAYAD.  </P></p>

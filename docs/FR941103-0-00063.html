			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cost limits for the minimum expenditure waivers must be in accordance with the CAA and federal I/M rule. Expenditures for repairs of at least $450, adjusted annually for the consumer price index (CPI), must be spent in order to qualify for a waiver in the enhanced I/M program. Maine has demonstrated that it can meet the enhanced I/M performance standard testing only 1981 and newer vehicles. In addition, Maine is requiring I/M on vehicles as old as 1968 model year. These vehicles will not be included as part of the ``enhanced I/M'' program, despite being subject to the same type of exhaust emission testing because the state does not require such vehicles to meet the $450 waiver minimum. Nevertheless, the testing of these additional vehicles will achieve additional emission reductions which will be used, in part, as a means of achieving additional emission reductions required for Reasonable Further Progress, and anticipated by Maine to be necessary for attainment. Accordingly, these older vehicles will be subject to a lower waiver expenditure of $125, adjusted for CPI, prior to receiving a waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Maine program includes a waiver rate of 3% of initially failed vehicles, Model Year 1981 and newer. This waiver rate is used in the modeling demonstration. The DEP has committed in the July 21, 1994 submittal, that if the waiver rate is higher than estimated as determined by its program reports, the State will take corrective action to address the deficiency. Furthermore, the SIP describes the three types of waivers the State will allow including: a minimum expenditure, a time extension, and a one-time hardship waiver provisions. These issues are dealt with in a manner consistent with the federal I/M rule. The proper criteria, procedures, quality assurance and administration regarding the issuance of waivers, consistent with EPA's I/M rule, will be ensured by the DEP and its contractors and are detailed in the SIP narrative, submitted on July 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One portion of the revised Maine rule represents a deviation from the requirements of EPA's final rule (57 FR 52950). This provision allows for owner-performed repairs for select emission control devices (specifically, the catalytic converter, exhaust pipes and hardware, fuel filler cap, PCV valve, thermostatic air cleaner, and air pump) for 1980 and newer vehicles to count toward the minimum waiver expenditure set forth in section 51.360 of the federal I/M rule. However, as mentioned above, section 51.360 also requires that the State commit to maintaining a maximum level of waivers in this program. The State has committed to a 3 percent waiver limit, and to taking necessary steps to ensure that this rate is not exceeded. It is the level of waivers that greatly affects the level of emission reductions achieved from the program. Maine's deviation in the area of owner-performed repairs is very narrow since the list of emission control devices for which costs can count toward the waiver is expressly limited. Based on these considerations and the State's commitment to ensuring an allowable maximum waiver rate, EPA believes that a specified and clearly limited deviation from the federal I/M rule in the area of owner-performed repairs will not significantly affect the level of reductions achieved from the I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State committed in its May 26, 1994 letter, reiterated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the July 21, 1994 submittal, that Maine would issue waivers only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the requirements of EPA's waiver requirements were met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its May 26, 1994 letter, the State committed to amend the SIP to not allow owner repair costs to count toward the $450 waiver amount for 1980 and later model year vehicles. The July 21, 1994 submittal stated that Maine would issue waivers ``only when the requirements of 40 CFR 51.360 are met.'' EPA construes this as a commitment to adopt the necessary corrective measures, which in turn provides an additional basis for the conditional approval proposed in the July 8, 1994 NPR. EPA has commented previously on the waiver provisions, including the OPR issue and the NPR proposed a conditional approval so that public notice on these issues was sufficient. For these reasons, EPA is conditionally approving this SIP revision. Accordingly, this notice requires the DEP to revise its regulation by June 1, 1995, to hold a public hearing on necessary regulatory changes, and to submit to EPA a revised SIP submittal removing the OPR waiver allowance for 1980 and newer cars by September 1, 1995. Of course, the State's failure to meet any of these dates will result in EPA disapproval of this action, unless the EPA Regional Administrator approves a later date in writing no later than the date of the applicable milestone. The September 1, 1995 date for final submittal will not be revised under any circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

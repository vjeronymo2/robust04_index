			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 Apr -- A form of words releasing Aleksey  Kazannik from the post of Russian procurator general has failed  to gain a majority of votes. The chairman of the teller's  commission reported that 68 deputies in the Federation Council  voted in favor of releasing him, while 74 voted against.    According to the standing orders adopted today by the  Federation Council, the procurator general is deemed to be  released from his duties if a majority of the total number of  deputies in the Federation Council votes in favor of that. The  total number of deputies in the chamber is 174. Voting slips  were taken by 145 people today. Therefore, over half of the  total number of deputies did not vote in favor of releasing  Kazannikov, the members of the teller's commission concluded.  However, the chamber was unable today to formulate a legally  satisfactory decision on the issue. It was decided to do that  tomorrow. The sitting ended at that point.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  vowed Monday night that Japan will make every effort within the  limits of its Constitution to cooperate in the event the U.N.  Security Council [UNSC] imposes sanctions on North Korea over  its alleged nuclear arms development program, a senior Foreign  Ministry official said.    Hata made the remarks at an emergency meeting convened  following weekend consultations of Japan, the United States and  South Korea in Washington to discuss the North Korean nuclear  issue, the official said.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Chief Cabinet Minister  Hiroshi Kumagai, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito and Shunji  Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy  Bureau who attended the Washington get-together -- were present  at the meeting Monday. Hata told the meeting that if the  Security Council decides to take measures, including sanctions,  to put pressure on North Korea to change its position, Japan  will support the move and cooperate as much as possible within  the framework of the Constitution, the official said. Hata also  instructed the government to study measures the country would  take in case the Security Council adopts the resolution.    Hata strongly urged North Korea to fully cooperate with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to eliminate  international suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons.  He said Japan will make every diplomatic effort to solve the  problem peacefully, through international coordination, the  official said. The diplomatic efforts include close  consultations with South Korea, China and other relative  countries, the official said.    In a related development earlier in the day, government  officials indicated Kakizawa may visit Seoul as early as this  weekend to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart Han  Song-chu. The date of the foreign ministerial meeting, however,  has not yet been decided due to the Diet schedule. Kakizawa may  also visit China, according to government sources.    Yanai, U.S. Assistant secretary of State Robert Gallucci and  Kim Sam-hun, South Korea's special envoy on the nuclear issue,  agreed over the weekend to adopt a united front on the North  Korean nuclear issue. In a joint statement issued after the  talks, the three nations called on the United Nations to take  prompt action against Pyongyang, including the consideration of  sanctions.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): Tracker fund with an insurance safety-net - L&amp;G's plan is more flexible than many guaranteed investments, though investors would have to be pessimistic to pay the steep charges / What's new? GUARANTEES OF growth and promises of high income have remained favourite features with managers launching new investments during the summer. With Legal &amp; General's five-year Guaranteed Stockmarket Investment Plan, 4 per cent of the investor's money goes towards an insurance policy to cover investment performance. The balance of 96 per cent goes into the L&amp;G Stockmarket Trust, a unit trust tracking the FT-SE 100 index, carrying an initial charge of 3 per cent and an annual charge of 2 per cent. The plan guarantees that investors will get back not less than 100 per cent of their initial investment at the end of five years. The insurance policy will make up any difference if the fund, including reinvested income, falls short. The minimum investment is Pounds 3,000. At the end of five years, L&amp;G pays back 1.5 per cent of the initial investment as a loyalty bonus. Investors would have to be very pessimistic about the five-year outlook to consider paying L&amp;G's steep charges for the guarantee of doing no more than break even, at worst. But the plan is more flexible than many guaranteed investments, as investors can pick their own starting date for the five-year term and there are no penalties for early withdrawal from the plan, apart from the loss of the loyalty bonus. YOUR MONEY BACK PLUS INTEREST EQUIVALENT TO FOOTSIE'S RISE ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester building society's second five-year stockmarket bond has no insurance component, despite the society's link with Scottish Amicable, as an appointed agent. Available until August 14 for investments between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 500,000, the bond guarantees a payback of the capital at the end of five years, plus interest equivalent to the full increase in the FT-SE-100 index over that time, or the return of 120 per cent of the initial investment - whichever is greater. Although past performance is not a reliable guide to the future, the Footsie index rose by 56 per cent in the five years to June 30, 1993. The bond has some severe restrictions, allowing no withdrawals at all during the first year, though the society says it would treat dire emergencies on merit and 'come to some arrangement'. Investors cashing in before the end of five years receive reduced guaranteed amounts. In the second year, the payback is the capital plus 70 per cent of any rise in the index over the time the money has been invested, with no fallback amount of interest. In the third year, investors cashing in get the greater of 105 per cent of their initial investment or their investment plus 70 per cent of the rise in the Footsie. In the fourth year, the guaranteed alternative goes up to 110 per cent of the initial investment, but investors withdrawing from the bond at that stage would still receive a maximum of 70 per cent of the rise in the Footsie on top of their original capital. QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS WITH AN EXPECTED 8 PER CENT YIELD LAZARD High Income Trust is a new investment trust aiming to provide a high gross dividend yield and a chance of capital growth by investing mainly in convertible securities . The offer for subscription at a price of Pounds 1 per share, which calls for a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000, closes on August 3, and the first day of dealing is scheduled for August 10. Nick Coombes, the investment manager, said the trust had been designed with the second most simple structure possible (the simplest being a trust consisting of ordinary shares only). It will draw 70 per cent of its money from ordinary shares issued to the public and 30 per cent from a capped bank loan. The trust will have a fixed life of six years, and has made a pledge that there will be no rights issues during that time. Mr Coombes, who has a long record in stockbroking and fund management, had joined Grahams Rintoul last September and was already engaged in advanced preparations for launching the High Income Trust, when the firm was taken over by Lazard in May. The launch was to have been a first foray into convertibles for GR, which ran trusts specialising in small companies and North American oil and gas, both poorly-performing sectors in the past few years. The Lazard High Income Trust is expected to yield 8 per cent gross and will pay dividends quarterly. But because the investment will be principally in convertibles, which are regarded as equity derivatives, investors will not be able to shelter the income from tax by holding the shares in a personal equity plan (Pep). ADVISER'S INCOME PEP WILL INVEST IN THREE UNIT TRUSTS COUNTRYWIDE Independent Advisers, one of the largest networks of financial advisers, has launched an income Pep, packaging its own choice of the unit trusts already on the market. Initially the Pep will be equally invested in three unit trusts: Newton Income, Perpetual High Income and Capital House Income &amp; Growth. The initial yield is approximately 4.5 per cent, but Peter Tamm, chief executive of Countrywide, said that in managing the Pep he would not be setting a target in terms of an income figure but would look at how unit trusts performed against their peer groups, aiming to pick trusts which would achieve results in the top two deciles of the performance tables. Charges on the Countrywide income Pep are an initial 3.5 per cent and an annual 1.75 per cent, with a fixed plan fee of Pounds 20. Mr Tann said that, as there would be no double charging, investors would be buying all three unit trusts more cheaply than if they went direct to the groups concerned. The Capital House and Newton funds both have a 6 per cent initial charge, while Perpetual's is 5.25 per cent. However, the Countrywide Pep's annual charge is half a percentage point above the 1.25 per cent charged by all three funds forming the original selection.</p>

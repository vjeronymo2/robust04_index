			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DAIRYMEN JOIN FARM BILL FIGHT  </P> <P> California dairy farmers are joining the Consumers Union of U.S. Inc. in  opposition to a 1990 Farm Bill provision that would raise the price of milk  products produced in the state.  </P> <P> The provision would allow dairy farmers in other states to increase the price  of milk products from California, which are kept down by lower production costs  in the state, according to the Consumers Union.  </P> <P> California farmers would be paid more. But they fear that higher prices will  reduce demand and make their milk products less competitive nationally, a  Consumers Union news release said.  </P></p>

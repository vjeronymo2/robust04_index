			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with B. I. Birshteyn, by I. Koretskiy; place and </F> date not given: "Boris Birshteyn: I Am an Absolutely Independent  Person"]    [Text] The name Boris Iosifovich Birshteyn is well  known on one-sixth of the land mass. He is praised and cursed,  presidents and journalists want to meet him, and everything from  cock and bull stories to the unmitigated truth are told about  the affairs of The Seabeco Group.    Seabeco is not being ignored in our republic either.  The firm is quite often spoken and written about mostly in a  poor light. Essentially that involves a rehash of Russian events  which have already set our teeth on edge. Having obtained an  exclusive interview with Birshteyn, we were interested not in  rumors and gossip swirling around this outstanding individual,  but most of all in the personality of the creator of Seabeco, so  to speak, in its undiluted form: his views of life, business,  and contemporary Moldova. That was what our conversation with B.  I. Birshteyn, who has visited our country more than once, was  about.    [Koretskiy] Welcome to Moldova Mister Birshteyn. These days  the republic is leading an intensive political  existence--elections and the sociological poll. Is your visit  associated with these events?    [Birshteyn] Absolutely not. This is a routine business trip  connected with the practical realization of one of our projects  involving investment in agriculture of Moldova. It is still too  early to mention it to the press, I will merely say that the  amount of investment involved is quite respectable even by  western standards.    I do not get involved in politics and it is not my habit to  exert influence or, God forbid, alter anything in the political  life of this country in which I am investing my capital. But if  you are interested in my own personal viewpoint concerning  recent events, then, naturally, for me as a businessman and for  my western colleagues it is more advantageous to deal with an  independent, sovereign state rather than with someone's province.    [Koretskiy] Boris Iosifovich, this is your first interview  with the republic press, therefore please acquaint our readers  with what is called The Seabeco Group. The Russian as well as  our own press, unfortunately, contains highly confusing and  contradictory depictions. This is evidenced by the telephone  calls and letters coming in to the editorial office.    [Birshteyn] H'm! I have not been asked that question for a  long time. It is considered that everything is known about  Seabeco.    Well, Seabeco is a group of private companies of different  profiles which I own. Our sphere of activity includes trade,  particularly trade in fertilizes and metals. It is a financial  business and includes industrial projects. We are also engaged  in the service sphere as evidenced by this hotel in Chisinau  where we are having our conversation.    [Editor] Boris Birshteyn was born in Lithuania in 1947 and  is  a graduate of Vilnius University. He reached the pinnacle of his  career in the USSR as director of a textile plant. In 1979 he  emigrated to Israel together with his wife, then moved to  Canada. A year later he founded his "The Seabeco Group." To form  that name he used the first names of his children--Semen and  Alona Birshteyn. At present the Birshteyn family resides in  Zurich, Switzerland.    [Koretskiy] What links do you have with Moldova?    [Birshteyn] A small human weakness which is called love for  this remarkable nation and its hard-working people. Coming here  many years ago I was charmed with Moldova and still feel that  way to this day. Because of which I am attempting to make and do  make my most serious investments in Moldova.    [Editor] Boris Birshteyn made the first major investment of  his capital in Moldova in 1990 deciding to remodel the old  Oktyabrskaya Hotel into a four-star western style hotel. That  was requested by the then leadership of the republic which  became mired in debt reconstructing its prestigious hotel. These  debts owed Vneshekonombank of the USSR subsequently transferred  to the government of sovereign Moldova and when the question  concerning their repayment became a pressing one, businessman  Birshteyn proposed an original move as a result of which dollars  from the repayment of the foreign currency credit debt in the  amount of over three million dollars went into the budget of the  republic. In that manner Seabeco is providing the government  with interest-free credit. Our Moldovan leu was printed in Paris  and modern communications, defense, and special equipment for  the Ministry of Internal Affairs were paid for specifically by  money from the firm. The Orgeyev Cannery is undergoing  reconstruction and a zone of farms with a complete service  complex is being created in Faleshtskiy Rayon on the basis of  Seabeco designs and at its expense. The firm provides assistance  through sponsorship of projects in the sphere of public health  and culture as well as aid for those with low incomes and for  victims of combat operations. Last year some 50,000 leus, over  2,000 dollars, and more than 4,000 FRG marks were allocated for  that purpose.    [Koretskiy] Mister Birshteyn, without revealing any trade  secrets pertaining to your future projects, let us talk about  where your investments will be going.    [Birshteyn] I am proceeding from the fact that Moldova is  basically an agrarian republic and, naturally, I intend  investing capital in agriculture and, in particular, in the  processing industry. Then, taking into account the geographical  position of Moldova, its climate, and the existence of a  diaspora both in the far and the near abroad, I believe that it  is necessary to develop a tourism industry.    [Koretskiy] Allow me to disagree with your viewpoint  concerning the agricultural profile of Moldova and remind you of  the first-class potential of the republic in the machine  building and electronic industry. Unfortunately these capacities  are now idle and the industry is in a decline. On the basis of  your experience could you suggest a way out of this dead-end  situation?    [Birshteyn] I am not an electronics expert but I am quite  familiar with the experience of Far Eastern countries which  created such a powerful market in that branch. Therefore today  it is extremely difficult to meet the demands of modern  electronics, that is, to win the market. But not hopeless. How?  Through the production of unique units and blocs calling for the  efforts of highly skilled personnel. In the East as well as in  the West everything is based on high-precision automatic  equipment, flow lines. Moldova, however, would be able to  interest producers with its highly skilled workers whose labor  is relatively cheap. Here it is necessary to look for partners.  I brought up that question with Muravskiy's government.    [Koretskiy] Did you bring it up as a member of the Higher  Economic Council of the President of the Republic of Moldova?    [Birshteyn] Yes. Unfortunately, however, nothing happened.    [Koretskiy] Tell me, Mr. Birshteyn, as chairman of the  Higher  Economic Council do you see a way out of the crisis in which  Moldova has found itself?    [Birshteyn] I would like you to take into account that this  crisis has engulfed all countries of the so-called socialist  camp and it is quite natural. Therefore there is no need to  dramatize the situation. I personally believe that Moldova will  get on its feet before other CIS countries providing there is a  stable political situation, because of its geopolitical  position, economic base, and the industriousness of the people.  These are the powerful internal reserves which have not been  mobilized until now. But help and investments are needed in any  undertaking. That is the first factor which must come into play.    Several days ago I helped to organize a meeting of a large  group of western businessmen with the president of Moldova. The  discussion concerned investments, big investment projects which  open up extensive prospects. A frank business dialogue took  place in the course of which the head of the republic expressed  doubt in the current course toward acquisition of credits to the  detriment of investments. If the policy of the government in  that area should change, consider it to be my small contribution  as chairman of the presidential council. After all the investor  brings not only money into this country but also, what is most  important, his expertise and knowledge, the ability to organize  the undertaking so that it profits the investor and the country,  and this means the people as well. In addition to that it allows  entry into western sales markets which in turn means the reverse  flow of foreign currency. Is that not advantageous for the  country?    Very many pilot projects were proposed at that meeting which  will undoubtedly be followed by others. It is a good sign when  major western firms manifest interest in investing in Moldova.    [Koretskiy] Mr. Birshteyn, again, based on your experience  of  cooperation with Moldova what obstacles do you visualize in the  way of these vivifying investments?    [Birshteyn] I believe that the answer is clear to anyone  with  even a minimal involvement in business. Conditions for the  development of business are needed. A legislative base is  required which clearly differentiates the rights and duties of  the businessman. The domestic and foreign businessman. In order  to avoid groundless accusations of nation pilfering. How can I  be pilfering the nation when I am investing my capital in it and  building? After all Birshteyn, for instance, cannot take this  hotel or plant, or a processing line with him to Canada. It was  and will remain the property of this country. My task is that of  any investor which is to ensure that the property is viable,  earns profits and provides employment for people.    We also touched on another one of these obstacles--the tax  policy. When taxes exceed a reasonable limit they discourage any  interest among investors to inject their capital into this  country. It is possible to understand the young state which is  attempting to satisfy its needs through the tax system. But not  at any price. "At any price" is not always the correct policy.  Life is already suggesting to the politicians where they made an  incorrect step in that sphere and everything, one must think,  will return to a normal, civilized path. After all they were  able to establish some benefits for agriculture and the  processing industry. That means not everything is lost.    [Koretskiy] Let us return to the search of ways to resolve  the economic crisis. For some of our politicians the creation of  free economic zones appears as a panacea against all economic  ills. What do you think about that idea?    [Birshteyn] I will not hide the fact that it appeals to me  and I was one of those who voiced this repeatedly. Except that  it was not about the economic zone but about the offshore  business zone. Similar to Liechtenstein and Monaco. It means  that for local and foreign capital special preferential  conditions are created for development. These conditions, which  are covered in international law, allow the state to develop  necessary branches to its advantage and receive profits for the  servicing of investments, while building and growing richer,  without investing its own funds.    [Koretskiy] Boris Iosifovich, you stated that you are making  your main investments in agriculture of Moldova. Great  transformations are now taking place in the countryside. The  reform is destroying kolkhozes and allows joint-stock companies  to develop, along with peasant farms, and farmers. In your  business dealings who do you prefer working with--kolkhozes or  individual farms?    [Birshteyn] This question, I see, is a loaded one. I will  answer frankly--I prefer to work with the state. Always. All  those projects which I mentioned will be carried out together  with the government on an equal footing. The government will get  its share and our firm will get its share. All this will take  place on a contractual basis and the results can be checked  through documents at any time.    [Koretskiy] Excuse me, but here is another "loaded"  question.  You worked on the basis of the same principle, i.e. directly  both in Russia and Kyrgyzstan, which is what gave rise to  accusations against the Seabeco Firm.    [Birshteyn] These accusations, however, burst like a soap  bubble once documents and facts were presented. Also I find it  difficult to understand how it is possible to level groundless  accusations from a high tribune without troubling to acquire  information from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.  After all every figure is reflected in it. Since these  documents made their appearance my stern critics fell silent.  For those reasons I released an official statement that I am  terminating my activity in Russia and Kyrgyzia.    [Koretskiy] Here, in Moldova, criticism was also leveled  against Seabeco regarding accuracy of information.    [Birshteyn] You know, I pay no attention to that ballyhoo  either here or over there. There is no time. The accusations  themselves are so confused and stereotyped that one begins to  wonder. Is it not absurd to say that Birshteyn, using his  private aircraft (Ha-Ha) brought over nuclear waste in order to  bury it in Krikov mines or somewhere in Siberia.    Someone wants to put the blame for all the troubles on  Seabeco or on any foreigner in order to appear patriotic. Time  usually provides the best evaluation of such phenomena. Even the  "great sinner" Rutskoy is now free and criminal proceedings were  initiated against his "righteous" accusers.    [Editor] NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA has a packet of documents and  official papers compiled by various monitoring organizations of  the republic at different times. They provide a most thorough  analysis of all activities of the Seabeco-Moldova firm, citing  figures and balances and reflecting the legislative base  underlying operation of the firm as well as audits of the mutual  settlement of accounts with the co-founder. The only violation  that the auditors were able to reveal was a delay in deduction  of funds into the Social Fund of the republic, for which a fine  was levied in the amount of 17,392 Moldovan rubles.    [Koretskiy] By the way, about Rutskoy. Your well-known  flight  from Moscow to Chisinau on your personal aircraft was viewed in  the republic in a highly varied manner. Could you shed more  light on this unusual visit now, sometime after the fact?    [Birshteyn] As commonly known there was a war going on at  that time and it is the most loathsome thing I have ever known  in my life. My soul rebelled against blood being spilled on the  land I love, against the suffering and grief of the refugees and  the overall depression in society. I was informed that the  figure of Rutskoy was the spark that ignited that war. His  presence in Tiraspol was viewed as approval of their course, as  a carte blanche. Knowing him personally I considered it my moral  duty to ask Rutskoy to come here and help resolve the conflict.  To my great delight I succeeded.    [Koretskiy] Mr. Birshteyn, your faith in male friendship is  impressive. You have never renounced your friends who worked in  the CPSU Central Committee after this seemingly invincible party  disintegrated. You did not disavow Rutskoy either when he was  put in jail or any of the others who found themselves in  disfavor. What is that--a pose, self-confidence, a character  trait?    [Birshteyn] In Moldova, inasmuch as I know, that is called  "Cei sapte ani de acasa" (seven years of home upbringing). I was  raised in a cultured family where the concept of friendship,  keeping one's word, and decency were placed above all.    My attitude toward a person whether he is a minister, the  president, or a driver never comes from the desire for personal  gain. Many of my friends, as they say, had their ups and downs,  but that did not alter my attitude toward them because am an  absolutely independent person and treat my attachments as I deem  necessary, without caring for the opinion of others or  proceeding from the political situation. I value true friendship  and know how to prize it.    [Koretskiy] Without beating around the bush, tell me how  compatible are the concepts of morality and business.    [Birshteyn] I know that education using the classics of  Marxism-Leninism as an example, has imbued people with a certain  stereotypical way thinking in this regard. I would like to note  that in the business world, real business, decency and keeping  one's word are valued above all else. That kind of reputation is  highly valued.    In my business dealings I have always tried to take the  honest path, engage in good business, and attain a certain level  so that my firm logo would be associated in people's minds with  good quality work. A few days ago I met a gentleman who thanked  me for the high quality of my sports outfits. But, good heavens,  I was in sports outfits some ten years ago. This means that the  buyer remembered and appreciated it. This is very important and  dear to me.    To earn money just for the sake of money is a boring  undertaking. I have always wanted for my capital to bring good  to people. That is why I have built and will continue to build,  I am initiating new projects that will remain after I am gone.  That, after all, is also morality. The fact that such a style of  work does not appeal to some and they attempt to blacken  everything is also a peculiar form of morality. Fortunately time  puts everything in its place. Passions will calm and they will  be forgotten, while this hotel and much else will remain and  serve the people and Moldova.    [Editor] Boris Birshteyn does not like being over-cautious.  He is not prone to sentimentality and reflection which are so  peculiar to the intelligentsia, or apprehension which is  characteristic of entrepreneurs of Soviet origin. His trusting  nature is combined with a narrowly utilitarian outlook and  pragmatism.    Mr. Birshteyn cannot "stop and glance back" to show off  before a mirror, to brag, let us say, about his wealth, and rest  on his laurels. He sincerely believes himself to be a gentleman  who has never harmed anyone. Birshteyn has so little time for  thinking about himself that he hesitated answering questions  about what color his eyes are or how many languages he speaks.,    Boris Birshteyn speaks Russian, German, English, Yiddish,  and  Ivrit and uses them all in his work.    [Koretskiy] A new strata of business people is now forming  in  Moldova. What errors would you warn them against?    [Birshteyn] Against "grab and rest." That is unpromising. It  is important to think and act in a broader fashion. Here I see  one of my own omissions which I am hoping to rectify. The thing  is that Moldova has no good schools for business training. I  managed to establish something like that in Kyrgyzia. It is  staffed by highly qualified foreign professors who teach the  ABC's of modern business life. Graduates receive not only an  international class diploma, but also good knowledge which helps  them start their own businesses. I hope that such a business  school will appear in Moldova as well.    [Editor] We, however, are hoping that not just a business  school as such will make its appearance in Moldova, but a school  of Moldovan business in the broadest sense of the word, i.e. our  own class of business people who will build business on the  basis of principles propounded by B. I. Birshteyn.</p>

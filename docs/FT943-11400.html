			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Man in the News: More and less than the sum of his parts - Henry Gonzalez Congressman Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican, is a former Rhodes scholar not above occasionally flashing his erudition. His disquisition opening the second day of the House banking committee's Whitewater hearings contained references to ancient Egypt, Copernican astronomy and the American revolution. Here, verbatim, is what he got in response. 'I will reserve for the record my observations on the history of the Ptolemaic world and point out to the gentleman that, in geometry, foremost mathematicians like Thales, who was most famous for saying that what one fool could do another could too, always in bringing forth the geometric basic truths, would always say QED - quod erat demonstrandum - that is, it remains to be proved and now it has been proved. And what the gentleman has said is, given his interpretation and prognostication of witnesses yet to be heard or those that have been heard, and I was hoping that that would have been a summing up at the end of the witnesses.' That was pure Henry Barbosa Gonzalez: the hint of scholarship, the mangling of the language, the iron fist in the courteous velvet glove. All these, and quite a bit more, including a legendary temper, were on display this week. The venerable chairman of the banking committee took it upon himself to ensure that the first congressional crack at the tangled skein known generically as Whitewater stuck to rules which he had been instrumental in crafting and which were designed to limit any damage to a Democratic president and White House. 'This is not a trial,' he declared on day one, and then set out to be both judge and jury. It was a performance that drove Republicans on the committee, including Mr Leach, to paroxysms of frustration, as the chairman routinely gavelled them out of order and cut them off when their allotted five minutes of questioning had expired. It even elicited an editorial in the nominally liberal New York Times, headlined 'Censorship, Gonzalez Style', complaining that 'the irascible Texan has twisted the already stringent rules to make it virtually impossible for members to develop a continuous, productive line of inquiry into even the narrow matter at hand.' Even some Clinton supporters wondered, privately, if he was not going too far. Fitting Henry Gonzalez, 78 and in his 34th year in Congress, into a neat box is not possible. He may be variously and accurately described as a pure populist (he would abolish the Federal Reserve system, symbol of big money), a blind Democratic partisan (he wanted to impeach Presidents Reagan and Bush over the invasion of Grenada, Iran-Contra and the Gulf war), and a fearless investigator (into failed savings and loans companies, BCCI and Iraq). He is also well-read (fond of mixing Shakespeare and Mexican poetry), incorruptible (he shuns the Washington social circuit and goes home most weekends), a loose cannon (capable of abrupt changes of mind) and an autocrat who more than once has decked a political critic with his fists. He is in fact all of the above, but contradictions render him both more and less than the sum of his parts. He was born in San Antonio in 1916, five years after his family had fled Mexico to escape Pancho Villa's revolution. His Basque ancestors had come to Mexico in the 16th century and were big silver mine operators, with political clout, but he was raised in straitened circumstances not improved in the Depression. Still, he acquired engineering and law degrees and entered social work. In 1956, he became the first Mexican-American in more than 100 years to be elected to the Texas senate, making a name fighting discrimination and poverty. After two failed bids for the governorship and Lyndon Johnson's old House seat, he won a special election to Congress from San Antonio in 1961 and has not faced a serious challenge since. Perhaps taking a cue from another legendary Texas populist, Wright Patman, he made the banking committee, with its broad remit, the vehicle for his congressional career, being elected chairman in 1989. In this role, Mr Gonzalez's non-partisan side was apparent whenever financial malfeasance was involved: four of the five US senators censured for taking payments from Charles Keating, chairman of the defunct Lincoln savings and loan company, were Democrats, while Clark Clifford, the Democratic lawyer, was not spared over BCCI. Curiously, whenever the committee is about its usual business, Mr Gonzalez runs it loosely, often losing procedural votes in spite of its 30-20 Democratic majority and sometimes appearing uninterested in the substance of legislation. One of the biggest admirers of his style as chairman used to be Jim Leach, the ranking minority member. On Whitewater, Mr Gonzalez initially resisted congressional hearings, saying they would jeopardise inquiries by Robert Fiske, the special counsel. Earlier this year he told Mr Leach it would be 'a cold day in Manila' before he allowed his committee to get involved. Just to rub it in, and breaching congressional decorum, he accused the mild Iowan of being obdurate, premeditated and wilfully disobedient. Days later he acceded to hearings, saying 'the country deserves a chance to expose the Republican witch hunt for what it is'. The problem for Mr Gonzalez is that he can only keep a lid on those Whitewater matters before his panel. Leaks from other committee staffs are rampant, though they have not amounted to much. Yesterday the Senate banking committee got into the act under looser rules and under the direction of Senator Don Riegle (coincidentally a Democratic member of the Keating Five and Senator Al D'Amato (the New York Republican irreverently known as Senator Quid Pro Quo). Simultaneously, whatever the convincing protestations of innocence before the banking committee this week by Lloyd Cutler and Bernard Nussbaum, present and past White House counsel, trouble seems afoot at the Treasury. Roger Altman, the deputy, and Ms Jean Hansen, the chief lawyer, both face tough questioning next week and either could end up as a sacrificial lamb. Yet it would require a wild stretch of the imagination to compare the week's hearings, in terms of drama or content, to the great congressional fora of the past - dealing with Watergate, Iran-Contra and the Clarence Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court. Cable TV channels covered the hearings but the commercial networks did not, though yesterday they suspended all regular daytime programmes for a court appearance by O J Simpson. Henry Gonzalez was not the only star of the week. His light-hearted foil, Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, pricked Republican bubbles of outrage and definitely produced the best one-liner after exchanges featuring much legal jargon: 'I am waiting to be shown a redactive recusal.' But the words most often heard came from the chair. 'The time of the gentleman has expired.' It was, of course, not applied to himself.</p>

Current stock assessment information indicates that bluefish are overfished, and the FMP contains no fishing mortality rate reduction strategy. Additional management measures are necessary for both the recreational and the commercial fisheries. In the development of Amendment 1, the Council proposes to consider additional management measures for both recreational and commercial fisheries along with a reevaluation of existing management objectives. The Council also announces a public process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues relating to revising the management of bluefish. The purpose of this document is to inform the public of the commencement of a scoping process and to provide the opportunity for public participation in the development of Amendment 1 to the FMP. All persons affected by, or otherwise interested in, the proposed amendment are invited to participate in determining the scope of significant issues to be considered in the EIS by submitting written comments. The scoping process also will identify and eliminate from detailed study issues that are not significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Council will discuss Amendment 1 at regularly scheduled meetings.

January 12, 1995, 7 p.m., Ocean City_Carousel, 118th St. &amp; Coastal Highway, Ocean City, MD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The management unit for Atlantic bluefish ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pomatomus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> saltatrix <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is all bluefish in U.S. waters in the western Atlantic Ocean. Current stock assessment information indicates that bluefish are overfished. Based on the overfishing definition in the FMP, the exploitation rate would have to be reduced by 50 percent to end overfishing. Because the FMP contains no strategy for reducing fishing mortality, additional management measures are necessary in both the recreational and the commercial fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bluefish management is further complicated by the multi-species/multi-gear nature of the fishery. Any management program developed for this Amendment must recognize that bluefish may continue to be caught and killed if these gears continue to be fished, even though their use may be directed at other species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Possible Management Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Current  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Objectives <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Part of the scoping process is the possible reevaluation of the existing objectives. The major goal of the FMP is to conserve the bluefish resource along the Atlantic coast. Five major objectives have been adopted to achieve this goal:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Increase understanding of the stock and of the fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provide the highest availability of bluefish to U.S. fishermen while maintaining, within limits, traditional uses of bluefish (defined as the commercial fishery not exceeding 20 percent of total catch).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Provide for cooperation among the coastal states, the various Regional Marine Fishery Management Councils, and Federal agencies involved along the coast to enhance the management of bluefish throughout its range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Prevent recruitment overfishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Reduce waste in both commercial and recreational fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fishery  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Measures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Possible management measures for the commercial fishery include, but are not limited to, minimum and/or maximum fish size, minimum mesh size, closed seasons and areas, quotas (including adjustments among states), a moratorium on vessels, individual transferable quotas, dealer and vessel permits and reports, operator permits, trip limits, and gear restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Possible management measures for the recreational fishery (including that sector of the fishery that carries recreational fishermen for hire) include, but are not limited to, minimum and/or maximum fish size, maximum possession limit, closed seasons and areas, gear restrictions, quotas (including adjustment among states), restrictions on the sale of recreationally caught fish, dealer and vessel permits and reports, and operator permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that permits would be mandatory for: Vessels landing bluefish for sale; dealers purchasing bluefish from permitted vessels; party and charter boats in the Atlantic bluefish fishery. Further, it is anticipated that vessels landing bluefish for sale would need to submit logbooks; dealers purchasing bluefish from permitted commercial vessels would need to submit reports; and operators of charter and party boats would need to submit logbooks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Paperwork Reduction Act forms (SF&hyph;83) prepared by NMFS for Amendment 2 to the Summer Flounder FMP, the Dealer Purchase Report was estimated to involve 1,255 respondents and 26+ responses per respondent per year, for a total of 33,135 responses at 0.0448 hours per response, for a total of 1,485 burden hours. The Vessel Logbook was estimated at 1,314 respondents, 12 responses per respondent, at 0.08 hours per response, for a total of 1,261 burden hours. The Vessel Permit was estimated at 24,943 annual responses at 0.2878 hours per response, for a total of 7,179 burden hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar burden hours should be experienced through bluefish management. There may be a reduction because vessels with summer flounder permits may qualify for the bluefish fishery. Currently, operating permits are required in the Northeast Multispecies, Atlantic Sea Scallop, and Summer Flounder FMPs. It is expected that the burden hours for the operator permit will be similar to those estimated for the Summer Flounder Operator Permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Timetable for EIS Preparation and Decisionmaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council has adopted a tentative amendment preparation, review, and approval schedule for Amendment 1. Under this schedule, the Draft EIS is planned for completion prior to the Council's September 1995 meeting. If an acceptable Draft is completed, the Council would decide at that meeting whether to submit the draft EIS for public review. Oral comments to the Council on their decision could be made at that meeting. If the Council's decision is affirmative, public review of the draft EIS would occur during 45 days in October and November 1995. At its January 1996 meeting, the Council would decide on any revisions to the proposed management regime of bluefish, and oral comments on the decision could be made to the Council at that meeting. If the Council's decision is affirmative, the EIS would be made final and submitted with the amendment recommendation and other rulemaking documents to NMFS for review and approval. The Council reserves the right to modify or abandon this schedule if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Magnuson Act, NMFS review and approval of a proposed amendment is completed in no more than 95 days and includes concurrent public comment periods on the amendment and proposed regulations. If approved by NMFS under this schedule, the revised bluefish management measures would be effective in 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  16 U.S.C. 1801  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David S.

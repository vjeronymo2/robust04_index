			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: GM in Dollars 100m India joint venture General Motors, the US carmaker, and Hindustan Motors, an Indian motor manufacturer, yesterday announced a Dollars 100m joint venture to make cars in India. The 50-50 venture is a boost for the Indian government, which is liberalising the economy and trying to attract foreign trade and investment. The announcement comes as Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is preparing to set off on a visit to the US aimed partly at promoting inward investment. GM will bring to India its Astra hatchback saloon, produced by Adam Opel, the group's German subsidiary. The partners plan to build 20,000 Astras a year, starting in the third quarter of 1995, at a Hindustan Motors plant at Baroda, in the western state of Gujarat. The proportion of local content in the vehicle is set to rise to 70 per cent over three years. Mr Greg De Yonker, executive vice-president of GM Overseas Distribution, said GM had been drawn to India by the government's economic liberalisation policies. 'We hope they will continue carrying them out, as they have said they will,' he said. Mr CK Birla, chairman of the joint venture, said it was 'a very positive sign of the world's confidence in India' that GM had decided to invest. GM produced vehicles in India between 1928 and 1954, when it pulled out because of the country's poor economic prospects. It developed ties with Hindustan Motors through licensing agreements to make Bedford lorries and Vauxhall cars. Hindustan Motors is best-known as the manufacturer of the Ambassador, a model based on the 1950s Morris Oxford. The joint venture was first proposed in 1990, but delayed by changes in the Indian government, shifts in economic policy, and the uncertainty caused by the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in December 1992. The announcement follows the recent signing of a joint venture between Telco, the vehicle manufacturing affiliate of the Tata industrial grouping, and Daimler-Benz of Germany, to assemble up to 10,000 Mercedes-Benz cars a year. Sipani Automobiles, a Bangalore-based engineering company, earlier this year started assembling Montego cars from kits supplied by Rover Group of the UK. In Bombay, Premier Automobiles, which has long-standing links with Fiat of Italy, is discussing a joint venture with Peugeot of France to make Peugeot's 309 model.</p>

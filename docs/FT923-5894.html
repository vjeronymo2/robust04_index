			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent stages a cautious recovery CONTINENTAL bourses staged a cautious recovery after its falls earlier in the week, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rose but sentiment remained nervous in spite of a batch of good company results and analysts said it was too early to speak of a recovery. 'The market has recently seen a strong decline, an adjustment of price levels and it looks oversold,' said one. 'But there isn't much buying interest around and any technical rebound appears to be short-lived.' Disappointing monthly inflation figures from Hesse were enough to upset the market and restrained the rise in the DAX to 4.37 to 1,473.28. At midsession the FAZ index was up 0.67 at 582.34, while turnover rose to DM5.1bn from DM4.1bn. MAN, the engineering and truck manufacturer, gained DM12.50 to DM279.50, but off an intraday high of DM281, on a 3 per cent rise in net profit for fiscal 1992. Continental put on DM4 to DM228.50 after forecasting good full-year earnings. Hoechst surprised analysts with its results but its shares closed unchanged at DM228. BASF, expected to report today, lost DM4.10 to DM207.10 while Bayer gained DM1.80 to DM257.50. After the close Henkel, down DM1 at DM566, reported a 2.9 per cent increase in its first-half profit. Volkswagen, which also reports today, strengthened DM2.20 to DM314 on news of a 10 per cent rise in sales. PARIS brushed off a second poll giving a majority of 'No's' in the Maastricht referendum and rebounded from the day's low on firmer bond futures. The CAC-40 index ended 0.08 better at 1,667.80, off its worst level of 1,648.32, in meagre turnover of FFr1.4bn. A year-on-year drop of 22.7 per cent in housing starts in the three months to end-July weighed on the construction sector. Lafarge fell FFr9.10 to FFr272.50 while Saint-Gobain eased FFr6 to FFr502. Talk of an ERM realignment, which would reduce the need for a further rise in interest rates, pushed the banking sector higher. Societe Generale rose FFr5.60 or 1.2 per cent to FFr469.50. Euro Disney rebounded from its recent weakness, closing up FFr2.65 or 3.9 per cent at FFr70.60. MILAN saw selling wipe out a slightly stronger start. Rumours concerning Mr Enrico Cuccia, honorary chairman of Mediobanca, were blamed for the fall. They were denied after the close. The Comit index fell 0.83 to 394.10 in turnover estimated at more than Tuesday's L49.1bn. Mediobanca fell L120 to L10,870 and then slipped to L10,550 after hours. Fiat closed at L4,040, up L40, but then fell to L3,995 later. Pirelli rose L16.50 to L1,184 on news that the British conglomerate BTR was buying Pirelli's Brazilian rubber production business. AMSTERDAM was lifted by some encouraging company results. The CBS Tendency index closed up 1.2 at 108.1. IHC Caland, the dredging group rose FL 3.20 to Fl 81 following a positive analysts meeting on Tuesday. Wolters Kluwer improved Fl 2.40 to Fl 77 on good half-year results, which also helped Elsevier rise 30 cents to Fl 104.30. KNP's interim results seemed to impress, as its shares put on Fl 2.50 or 6.7 per cent to Fl 39.50. ZURICH retreated in late trading with the SMI index down 4.7 at 1,705. BBC Brown Boveri certificates went against the market, gaining SFr35 to SFr665 on a proposal to swap non-voting participation certificates for voting bearer shares. The bearers closed unchanged at SFr3,370. STOCKHOLM rebounded from its recent slump, gaining 2.6 per cent despite a 3 percentage point rise in the Riksbank's key lending rate. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 19 to 751.3 in heavy turnover of SKr711m, of which Astra accounted for SKr270m. Astra led the rally after its stronger-than-expected results for the half year, released after the close on Tuesday. The A shares ended at SKr512, up SKr15 and the B share rose SKr13 to SKr497. OSLO jumped more than 2 per cent in spite of sharply higher interest rates, partly on relief over a government decision to take over the running of the insurer Uni Storebrand. The all-share index gained 6.73 to 306.77 in turnover worth NKr224m. HELSINKI's fall continued after the central bank raised its tender rate. The HEX index slipping 20.4 or 3.5 per cent to 559.3 but turnover remained low at FM15m. Nokia free shares fell FM3.5 to FM46. COPENHAGEN stabilised after heavy losses this week, with the KFX index closing 0.25 down at 75.77 in thin turnover of DKr112m. FLS Industries fell DKr10 to DKr430 after announcing a fall in mid-year profit. MADRID closed at another year's low, the general index off 1.90 at 203.76 in turnover of some Pta6bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 26  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close   999.33   997.70   997.45   996.54   997.10   997.69   996.62   997.98  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  999.33            Day's Low  995.81  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Aug 25        Aug 24        Aug 21        Aug 20       Aug 19       993.01       1010.52       1039.54       1030.83      1033.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

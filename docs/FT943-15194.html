			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Airline perks in peril - A US agency plans to save clients money by cutting out extras such as frequent-flyer schemes A few weeks ago this page asked whether employees travelling on company money should be allowed to keep frequent-flyer points for themselves. Most who responded thought they should. But the question will no longer arise if Mr Kevin Mitchell, founder of a new US company called Business Travel Contractors, has his way. Mr Mitchell is the business traveller's nemesis. He believes that companies are being ripped off by frequent-flyer schemes and other incentives offered by airlines. So he has come up with a scheme that would slash the cost of corporate air travel (and, incidentally, make money for Mr Mitchell) by wiping out the perks. It is no secret that the frequent-flyer system, where a passenger receives points, or miles, towards free tickets for future flights, is open to abuse. Some employees may make unnecessary business journeys to accumulate miles for their personal use; others may choose unnecessarily long and expensive routes; still more may travel with certain airlines to earn miles in their frequent-flyer programmes when other airlines would have charged much less for the same journey. Frequent-flyer schemes, however, are not the source of concern to employers. In the US, as elsewhere, most big companies use travel agents to handle their air travel re-quirements. The travel agents make their money from the standard 10 per cent commission they get on each ticket sold. But airlines also offer loyalty bonuses, known as overrides, to travel agents which sell enough of their tickets, plus allowances known as soft dollars that can be exchanged for free tickets, free upgrades and other perks. It is small wonder that companies sometimes question whether the advice they are getting is as unbiased as they would like it to be. Mr Mitchell says many companies believe the whole system is rotten, wasteful and inefficient. The solution, he says, is to scrap it. He wants airlines to introduce special fares for their corporate customers that would carry no commissions, no overrides, no frequent-flyer points, and no other bonuses of any kind. Stripped bare of all the associated costs, these so-called business contract fares would be much cheaper than today's. They would also be simpler to understand because they would be strictly mileage-based. In this new, perk-free era, companies would still use travel agents to make their travel arrangements. But the agents would no longer get commissions from the airlines: instead, they would be paid for their services by their corporate customers. Mr Mitchell's Business Tra-vel Contractors, which is based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, would make its money by representing companies in their fare negotiations with the airlines. It is tempting to dismiss Mr Mitchell as an idealist. But as the former vice-president of conference and travel management for Cigna, one of the biggest US insurance groups, he knows what he is talking about. Significantly, he has already signed up 17 US companies to fund the development of his scheme, including Cigna, Bell Atlantic, Black &amp; Decker, Chrysler, Colgate-Palmolive, General Motors, Gillette, Merck, Whirlpool and Xerox. Will the idea fly? Mr Mitchell says it will cut total corporate travel costs by a minimum of 20 per cent, so companies seem likely to support it. US travel agents are also interested, because a fee-based system could offer them a more secure flow of income than commissions, which are vulnerable to the downward pressure on air fares. The biggest resistance seems likely to come from the airlines, which like to think that incentives are a cost-effective way of putting bodies in seats. Earlier this year, International Business Machines, the computer company, failed in an attempt to persuade two US airlines to eliminate frequent-flyer points for IBM employees in return for lower fares. But Mr Mitchell claims the airlines are secretly desperate to get off the treadmill of an ever-rising volume of overrides and frequent-flyer awards. As soon as he has 40 companies behind him, he plans to test that theory by making the airlines an offer they can - but possibly won't - refuse.</p>

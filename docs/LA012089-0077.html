Expanded Entertainment, $39.  </P> <P> This collection of 14 excellent shorts from nine countries showcases the  diversity of world animation. Dujan Petricic's outrageous re-telling of "Romeo  and Juliet" (Yugoslavia) with monsters, and "Charade" (Canada), John Minnis'  Oscar-winning parody of parlor games, recapture the hilarity of the classic  Hollywood cartoons. A second Academy Award-winner, Borge Ring's "Anna and  Bella" (Holland), in which two aged sisters reminisce about their shared lives,  shows how a talented artist can capture the most deeply felt emotions in a few  simple lines. An exceptional package of films. Information: (213) 473-6701.  CHARLES SOLOMON  </P></p>

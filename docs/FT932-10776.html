			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Touche Ross faces Fidelity trial THE RENEWED legal battle over the performance of Touche Ross as auditors to Fidelity, an electronics company, is set to go to trial in October 1994, more than 10 years after the company was acquired by Caparo, a privately owned mini-conglomerate. In the latest attempt to gain redress from the auditors, a case is being brought by Intersound Consumer Electronics, the name by which Fidelity is now known. Caparo brought a case against the auditors and the directors of Fidelity in 1985. This culminated in a controversial ruling in the House of Lords in 1990. The courts found against two directors, Mr Steven Dickman and Mr Robert Dickman, who have since become bankrupt, but the action against Touche Ross foundered. A 1990 ruling widely welcomed by accountancy firms said auditors had no 'duty of care' to individual shareholders or other users of accounts, and only to the company and to shareholders as a collective body. The decision has led to calls for reform of the law, not least from Sir Thomas Bingham, one of the appeal judges on the Caparo case, who led the inquiry into the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Now action is being brought against Touche Ross by Intersound, which is owned by Caparo. The mini-conglomerate made a hostile bid for Fidelity which led to its takeover of the company in October 1984. A writ was first issued in March 1990 claiming damages and interest in connection with breach of contract and/or negligence arising from the audit of Fidelity's accounts for the period to March 31 1984. The statement of claim quantifying the sums is not a public document. But the original claim against Touche Ross by Caparo as shareholders was for Pounds 13.4m for the acquisition, a further 20 per cent for the 'reasonable return' on investment for that sum, less the residual value of the Fidelity shares, plus interest. The case centres on the alleged overstatement in the 1984 accounts of stocks, sales and pre-tax profits. Touche Ross has said it will defend the action 'forcibly'.</p>

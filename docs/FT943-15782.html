			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Total sells shares in Euridep offshoot Total, the French oil group, said yesterday that it had sold a 20.2 per cent stake in its Euridep paints subsidiary to a group of French and international investors. The proceeds, which are thought to be about FFr600m (Dollars 107.9m), will finance Euridep's investment and acquisition plans, Total said. Euridep comprises all Total's paint businesses, which generate sales of about FFr3bn. It is the largest paints company in France, and ranks number four in the UK, following its acquisition of Manders earlier this year. Societe Generale, the French bank, handled the sale of the 20.2 per cent stake in Euridep stake, taking up some of the shares itself. Other investors included banks, insurance companies and some private investors, Total said.</p>

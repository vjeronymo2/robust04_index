			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Management: A sympathetic ear in the office - Employee counselling schemes are helping to make the workplace happier A senior administrator in a London bank had spent several years successfully climbing the corporate ladder. Yet over a period of six months he began to experience headaches, a poor appetite and eczema. Demoralised, he started scanning the employment pages for a new job. His departure might have cost his employer thousands of pounds, as it sought to train a replacement candidate. Yet due to confidential counselling paid for by the bank, which identified symptoms of stress due to a difficult relationship with a superior, he remained and was soon promoted to a more senior position. A female employee in a computer firm faced similar problems. Yet after a few counselling sessions, she is back at work and enjoying a better relationship with friends and colleagues. 'My friends say I have changed a lot, become a lot more outgoing and assertive,' she says. Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs) are run by 80 per cent of the top 500 US companies. In the UK, EAPs are also becoming an increasingly popular employment benefit, particularly in the banking, pharmaceuticals and financial services industries. Since the late 1980s some 150 UK companies are estimated to have taken up comprehensive EAPs and the rate of participation is increasing, according to providers. Groups as diverse as Whitbread and Mobil Oil are among converts to the advantages of providing confidential counselling to employees and their families throughout their working lives. The counselling programme, usually contracted out to an independent firm of specialists, is often part of an occupational health programme. Employees and (where appropriate) their families are generally given a card with a number to contact a counsellor either for telephone or face-to-face counselling. The service may cover problems ranging from depression to debt, or stress arising from difficulties at home or in the workplace. The argument for introducing such a programme may not be immediately apparent to frontline managers more concerned with the day-to-day job of surviving the recession. Improving the general sense of well-being among employees is likely to be lower on the list of priorities. However, with recession forcing companies to cut staff, the pressures on those who remain has never been greater. Ian Anderson, community investment manager of Whitbread, is adamant his company's experience is solid proof of the benefits which EAPs can bring. He claims that 'the EAP has been a major factor behind our success in retaining managers'. Since introducing it on a trial basis in 1988 in conjunction with the EAP firm, Focus, Whitbread now offers the facility to all employees and their families. It estimates that about 5.5 per cent of its workforce uses the programme, with the most common concerns being work and family related. Anderson believes the EAP has helped to improve the efficiency of employees and encourage a happier workplace. 'If they have problems, they will be careless,' he says. The company is also likely to experience problems of absenteeism and 'general lateness'. However, says Anderson, EAPs had helped 'to nip such problems in the bud'. Mobil Oil, which uses the 24-hour service provided by Personal Performance Consultants, considers its EAP to be an essential element of its health and safety programme. Initially introduced to deal with the problems of its off-shore employees, many of whom are away from their families for two weeks each month, the facility has been expanded to cover 3,000 workers around the country. John Cooper, Mobil's group medical adviser, stresses the importance of mental health at work, particularly in the off-shore industry. 'If you are not functioning at 100 per cent, then you are a safety risk,' he says. Employees with problems will either refer themselves or can be referred by managers. If referred, it is up to the employee to decide whether to take up the offer. The counselling will then remain confidential. Both Anderson and Cooper stress the need for this, although the company pays a price by receiving few statistics on use of the programme. The lack of statistics makes the payback difficult to determine. In the US, where EAPs have been accepted practice since the 1940s, statistics are easier to come by. The aerospace group McDonnell Douglas is often cited as a company which has seen tangible benefits. The initial costs of setting up an EAP are likely to be incurred in commissioning an outside counselling firm or hiring one in-house and printing the promotional literature. On average, hiring an external counselling service will cost a company between Pounds 15 and Pounds 30 per employee, depending on the complexity of the programme. Companies must be prepared to invest in training management to spot potential problems, and appoint at least one person to oversee the day-to-day running of the programme. Whitbread supports its EAP with posters, brochures and regular talks. 'It is no use launching a programme with great razzamatazz and expecting your staff to remember its existence,' says Anderson. 'Like any other service, it needs marketing.'</p>

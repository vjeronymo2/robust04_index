			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT OF GERMAN AID FOR LIBYAN JETS IS REINFORCED;  </P> <P> DER SPIEGEL CARRIES PHOTOS PURPORTED TO SHOW USE OF AERIAL REFUELING TECHNOLOGY  FROM MUNICH FIRM  </P> <P> A national newsmagazine published photographs Sunday to reinforce its assertion  that a West German firm is furnishing air-to-air refueling technology to Libya  that will give Col. Moammar Kadafi's fighter-bombers range enough to reach  Israel.  </P> <P> Der Spiegel printed four photographs, taken from a videotape, purporting to  show a French-built Mirage jet of the Libyan air force nosing into a refueling  drogue from another plane.  </P> <P> The magazine said that Intec, a Munich-based company, had helped convert  U.S.-built, Libyan-owned C-130 and Boeing 707 transport planes into refueling  tankers to service the attack jets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Israel Within Range  </P> <P> "The fighter jets are now able to fly to and from Israel," the magazine's story  said.  </P> <P> Der Spiegel also published a letter it said was from Intec to a technician  involved in the assistance project.  </P> <P> The magazine made its initial assertion about Intec last week, and Bonn's chief  government spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, promptly denied the allegation, saying  that Intec had sent two fuel tanks to Libya but that these could be used only  on the ground and not in the air.  </P> <P> Ost has several times lately been forced to change his public denials of West  German companies' involvement in Libyan projects, notably those concerning a  chemical weapons plant that Washington charges is being built at Rabta, south  of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. Libya insists that the plant is intended to  produce only pharmaceutical chemicals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3 Years in Libya  </P> <P> Der Spiegel reported in its current edition, which will be on the newsstands  today, that technicians recruited by Intec have been working in Libya for the  last three years, and the published letter it said was from the company to a  technician was dated Dec. 20, 1985. The letter referred to the "operation in  North Africa."  </P> <P> According to the magazine's account, Washington told the Kohl administration  about Intec's arrangement with Libya in May, 1988. But it was only after the  furor over the Libyan chemical complex surfaced that the West German government  said Intec was under investigation for possible breach of export laws.  </P> <P> In its current edition, Der Spiegel also reported that a state-owned East  German company supplied steel parts for the Libyan complex at Rabta.  </P> <P> Quoting intelligence sources and others, the magazine said that the state firm,  VEB Metalleichtbau Kombinat, was aware that the Libyan plant is intended to  produce chemical weapons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approached by Barbouti  </P> <P> According to the magazine's account, the East German firm was originally  approached by Ihsan Barbouti, a London-based, Iraqi-born entrepreneur whose  defunct Frankfurt company is under investigation for allegedly having supplied  goods and services to the Rabta factory. The magazine said the East German  company furnished 10 steel construction elements weighing 800 tons each for  Rabta.  </P> <P> East German officials knew that "these civilian materials were intended for  totally different purposes," Der Spiegel said, adding that in 1987 the East  Germans tightened controls on exports of materials that could be used to make  chemical weapons.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a West German parliamentary panel is scheduled this week to examine  charges that West German scientists might be involved in an Iraqi government  program to make biological weapons.  </P></p>

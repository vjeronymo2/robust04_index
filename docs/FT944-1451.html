			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Asian markets feel the squeeze in a shrinking world: Peter Montagnon reviews prospects after global ripples Five years ago, says one Asian stockbroker, it would have been unthinkable for the region's markets to have tumbled on the news that a local authority in the US had gone bankrupt. That this has been the case with California's Orange County shows how global markets have become. Asian shares fell sharply on Orange County's troubles with Hong Kong particularly badly affected, though many have since recovered some lost ground. Fund managers say the underlying tone remains weak and admit that 1994 has been pretty disappointing after last year's stellar performance. Attention is now turning to 1995. Perhaps Asia will shake off the interest rate gloom emanating from the US and resume its position at the top of the world performance league. But confidence is far from strong. In theory there are good arguments why Asian markets should recover. While interest rates have tended to rise around the region in response to tighter money in the US, the effect on economic output should be marginal with most countries expecting little worse than a slight softening of this year's high growth rates. Indeed the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank has forecast a rise to 5.8 per cent from 5.5 per cent in Hong Kong's growth next year. 'Asia is delivering more than its fair share of earnings growth,' says Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London. 'Therefore de-coupling (from the US) in 1995 is a fair possibility.' However, few brokers and fund managers predict a speedy turnround in the new year and several think the markets could fall further. Part of the problem is that no rally can be sustained by local demand alone. Some brokers argue that local investors have neither the cash nor the confidence to drive equity markets higher on their own. Share prices will only really start to recover, they argue, once foreign institutional liquidity returns. Yet Asia is low on the shopping list of US investors now they can obtain higher yields in the money and bond market. Liquid markets such as Hong Kong have also taken a hammering. On this basis it would appear that the markets least at risk are those such as South Korea and Taiwan which are insulated from the ebb and flow of foreign liquidity by regulatory controls on overseas investment. But others will not necessarily recover automatically. Part of the question is whether US buyers will return in force at all if higher interest rates make equity investment less fashionable in the US than bonds and money market instruments. Mr Angus Armstrong, Morgan Grenfell's economics director in Hong Kong, says the real question is where the capital flows will go. 'The markets which will suffer most are those which have been most exposed to international capital flows.' Markets where currencies are aligned to the US dollar are particularly vulnerable to repatriation of foreign investment. This category, he says, includes Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong. Then there are regional factors. Overshadowing the Hong Kong market are worries that China's economy might be heading for a hard landing. Chinese companies which are quoted there have been hard hit in recent weeks on worries about the ability of state enterprises to service their debts and about the cavalier way China has treated some foreign investors such as the restaurant chain McDonald's which has had its lease in Beijing terminated. There also remains a risk that China will fail to control inflation and rein in state enterprises. Repercussions would be felt further afield, given the extent to which companies from countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan and Singapore have invested in China. Malaysia has also disappointed this year. Some investors hope that elections expected next year will help lift share prices as political parties step up their spending to win voter support. The same could be true of Thailand where the coalition government is in disarray. Another worry is that Japanese investment in the region could slow when the yen starts to weaken, as higher exchange rates would erode the competitive advantage of other Asian countries. By 1996 the earnings position could look weaker. BZW forecasts that earnings growth that year will have fallen sharply on this year's level in almost all markets, except the Philippines. Crosby Securities believes Thailand will show earnings growth of 21.5 per cent in 1996 against 21.9 per cent this year. Earnings growth will be slightly higher by then in Singapore but will have fallen back in Hong Kong, Malaysia and, in contrast to BZW's forecast, the Philippines. In other words, earnings growth may be reasonable next year, but there are doubts about 1996. Those who are punting on an Asian market recovery next year must believe US liquidity will return before the markets start looking past the peak of the earnings cycle.</p>

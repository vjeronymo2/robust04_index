			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Ciments Francais told to make bid CIMENTS Francais, the troubled French cement group, is being forced by the French stock market authorities to mount a bid for Guintoli, the construction company embroiled in the recent scandal over Ciments Francais' off-balance sheet dealings. The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, the body that regulates the Paris stock market, yesterday announced that it had instructed Ciments Francais to make the bid after considering a report by the Commission des Operations des Bourse, the market watchdog, into the cement company's investment in Guintoli. The critical issue in the Guintoli affair was whether the Ciments Francais stake in the company was raised above the 33.3 per cent level at which, under French law, any investor must mount a full bid. The official reports have concluded that Ciments Francais did acquire more than a third of Guintoli's equity and therefore must make an offer. Ciments Francais has been clouded by controversy since October when the scandal over its off-balance sheet dealings first surfaced. Mr Pierre Conso, who chaired the company at the time of the transactions, has resigned.</p>

Those running on the ADP list  included Petr Lucinschi, the speaker of the present parliament,  and Andrey Sangeli, the prime minister. In all, 73 percent of  Moldovans took part in the elections.    Parties of leftwing orientation, running in the Socialist  Party-Movement For Equal Rights and Unity bloc, scored an  unexpected success, gaining 23 percent of the vote. The Popular  Christian Democratic Front and the bloc of peasants and  intellectuals, whose main aim is unification with Romania,  gained approximately 14 percent of the votes. In fourth place,  according to as yet preliminary figures, was the Social  Democratic Party, which received 13 percent of the votes.    Political specialists in Moldova believe that a constructive  majority will be formed in the new parliament which will favor  the further strengthening of Moldovan statehood - in particular,  the implementation of a balanced foreign policy - and closer  economic integration with all republics of the Commonwealth.</p>

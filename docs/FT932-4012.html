			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Sotheby's helps to bail out Names SOTHEBY'S, the London auction house, is offering a discreet tailor-made service to Lloyd's Names who want to sell the family silver - or other heirlooms. 'We are not coffin chasers, but we have a market where a lot of people are looking to raise capital,' said Mr James Miller of Sotheby's. It has received 'thousands' of inquiries in recent months from Names, individuals whose capital underwrites the insurance market. Sotheby's is to meet members' agents next week to advise on auction rescue packages. The meeting, the first of its kind in Lloyd's 300-year-old history, comes as many Names are close to ruin. The auction house offers Names a 40 per cent discount on commission, loans of up to 35 per cent on the value of objects sent for sale and free surveys. It also promises 'total anonymity'. Mr Miller heads a special advisory service which is already dealing with about 2,000 Names, most of whom are seeking to raise between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 100,000. Sotheby's counsels them about which objects to sell: 'Some people might say 'I can't bear to sell that painting - what about the candlesticks?' But we might have to point out that there are already lots of candlesticks on the market, so why don't they look at the chest of drawers?' The main objects being sold are silver, jewellery, paintings and furniture. Sotheby's said the flood of new pieces had not, as yet, triggered a significant fall in their prices for silver and jewellery, although prices in the furniture market have dipped in the last year. 'Most of the silver does seem to be mopped up,' said Mr Richard Came, silver consultant at Sotheby's. Among the hard hit Names themselves, the mood is more bitter. 'It's a buyers' market', said Mr Norbet Mallet, who, as a result of losses of more than Pounds 1m with the Gooda Walker syndicates, has had to sell most of his family jewellery in the last two years, at prices he believes are 'some 30 per cent lower' than 1980s prices.</p>

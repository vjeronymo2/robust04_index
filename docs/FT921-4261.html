			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Perez package casts doubt on economic reform THE package of political, economic and social initiatives announced last week by Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, has raised serious questions about the future of his unpopular economic reform programme, writes Joseph Mann from Caracas. President Perez last Thursday disclosed a broad range of initiatives aimed at raising general support for his administration and at stemming the attacks from political foes, including members of his own political party. The most important of these initiatives were: a return to price controls on a limited number of items, such as petrol, electricity, pharmaceuticals, and a small basket of basic foods; new or accelerated programmes in housing, transportation, health and education; institution of a luxury tax, a new tax on corporate assets and other fiscal measures; pledges to install a constituent assembly that would effect major constitutional reforms and choose a 'cabinet of national unity'; reforms aimed at reducing corruption, including the replacement of five Supreme Court justices, bills to reform the legal system and the threat of extraditing major figures charged with corrupt practices; and, a series of financial system reforms. These initiatives were based on the recommendations of a special commission charged with finding solutions to the current political crisis. Investors are worried that new members of the proposed 'national unity' cabinet - likely to include opposition and independent figures - will savage the economic reforms put into effect three years ago, despite Mr Perez's repeated pledges to the contrary. So far, the president's March 5 message has produced only a few concrete results. The head of the Supreme Court announced he was retiring, and the Minister of Justice, in office for only eight days, resigned indignantly, asserting she had not been consulted on proposed legal reforms. Members of both mainstream parties, the president's Democratic Action (AD) party and the opposition Christian Democrats, began criticising the idea of a constituent assembly. Moreover, Mr Perez's pledge to pursue allegedly corrupt figures in and outside Venezuela put him sharply at odds with a powerful group within his own party, which fears that important figures from the last administration, including ex-President Jaime Lusinchi, could face public charges.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Danish Local Elections: Coalition parties take a beating DENMARK'S coalition government parties have taken a beating in local government elections, which showed a surge in support for the opposition Liberal Party, headed by former foreign minister, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. The Liberals won 27.1 per cent of the vote against 15.8 per cent in the last election to the Folketing (parliament) and 17.8 per cent in the 1989 county council vote. The results are a pointer to the general election due before the end of 1994 in which the Liberals are set to lead the opposition challenge to the Social Democratic-led coalition, headed by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. Mr Rasmussen said yesterday he was satisfied with the result, which 'shows that people are beginning to see the results of the government's policies.' The Social Democrats won 34.4 per cent in the county council elections compared with 37.4 per cent in the 1991 Folketing elections and 35.4 per cent in the 1989 local government vote. But results for two of the small centre parties in the present four-party coalition were disastrous. The Centre Democrats won 1 per cent compared with 5 per cent in the 1991 Folketing election; the Christian People's Party went down to 1.6 per cent from 2.3 per cent. The Centre Democrats would lose all their nine seats and the Christians their four seats in the present Folketing if Tuesday's result were repeated in next year's election. The fourth coalition party, the Radical Liberals, did better, scoring 3.9 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent in 1991. The Conservatives, aiming to form a coalition with the Liberals after the next parliamentary election, went down to 12.8 per cent from 16.0 per cent in 1991 and the right-wing populist Progress Party scored 5.1 per cent, down from 6.4 per cent in 1991. On the far left, the Socialist People's Party scored 9.1 per cent, up from 8.3 per cent in 1991. The Social Democrats have led the coalition since January when Mr Poul Schluter, who was conservative prime minister since 1982, resigned. Mr Ellemann-Jensen said yesterday the signal from the local elections was that 'the voters found it unreasonable to switch governments without a parliamentary election.'</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tamaris plans capital restructure TAMARIS, the long term care provider, has announced plans to overcome the financial difficulties of recent years with a capital restructuring, placing and open offer. The money is being raised to turn a deficit on shareholders funds of Pounds 724,000 at March 31 to a surplus of about Pounds 556,000 and to fund development. Under new management, a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.3m for the year to end-March 1991 has reduced to a deficit of Pounds 50,000 in 1992-93. The board plans to operate 1,000 beds within the next five years. It currently has 234. The capital reconstruction involves the conversion of all preference shares and the raising of new equity shares. The company has not paid a dividend on preference shares since April 1991 and has passed its payments to ordinary shareholders since August 1989. Preference shareholders will forfeit accrued rights to Pounds 440,000. Under the proposals every 100 preference shares will be converted into 960 ordinary shares. Each existing share and each converted ordinary share will then be split into one new ordinary share and one deferred share. The company is simultaneously raising a net Pounds 1.28m through the issue of 78.9m new shares at 2p each, in the placing and open offer. The open offer is restricted to 44.9m shares. Qualifying shareholders will be entitled to apply for 16 offer shares for every 15 existing shares and 10.24 offer shares for each preference share. The remaining 34m new ordinary shares are being placed firm. The capital will be reduced by cancelling the deferred shares arising on the subdivision and reducing the amount standing to the credit of the share premium account by approximately Pounds 2.7m, subject to the agreement of shareholders and the High Court.</p>

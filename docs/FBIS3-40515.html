			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Fujitsu, Ltd., has developed a software package for  work stations to be used for the calculation and analysis of the  orbits of satellites circling the earth. It can be used not only  to calculate the orbit of a satellite in time series by entering  the position and speed of the satellite, but also to display the  calculated orbits on a world map. Its price is only one-tenth  the price of the software packages for large general-purpose  computers. As a low-cost orbit-analysis software package for  personal use by engineers and scientists, it will be aimed at  various institutions and companies that use satellite data, such  as National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), aerial  survey companies, broadcasting corporations, and universities.    The software was developed as a package for work stations  based on orbit-analysis software for large general-purpose  computers that Fujitsu developed for NASDA and are currently  operated by NASDA. Depending on the desired accuracy of  analysis, three different models are available -- Orbiter/1  (&yen;3 million), Orbiter/2 (&yen;1.5 million), and Orbiter/3  (&yen;0.5 million). They all work on Fujitsu's S-family work  stations. The company hopes to sell 20 sets a year.    Once the basic data such as position, speed, and time of a  satellite obtained from the satellite operating company or  organization are entered into a work station loaded with this  software, it will automatically calculate the position of the  satellite at a certain point in the future or the direction seen  from an arbitrary point on the ground, keeping factors such as  the atmosphere and the gravity in consideration.    NASDA and other space-related research organizations  normally  use large general-purpose computers to calculate the orbits of  the satellites that are currently in operation or are to be  launched in the future. Since the software packages for large  computers are quite expensive to develop -- more than &yen;30  million -- they are not readily available for individual  engineers or scientists for their own orbit calculations and  studies.    Companies such as aerial survey companies, broadcasting  corporations, and radio service companies have had to depend on  data from research institutions, etc. Since this new software  enables smaller firms to do in-house orbit calculations, there  are many applications; for example, aerial survey companies will  be able to plan ``when and where to start next surveys.''</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Little movement as focus shifts to refunding deal US GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed slightly at the long end of the market but eased at the short end as a round of bank prime rate cuts and a spate of economic statistics passed with little reaction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up  1/16 at 96 9/32 , to yield 8.174 per cent. The two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 1/32 , yielding 6.795 per cent. Analysts said the market's attention was fixed on the Treasury's quarterly refunding package, scheduled for next week. Analysts are expecting the Treasury to announce offerings worth Dollars 36bn, spread evenly between three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities. Bond dealers were unhappy that the Fed cut the discount rate on Tuesday, just days before the quarterly refunding, because it pushed up bond prices. Higher bond prices make the refunding exercise more costly for dealers and investors, who would have preferred to see the Fed wait until after next week's injection of fresh supply to cut rates. However, analysts expect the offering to go well because of feeling that the economy will take longer than envisaged to pull out of its recession. Yesterday's economic data left little impression on the market. The Fed's latest survey of the economy and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' (NAPM) report for April revealed a slight improvement in economic conditions, but showed the economy still firmly rooted in recession. Allied to a small rise in the April leading indicators, the news suggested a recovery was still a way off. In the credit markets, the Fed intervened via overnight system repurchase agreements to add reserves to the market and soften the Fed funds rate. The Fed's operations initially had the desired effect, pushing Fed funds down from an opening 6 per cent to 5 3/4 per cent, the target rate set by the Fed, before firming later, to 5 7/8 . UK GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed yesterday, although traders said the gilts market was generally quiet ahead of today's local government elections. The price of the benchmark gilt, the 11 3/4 gilt maturing in 2003/07, increased by half a point from 110 1/32 to 110 17/32 . The election results for 12,000 council seats in England and Wales will be awaited eagerly as they are expected to provide an indication of the government's popularity and how soon a general election will be called. Traders said they expect the gilts market to bounce up once the local elections are out of the way. Attention is then more likely to focus on the April Retail Price Index, due on May 17, which is expected to show a fall in inflation. JAPANESE government bond prices rose on rumours that the Bank of Japan would cut the Official Discount Rate, following the US Federal Reserve's example. The yield on the benchmark No 129 government bond opened at 6.69 per cent in Tokyo. It moved to a high of 6.645 per cent, and traded in London at around 6.65 per cent. Volumes were low as it is the Golden Week holiday in Japan. EUROPEAN government bonds drifted up, reflecting optimism over the Fed's discount rate cut. Most of the domestic markets were closed yesterday for the May Day holiday, but trading in European bonds took place in London. Traders reported further interest in buying shorter-dated German government bonds, as fears of an interest rate increase have been dispelled for the time being. Interest in the Dutch bond market - which stayed open - focused on the new 8.5 per cent 15-year state bond tap. The capital markets agency of the Dutch finance ministry set the tap issue price for the 8.50 per cent state bond due 2006 at 99.6 to yield 8.55 per cent. The price on Monday was 99.40.</p>

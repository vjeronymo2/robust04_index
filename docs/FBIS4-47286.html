Pakhomov, Institute of High Temperatures of  the USSR Academy of Sciences; UDC 666.762.6.017:537.311.3]    [Abstract] Cerium dioxide-tantalum oxide ceramic material  was studied to determine the combined effects of a gaseous  atmosphere and the tantalum oxide alloy on its electrical  conductivity. More than 99.8% pure cerium dioxide and  tantalum  oxide powders were mixed to form compositions in which the  proportion of tantalum oxide was 0.5, 2.3, or 5%. The  powders  were then briquetted, fired at 1870C for 5 h to synthesize  a solid solution, and re- pulverized to obtain fractions from  0.65 to less than 0.05 mm. Bar-shaped specimens 7 x 7 x 70 mm  were compacted at 100 N/sq mm from tri-fraction mixtures of the  powders and fired at 1820 K for 6 h. The fired specimens had an  apparent porosity of 18-20% and a total porosity of  20-22%.  Electrical conductivity was measured with four PR-30  platinum-rhodium probes utilizing direct current. In the first  series of tests, the specimens were exposed to atmospheric air,  and in the next series of tests, to an atmosphere of combustion  products created by igniting propane in oxygen at air-fuel  ratios of 0.7, 0.9, and 1.2. It was found that alloying cerium  dioxide with tantalum oxide greatly increases the material's  conductivity in air (to the solid solution saturation point).  Unalloyed cerium dioxide ceramics exposed to combustion products  have a much higher electrical conductivity than those exposed to  atmospheric air. Moreover, the lower the air-fuel ratio, the  higher the conductivity. Alloying cerium dioxide lowers the  sensitivity of the conductivity of this material to the  composition of the gaseous atmosphere of combustion products,  especially for saturated solutions of tantalum oxide in cerium  oxide.

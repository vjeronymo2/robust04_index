			<p>BFN     [Text] London, 16 May (INA) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister  Mr. Tariq 'Aziz said political pressures imposed on the UN  Special Committee and the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] had prevented them from informing the Security Council of  Iraq's compliance with Resolution 687.    In statements to the BBC correspondent in New York, Mr.  'Aziz  added that without those pressures, the Special Committee and  the IAEA would have a long time before conveyed this view to the  Security Council.    Mr. 'Aziz added that the political attitudes of France,  Russia and China toward Iraq are clear and had acknowledged the  realities concerning Iraq's application of the Security Council  resolution.    Mr. 'Aziz pointed out that the United States and Britain  maintain anti-Iraq political stances contributing not to  acknowledge these realities.    Mr. 'Aziz said text of Resolution 687 is an important issue  and is considered essential by the West and that is why the West  made row when it thought that Iraq does not comply to the  resolution articles but when it has become clear that Iraq is  fully complying with the resolution, the West started to say  that that is not important and such affair reflects a clear  contradiction.    Mr. 'Aziz said we still say to the Security Council that it  should respect its resolution otherwise this would harm the  legal and moral credibility of its resolutions.</p>

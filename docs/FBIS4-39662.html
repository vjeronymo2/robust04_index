			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" from speech by Ukrainian President Leonid </F> Kravchuk at the Ukrainian Supreme Council plenary session in  Kiev on 2 June 1994]    [Text] Esteemed people's deputies!    In my address to the Supreme Council, to you, I outlined my  arguments regarding the June elections. Today, as well as  yesterday, while analyzing the debate held here, I had the  impression that the emphasis was only on the first argument,  namely, the one concerning the need to postpone the elections.  However, another important argument, that if the Supreme  Council adopts appropriate laws, clarifications, the elections  will have to be held, was not analyzed. I am not calling from  this rostrum not to hold the elections. I have said, and I am  still saying, and my viewpoint is that the elections should be  held. They should be held, however, only if the legislative  basis is adjusted to them. This is my position, and it is based  on my conviction that otherwise we will completely lose control  over the authorities.    If the elections are held without changing and amending the  Constitution and laws, if the powers of local authorities are  not precisely defined, we will have an uncontrolled situation, a  total disarray of the Executive Branch. This is not simply a  threat, but based on the experience of happened in 1990.  Regarding the presidential office, it was introduced not simply  because someone wanted it, but because the situation demanded  it. This is first.    Second, if you carefully read the law on reforming local  authorities and self-government, adopted by the previous Supreme  Council, you will find a definition of the presidential office.  I recall how your predecessors were cleansing this law, and how  they did not want that such an office exist.    Suddenly, later, there was talk that the president must be  elected.    Thus, I am asking you one simple and clear question: If this  law entrusts the government with everything, what role is  assigned to the president?    If the president is elected universally with these powers,  and I see that there will be no other case, we will have in Kiev  the president, the head of the state and the head of the  executive authority, and we will lack of any presidential  influence in the regions.    I am saying this to coordinate these issues.    If the Supreme Council really wants Ukraine to remain an  independent, manageable, sovereign, and democratic state, as has  been stated here, then, while adopting the resolution regarding  the 26 June elections, or confirming it, the parliament must  assume responsibility for preparation and adoption of the  appropriate documents by 26 June. This should be written down  in a resolution, the draft of which envisions that documents  defining, in particular, the powers of the Ukrainian president,  will be submitted by 12 June.    The powers of the Ukrainian president are defined by the  Constitution, and you will not change them by any law, whether  you want this or not. The Constitution must be changed. Is  this realistically possible? If such a possibility do exist,  let us do that. I support this. Moreover, I was the first to  support a clear division of powers. The draft constitution, at  my proposal, was amended with this very provision concerning the  division of powers of the head of state and the head of  Executive Branch. Yet, this must now be added to the current  Constitution.    I would therefore like to refute any insinuations that  someone wants to preserve himself in office, that the president  signed the electoral law alone. But after that, the president  submitted to the Supreme Council draft legislation concerning  reorganization of governmental power.    You, speaking from this rostrum, insisted that it was not  expedient to adopt them. Everything was written down clearly:  Who is the president, what is the government, what is the  judicial authority, and what is the Supreme Council. Nobody  would have played a game of war anymore. You did not want it!  A very interesting thesis recently appeared: Apparently, there  is only one thing to be done, the law has to be changed that an  oblast head be elected by deputies, and seemingly, everything  will be fine.    But I am asking you, if an oblast head is elected by  deputies, will the government be able to dismiss him? No. Will  the president be able to do that? No. I have currently three  times as much power vis-a-vis the Crimean president, as the  newly elected president will have regarding an oblast or rayon  head.    I am asking these questions, being led by my current  feelings. Someone does not like the president standing here. I  would like the president to be elected without ruining the state  and the executive authority, that he be elected legitimately,  consistently, and without insinuations that, apparently, we are  currently resorting to legal cases because, apparently, people  want this. Tomorrow, when everything collapses, the same people  will come here, to the Supreme Council, and they will say that  there are no pensions and other things, because there will be no  money for the budget. Who will answer these questions and how?    I am saying, if we are to establish authorities, if are to  establish new authorities, then let us establish it in a manner  enabling it to work.    I repeat, the authority we are to elect will not work, and  if  it does work, it will have no control, given these laws. I do  not want to be a prophet, as the saying goes, "in my own  fatherland," but you will see a situation within a certain  period. You will see and then speak out. Thus, I want us to  approach this issue in a responsible manner.    If the Supreme Council drafts the appropriate laws, if it  places all emphasis on the law adopted by your predecessors,  there will be no doubt: I will support the elections, I will  support holding such elections.    Thus, my position on the local elections is clear.    Here is my second position, on the presidential election.  The current status of the president is defined in the  Constitution. If the president is elected according to this,  then, believe me, no Supreme Council will be able to strip him  of any power after he goes through all that torment. There is  talk that these issues can be resolved in a referendum. This is  interesting logic. We will first elect the president with  powers in June, and in September we will hold a referendum on  the question of which powers should we take away from him. So,  what do we finally want? We only want to voice slogans. This  is unrealistic.    Once again, I am calling on you, for you will bear the  greatest responsibility. I want everyone to know that, because  the presidential campaign has already begun. I am a  presidential candidate, you were elected by the people. There  is a legitimate, constitutional Supreme Council, though  incomplete, since a third of deputies are not here, 9 million  voters are not represented in the Supreme Council.  Nevertheless, you are the legitimate, constitutional Supreme  Council, and you bear the greatest responsibility for a way we  will form the government. History must know of this. What sort  of government we will form is the exclusive provenance of the  Supreme Council. Any political passions, any insinuations --  who wants what and how -- must be rejected if we really love  Ukraine.    I want us to establish strong executive authorities,  legitimate legislative authorities, and the president with  precise and clear powers. If we do that, there will be a need  to go to the polls on 26 June. It does not matter who will win.  I have never objected to that.</p>

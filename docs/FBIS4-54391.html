			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- The leaderships of the two  major political powers, the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) and  the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), today discussed the future  of the cabinet, their representatives said today at their  regular weekly news briefings. "The time of waiting and  half-way measures is running out," said BSP deputy floor leader  Georgi Pirinski, voicing his party's stand. BSP expects that  the prime minister's ideas about cabinet changes would become  clear by the end of the week. "The cabinet should go instead of  reshuffling," said SDS leader Filip Dimitrov.    According to BSP analyses, confrontation in society has been  further exacerbated, yet Bulgaria has the real chances of  stabilizing its law and order and its foreign economic  relations. The Socialists have not changed their demands to the  Cabinet; yet they have never raised the issue of the restoration  of ministries or reinstatement of persons. "Structural and  personnel changes lie within Prime Minister Berov's own  discretion," Mr. Pirinski said. In his view, Mr. Berov has not  shown he is decisive enough to "make a U-turn in the cabinet's  performance." BSP set several demands to the government:  resumption of political dialogue with the trade unions,  stabilization of the national budget, setting in motion  structural adjustment, unblocking privatization, etc. "Unless  Mr. Berov makes his ideas clear by the end of the week, BSP will  reconsider its stand," the Socialists said at their news  conference.    Later in the day, Socialists' leaders held an unscheduled  meeting with Prime Minister Berov, national television reported  in its main newscast.    "The prime minister alone can say how far things have been  specified with him. I can't say that because what is going on  now is a change in his notions, frame of mind and intentions.  There will be continuous changes in the coming days and weeks,  they will be exceedingly vigorous," BSP leader Zhan Videnov told  a TV interviewer. The government Press Office specified that  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov will address parliament tomorrow [27  April].    SDS leader Filip Dimitrov described the intended cabinet  changes as "the latest trick of anti-national behaviour on the  part of the communist parliamentary majority." At a regular  meeting today, the SDS top leadership considered its reaction  which will depend on whether the cabinet changes will be  introduced before parliament on Wednesday or not. Mr. Dimitrov,  however, did not specify the strategies adopted.    The parliamentary New Union for Democracy (SDS expellees and  defectors) and the MP's of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights  and Freedoms (DPS) today met to discuss the intended policy  which Prime Minister Berov is expected to set forth before  parliament tomorrow, as well as his concept of structural  cabinet changes.    The two factions agreed that no structural and personnel  changes are necessary until parliament's Easter recess, said the  spokesman for the parliamentary DPS Yunal Lyutfi. During and  after the recess, the two factions will continue their  consultations with Prime Minister Berov on the government's  programme and the need of personnel and structural cabinet  changes.    The forthcoming structural changes in the cabinet were  discussed today by Prime Minister Berov with Mr. Aleksandur  Tomov, leader of the Civil Alliance for the Republic (a radical  movement which broke away from the BSP), national radio  reported. Mr. Tomov said that certain political forces should  not take advantage of the grave economic situation to put  pressure on the government. According to him, in order to avoid  a power vacuum and an economic collapse, political forces must  reach a consensus on the changes needed by Prof. Berov's cabinet.</p>

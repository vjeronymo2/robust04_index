			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Leeds up despite margin pressure Leeds Group, the West Yorkshire-based textile dyer and printer, lifted profits by 17 per cent and sales by 21 per cent in its first half. 'We have managed to wring some growth out of pretty challenging market conditions,' said Mr Robert Wade, chairman. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 3.41m in the six months to March 31, on turnover ahead from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 26.4m. Mr Wade said the UK high street fashion business had been under constant price pressure. Continental Europe had been at a low ebb since the autumn, making trading tough in the Benelux countries, Germany and France. But while many continental competitors were losing money, the group's transfer printing business in the Netherlands, acquired last year, was trading profitably. Margins were also under pressure, from increased prices for both wool and cotton and demands for extended credit. However, the group had attained across the board cuts of at least 5 per cent from its dye wares and chemicals suppliers. The group, which makes most of its money through commission business, had succeeded in reducing its dependence on clothing by going for curtain and upholstery business. The outcome included Pounds 332,000 (Pounds 385,000) of business interruption insurance following a fire at a factory in November 1992. Earnings rose from 7.2p to 8p. The interim dividend is increased from 1.83p to 2.1p.</p>

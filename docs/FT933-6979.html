			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / US begins airdrop of food on besieged Mostar US AIRCRAFT late last night began dropping food into the southern Bosnian city of Mostar, according to US airforce officials. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees had earlier called on the western allies to organise rapid airdrops of food into the city, where some 55,000 Moslems have been trapped for more than two months. The UN appeal came as opposition to international peace proposals appeared to be mounting after leaders of the Moslem-led Bosnian government lambasted the plan to divide their republic. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, denounced the proposed map put forward last week at the Geneva peace talks for 'rewarding the aggressor, and punishing the victim'. The plan is due to be debated by the Bosnian assembly later this week. Speaking on behalf of Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, Mr Silajdzic said it was unlikely an agreement would be accepted unless there were big concessions. But in an attempt to step up pressure on his Moslem adversaries, the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, reiterated warnings that if the Bosnians rejected the deal, they would face more war. However, Mr Miro Lazovic, speaker of Bosnia's parliament, dismissed the need to endorse the proposals by the August 30 deadline set by the peace envoys, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg. Rebel Bosnian Croats also rejected international protectorate status for Mostar envisaged by the peace plan, instead declaring the city the capital of a Croat republic. They later weakened their stance, saying they would accept a two-year EC mandate. Meanwhile, UN efforts to take an aid convoy into Mostar failed when Croat forces refused to let it into the east of the city. In an effort to break the deadlock, the Moslem forces in Mostar, under pressure from the UN, agreed to an exchange of bodies with the Croats. Under the agreement, the UN convoy will provide aid to both the Moslem-controlled east side of Mostar and the Croat-held west side at noon GMT today. The bodies of nine Croat soldiers will be swapped for those of 15 Moslem dead. A UN protection forces spokesman in Zagreb said that fighting was continuing yesterday between Croat and Moslem forces around Mostar. Amid mounting outrage over the fate of Mostar, Washington continued to raise the tone of its warnings to the Croats. US officials have said the air strike warning issued by Nato applied not only to Serbs besieging Sarajevo but to other groups preventing delivery of aid.

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAKING MUSIC IS A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE FOR THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY CHORALE  </P> <P> Margaret and Bob Rouse, both 67, have been married for 43 years. They met  nearly half a century ago at Colorado Springs High School. Margaret had the  lead role in Gilbert and Sullivan's "H.M.S. Pinafore." Bob was a string bass  player in the orchestra.  </P> <P> They loved music then -- and still do.  </P> <P> "Our music is a strong bond," Margaret said. And as members of the San Fernando  Valley Chorale, the Van Nuys couple eagerly attend choral rehearsals each week  at Our Saviour's Lutheran Church in Granada Hills.  </P> <P> "When spouses go out separately, there can be a degree of resentment," Bob  said. "But we go out to rehearsals together. It brings us closer."  </P> <P> Every Tuesday evening, the Rouses blend their voices with about 30 other  Chorale singers. Their repertoire includes a variety of music -- classical,  liturgical, comedy, folk, motion picture themes, and of course, those  ever-popular Broadway hits.  </P> <P> The Rouses agree that the Chorale brings them a sense of accomplishment,  relaxation and pleasure. Making music is fun.  </P> <P> Since 1974, the Chorale has provided the opportunity for such qualities to  dozens of non-professionals -- singers of all ages and from all walks of life.  Started by John Ellis, who also founded the Burbank Civic Light Opera in 1950,  the Chorale has, over the years, made appearances throughout the Valley and Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> There have been performances at convalescent homes, hospitals, meetings of  civic organizations, churches and shopping malls. The group also has performed  on a couple of occasions at the Music Center of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion  and has regularly appeared at the Hall of Liberty in Forest Lawn with the Los  Angeles Solo Repertory Orchestra.  </P> <P> The Chorale has also performed with the Highland Park Symphony Orchestra and  the Korean Philharmonic Orchestra.  </P> <P> For Chorale members like Carl Frain, 63, who served as the group's first  president, it is the thrill of performing that keeps him coming back year after  year.  </P> <P> "When I was young, I thought I might be a Big Band singer -- me and everyone  else," Frain reminisced. "In high school, I sang and acted. I've been singing  all my life. There's nothing better to do than sing."  </P> <P> On occasion, Frain did sing professionally, but his chief occupation was as a  machinist.  </P> <P> When he suffered two strokes two years ago, getting back to the Chorale served  as a powerful incentive to recover. "I was singing within three or four  months," he said. "When I got back into singing, it was good exercise. Like  sports, your muscles build up. As soon as I got back, it helped me vocally."  </P> <P> Joining the Chorale is relatively painless, said President Ron Blair.  Interested vocalists simply show up at one of the rehearsals and start singing  with the group.  </P> <P> After three rehearsals, the prospective member can meet with the director, who  has the power to accept the newcomer or not. More often than not, he or she is  welcomed.  </P> <P> Over the years, a few people have been turned away, however. And some have been  accepted who dropped out later. Blair remembers one man who had difficulty  blending with the group. "He sang like he was in a bar," Blair recalled,  laughing. "Eventually, he did quit."  </P> <P> Besides attending weekly rehearsals, participants are required to meet a  performance dress code and pay yearly dues of $50, which are used to offset the  group's expenses, including payments to the Chorale's director and accompanist.  </P> <P> Although joining is simple, in recent years, keeping the nonprofit group alive  has been a challenge.  </P> <P> A major difficulty has been finances. When the Chorale was started in 1974, it  was sponsored by Los Angeles' Bureau of Music and received municipal funding.  However, in July, 1986, the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department cut off the  city's assistance. This resulted in a crunch for the Chorale, since its annual  operating budget is between $4,000 and $6,000.  </P> <P> To make ends meet, the group raises funds with regularly scheduled concerts and  occasional special fund-raisers, and solicits donations from friends. Last  summer they held a garage sale.  </P> <P> "We're running on a shoestring," Blair said. They are actively seeking a  sponsor, he said.  </P> <P> Besides the financial problems, the Chorale recently faced another obstacle. In  December, 1987, Robert Mantzke, the Chorale's popular director since 1984, died  of cancer.  </P> <P> To keep things running smoothly, the Chorale's board appointed member Margaret  Blair interim director -- a move that made some members unhappy. "Maybe they  weren't comfortable having a woman as a director," Ron Blair (no relation)  said, "even though she was qualified."  </P> <P> A division within the group ensued. In January, 1988, about 20 members decided  to leave the Chorale to start a separate singing group.  </P> <P> The schism added to the already low spirits of the Chorale. Yet, determined to  prevail, in July, 1988, they selected Conrad Immel as a new director, and a new  era began.  </P> <P> As a Fulbright scholar, Immel had studied in Vienna and Italy before launching  an eight-year operatic career in Germany and Austria. He has a master's degree  in music literature and a bachelor's degree in voice from the University of  Texas in Austin, and was an assistant professor of vocal arts at the USC for  four years.  </P> <P> Immel says that his standards are high, but that members of the Chorale share  his enthusiasm for quality work. "My philosophy is that anything worth doing is  worth doing well," he said. "With an amateur group, it just takes a little  longer. Excellence in this type of situation is something worth striving for."  </P> <P> Unlike former directors, Immel dedicates part of each rehearsal session to  actually teaching vocal techniques. But it's not all hard work, he said. "I try  to be funny," he said with a chuckle.  </P> <P> More important, he views the group as an outlet for creative expression and  values its continued existence. "With TV and records, it is really easy to slip  into the mode of letting other people make music," Immel said. "The Chorale  provides members with the opportunity to sing great music from their heart and  soul. It's an opportunity to project their emotion, and when they perform, to  move other people, too. They are able to create a real special sense with the  audience."  </P> <P>  The San Fernando Valley Chorale presents two major concerts each year. On May  21, it will perform at 3 p.m. at Our Saviour's Lutheran Church, 16603 San  Fernando Mission Blvd., Granada Hills. Admission is by donation.

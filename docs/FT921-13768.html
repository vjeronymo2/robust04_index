			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Observer: Green . . . with envy Next June's Earth Summit in Brazil, billed as humanity's last chance to avert ecological catastrophe, already promises to be a diplomatic disaster. The pressing problem, it seems, is not surplus of toxins but shortage of bedrooms. Of the 41 nations to request accommodation so far, 80 per cent stipulated the same three hotels. So, as befits the new world order, they have gone respectively to the Americans, the Japanese and the Germans, leaving the rest of the world enviously scattered around lesser hotels. The Canadians are not speaking to the Germans, having lost to them in the battle for the Intercontinental even though Canada was the only country to give money for the conference's organisation. Some Canadians suspect their ousting is connected with Chancellor Kohl's Dollars 180m handout towards environment projects in Brazil. No one is speaking to the Americans, who simply faced the Brazilians with the ultimatum: 'Give us what we want or we don't come'. As for the Brits, although 1,994 rooms have now been allocated, the UK delegation still has nowhere to stay. That, say the organisers, is their punishment for wanting all 160 members of the party to be in suites. But it might also strike at least four of them - Premier John Major and three other ministers - as scant reward for Britain's being the earliest country to request accommodation in the first place.</p>

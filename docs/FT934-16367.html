			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Breda finance unit to be put in liquidation FINBREDA, the quoted finance company of the Breda group and part of Efim, the state-run industrial holding company, is to be placed in liquidation following the announcement of a loss of L232bn (Dollars 146m) in the first half of this year on top of 1992 losses of L359bn. The company said the losses were mainly due to financial charges relating to defence subsidiaries Oto Melara and Breda Meccanica Bresciana. The move forms part of the overall liquidation of Efim set in motion in July 1992. The defence units are being merged with Finmeccanica, the engineering arm of state-owned IRI.</p>

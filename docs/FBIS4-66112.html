			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Previti Finds `Sympathy and </F> Encouragement'"]    [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, May 24 -- Italian Defence Minister  Cesare Previti said he had found nothing but "sympathy and  encouragement" for Italy's international role -- especially its  support for the Bosnian mission -- during his NATO debut at a  defence ministers' get-together due to end tomorrow.    After transmitting his message of utmost continuity in  Italy's foreign affairs, and its willingness to play a bigger  role in peacekeeping operations, Previti said he had found "no  prejudice, and no reservations, whether covert or overt", in his  meetings here.    Previti echoed Foreign Minister Antonio Martino in  Washington  in stressing that Italy wants an "appropriate involvement" in  political and military decision-making if it is to take on any  larger role: a fact that was recognised by U.S. Defence  Secretary William Perry.    He reiterated Italy's willingness to send peacekeepers to  Bosnia, on three conditions -- "if the UN Security Council so  requests, if it is a case of implementing a peace plan, and if  all the sides in question have agreed to that plan" -- and added  that Italy is also willing to take part in a possible aid  operation in Rwanda "if the UN asks us, and in forms that will  have to be agreed".    In talks with British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and  German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe he examined industrial and  technological cooperation. NATO's supreme European commander  George Joulwan expressed gratitude for Italy's loan of air bases  for operations in former Yugoslavia.</p>

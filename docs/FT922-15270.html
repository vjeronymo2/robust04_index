			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Fast talk needed to explain extent of problems MYSTERY shrouds the recent and rapid decline of MTM, the speciality chemicals group and former glamour stock and MTM and its advisers have some explaining to do if they are to save the company. They will have to do it fast. Following the group's admission that it had breached its covenants, its bankers yesterday gave the company a stay of execution of only 30 days. Before those 30 days expire, MTM and its advisers will have to explain to the bankers the full extent of its predicament. In addition, the group, together with the Postern Executive Group, its newly appointed corporate management specialists, will have to demonstrate how it can escape its present plight. It must also grapple with certain questionable transactions that appear to have taken place last year. The extent of MTM's difficulties will remain obscure until it publishes its long-delayed audited full-year figures. The present crisis was triggered when MTM's auditors, BDO Binder Hamlyn, refused to sign off the company's results last month. They disputed the way MTM appeared to have valued its assets. The way MTM capitalised interest on construction projects was also questioned. Staff at MTM said that although the auditors had signed off the previous year's accounts - which used similar methods - this year the accountants at BDO Binder Hamlyn were less willing to sanction such methods for two reasons. First, the Leeds BDO Binder Hamlyn office conducting the audit was under pressure from its London headquarters to be stringent following corporate crashes which had involved lax accounting procedures. Second, although such methods had been used before by MTM, they had not been used on such a scale. Staff say that Mr Richard Lines, the company's founder and executive chairman, was under pressure to achieve a profits forecast of Pounds 23m last month when the group was to publish its full-year figures. If MTM could not achieve that total, the recent Pounds 62m acquisition of Hardwicke, paid for by a rights issue, would dilute earnings. This would have undermined the group's ability to return to the City for cash. Insiders say the accounting methods, which were eventually challenged by the auditors, were required to ensure the company reached that magic Pounds 23m figure. Analysts now believe profits could be as low as Pounds 10m. Once the asset values were challenged, the group's financial position rapidly unravelled. MTM's breaching of its banking covenants was a direct consequence of the auditors' decision to challenge its asset values. With debts of about Pounds 70m, MTM's covenants were dependent on certain debt and assets ratios. The covenants were also dependent on certain income-to-debt ratios. Analysts fear that if they have underestimated the company's debts, MTM may also not have the income required by the covenants. The most pressing problem facing MTM is debt reduction. Mr Alasdair Nisbet, chemicals analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, believes the company will have to make disposals, probably Hardwicke. In the short-term, the company would be unable to raise money through a rights issue because of the stock's low share price. 'If you ask the question whether MTM is going to file for receivership, the answer is probably not yet,' says Mr Nisbet. 'But the management will have to take some hard decisions pretty quickly if the group is going to survive.' Meanwhile, questions remain about how MTM managed to reach such a desperate position. Whether the report, prepared by BDO Binder Hamlyn for MTM's audit board, will be sufficient for critics remains to be seen. The MTM mystery will clearly take time to decipher.</p>

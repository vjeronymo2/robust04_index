			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 4 JAPANESE BANKS' RATINGS DROP  </P> <P> Moody's Investors Service today downgraded the debt ratings of four major  Japanese banks, citing concern about profitability and asset quality,  particularly in real estate loan portfolios.  </P> <P> Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. were lowered to AA-1 from AAA,  while Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. was downgraded to A-1 from AA-2 and  Tokai Bank Ltd. was lowered to AA-3 from AA-2.  </P> <P> Moody's noted that Sumitomo remains Japan's most profitable bank. It praised  Mitsubishi's conservative management, Long-Term Credit Bank's strong fee-based  businesses and Tokai's solid base in and around the city of Nagoya, in central  Japan.  </P> <P> But the agency said it is concerned about the banks' exposure to loans in a  soft real estate market, their need to restructure assets and their ability to  compete as interest rates are deregulated.  </P></p>

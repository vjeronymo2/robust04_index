This was shown during the visit by U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher to Beijing. The way the communists  deal with people who think differently, who have different ideas  and are rebellious, who want independent trade unions and demand  freedom of speech and of the press, the uncomfortable people who  face up to the state and are therefore removed from circulation  -- allegedly, this was the most important issue on the human  rights agenda that the U.S. chief diplomat broached in Beijing.    In fact, however, this is not true. By publicly insisting on  the observance of international norms also in dealing with  dissidents, the U.S. secretary of state mainly had an eye on his  own audience in Washington. Congress and the Senate have linked  trade and customs preferences via the most-favored-nation clause  with better treatment of political prisoners, with visits to  prisons, with stopping the production of goods for the U.S.  market manufactured by prisoners in labor camps, with questions  of the immigration of Chinese refugees, and with improvements in  the situation in Tibet.    The U.S. Administration, which has landed in a dead end with  its policy toward China, is now desperately trying to sell the  skeptical Congress the claim that, at least in some areas, the  human rights situation in China has improved over the previous  year--because the United States needs China as a market. In  China, Boeing is struggling against Airbus, the powerful U.S.  telecommunications corporations are struggling against Siemens.  Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler are competitors for a planned truck  factory in Guangdong. Mercedes-Benz has even involved Chancellor  Kohl in this project. Unexpectedly, German Foreign Minister  Kinkel will soon go to Beijing again and, as one has heard,  prepare a trip to Germany by head of government Li Peng, because  the Chinese head of government will come to Bonn as the  chancellor's guest before the Bundestag elections. Japan's Prime  Minister Hosokawa has announced his visit to Beijing for next  week, and France's Balladur will visit China in April.    Thus, the Americans rightly fear that Europeans and Japanese  might compete with them for positions in China. This is  particularly the case if the abolition of the  most-favored-nation clause leads to a boycott of U.S. companies.  However, the United States also needs the government in Beijing  as a global player in the conflict settlement in the UN Security  Council and as a security partner in Asia. In addition, the  U.S. consumer would be punished if Chinese goods were burdened  with penal duties. From the U.S. point of view, there are far  more important issues than human rights. It is just that they  are not mentioned so much.    "Common global and regional interests" determine the U.S.  relationship with China. This is how Christopher summed up his  talks in China. Regarding the way it deals with dissidents,  China is prepared only for cosmetic corrections. It is  unrealistic to expect anything else.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / More complaints against brokers COMPLAINTS about securities and futures brokers increased slightly last year, according to a report published today. Nevertheless, the complaints bureau of the Securities and Futures Association, the self-regulatory organisation for the industry formed a year ago by the merger of two other watchdogs, was given a clean bill of health by the first annual report of its complaints commissioner. The report shows that 1,206 complaints were received by the SFA. Of those, 73 should have been made direct to the Stock Exchange, leaving a total of 1,133, compared with 1,115 in 1990 and 1,025 in 1989. Complaints were made against 158 firms, 11.4 per cent of the SFA's membership of 1,380. In 1990 complaints were received against 9.5 per cent of the previous regulator's membership.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reckitt &amp; Colman rises to Pounds 252.3m - Shares marked down as outcome falls short of market expectations RECKITT &amp; COLMAN, the food and household products group, increased pre-tax profits last year, helped by the Pounds 713m acquisition of Boyle-Midway in 1990. Pre-tax profits, at Pounds 252.3m, were up 7.3 per cent from 1990's figure of Pounds 235.2m. However, the results were slightly below market expectations and the shares fell 6p to 640p. Sir Michael Colman, chairman, said that Boyle-Midway, which makes household and hair-removing products, paid for itself in 1991 even after an increase in interest charges. The net interest bill rose from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 40.3m, reflecting a full year of Boyle-Midway. Fully diluted earnings per share, however, showed minimal progress to 40.77p (40.22p). Sir Michael said that the group had spent more heavily on marketing its brands. He said that 80 per cent of the Pounds 101.9m increase in distribution costs to Pounds 615.1m was attributable to increased marketing costs. A final dividend of 9.55p is recommended to give a total of 15.1p (13.6p). Sir Michael said that the rise of 11 per cent compared to inflation of about 4 per cent and the group's aim was to maintain a realistic progression in the dividend. Sales increased by 12.7 per cent to Pounds 1.99bn while trading profits were almost 16 per cent higher at Pounds 292.6m. Margins were helped by savings made through the integration of Boyle-Midway and a reorganisation of European manufacturing facilities. Mr Vernon Sankey, who took over as chief executive in January, said that both the household and toiletry and pharmaceutical divisions were core to the business. Household and toiletry trading profits rose by 28 per cent and margins were up from 14.2 to 14.9 per cent. Pharmaceutical profits were hardly changed at Pounds 40m and margins fell from 25.4 to 23.8 per cent as the division was affected by recession in its main markets. The food division increased trading profits by 6 per cent to Pounds 57.4m while margins rose from 10.7 to 11.1 per cent, still well below the group average. Trading profits from other activities fell from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 8.8m although this partly reflected the sale of the fine art and graphics business in 1990. After a slightly lower tax rate at 32.6 per cent, there was Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 4.86m) of interest on the group's convertible bonds, which it regards as equity rather than debt. The balance sheet had net debt of Pounds 338.3m at the year-end, a fall of Pounds 19.5m. Shareholders' funds were up from Pounds 636.1m to Pounds 719.6m. Mr Iain Dobbie, finance director, said the group preferred to look at interest cover on debt rather than gearing. Interest cover was 7.3 times, or 5.3 times if the interest on the convertible bonds is included, levels with which the group was comfortable. See Lex</p>

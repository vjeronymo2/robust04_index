			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the criteria are met, HCFA or the State may continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments to a facility with deficiencies that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute an immediate and serious threat for up to 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months from the last day of the survey. If the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not correct deficiencies by the end of the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified, HCFA would_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Terminate the provider agreement for Medicare SNFs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Discontinue FFP to the State for Medicaid NFs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State may terminate the provider agreement for NFs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed that the required termination notice would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be sent 15 days before the end of the 6-month period, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the notice period would run concurrently with the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 days of the 6-month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare SNFs and dually participating facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely affected by the requirement to repay to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government all payments received if corrective action is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken could appeal the decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 16. Resolution of Differences in Findings and Recommended Remedies Between State and HCFA for non-State operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid Facilities and Dually Participating Facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 1919(h) (6) and (7) of the Act set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special rules for when the State and Secretary do not agree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on findings of noncompliance, timing of termination or where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies overlap. To implement these provisions, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in &sect;488.234 that, if HCFA finds that a non State-operated NF or a dually participating facility has met all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, but the State survey agency finds that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility has not met all requirements and the failure does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents, the State survey agency's finding will control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (proposed &sect;488.234(a)(1)). In this instance the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification of noncompliance would control. The dually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating facility would have its hearing rights met  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the procedures set forth at 42 CFR part 498. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-State operated NF would have its hearing rights met  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the procedures set forth at 42 CFR part 431. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA finds that a NF or a dually participating facility has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not met all requirements and the failure does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents, but the State survey agency has not made such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding, HFCA's finding could control. In this case, HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would impose the remedies and would permit the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue payments to the facility during the correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period (proposed &sect;488.234(a) (2) and (3)). These provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify the means to determine compliance or noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Medicaid NF which will then, by virtue of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(8) of the Act, become the compliance/noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision for the Medicare SNF. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Ambassador 'Abdallah 'Abdallah and </F> Israeli Ambassador David Sason by unidentified correspondent; in  Athens on 25 February -- in English with Greek subtitles]    [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Ambassador, Greece now holds the  presidency of the European Union. What can it do to help the  Palestinian people after such a sad event?    ['Abdallah] Greece, as the president of the European Union,  must press hard for the international protection of Palestinians  and the occupied areas in the face of the Israeli aggression,  official and by the settlers. Second, Greece, as president of  the European Union, can also press for the immediate  implementation of the Declaration of Principles and immediate  withdrawal of Israeli forces and a dismantlement of the  settlements which are time bombs that threaten both Israelis and  Palestinians alike.    [Correspondent] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias is going  to visit the Middle East next week. What does he have to say to  the Israelis?    ['Abdallah] I hope he will tell them that Israel cannot work  for peace and at the same time arm its settlers to murder  Palestinians. This is against peace and not the way that would  bring about tranquility and stability in the region.    [Correspondent] Mr. Ambassador, yesterday you were telling  us  that Greece can contribute a lot to the peace process. Now,  after such a sad event, what can we do?    [Sason] Well, I do believe that Greece, like all the other  countries in the world, can contribute by convincing the Arab  people, the extremists and the Palestinian themselves to reduce  the tension. To understand that this is the act of a saboteur,  an extremist one. That it is not something that was planned,  guided by the State of Israel. It was an act that was done in  order to provoke the peace process. So, all of us are almost  obliged to try to reduce the terminology, to try and to speak in  minor tones, about this incident, which is a very sad one.</p>

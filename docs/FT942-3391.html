			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Stoppage could lead to penalty for company The strike by railway signalmen represents the first serious challenge to the new structure which is being fashioned from the framework of British Rail. It also constitutes a considerable personal test for Mr Robert Horton, chairman of Railtrack. Mr Horton, who left British Petroleum with a formidable reputation for toughness, has to show that he can create a more modern railway. Under British Rail, the internal pressures on the negotiators to keep the trains running while giving away as little as possible would have been strong. But under the newly decentralised railway system which is being created, these pressures have been made more acute. If Railtrack, set up on April 1 to take over BR's track, signalling and stations, fails to provide a working railroad it must compensate the train operating companies. A failure to keep the trains running puts direct financial pressures on a company which hopes to achieve a stock market flotation before the next election. Railtrack is unfortunate to have inherited a dispute which has been simmering for seven years. It is difficult to say whether BR would have handled the present dispute any differently - striking railmen brought BR services to a halt in April 1993 - but in the 2 1/2 months since its creation Railtrack has established a reputation for driving a hard bargain. The train operating companies have complained that Railtrack has negotiated tough terms in its access contracts. Some have said that the penalties on Railtrack for failing to keep lines open are too light. According to the RMT, Railtrack has adopted a similarly tough approach to its industrial relations. Discussions with the unions - formal negotiations were not begun, it insisted - were handled by a four-person team led by Mr Chris Leah, director of Railtrack's north-west zone. Mr Leah, 46, was previously BR's north-west regional director. Behind Railtrack's industrial relations team, however, stand Mr Horton and his board. Mr Horton acquired a formidable reputation during his 35 years at BP for cutting the fat out of the businesses he ran. But a sharp decline in profits during the recession and an acquired reputation for arrogance prompted his fellow directors to cast him out. On arriving at Railtrack Mr Horton was keen to allay fears that he would prove a second Doctor Beeching, the British Railways chairman who made swingeing cuts to the network in the 1960s. Speaking just before the formal launch of Railtrack on April 1, Mr Horton described the rail network as 'a priceless national asset which we have jolly well got to make good use of'. But it is clear that the modernisation of Railtrack's part of the old BR will involve a tough approach to cost-cutting. One priority is reducing the Pounds 1.8bn annual cost of maintaining the rail network. Altering railway practices which have become entrenched over the 47 years of government ownership will take time and Mr Horton said he did not expect to make big changes in the first year of the new management. But the challenge posed by the signalmen may mean that decisions may have to be taken far sooner than expected.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: QVC adds Dollars 1bn to war-chest for Paramount bid QVC Network, the TV home shopping business, yesterday increased its financial strength in its hostile Dollars 9.6bn bid for Paramount Communications by announcing a further Dollars 1bn equity investment from two media groups, Advance Publications and Cox Enterprises. Each will invest Dollars 500m in QVC common and convertible preferred stock if the QVC bid for Paramount succeeds. Cox owns 18 newspapers, 24 cable TV systems and 19 TV and radio stations. Advance, owned by the Newhouse family, has interests including The New Yorker magazine and the Conde Nast group. QVC, led by Mr Barry Diller, a prominent film industry figure, is competing for Paramount against an agreed bid, currently worth about Dollars 8bn, from cable group Viacom. Its latest move will put more pressure on Viacom to improve its offer. Paramount has agreed to study QVC's bid, but has questioned the company's financial resources. QVC, with revenues of around Dollars 1bn, is smaller than Paramount or Viacom, but has powerful financial allies. When it launched its bid last month, QVC said its two largest corporate shareholders, cable groups Comcast and Liberty Media, had each agreed to invest Dollars 500m in its convertible stock. Last Wednesday, Liberty and its associate, cable group Tele-Communications Inc, agreed to be acquired by local telecoms group Bell Atlantic in a merger that could be worth more than Dollars 20bn. The deal prompted speculation that Mr John Malone, who heads both TCI and Liberty, might be less committed to the QVC bid. However, yesterday's announcement made clear Liberty remained one of QVC's backers, though the terms of its investment, and that of Comcast, have been changed to mirror the Cox and Advance agreements. Each of the four will buy Dollars 250m of QVC common stock at Dollars 60 a share and Dollars 250m of convertible exchangeable preferred stock, carrying 6 per cent dividends and convertible at Dollars 65.45 a share. QVC stock closed on Friday at Dollars 58, up Dollars  1/4.</p>

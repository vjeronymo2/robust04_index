			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Clinton calls for floods rethink THE Clinton administration is urging army engineers and other government agencies to look at different ways of controlling floods as they examine whether to rebuild dams and earthwork levees after this year's inundation of the Mississippi and Missouri river basins. In a memorandum greeted enthusiastically by environmentalist groups, the White House asked agencies to consider 'non-structural alternatives' such as buying up farmland in the river plain to be used as catchment areas for future floods. The White House paper says, however, that the administration does not intend to reject local demands that specific levees be rebuilt. Environmentalist groups, such as American Rivers, have claimed that levees along the Mississippi forced the river higher than it would otherwise have been by denying it natural outlets to swamps and wetlands in the river bottom, and also encouraged people to build in flood-prone areas. Nevertheless, most of the flood-walls and levees built and managed by the federal government, under the auspices of the Army Corps of Engineers, are likely to be rebuilt. Federal levees, which typically protect large urban or industrial areas, are much higher and stronger than private earthworks. Only an estimated 40 per cent of the roughly 500 federal levees in the Mississippi and Missouri basins failed or were topped by this year's record floods, compared with around 85 per cent of private levees. The Corps has already put out tenders for some immediate repair projects, and aims to get as much construction work done as possible before winter. However, federal officials will also insist that many homeowners move to higher ground, leaving their land as a buffer zone for future floods.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETER SELLARS' REMARK  </P> <P> I was appalled when I read "The Artist at the Helm" (Aug. 31), which was about  Los Angeles Festival Director Peter Sellars.  </P> <P> That a public figure would say "it doesn't make you look like a low-IQ retard"  is almost unbelievable. And that his cast giggled in response says a lot about  their IQs.  </P> <P> Sellars, Times staff writer Greg Braxton and The Times editing staff all owe  apologies for having said, written and published this remark.  </P> <P> JOANNE TURNER  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P> <P>  Sellars made the comment in directing the "Nixon in China" cast to actually  converse rather than to mime conversation.  </P> <P> </P></p>

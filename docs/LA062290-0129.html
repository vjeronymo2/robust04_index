			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASD VOWS RULE ON UNEQUAL VOTING  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Securities Dealers Inc. says it will introduce its own  rule to protect corporate stockholders from unequal voting rights if a federal  version remains struck down by the courts.  </P> <P> Last week, a federal appeals court in Washington unanimously held that the  Securities and Exchange Commission exceeded its authority in prohibiting  publicly traded corporations from weakening the voting power of those who  already own stock in the company.  </P> <P> The SEC has yet to say if it will appeal the decision by a three-judge panel of  the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  </P> <P> But Joseph Hardiman, president of the NASD, said if the ruling is upheld "we  will propose a look-alike rule." The NASD is a self-regulating organization  overseeing over-the-counter stocks.  </P></p>

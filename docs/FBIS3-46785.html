(SINOPEC), a company spokesman said Tuesday. A team from Yukong  and a Luoyang design company have begun a feasibility study for  the project, worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, the spokesman said.    The study is scheduled to end in March, and if the result is  favorable Yukong will apply for joint-venture approval from the  Shenzhen authorities and begin construction in the second half  of the year for completion by late 1997, he said.    Yukong and SINOPEC agreed to form a locally incorporated  joint venture capitalized at 375 million dollars, or 25 percent  of the total estimated investment of 1.5 billion dollars. If  the refinery is a success, Yukong hopes to build a plant to  manufacture petrochemical products with the naphtha it produces.    SINOPEC and Yukong will put up 60 percent and 40 percent of  the capital, respectively, and borrow other funds on the  international financial market using the refinery as collateral,  the spokesman said.    Of the petrochemical products, 80 percent will be sold in  China and 20 percent exported to Southeast Asia.</p>

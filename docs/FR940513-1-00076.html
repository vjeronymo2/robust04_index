			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3. Determination of the MACT Floor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The MACT floors were determined for the following types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of operations: Product loading and ballasting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Product loading. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The marine vessel data base is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on throughput data for marine vessel loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminals. The throughput data are divided into crude oil,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline, and 11 other commodity categories. Additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on these data are available in the TSD for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulation (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble). The EPA estimated the emissions of HAP from each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these terminals using these throughput data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporating assumptions about how many of these facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were controlled, and the extent of their control. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions are based on existing Federal and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. For example, benzene loadings are already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled by the benzene NESHAP (40 CFR part 61, subpart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BB). In addition, four States have regulations requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of emissions from marine tank vessel loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations: New Jersey, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California (District regulations). (Additional information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the derivation of the MACT floor is found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;A&hyph;44.) Additional discussion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency's interpretation of the MACT floor is presented in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section J. Solicitation of Comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the approximately 360 terminals estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by the proposed regulation, 43 facilities comprise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the best performing 12 percent of facilities used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculating the MACT floor for terminals emitting over 1 Mg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of HAP emissions. These terminals are subject to State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations in California, New Jersey, and Louisiana.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Averaging the required control levels of these facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in a MACT floor of 93 percent control for facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emitting more than 1 Mg of HAP per year. Although this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived average does not precisely match a control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology, for all practical purposes it is equivalent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction achieved by recovery techniques  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., 95 percent). Additional information on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derivation of the MACT floor may be found in the docket for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposed rulemaking effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 1,440 facilities that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emit less than 1 Mg of HAP emissions annually if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncontrolled. The average control level of the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing 12 percent of facilities is 36 percent control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This control level does not represent an existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology. Therefore using the average of the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing 12 percent is inappropriate for establishing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT floor. Taking the median of the best performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 percent of these sources (94th percentile) results in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control level of zero because the median facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncontrolled. This is a more appropriate portrayal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of control that exists in this subcategory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this level of control (i.e., no control)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents the MACT floor for terminals emitting less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 Mg/yr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MACT floor for new facilities, regardless of size,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a 98-percent overall control of emissions. This control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level represents the best performing similar source. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency will take comment on whether the MACT floor for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources could, consistent with the requirements of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 112(d) of the Act, be equal to a control requirement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 95 percent when a recovery device is used. As discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elsewhere in this preamble, the Agency wishes to encourage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of recovery devices. However, a 95 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction requirement for recovery devices may be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with the requirement of section 112(d)(3) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act that emission standards for new sources shall not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less stringent than the emission control achieved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best controlled similar source. The EPA requests comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on whether the secondary benefits of recovery devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the Administrator with the ability to determine that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a 95 percent reduction requirement for those sources using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery is ``not less stringent'' than a 98 percent reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for all other sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ballasting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  According to the Marine Board report,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most tankships have segregated or clean ballast tanks due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coast Guard regulations and international agreements that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively prohibit ballast emissions from occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Marine Board report was issued in 1987, as older  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels have been retired, the proportion of ``uncontrolled''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels has decreased further. However, the Agency does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have any information available to it to evaluate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of vessels that still emit ballasting emissions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly those vessels that are not in crude oil service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (where the vast majority of ballasting occurs). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator determined that the MACT floor for ballasting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at new or existing sources would be a prohibition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ballasting emissions. The Agency is requesting comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this decision to prohibit ballasting emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Selection of Basis and Level of Proposed MACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Development of Regulatory Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Product loading. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two regulatory alternatives were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed for the subcategory represented by major source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emit less than or equal to 1 Mg of HAP annually. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternatives are summarized in Table 4. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first alternative, Regulatory Alternative A, represents the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT floor of no control. Regulatory Alternative B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents the control of a facility's total HAP throughput  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting in an overall emission reduction of 95 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two regulatory alternatives were considered for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcategory represented by existing facilities emitting more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 1 Mg of HAP per year. Regulatory Alternative A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents the MACT floor level of control (93 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall control). Regulatory Alternative B represents the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of a facility's total HAP throughput to an overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of 95 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are no regulatory alternatives for new facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that exceed the MACT floor of 98 percent control because no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other alternatives that are more stringent than the floor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were considered technically feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHENS WANTS HIM KILLED, SCANDAL FIGURE SAYS  </P> <P> A Greek banking tycoon who has touched off the worst political scandal in his  country's modern history is expected to argue in court papers today that he  should not be extradited to Athens because the government there wants him  killed.  </P> <P> George Koskotas, a former chairman of the Bank of Crete who fled Greece last  November, said in a petition prepared by his lawyers that he has "strong reason  to believe that he would be killed" if U.S. authorities return him to Athens.  </P> <P> Greek authorities have accused Koskotas, 35, of embezzling more than $200  million from his own bank. The banker has admitted skimming funds, but he said  he did so on the orders of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, putting the money  into accounts controlled by officials of Papandreou's ruling PASOK socialist  party.  </P> <P> Koskotas' charges, buttressed by bank records and a tape recording of a  conversation in which Papandreou promised to protect him from prosecution, have  touched off a major political uproar in Greece.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Plot Charged  </P> <P> Papandreou, who faces a national election June 19, has charged that the affair  is part of a U.S.-sponsored plot to bring him down. His government, the most  leftist in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has frequently disagreed  with U.S. policy on terrorism and other issues.  </P> <P> Koskotas, who was arrested by the FBI at Greece's request last year, is being  held in a county jail in Salem, Mass. His lawyers were scheduled to file his  formal response to Greece's extradition request in U.S. District Court in  Boston today. A hearing on the extradition is expected next month -- about the  time of the election in Athens.  </P> <P> "Mr. Koskotas faces a clear and present danger to his physical safety if he is  returned to Greek hands," his lawyers' statement charges. "Violent terrorist  groups openly have stated their intention to assassinate Mr. Koskotas. The  Greek police and security forces through the years have shown themselves to be  singularly incapable of preventing such attacks. . . .  </P> <P> "It can hardly be doubted that Mr. Koskotas -- whose death or disappearance no  doubt would avoid great embarrassment and further political damage to the  ruling party -- cannot expect adequate protection. . . . "  </P> <P> Koskotas' petition also asks the U.S. court to prevent his extradition on the  grounds that the charges against him are political in nature. Under the  U.S.-Greek extradition treaty, the two countries are not bound to turn over  defendants accused of crimes "of a political character."  </P> <P> Greece's most violent leftist terrorist group, the November 17 Revolutionary  Organization, has denounced Koskotas as a "plunderer" and has accused the  government of trying to cover up its complicity in his deeds.  </P></p>

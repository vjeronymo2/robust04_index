			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Arts: Behind the Fringe - Edinburgh International Festival Even in Edinburgh, they cannot control the weather, or perhaps they can. Saturday's steady drizzle gave way to low cloud and a nip in the air yesterday morning. Then suddenly the sun came out for the official opening of the 1993 Festival. Actually the festival with a small 'f' had already started. Fringe productions have been running since early this month. In a relatively new development, there have already been previews in London. It is used to be Edinburgh first, then London. The fringe gets bigger and bigger. Now in its 47th year, it will host a record 1,235 productions with an estimated total of over 12,000 performances at 165 different venues. In 1978 the number of shows was only 472. It is also becoming more professional. The days when any college dramatic society could slum it for a few weeks in Edinburgh seem to be over. When the Red Shift Company is premiering the first stage version of Thomas Mann's Death In Venice, you are up against serious competition. There are as yet no identifiable themes, just oddities. For example, there are four separate productions of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing - a play which is currently going down well in London's Shaftesbury Avenue - and three of A Midsummer Night's Dream. The oddest show of the lot may turn out be music from a New Zealand Celtic band. Ticket prices are up, but not substantially. Entrance to over half of this year's fringe shows will be Pounds 5 or less, and a few are free. At the official Festival, sponsorship is at a record level of Pounds 805,000. Among the leading contributors are the privatised British Gas Scotland and Scottish Power. The latter is the biggest private sponsor of the lot and is backing some of the notable musical events, such as the Verdi Requiem performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. The official Festival has reacted to suggestions that the main European theatre festival of the year is now in Salzburg by introducing a programme of collaboration. Peter Stein's production of Julius Caesar, which was shown in Salzburg last year, will reappear at the Royal Highland Exhibition Hall. Peter Sellars' production of The Persians by Aeschylus, which opens today, has also been seen at Salzburg. So far, however, the main attraction is neither theatre nor music. It is an outstanding exhibition of photographs called The Waking Dream: Photography's First Century, and comes from the Gilman Paper Company Collection in New York. When a very similar exhibition was shown recently at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I am told that the lighting was a little brighter. Edinburgh might take note of that. Otherwise, this is the exhibition to see. Note, for instance, the wonderful pictures of Lady Ottoline Morrell in Cavorting by the Pool at Garsington, circa 1916 and the pictures of the American Civil War. The exhibition runs at the City Art Centre until October 2.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hamleys achieves strong growth to Pounds 0.68m midway Pre-tax profits at Hamleys, the self-styled 'finest toyshop in the world' which floated in May, jumped from Pounds 115,000 to Pounds 676,000 in the half-year to July 30, on turnover up 16 per cent from Pounds 7.67m to Pounds 8.91m. With operating profits up 46 per cent at Pounds 858,000 (Pounds 588,000), the operating margin grew from 7.7 to 9.6 per cent. Mr Howard Dyer, chairman, ascribed this growth to increased sales, greater productivity per employee, and 'that small business mentality where you watch every penny'. He hoped the profits rise was 'an outperformance' of City expectations, though the shares were unchanged at 168p. The flotation price was 185p. Mr Dyer said the store in London's Regent Street, which accounts for 75 per cent of group sales, was seeing the results of the refurbishment completed in June 1993. Sales in the store increased by 14 per cent. The satellite operations - shops in Covent Garden and Heathrow's Terminal 4  -performed well. Mr Dyer said that, aided by the duty free impact, the company had been able to sell more expensive items in the airport. He suggested that Hamleys would look to European airports and Far and Middle Eastern franchises for expansion in the next two to four years. Also, once passengers could use the Channel Tunnel, the shop at the entrance would open. Between April and June a further seven House of Toys concessions opened within House of Fraser stores: another 16 will open for the six-week run-up to Christmas. Mr Dyer said that 95 per cent of HoF toy sales came in the second half, against 60 per cent for the Regent Street store, which relied far more heavily on tourists. Extra House of Toys stock totalled Pounds 500,000, though currently Hamleys had 'small cash reserves'. With the float proceeds, long-term debt was wiped out and the interest charge fell to Pounds 182,000 (Pounds 473,000). Earnings per share were 2.7p, against 0.5p, or 1.5p pro forma. The maiden interim dividend is 2p.</p>

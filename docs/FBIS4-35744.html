			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Abu-'Id: "Palestinian Official Tells </F> AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Jordan Not Dealing With Us as Economic  Partner; `Commission-Seekers' Biggest Threat to the Palestinian  Entity"]    [Excerpts] Amman, Jerusalem -- Commenting on the draft  Palestinian-Jordanian agreement, Ibrahim Abu-'Ayyash, member of  the Palestine Central Council and the Palestine National  Council, has said in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the  agreement between the two sides is necessary and important. But  the main obstacle lies in the nature of the Jordanian side's  view of the Palestinians, which I believe does not regard the  two sides as equal partners, but, rather, as a superior and a  subordinate.    Abu-'Ayyash said that the nature of this view is worrying  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and that the main problem  is that "they continue to talk to us on the basis that we are  part of Jordan, not on the basis of our independence." [passage  omitted]    Furthermore, Abu-'Ayyash said that the transitional phase  involves great dangers, especially in view of rumors that  Palestinian officials have become agents for international  companies to distribute their commodities in the areas  controlled by the Palestinian authority -- a phenomenon now  known as the "commission-seekers" phenomenon.    In this context Abu-'Ayyash said: "Regrettably, rumors have  cited names of figures close to Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat." However, he added: "Nevertheless, matters are still  within the framework of rumors. But the important thing is for  the Palestinian leadership to understand the seriousness of the  stage ahead and thus not link its destiny with Israel, but with  the Arab states."    He pointed out that the biggest threat to the new  Palestinian  entity is those who are trying to be clever. [passage omitted]</p>

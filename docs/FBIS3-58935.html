			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Renzo Di Rienzo: "First, Pay the Doctor"] </F>   [Text] Berlusconi's platform advocates private health  care; pension funds; and for the very poor, vouchers to be spent  in hospitals. These are his proposals, stolen from Ronald  Reagan.    Berlusconi's program for governing ("A plan for the future  of  democracy in Italy") is modest in appearance, in the style of  the Knight of Arcore. Having settled on the title, various  committees of professors who are involved in the "Seekers of  Good Government" association went to work before Christmas. But  because the egghead consultants were working at a leisurely  pace, Silvio Berlusconi's staff [preceding word in English] in  the meantime quickly set about distilling certain truths into 40  points that will be the centerpiece of his election campaign.  Each point is studied as if it were a minor political  provocation--a hammer blow designed to demolish everything that  has been done heretofore with respect to the economy, pensions,  and welfare. In this way, 40 resounding blows were struck--blows  that will not allow TV or the press to divert their attention  for so much as one day from Silvio Berlusconi.    His program is ready, however, and has even been condensed  onto colored cards that the candidates of the new party "Forza  Italia" are committing to memory. In reading these cards, one  gets the impression tht the only way to enter fully into the  Berlusconian neofree-enterprise universe is to picture Italy as  an enormous supermarket in which all citizens are basically  potential consumers and are differentiated among themselves in  terms of the differences in income that they individually  represent. And so you have the superconsumers; the medium  consumers; the anticonsumers (these are the worst, because they  are that way ideologically, not because of their income); and  finally, those who have little or no income: the very poor.  Anyone who believes, however, that Berlusconi's proposed reforms  are grimly classist in nature--as might appear at first  sight--is mistaken. He also has an idea and a proposal to  benefit the so-called new poor (estimated--in one study by the  office of the prime minister--to number approximately 3 million  citizens). For them, the Knight proposes the distribution of  free "vouchers" (as they are defined in the "Forza Italia"  programs), which resemble meal tickets except that they cannot  be spent at lunch counters, to be sure, but at private clinics  or in the very same USL's [local health units] which operate in  merciless competition with the private clinics and all of which,  in any case, require payment.    Here is the great change that Berlusconi would like to make  in the system: Welfare will no longer be the responsibility of  the state and guaranteed to everyone; the very poor will have  their vouchers, and the others will pay for their own health  care by purchasing the best coverage they can obtain in the  market. All of us should, therefore, become more judicious and  think of the future, because Mother State that today provides  for our health and our old age will gradually be dismantled.    But will all Italians be foresighted enough to provide  health  care insurance for themselves? And who is giving a thought to  the overconfident and the irresponsible? The truth is that  Berlusconi has not neglected them either: his recipe is a kind  of American-style free enterprise system (the one propagandized  throughout the world during Ronald Reagan's reign), diluted by  Milanese circumspection. Everyone--even the improvident--will  accordingly be compelled to acquire--at their own expense--an  insurance policy that will cover at least the major risks  (accidents, serious illnesses, operations, and lengthy  hospitalizations), as occurs today in the case of compulsory  automobile insurance.    Under the Berlusconi free-market system, of course, social  differences will be felt even more strongly than today. That is  to say, those who are well off will be able to obtain complete  and reliable health insurance, while those who cannot afford it  will have to be content and be very careful not to get sick.    The Arcore party platform also includes a complete change in  the pension system. If Berlusconi were to govern the country,  the entire system would be privatized within 10 years, at which  point the insurance companies would compete ruthlessly with each  other for life insurance policies and with the INPS [National  Agency for Social Security], which would have to function on the  basis of decidedly privatistic standards. Provision is of course  made for a transition period: those who have already made many  payments to the INPS should continue to do so until they reach  the age at which they qualify for a pension, but those who start  work in future years will be able to select any insurance  company that suits them.    As at present, professionals, artisans, and businessmen will  acquire life insurance policies that are entirely private.  Employed persons, on the other hand, will tend to use the  pension funds (consisting of sums withheld monthly from their  pay and passed on to a private insurer) that will subsequently  be taxed at reduced rates. Professor Antonio Martino--the brains  behind the Berlusconian economic plan and the future economy  minister if the ticket of the moderates wins--is already  preparing a plan to make these pension funds more attractive  because they will become in fact the instruments for  accumulating the sums set aside for the pensions of employees in  the public and private sectors. A small percentage of the sums  thus withheld will be diverted into a kind of social fund that  will finance the minimum pensions for those millions of  low-income Italians who will be unable to provide for their own  pensions.    Will Knight Berlusconi have the courage to announce these  resounding innovations that have been elaborated by his  economists? And above all, will they bring him votes?    For the present, he is only considering it, but he will  eventually propose a law to set a ceiling on government  spending--in order to prevent excessive expenditure--that will  be similar to the proposal he has already made regarding tax  revenues. Although this part of his platform may even displease  many Italians and may lend itself to the accusation that he is  scrapping all that has heretofore been regarded as social gains,  Berlusconi will be betting heavily on an economic recovery.  Could he--an incurable optimist--stand idly by in the face of  declining production and the tragedy of unemployment? Two  splendid ideas have occurred to him in this connection, but they  will require a sacrifice on the part of the national treasury.  The first would allow a businessman not to pay taxes on profits  from his business that are reinvested immediately, and the  second would authorize him to hire workers without paying the  corresponding social taxes until such time as the economic  recovery has been consolidated. Would these two strategems serve  to give a major boost to the Italian economy? "They would not  work, inasmuch as apprenticeship contracts and various forms of  incentives for investment already exist," says Professor Felice  Mortillaro, despite the fact that he himself is a member of the  Good Government Association. "An entrepreneur invests or hires  when the production cycle is set in motion, and certainly does  not do so in order to save on his taxes."</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (4): Unfinished business - Merseyside Development Corporation This has not been a good year for the Merseyside Development Corporation. It is under a cloud because of a debacle over a loss-making opera concert staged to celebrate the visit of the Columbus Grand Regatta tall ships in 1992. Mr Chris Farrow, the chief executive, has been grilled by the Commons public accounts committee over the concert's Pounds 695,000 losses; its report is awaited nervously by the corporation. In the meantime, the MDC is having a row with the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company over development of a ro-ro container terminal at Birkenhead, where the MDC has planning powers. The dock company offered immediate development at a cost of up to Pounds 20m, but the MDC has made London &amp; General Property its preferred developer on its Pounds 70m, more visionary but less certain proposals for a container terminal, a science park and a student village. Mr Bob Lane, the MDC's assistant chief executive, says: 'This met the wider brief that we wanted. We are in the business of job creation. A dock by itself would not have created many jobs.' London &amp; General has to produce detailed proposals by the end of this month, and the deal might still fall through, but the row has been a poor advertisement for Merseyside's claim that all is now sweetness and light between public and private sectors. The pity is that these difficulties have overshadowed the fact that the sums finally seem to be coming right for the MDC, 13 years after it was founded - alongside its London counterpart - to bring disused Mersey docklands back from the dead. By 1990, the MDC had spent Pounds 180m of public money but had generated only Pounds 43.5m in private sector investment. Its policy of leisure development - notably the Albert Dock tourist complex - was criticised for attracting 5m visitors a year who did not spend enough to create many jobs. The figures, however, are now better. Total private sector investment is put at Pounds 301m, slightly ahead of the cumulative total for spending by the corporation. Since most of the corporation money was spent in the early years, anything new from the private sector should now push up the multiple of private to public sector investment rapidly. The corporation has reclaimed more than 800 acres of land, built 468,000 sq ft of office space and, most important of all, helped create 10,605 jobs. There are three pieces of unfinished business before wind-up in 1998. The corporation wants to help develop derelict land in north Liverpool and Bootle and plans to spend Pounds 30m making the rest of the A565 Southport road into a dual carriageway. Another big project will be the former Cammell Laird shipyard, where English Partnerships hopes to get EU Objective 1 funding for development with the MDC and private sector. A question-mark hangs over the third project, involving King's Dock, next to the Albert Dock on the Liverpool waterfront. A grand design has been set out for leisure and business space, but so far developers have not come forward for the 40-acre site. However, despite the inquiry into the tall ships fiasco and doubts about whether there is enough demand to drive projects involving offices and science parks, the corporation should end its life with a reputation for a job pretty well done.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, May 14 (XINHUA) -- A total of 356 Chinese  medical personnel and overseas contract workers working in the  strife-torn Yemen left the port city of Hodeida in the north  tonight for Djibouti on their way home.    Thirty-four of the 356 Chinese had been stranded in the  south  since the civil war erupted in the Arab nation on May 4, and  they later managed to evacuate from Abyan Province to arrive in  Hodeida this afternoon with help from the Yemeni authorities.    However, Zhang Chengjian, deputy director of a Chinese  medical team working in Abyan, was shot dead on May 9 during the  evacuation.    Most of the Chinese nationals working in the south had left  Aden, capital of the south, on May 7. 149 other Chinese working  in the north left Sanaa for home by air two days ago.    So far most of the Chinese working in yemen have evacuated  from the country.    The civil war has been raging since May 4 between the north  and south which joined in an uneasy union in 1990.</p>

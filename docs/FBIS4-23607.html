			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bujumbura Radio-Television Nationale du  Burundi Radio in French at 1800 GMT on 12 June reports that  interim Burundi President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who was  interviewed before leaving Bujumbura for the OAU summit in  Tunisia, spoke about the Rwandan issue. "Burundi's position is  clear," he said. "We must be absolutely neutral in this  inter-Rwandan conflict, and we ask all Burundians wherever they  are, to respect this government's commitment to neutrality in  the conflict."    Ntibantunganya went on to say Burundi has to help Rwanda to  restore peace and security and that the Arusha agreements must  be the starting point for negotiations between the Rwandan  sides. "Given the situation in Rwanda over the last two months,  these agreements must be adjusted to suit them to the current  situation," he added.</p>

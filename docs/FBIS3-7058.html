The general bureaux of railways carried hundreds of  thousands  more tons of freight than their plan in recent one month. The  transport turnover of the general bureau of Western railways was  207,400 tons more than the assignment in the period.    The general bureau of Eastern railways and the Kaechon  general bureau of railways hauled freight 20 to 30 percent more  than the rated traction tonnage by scrupulously organizing and  commanding transport and reducing the stoppage time of wagons.    Haeju Chongnyon, Unpit, Paechon and many other railway  stations have hit their first-quarter assignments ahead of  schedule.</p>

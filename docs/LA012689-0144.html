			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The projected sale of Turner Broadcasting System's CNN Building in Atlanta for  $170 million has encountered a hitch. A letter of intent for an acquisition of  the office-hotel-shopping complex by 66 Properties Inc., which was announced  last Nov. 7, "expired without consummation," Turner said. However, Paul D.  Beckham, senior vice president of finance and administration, said talks with  66 Properties have been continuing and Turner still intends to sell the  building "on the appropriate terms."  </P></p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA prices continued to decline, second position July sinking to a new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 546 before closing at Pounds 547 a tonne. Dealers said there was no sign of significant producer selling. Manufacturers were also inactive. A quiet week appears in prospect with a French holiday tomorrow likely to limit business further. In contrast robusta COFFEE closed around the day's highs, also in quiet trading. Prices were aided by a lack of sellers. Caution was evident ahead of this week's producer meetings at the ICO, starting today, and there was little sign of any Indonesian selling. New York arabicas were ahead at midday. On the LME NICKEL moved ahead; the close was considered constructive by technical traders, signalling further gains today. COPPER again met resistance on any rise to the Dollars 2,240 level for three-month metal, dampening trading interest. In Chicago WHEAT held modest gains at midday, supported by news of crop damage in western Kansas because of record cold there during the US Memorial Day weekend. Also bullish was news that Russia bought a large share of soft red winter wheat in its total purchase of 860,000 tonnes of EEP wheat. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zou Qingli (6760 3237 7787)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- To ensure the sound  development of the satellite ground reception equipment  industry, China will designate producers of ground reception  equipment for satellite television broadcasting and implement a  strict production licensing system.    It was learned that China's satellite television industry  developed rapidly in the last decade. The country today has  nearly 300 enterprises producing more than 100,000 sets of  satellite television reception equipment a year. These  enterprises, which are under the jurisdiction of more than 10  departments, spread thinly their production investment and are  generally small in terms of their scale of production. Many of  them lack the ability to develop products by themselves and  demonstrate poor economic efficiency. To change this condition,  the State Council has decided to strengthen the macromanagement  of the production of satellite ground reception equipment.  Based on this decision, the Ministry of Electronics Industry  recently promulgated the "Provisions on the Management of Ground  Receiving Equipment for Satellite Television Broadcasting."    The provisions specify that local departments in charge of  the electronics industry will be centrally responsible for  managing the production of satellite ground reception equipment,  for receiving applications, for making recommendations related  to the designation of enterprises for the production of  satellite ground reception equipment in the localities, and for  investigating unlicensed production.    The provisions stipulate that an enterprise must possess  certain conditions to become a designated production enterprise:  An enterprise must has the ability to develop new products, and  its products must contain a higher proportion of locally made  components. Its production scale must be fairly large, and its  products must enjoy a fairly large market share. It must have  the means to measure satellite ground reception equipment  qualities and possess a sound and effective system for quality  control. Its products must reach the current national or  industrial standards. It must have a complete set of documents  on the design and industrial process of the products as required  by state regulations.    The provisions also set specific requirements on the methods  of application, examination, and approval for designated  production enterprises and on the operation and management of  licensed enterprises. The provisions also stipulate that  unlicensed enterprises must immediately stop producing satellite  ground reception equipment and that unlicensed producers will be  investigated to fix their responsibility as legal entities in  accordance with the law.</p>

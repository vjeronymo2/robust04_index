			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Ukraine agrees terms of IMF membership UKRAINE has agreed on terms to join the International Monetary Fund and hopes to become a fully-fledged member of the Washington-based institution by the beginning of next month, writes George Graham in Washington. Mr Hryhory Pyatachenko, Ukraine's finance minister, said he had accepted the IMF quota of 0.69 per cent which had been proposed to him, though Ukrainian officials said they were disappointed that it was not higher. This quota would give the former Soviet republic access to IMF financing of up to approximately Dollars 1bn a year. If the IMF can complete its Dollars 60bn quota increase - an operation which is currently held up by the US's refusal to authorise its Dollars 12bn share - this financial access would increase to approximately Dollars 1.5bn a year. Russia, the largest of the former Soviet republics, agreed earlier this month on a quota of 3 per cent. Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, complimented the Ukrainian government after his meeting with Mr Pyatachenko on its 'commitment to a market economy and to the integration of Ukraine into the international economic community'. He also welcomed Ukraine's decision to accept joint responsibility for the debt of the former Soviet Union, a move which he said 'can only enhance Ukraine's standing in the eyes of the international financial community'.</p>

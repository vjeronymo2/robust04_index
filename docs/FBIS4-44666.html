			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent in Kourou (French Guinea) </F> Pierre Langereux: "Ariane's Failure Causes the Loss of Turksat  1A and Eutelsat 2/F5 Satellites"; first paragraph is AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] The shutdown of Ariane 4's cryogenic engine during  its 63rd flight has caused the loss of two telecommunications  satellites, the Turksat 1A and Eutelsat 2/F5, which were insured  for the record amount of 2.2 billion French francs [Fr].  Replacement satellites will be ready for launch in July and  October of 1994, respectively.    "On 24 January in Kourou, Arianespace suffered its first  failure in four years of consecutive successful launches. Over  the course of those 26 flights, Ariane placed in orbit 40  European and foreign satellites. Today we have experienced a  failure! We can accept this without undue distress, because we  know the launcher is reliable though (unfortunately) not  perfect." With those remarks, Arianespace CEO Charles Bigot  summed up the situation after the surprising--and financially  painful--failure of the European launcher's 63rd flight. It was  Ariane's sixth failure in just over 14 years, and Ariane 4's  second failure (out of 35 launches) since starting service in  June 1988. The misfire abruptly deflates Ariane 4's success rate  from its previously enviable level of 97.1 percent, to a mere  94.4 percent!    The 24 January failure was the most costly one in the entire  world history of commercial launches. Indeed, the Ariane 44LP  carried record insurance of $356 million, or about Fr2.2  billion, on its twin payload of two, Aerospatiale-built  telecommunications satellites, the first Turksat 1A and the  second-to-the-last Eutelsat 2. Mohammed Dhabi, general director  of Faugere &amp; Jutheau, the broker that insures all Ariane  launches, says the Eutelsat 2/F5 was covered for about Fr1.1  billion (170 million accounting units), and the Turksat 1A for  about the same amount. The contract to insure the two satellites  had totally depleted the funds available on the world market.  Charles Bigot further notes that Arianespace's insurance  department, S3R, had to add $35 million to the $321 million  collected on the international market (from 87 insurance  companies).    "It is a brutal loss," acknowledges Charles Bigot, who ticks  off the additional costs of modifying Ariane and of revenues  lost by the two operators, Europe's Eutelsat and Turkey's  P&amp;T.  The satellites of the Turkish postal and telecommunications  office were made by Aerospatiale in Cannes, with the help of  Alcatel Espace in Toulouse.    Ariane's 63rd flight was the first time Aerospatiale had had  two of its satellites on board one launcher. In another first,  the French firm was even granted the privilege--as are all  direct Arianespace customers--of inscribing its name on the  European rocket, since it had signed a contract with Turkey to  place both Turksats in orbit in January and July, 1994,  respectively. Finally, it was Aerospatiale's--and more broadly,  any European firm's--first experience with a "turnkey" delivery  (geostationary-orbit, ready-to-operate satellites), as  stipulated in the $315 million contract it had signed with the  Turkish P&amp;T in 1990.    The Turkish Minister of Transports and Telecommunications,  Mehmet Kostepen, had come to watch the launch in Kourou via a  specially chartered Airbus 340 Aerospatiale and Arianespace had  reserved for its 150 VIPs.    Mr. Kostepen was obviously quite disappointed at Ariane's  failure, which deprives him of a satellite scheduled to begin  operating and generating revenues by late February. In  particular, the Turksat 1A was slated to relay Turkey's four  national television stations and 10 private ones throughout  Turkey, Central Europe, and the Middle East. The expanded  broadcasts are meant to reach 100 million Turkish speakers, and  to turn the Turksat program, in which Ankara will ultimately  invest a total of $600 million, into a money-making proposition.    But Mehmet Kostepen has not lost confidence in Ariane,  stating that "the second Turksat should be launched in July" and  that "God willing, I hope to be in Kourou again to see it  launched." On the other hand, Eutelsat's general director Jean  Grenier seemed more affected by the mishap. Grenier certainly  had no desire to lose his satellite, despite the fact that he  had protected himself by insuring a Eutelsat 2 for the first  time. "I don't know what we're going to do," he confided to us  immediately after the 2/F5's loss. Grenier has not ruled out the  possibility of ordering an additional Eutelsat 2 to avoid a  capacity shortfall between now and the arrival of his new "Hot  Bird Plus," which Aerospatiale and MMS are currently vying to  build.    The botched launch is also "an enormous disappointment" for  Aerospatiale CEO Louis Gallois, who had come to watch his first  Ariane launch. Gallois's group has been the main manufacturer of  Ariane rockets since 1973. According to him, the failure  demonstrates that "We are still at the technological development  phase." This terse comment was an unintentionally harsh  condemnation of Ariane teams, which were already "bitterly  disappointed by the accident." Charles Bigot stressed this when  he "apologized to his customers for the failure" that lost the  two satellites, which tumbled into the Atlantic off the coast of  Africa.    In a letter written the day after the Ariane accident,  French  space minister Gerard Longuet "reaffirmed his personal  confidence and that of the government" in Arianespace and "the  entire Ariane program community." The industry minister believes  that "Ariane will resume its excellent track record without  delay."    So the investigating committee will have to do its job  thoroughly, but most of all, quickly. Indeed, Arianespace thinks  that, given the nature of the accident, "There is reason to hope  for fairly quick diagnosis and corrective measures." Charles  Bigot has announced that the investigative team will "submit an  initial report by mid-February"!    "Arianespace's priority is to serve its customers," says  Bigot, adding that, according to the rules, customers that have  just lost a satellite are given relaunch priority. "Ariane's  manifest will be altered accordingly," so that the  (insurance-paid) replacement satellites can be launched as soon  as possible. But the actual advantage of this policy will be  slight in this case, at best maintaining the  previously-scheduled launch dates of the next models, Turksat 1B  and Eutelsat 2/F6, for July and October, 1994.    Aerospatiale Space-Defense Director Michel Delaye has, in  fact, confirmed that the two satellites will be ready for that  date. Delaye notes that the Turkish contract requires  Aerospatiale to provide a replacement satellite to Turkey within  two years. Moreover, if the second satellite is lost as well,  the Turkish P&amp;T can demand full reimbursement of the $315  million.    Jean Grenier explained that the Eutelsat 2/F6 was designed  for a slightly different mission than the 2/F5 (which was  altered to broadcast to the East), and is not in any case  scheduled for launch until next October. But perhaps the  European organization's satellite will be able to cut in ahead  of its Luxembourg SES competitor's Astra 1D in the fall.    In any event, Arianespace aims to "start flying again  shortly" to "make up the time lost" as a result of the F63  failure, a delay that is still difficult to calculate exactly.    "We have the capacity to speed up our schedule," says  Charles  Bigot. The CEO noted that "the operational plan calling for 10  flights a year over three years beginning in 1994 does not  require a launch rate of one every five weeks, but just under  half that." The original schedule was established precisely in  order to allow for technical, program, or industrial glitches.  Moreover, says Charles Bigot, on 1 February Arianespace expects  to unveil a new operational plan "that will accelerate  operations still more and enable the company to launch rockets  every three weeks." The new plan will probably require working  Arianespace teams six out of seven days.    The first task of those teams will be to dismantle (and  perhaps ship back to Europe) the third cryogenic stage that is  now mounted on the next launcher (F64), scheduled to carry an  Intelsat 7 on 23 February. Charles Bigot is not willing to  announce a new launch date, but he hopes that operations will  resume "in a few weeks." That seems rather optimistic, however,  and at best specialists believe Ariane will be grounded for at  least two to three months. All of Ariane's next flights will be  postponed accordingly, at least for the remainder of 1994.  <H5>  Boxed Material: An Overheated Bearing Is the Cause of Failure </H5>   Arianespace's CEO confirmed the day after the launch that  initial examinations during the night had revealed "a failure  caused by the premature shutdown of the third-stage engine.  Eighty seconds post-ignition of the cryogenic stage, the  pressure in the center of the stage, the pressure from  outflowing oxygen, and the rotation speed of the liquid-oxygen  turbopump, which had all been normal until then, slowed for 0.5  seconds, then dropped abruptly." More specifically, a quick  survey of recordings shows that, after 60 s of nominal cryogenic  engine operation, the countersunk bearing of the oxygen pump  (also cooled by liquid oxygen at 170C) become abnormally  heated. Overheating was slight at first, during two stroke  operation, then shot up exponentially, quickly exceeding the  maximum threshold. This surge destroyed the bearing and stopped  the oxygen turbopump, which was rotating at 13,000 rpm. Francois  Calaque, the director of Aerospatiale Launchers, privately made  the same diagnosis immediately after the accident, when only  preliminary data on the F63 failure were available. The  accident, Charles Bigot went on to say, "has nothing to do with  the (four-day) launch postponement decided as a precautionary  measure (before F63), to correct the (electrical) anamoly  discovered in an interface case of the previous (F62) launcher's  module."    Now Arianespace must clarify exactly, and as quickly as  possible, the underlying cause of the accident, which began with  the destruction of the bearing. As Charles Bigot explains, the  bearing "acted as a fuse," and engineers must figure out how it  could have become vulnerable to destruction just one minute  after ignition of SEP's HM7B cryogenic engine. According to  Daniel Mugnier, director of Launchers at the National Center for  Space Studies, the disastrous heating of the bearing was  apparently due solely to a mechanical overload (which the  bearing is not designed to tolerate), rather than a purely  thermal phenomenon.    But it will be up to the immediately-formed investigative  committee to "thoroughly analyze and elucidate the reasons for  the anamolous operation of the engine," declared Charles Bigot.  Arianespace's CEO affirmed that "the Ariane system is mature and  proven, but remains technically fragile." Its cryogenic  propulsion system in particular, he says, "is more sensitive  than the rest of the rocket." This is a well-established fact,  since problems with cryogenic propulsion have unfortunately  caused five of Ariane's six failures since 1980!</p>

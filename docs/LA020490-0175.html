			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES DON'T SHOW LEADERSHIP  </P> <P> I have been following with great interest the special election race in the  Republican Party for the 31st Senate District vacated by Sen. William Campbell.  Like most residents of this district, I have been amused, entertained, bored,  surprised and even shocked at the cruelty in words that grown men use to  deprecate each other.  </P> <P> What I have not heard or seen in the literature that I have received is any  cadence of leadership from any of the candidates. One would think that this  special election would be the opportune moment where a candidate could  distinguish himself by his rhetoric and character, thus showing the public the  first fruits of a promising political leader. What I got instead were "wimps"  that have tried to sound like leaders.  </P> <P> What I want is to know that the candidate I select could not only lead our  district, but in time would be part of a pool of future political leaders that  would eventually provide leadership for the state in the next century. With the  choices presented to me, I do not feel that the future of my generation stands  on solid ground. Often, I feel like a voter being courted by suitors that do  not entice or excite me. Perhaps I am asking too much. But as a voter, I just  wish that one of the candidates would satisfy my hunger for leadership.  </P> <P> The literature that I have received has been insulting. I would never vote for  or against someone based on accusations, innuendoes or potholders. I am  indignant over those candidates that believe that my intelligence is at the  level of one of Pavlov's dogs. They may drag their character and intelligence  in the sewers, but I will not join them. It is too bad that I have to choose  the future senator of this district based on this kindergarten rhetoric.  </P> <P> Californians are known to produce great wines. The grapes that produce these  wines are nurtured and are not taken from the vine until they are ready for the  public. I feel that most of the current assemblage of candidates for the 31st  Senate District are not ready for the public. They should remain on the vine  until they mature, because the challenges that we will face in our senatorial  district in this decade will most likely temper a man and forge a future leader  for California.  </P> <P> NOEL A. JAIMES  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P></p>

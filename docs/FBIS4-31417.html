			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "ao": "Majority Against Federation's Breakup"] </F>   [Text] The FOCUS--Center for Social and Marketing Analysis  agency conducted a public opinion survey from 9 to 23 May 1994,  in which the organizers involved a representative sample of  2,018 respondents. One of the questions asked was: "Had a  referendum been held before the division of the CSFR, how would  you have voted?" Partition would have been preferred by 27  percent of those questioned (in October 1993, 23 percent gave  this reply to the same FOCUS question), 57 percent would have  voted against partition (60 percent), 11 percent would not have  participated in the referendum (14 percent), and 5 percent did  not know (3 percent). Asked what kind of an arrangement of  relations between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic  they would personally wish in the future, the respondents  replied as follows: Two independent states would be preferred by  35 percent (32 percent in October 1993), a confederation or  union by 30 percent (27), a federal state by 26 percent (35),  and another arrangement by 3 percent (2). Six percent (4) could  not decide.</p>

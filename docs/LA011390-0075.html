			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HASTILY ADOPTED RESTRICTIONS ON HILLSIDE BUILDING MAY UNITE OPPONENTS;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: SIERRA MADRE OFFICIALS, PROPERTY OWNERS AND PRESERVATIONISTS AGREE  THAT THE STRICT GUIDELINES SHOULD BE MODIFIED.  </P> <P> In a swift chain of events that unfolded like a drama, the Sierra Madre City  Council has adopted an ordinance that imposes what may be the strictest  guidelines on hillside development among foothill cities in the San Gabriel  Mountains.  </P> <P> But city officials and both sides agree that the guidelines probably will be  modified.  </P> <P> The rush of events included an end-of-year revelation by an attorney of a City  Hall error that allowed the unexpected expiration of a building moratorium and  resulted in civic chagrin, a hastily called special council meeting and the  failure recently of hillside property owners to agree to a self-imposed  building moratorium.  </P> <P> The ordinance adopted unanimously by the council was originally drafted by the  city's Planning Commission. It imposes requirements ranging from five to 40  acres per house by dividing the hills into five zones stretching vertically up  the mountainsides. Buildings are limited to one story and a maximum height of  20 feet. The previous foothill density guidelines were much less strict -- one  house per 15,000 square feet.  </P> <P> After the council meeting, property owners and preservationists, who had  clashed since September in overflow meetings at City Hall, smiled uncomfortably  at each other with the realization that now they will have to work together if  they want to amend the ordinance.  </P> <P> "I think it was the most wonderful thing that happened," said preservationist  Gurden Miller. "The ordinance that nobody really likes and that has to be  amended will bring people together."  </P> <P> When first proposed in September, the ordinance pleased many of Sierra Madre's  10,800 residents. But it enraged some of the about 15 hillside property owners.  They and their attorneys accused the city of, in effect, confiscating their  land.  </P> <P> The City Council then proposed modifications that, in turn, outraged the town's  informal preservationist group, the Hillside Coalition. Coalition members said  the revisions weakened the ordinance, and they threatened to withdraw their  support of three council members who proposed the changes and who are up for  reelection in April.  </P> <P> The council's version was referred back to the Planning Commission last fall  for further study. Then came the sudden turn of events that ended the stalemate  and punched the solution of the controversy into fast-forward.  </P> <P> The catalyst was land-use attorney Mark Steres, who represents hillside  property owners Annette and Lawson Martin. When preservationists discovered in  1988 that the Martins had purchased 100 acres in the foothills of Monrovia,  Arcadia and Sierra Madre, they realized the foothills could be developed.  </P> <P> At their urging, the council passed a hillside building moratorium. Multiple  extensions were approved while the city tussled with an ordinance to govern  hillside development.  </P> <P> At the end of December, Sierra Madre officials thought that moratorium  extensions were still in effect. Steres' research showed otherwise.  </P> <P> "They thought the moratorium was expiring in March of 1990," Steres said. "But  according to my analysis, it expired September, 1989.  </P> <P> In a dramatic move at 4:50 p.m. on Dec. 29 -- the last day of business for the  city in 1989 -- Steres delivered to City Hall a request to subdivide 11.3 acres  of the Martins' land into 10 lots. He sent a cover letter that said the request  had to be honored because the city had no moratorium in effect.  </P> <P> After City Atty. Charles Martin (no relation to Annette and Lawson Martin)  confirmed that Steres was correct, those involved went into a frenzy of action.  Phones began ringing all over the city.  </P> <P> "It was an absolute shock to the Hillside Coalition," coalition member Caroline  Brown said. "We were under the impression that all the procedural matters had  been handled correctly by the city administration . . . but basically they  goofed. We thought we were left without hillside protection."  </P> <P> A special meeting of the Sierra Madre Council was called for 5:30 p.m. on Jan.  4, a Thursday. The council usually meets on Tuesdays at 6:30 p.m. Because many  residents were still away on holiday vacations, only about 25 people attended  the meeting -- considerably fewer than had attended previous meetings about the  hillside development ordinance. As many as 200 people attended some of those  meetings.  </P> <P> City Atty. Martin advised the council to adopt the Planning Commission  ordinance as a stopgap measure because no further building moratorium  extensions could legally be imposed.  </P> <P> Following assurances that it will amend the ordinance, the council then  reluctantly introduced the strict version of the hillside ordinance. Shocked  property owners left the meeting saying they were resolved to impose a  voluntary building moratorium on themselves that would make unnecessary the  city's passage of the strict building restrictions.  </P> <P> But by the regularly scheduled council meeting the next Tuesday, the property  owners had not reached an agreement. Without discussion, the council then  unanimously adopted the strict measure, which took effect immediately.  </P> <P> "They did it as a knee-jerk reaction to protect themselves," Steres said after  the vote. "This story isn't close to being finished."  </P> <P> Steres said he believes that the new ordinance won't affect the Martins'  subdivision request, which was submitted before the measure was adopted.  </P> <P> Amendments to the ordinance will be worked out in voluntary meetings now being  planned by members of the Hillside Coalition and hillside property owners such  as the Passionist Fathers, who operate a 65-acre religious retreat, and Mike  Heflin and David Willis, whose families each own 100 acres.  </P> <P> Likely to be considered are the modifications proposed earlier by the council,  which reduced the acreage requirements and created three horizontal zones.  Coalition members also said they are researching a hillside development  ordinance in Rancho Cucamonga that restricts development on all slopes of 15%  or more.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the Sierra Madre hills are protected, Brown said. But she was  reluctant to say that the rapid turn of events meant a victory for  preservationists.  </P> <P> "I do think we have an upper hand," she said, smiling, "but I don't think it's  useful to be too proud or too right."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oslo correspondent Yo'av Tocker] </F>   [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will hold a tete-a-tete  meeting with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo this  evening. 'Arafat said he is committed to the Declaration of  Principles [DOP] signed with Israel and opposes violence and  terrorism. The PLO chairman admitted that he had called on  Muslims to launch a jihad for the liberation of Jerusalem but  noted that he had been referring to a peaceful struggle.  'Arafat alleged that his remarks had been misconstrued. Our  correspondent Yo'av Tocker reports on the meeting between  'Arafat and Peres in Oslo:    [Begin recording] [Tocker] In this video footage we can see  the exposed tip of the nervous, political-psychological iceberg  that was evident here over the past few hours. Mr. Peres  arrives at a ceremony held by the Carter Foundation for Human  Rights. He approaches the audience and pointedly avoids Yasir  'Arafat, on his right, who, with a knowing smile, is about to  take his seat. Several moments earlier, following Peres' demand,  and in the wake of U.S. mediation efforts, 'Arafat explained  that his call for a jihad was really a call for peace.    ['Arafat, in English] I will continue my jihad to achieve  peace. We can say it in an Islamic, religious way. I will  continue my jihad to do my work very well. I will continue my  jihad until I will be able to.... [pauses] Christians and  Muslims to pray together; and Jews to pray together in  Jerusalem. This is a Terra Santa for Jews, for Christians, for  Muslims.    [Tocker] 'Arafat's clarifications, issued with a great deal  of embarrassment, were prompted by Peres' ultimatum that 'Arafat  must publicly state his commitment to the peace process, which  the PLO chairman indeed did, thus apparently satisfying the  foreign minister. Nevertheless, when I asked him on behalf of  Israel Television what he meant by jihad, 'Arafat refused to  clarify his remarks directly to the Israeli people.    [Peres] This is the minimum I expected him to say.    [Tocker] What do you mean by the minimum?    [Peres] In other words, this is what was necessary. The  situation was not a simple one, but had he not issued this  statement I would not have come.    [Tocker] What do you intend to discuss in your meeting with  'Arafat later this evening? Will you demand that he express  even more detailed reservations?    [Peres] He has already expressed whatever reservations were  necessary. He made a mistake and subsequently tried to rectify  it. However, I hope that all of us, and especially 'Arafat, will  honor the DOP.    [Tocker] Beyond what you describe as the minimum, do you  accept this interpretation of jihad as semantics, a religious  term bereft of any political or military significance?    [Peres] I am not a philologist. I insisted on three other  things: his total commitment to the DOP, the total negation of  terrorism and violence, and that future developments must be  achieved entirely through negotiations.    [Tocker] I noticed that you refrained from talking to  'Arafat or shaking his hand during the ceremony, even after his  public clarification.    [Peres] That was not especially called for.

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Poseidon Gold in bid for Aztec Poseidon Gold, part of the Australian-based Normandy Poseidon mining group, has launched a ADollars 268m (USDollars 180m) bid for Aztec Mining, the gold and base metals miner. The bid was immediately rejected by Aztec's chairman. Poseidon Gold is offering 68 cents a share for Aztec, compared with the last sales transaction on Tuesday of 58 cents. News of the bid sent the shares to 70 cents. Mr Tom Johnston, the chairman of Aztec, last night said: 'I have spoken with directors of Aztec's 37 per cent shareholder, Alumax (the US metals group) and they agree that the bid is opportunistic, ill-timed and unwelcome. 'They will not accept this offer. It has been made at a low point in the base metals price cycle.'</p>

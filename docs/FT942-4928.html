			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Thailand's Imperial Hotels sold for Dollars 132m Thailand's Imperial Hotels Group has been sold to Mr Charoen Siriwattanapakdi, one of the country's richest men, in a deal which values the company at Dollars 132m. The transaction is thought to rank among the largest in Thailand. Imperial Hotels ran into financial difficulties after it opened the 1,400-room Imperial Queen's Park Hotel - Bangkok's biggest - two years ago at a time when the number of foreign tourists arriving was in decline following the military's suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. Mr Akorn Hoontrakul sold his family's 70 per cent stake in eight hotels for Bt33 a share. This shows a premium of some 10 per cent to 12 per cent over its net asset value, which includes debts of at least Bt3.5bn (Dollars 138m) but also a land bank and lucrative smaller city hotels. Mr Charoen controls the privately-owned Thai whisky maker Sura Thip, which last year opened a joint beer-making venture with Carlsberg, the Danish brewer. He also has banking and insurance interests. International Broadcasting Corp, the Thai cable television operator, confirmed that it is in talks with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, AP-DJ reports from Bangkok. An IBC spokeswoman said that the operator was planning to double its number of channels to 10, and that it was talking with Star TV about obtaining news and entertainment to fill its programming needs.</p>

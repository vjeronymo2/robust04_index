			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> IMPACT OF HARRIS FELT IMMEDIATELY AT CS LONG BEACH  </P> <P> Lucious Harris celebrated his 19th birthday Monday by scoring a season-high 17  points for the Cal State Long Beach basketball team.  </P> <P> A coming-out party?  </P> <P> Hardly. The 6-foot-5 freshman guard from Cleveland High had long since made his  presence felt during his first collegiate season.  </P> <P> Harris is averaging 10.9 points, third on the team, and has been a starter in  all but one game.  </P> <P> More importantly, he has played a key role in the 49ers winning six of their  first seven, the fastest start for Long Beach in more than a decade.  </P> <P> Against North Texas State on Monday, Harris made seven of his first nine  field-goal attempts as the 49ers gained a 92-74 victory before a capacity crowd  at the Long Beach gymnasium.  </P> <P> But that performance pales in comparison to his last-second heroics in games  played earlier this month.  </P> <P> It was a Harris steal with three seconds left that led to the winning basket in  the 49ers' 70-69 upset of Purdue on Dec. 2. Two weeks later, on the road  against Texas, he made a three-point shot at the buzzer to pull out an 89-87  win for Long Beach.  </P> <P> "He doesn't play like a freshman. He's cool and calm," said Bob Braswell, a  Long Beach assistant who coached Harris at Cleveland. "The Purdue game was  probably the best example of that.  </P> <P> "We were down by two, less than a minute to play, and we called his number, set  up a play designed for him, and he hit the shot. Then he got the big steal to  win the game."  </P> <P> Just call him Cool Hand Lucious.  </P> <P> Harris, who averaged 20.9 points a game as a high school senior, had his own  plan when he accepted a scholarship offer from Long Beach last spring. But it  didn't include starting as a freshman.  </P> <P> "I was hoping I could make the team and pick up a few minutes," Harris said. "I  thought, maybe I could start my junior year."  </P> <P> Redshirting Harris during his freshman season was briefly considered by the  49er coaching staff, but Braswell said that option was quickly discarded.  </P> <P> "He played himself out of redshirting real quick," Braswell said. "It's very  difficult for a freshman to start on any college level, let alone Division I,  but Lucious worked hard over the summer and really didn't leave Coach (Joe)  Harrington a choice."  </P> <P> Harris said he wasn't sure that he belonged at the major-college level until he  scored 27 points in an intra-squad scrimmage during Long Beach's early season  workouts.  </P> <P> But cracking the starting lineup? Well, that was another thing all together.  </P> <P> "It surprised me a lot," Harris said. "I thought I would come off the bench."  Or at least be riding it with a game on the line.  </P> <P> "The Purdue game I was really scared," Harris said. "My stomach had a lot of  butterflies. But when (Harrington) called the play for me I just thought, 'Put  it down. Got to make it.'  </P> <P> "Later I thought, 'Why did he call on me?' But he made the right choice, and it  boosted my confidence a lot."  </P> <P> Braswell says looking to Harris in the clutch could fast become a trend for the  49ers.  </P> <P> "He's shooting the ball very well," Braswell said. "He's a slashing type player  who can drive to the basket or hit the jump shot, and right now he's doing all  the right things."  </P></p>

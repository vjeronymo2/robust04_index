			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Comoran President Mohamed Said Djohar should go.  The Comoran opposition in France reiterated this call at a  rally in Paris yesterday afternoon. At the end of the rally,  the opposition spokesman in France, Abdallah Ahmed Mohamed,  talked to reporter Youssoufou Saliou Mohamed:    [Begin Mohamed recording] This rally was necessary because  an  important document was published in Moroni on 17 January by all  Comoran opposition parties grouped into a forum for national  redress. This forum clearly and loudly asked President Djohar  to step down and today we want to sensitize the entire Comoran  community to that fact. All the people invited to this rally  agreed to come in great numbers in order to demand the  resignation of the head of state, to fight for the respect of  the principle of human rights and democratic liberties as well  as the establishment of a genuine law-abiding state.    President Djohar along with his son-in-law, (Mshangama),  will  miss no occasion to violate the principles of the Constitution.  Moreover, President Djohar's son-in-law, (Mshangama), maneuvered  to be elected and undertook a true coup de force to be elected  speaker of the National Assembly. Right at this moment, many  opponents are imprisoned and this is the case of a  parliamentarian who was regularly elected in the first round of  the legislative elections at (Moutamoudou), namely Mr. Ahmed  Mohamed. We believe that this wave of arrests is a serious  breach of human rights principles and one of the main grievances  of the opposition today is the demand for the immediate and  unconditional release of all political prisoners.

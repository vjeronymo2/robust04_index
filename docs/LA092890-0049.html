			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'NEA FOUR' SUIT SEEKS REJECTED GRANT FUNDS;  </P> <P> ARTS: PERFORMANCE ARTISTS SAY THEY WERE DENIED NATIONAL GRANTS FOR POLITICAL  REASONS. ONE SEEKS DAMAGES FOR VIOLATION OF PRIVACY.  </P> <P> Four performance artists denied National Endowment for the Arts fellowships on  what they say are political grounds filed suit Thursday in Los Angeles federal  court seeking an order overruling the grant rejections.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the four said they would also file a petition for a temporary  restraining order today that would bar the arts endowment from spending the  $23,000 earmarked for the fellowships until the dispute is resolved.  </P> <P> The performers -- Karen Finley and Holly Hughes, both of New York, John Fleck  of Los Angeles and Tim Miller of Santa Monica -- have become known as the "NEA  Four" in arts circles.  </P> <P> Their work is highly political. All but Finley are gay and include homosexual  and lesbian themes prominently in their work, which has received broad critical  acclaim.  </P> <P> Finley's performances are stridently feminist in tone. She has appeared on  stage partially clothed, her body smeared with melted chocolate and alfalfa  sprouts to symbolize denigration of women by forcing them to wallow in  excrement and sperm.  </P> <P> Finley and Miller previously had received numerous NEA grants.  </P> <P> The plight of the four attracted national attention last summer when NEA  Chairman John E. Frohnmayer overruled the unanimous vote of a grant-review  panel and rejected the fellowships. The decision was made after Frohnmayer  reportedly told a meeting of arts activists that the NEA's precarious political  situation necessitated denial of the grants.  </P> <P> The endowment currently faces battles in Congress to secure renewal of its  legislative franchise and appropriations for the 1991 fiscal year.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, which was assigned to U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima,  seeks an order compelling Frohnmayer to reconsider the rejections on grounds  that the fellowships were denied for reasons other than questions about the  performers' artistic excellence.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer sacrificed the artists "because of the controversial political  content of their work," according to the complaint. "He did so with the aim of  suppressing the expression of plaintiffs' ideas."  </P> <P> The NEA has declined to give reasons for the grant rejections. And Frohnmayer  turned down appeals of his decision by the artists earlier this month.  </P> <P> The furor over the fellowship denials has made the four artists -- and Finley,  in particular -- heroes within the arts community and prominent players in the  continuing drama over the NEA's political future.  </P> <P> The action, filed by attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union, was  undertaken by a consortium of five arts attorneys assembled by the National  Campaign for Freedom of Expression, an activist artist group.  </P> <P> The suit asked for an additional $50,000 in damages to Finley, whose privacy  rights were violated, the complaint charged, by an alleged NEA leak to  conservative columnists of her confidential NEA grant application.  </P> <P> The NEA, which has a budget of $171.5 million this year, gives grants to  artists and arts institutions nationwide. Its political turmoil began in April,  1989, with a controversy over NEA support of two exhibits containing  controversial photographs. One of those, a show of work by photographer Robert  Mapplethorpe, is currently the subject of a state court obscenity prosecution  in Cincinnati.  </P></p>

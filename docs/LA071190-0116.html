It takes place entirely  within the confines of family life. I dare say it will arouse some discussion;  but it can't offend anyone."  </P> <P> At a pre-preview seminar at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, titled "Lies of the  Mind: Truth and Illusion in 'The Wild Duck,' " it did cause a good bit of  discussion, including recaps of how it offended the audiences of the 1880s.  LATC's production of the comic tragedy opens Thursday.  </P> <P> On hand for the Saturday discussion were "The Wild Duck's" director, Stein  Winge, and this version's translators, Gerry Bamman and Irene B. Berman, along  with City University of New York Theatre Program chairman Marvin A. Carlson and  moderator Richard Toscan, dean of the School of Theatre at USC.  </P> <P> The big question was how to get Ibsen right. This was the play that signaled  Ibsen's abandonment of social criticism, and he was saying new things in a new  way.  </P> <P> Bamman, also an actor and director, first noticed a problem with Ibsen  translations when asked about 10 years ago to find a good translation of "A  Doll's House." There wasn't one. Since establishing a working relationship with  the Norwegian-born Berman, they have translated "A Doll House" (the correct  title), "Hedda Gabler" and "Peer Gynt," among other plays.  </P> <P> Bamman, commenting that any translation "has a limited life" and should be  redone about every 20 years, was adamant about keeping the work colloquial. He  pointed to a phrase directly translated from "Doll House" as "fresh as a fish."  This would mean nothing to an English-speaking audience, he said. "Healthy as a  horse" was the solution.  </P> <P> Quoting the translator's problem, "you can't be beautiful and faithful at the  same time," Bamman said that he believes you can -- "if you keep the style in  mind and retain your humility."  </P> <P> "You should not hear that it is a translation," Berman added, also elaborating  on the problems involved with the Norwegian language's vocabulary, which is  one-third that of English, and the difficulties with what she calls "filler  words," such as yes, well, etc. When Ibsen repeats a word for effect or  meaning, adjustments have to be made.  </P> <P> Director Winge, who was appointed in January as artistic director of the  National Theatre of Norway, said that he is really just "getting into" Ibsen.  This is the first time he has directed "The Wild Duck," and he has been working  not only with the Bamman-Berman translation, but also with the original  Norwegian text in his hand. Asked by an audience member how he can work with  both texts, he replied: "I've been able to communicate with myself the whole  time."  </P> <P> Winge believes "The Wild Duck" is Ibsen's most cruel play, meaning his most  deeply cutting, because of the subject matter of a family that lives surrounded  by their own lies and illusions, finally resulting in the tragic suicide of the  family's daughter, Hedvig. It's a subject Ibsen bequeathed to future  playwrights, particularly Eugene O'Neill in "The Iceman Cometh."  </P> <P> Relling, a character in the play, says, "Rob the average man of his basic lie  and you rob him of his happiness as well." It is restating this truth in the  life of Ibsen's characters that creates the hurdles that translators and  directors have to jump without stumbling.  </P> <P> "It's a difficult and personal play," Winge said. "Ibsen couldn't write about  how he felt in letters, so he put it all in 'The Wild Duck.' "  </P> <P> Carlson added that "it took people a long time to digest 'The Wild Duck,' " and  the Ibsen plays that followed. He had broken with a long dramatic tradition,  and "Wild Duck" seemed a parody of an Ibsen play.  </P> <P> "We've got to stop lying to each other," Carlson said the characters in "Wild  Duck" are saying, and it's hard to allow the "wonderful richness and ambiguity  of the characters to open up into the richness and ambiguity of the play  itself."  </P> <P> It's that richness and ambiguity that make the translators' job so difficult,  the director's job so hazardous, the scholar's so endless. Hunting for the  right connotation, the right nuance that will help to explain why Ibsen's  characters hide behind their mendacity and illusions, is as intriguing as  trying to discover why they, like the wild duck when wounded, dive for the  bottom to escape predators.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAF DEFEATS SABATINI, 6-3, 6-2, IN FIRST MATCHUP SINCE U.S. OPEN  </P> <P> Top-seeded Steffi Graf overpowered Gabriela Sabatini, 6-3, 6-2, Sunday to win  the European Indoor tournament for the fourth time.  </P> <P> The meeting was their first since Sabatini beat Graf to win the U.S. Open five  weeks ago.  </P> <P> Graf, apparently recovered from a virus infection flare-up, used her powerful  forehand to keep the second-seeded Sabatini at bay and improved her career  record against the Argentine to 19-4.  </P> <P> "I planned to play aggressively from the start, and it succeeded surprisingly  well," Graf said.  </P> <P> Sabatini, playing less than 24 hours after a grueling three-set semifinal  against Czechoslovakia's Jana Novotna, got off to a slow start and never  recovered. She offered little resistance after losing her serve twice in the  second set to fall behind, 3-1.  </P> <P> Sabatini, fourth in the world rankings, had little chance to display her recent  more aggressive style in the 74-minute match, and several net forays provided  easy points for Graf.  </P> <P> Graf, the world's top-ranked woman player, captured her 52nd victory in a Grand  Prix tournament and a $70,000 first prize.  </P></p>

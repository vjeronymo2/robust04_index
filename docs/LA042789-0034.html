			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN SCRAPS AIRPORT PLAN IN BOW TO CONSERVATIONISTS  </P> <P> In an attempt to boost Japan's image in environmental matters, government  officials announced Wednesday that they will scrap plans to build a landfill  airport near a rare stand of blue coral off a remote island in Okinawa  prefecture.  </P> <P> Junji Nishime, the governor of Okinawa, told a news conference that the  prefectural, or state, government was responding to international criticism and  vociferous local protest in deciding to move the airport project to a new site  about two miles north of the original site.  </P> <P> Environmentalists had waged a campaign to stop construction at the village of  Shiraho on Ishigaki Island, saying it would harm one of the few coral reefs  that has escaped destruction related to development in the Ryukyu Islands. Soil  erosion has brought on a crown-of-thorns starfish infestation that has killed  about 90% of the coral in Okinawa prefecture, marine biologists say.  </P> <P> It was not clear whether the revised construction plan will pose any danger to  the Shiraho reef, or whether the airport will encounter renewed opposition by  residents near the new site.  </P> <P> Nishime, who had maintained that there was no other suitable location for the  runway on Ishigaki Island, made his decision after the central government's  environmental agency came out against the plan. There had been 13 years of  heated controversy.  </P> <P> Masahisa Aoki, director general of the agency, told reporters that Japan is now  adopting a "leadership role in protecting the global environment." The  government plans an international conference on environmental issues in  September.  </P> <P> "It is my conviction that we must protect the coral in Okinawa," Aoki said.  </P> <P> The Shiraho decision is believed to be the first time the agency has asserted  itself to halt a major development project because of potential environmental  impact, according to Cecilia Jung-Sook Song of Traffic (Japan), an  environmental protection group associated with the World Wildlife Fund.  </P> <P> "This is a historic development as far as Japan's environmental policy goes,"  Song said. "Certainly it would have been quite embarrassing if Okinawa had gone  ahead and dumped on Shiraho."  </P> <P> In addition to the World Wildlife Fund, the Cousteau Society and the  International Union for Conservation of Nature have studied the reef and  condemned the $240-million project.  </P> <P> Prefectural officials have argued that a new airport is necessary to  accommodate jumbo jets bringing tourists on direct flights from the main  Japanese islands. They asserted in a series of environmental assessments,  disputed by opponents as lacking scientific credibility, that a 6,600-foot  runway could be built on part of the reef without causing significant harm to a  nearby colony of blue coral.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The North Ossetian and Ingush teams negotiating in  the Kabardino-Balkarian capital Nalchik agreed on April 14 on  the preamble of a final document, a treaty on helping the  refugees in their republics return to their homes, as envisaged  by the Russian president's decree.    Vladimir Lozovoy, head of the interim administration in the  emergency-rule zone, said at a news conference in Nalchik  Thursday night that adoption of the preamble was the main  achievement of the day. He said that the two sides had, at  last, developed the guidelines for further talks. In  particular, the preamble condemns all kinds of extremism and  activities of those who triggered the violence in North Ossetia  in the fall of 1992. The preamble also says that the two sides  will abide by the Russian Federation's Constitution and  ordinances of the Russian government in resolving their problems.    Lozovoy also said that the North Ossetian and Ingush  negotiating teams headed by Presidents Akhsarbek Galazov and  Ruslan Aushev would continue discussion of the draft accord  article by article. The talks were expected to resume in the  Kabardino-Balkarian president's country residence at 11:00  Friday.    Lozovoy said that even though the issues under discussion  were not easy, the atmosphere of the talks was polite and  benevolent. Speaking on the April 12 capture of Ingush hostages  in North Ossetia, Lozovoy said that North Ossetian law  enforcement agencies had been keeping three Ingushis suspected  of crimes committed in the republic. They are in the custody of  the North Ossetian Prosecutor's Office.</p>

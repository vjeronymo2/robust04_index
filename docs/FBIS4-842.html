			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by John Perlman, Janine Lazarus, and Guy Jepson] </F>   [Text] Amid allegations that Police Commissioner General  Johan van der Merwe authorised the sale of 1,000 semi-automatic  rifles from Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] to the Kwazulu  Police [KZP], the SAP [South African Police] yesterday failed to  arrive at a Goldstone Commission hearing called to probe the  attempted weapons deals Eskom's corporate investigations  consultant, Gaf van Niekerk, said yesterday that the export  permit for the weapons (required by law for weapons sales to  "self- governing" territories) had been approved by the police.  He said it had been discussed with the commissioner and signed  by a Major R le Roux on Van der Merwe's behalf.    And Ivan Garb, MD of the firearms dealer involved in the  weapons transaction, yesterday told the inquiry he was also  given to understand that it had been authorised by the  commissioner.    Van der Merwe yesterday denied he had personally authorised  the deal or was aware of it. Speaking from his home yesterday  afternoon, he told WEEKEND STAR. "That is not correct, not at  all."    Van der Merwe said the SAP section responsible for the  issuing of firearm permits had inquired at his office whether  there was any special provision regarding "the issuing of  permits for the exporting of certain arms to KwaZulu".    "My office went through the minutes of the Cabinet and  informed the Firearms Register that there is no such provision  and that they can continue in terms of the normal requirements  of the Arms and Ammunition Act, and they did so."    Yesterday's hearing lasted barely two hours, but the  information that has begun to emerge may well prove to be  explosive when the hearing is reconvened on Wednesday. The  commission heard evidence that Phillip Powell, commander of  KwaZulu's controversial self-protection units, had initiated the  deal from the KwaZulu government side.    Evidence was also presented that while the KwaZulu  government  paid out R2.1 million [rand] for the weapons -- the money was  returned when the deal fell through -- the purchase price for  the guns was just R675,000. Seyeh International, a private  company whose director John Sleep helped to initiate the deal,  made a profit of R1.03 million, with the rest of the balance  going to Garbs, the firearm dealers.    But the biggest surprise came at the start when Mr Justice  Richard Goldstone called the roll of legal counsel and found  that the SAP was not represented. He told the hearing that he  had written to Van der Merwe on Wednesday requesting SAP  representation at yesterday's inquiry. In this letter Mr  Justice Goldstone also asked Van der Merwe to provide the  commission with certain information, including "all documents  and correspondence relating to the issue of the permit for the  delivery of 1,000 LM-4 rifles on Friday, 25 March 1994." This  was the day the Eskom deal was supposed to go through.    The judge asked for the names of the police officials who  had  authorised the permit and the reasons for such authorisation.  He also required information about Eskom's earlier sale of  1,043 G-3 rifles to the KwaZulu Police.    Subsequent correspondence clearly signals a looming  stand-off  between the commission and SA's top policeman. Van der Merwe  replied the following day, saying that "the time allowed was not  sufficient". The commissioner said that the "short notice  received of the inquiry" had made it impossible for the SAP to  "consult with and instruct its legal representatives". He asked  Mr Justice Goldstone to "consider postponing the inquiry to a  mutually arranged date".    The judge replied that the matter had been made public by  Eskom on April 1, "more than two weeks ago". He said the arms  sale on March 25 and "the permit issued on that day by the SAP  are hardly complex matters".    At the hearing, Eskom representative Dr George Lindeque  described how he was on his way to his car when he stumbled  across men loading rifles into trucks parked in the company's  garage. He said a check revealed that Henk Pienaar, Eskom's  head of protective services, knew nothing about the deal. Van  Niekerk told the commission that the vehicles had not been  signed in on Eskom's security register and did not have number  plates.    Stephen Mullins, appearing on behalf of the KwaZulu  government and the KZP, said it had become "increasingly  difficult" to source weapons for the homeland's forces.    Responding to WEEKEND STAR's story last week that a vehicle  belonging to the National Intelligence Service [NIS] had been  seen at Eskom during a weapons transaction NIS head of  information security Andre Roux said inspection of the vehicles  log showed that it had not been used on the day in question. He  said an examination of fuel consumption and questioning of  personnel who controlled the vehicle's use had confirmed this.    Eskom representatives said they "could not find any trace of  (the NIS vehicle) being there". Roux said a vehicle, belonging  to a security company, with a similar registration was at Eskom  on the day in question. Eskom representatives confirmed this.</p>

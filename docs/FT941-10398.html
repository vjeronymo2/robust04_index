			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Frantic trading in Reuters International news and financial information group Reuters Holdings experienced frantic trading as the company announced that it was splitting its shares and came out with full-year results at the top end of market expectations at Pounds 440m. A share split, which will make the stock more marketable and liquid, had been expected, but most analysts had anticipated a three-for-one deal at best. When Reuters declared that investors would have four shares for every one held, the market price moved up so fast that there were periods of backwardation - a situation where the pace of trading leads to bid prices being temporarily higher than the offer price. At one stage it was technically possible to sell Reuters shares at 1980p and buy them back at 1947p. Lehman Brothers raised its 1994 forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 520m, giving 88p of earnings. Henderson Crosthwaite, the agency's broker, raised its estimate by Pounds 20m to Pounds 520m, while BZW adjusted to Pounds 505m from Pounds 482m. The Reuters share price leaped to a high of 2018p before closing 60 up on balance at 1971p after heavy turnover of 2m.</p>

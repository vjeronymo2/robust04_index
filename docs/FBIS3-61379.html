			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Konstantin Taushanzhi, head of the Gagauz </F> People's Party, recorded by P. Lyutyy; place and date not given:  "By the Thorny Path of Choice"]    [Text] The Gagauz People's Party, which is headed by  Konstantin Taushanzhi, the well-known economist and politician  and head of a department of Komrat State University, has  unequivocally advocated elections to the Moldovan Parliament on  the territory of areas of compact residence of the Gagauz. The  Gagauz People's Party (GNP) is guided only by parliamentary  methods, prohibiting confrontation, the use of force, and so  forth.    This is what Konstantin Taushanzhi says on this subject:    [Taushanzhi] First, we are convinced that participation in  the elections expresses the interests of an absolute majority of  the Gagauz population and that there is no alternative to  peaceful dialogue and negotiations. The power method, the method  of confrontation, has not produced and will not produce results.  We have already experienced this, when armed persons prohibited  the inhabitants of our districts from taking part in the  elections for president of the Republic of Moldova. We proceed  from the fact that participation in the elections is the  constitutional duty of each citizen, it is his right and  obligation, if you wish; and if there is even only one single  person wishing to cast his vote for a future deputy, all the  conditions for the realization of his right must be created.  Disregard for this right, pressure, bans, and threats are just  further disgraceful stunts of the compromised leadership of the  Gagauz Republic. They are the embodiment of the ignorance of the  self-proclaimed leaders of Gagauzia, who want to decide for the  people.    [Lyutyy] What is the explanation for the policy of the  present Komrat leaders?    [Taushanzhi] Their fear of the people. After all, their  behavior, all their actions, their spending, and so forth have  to be answered for. The people have been waiting for this  account for three years now. Since 1990, when the workers of the  villages and towns made their modest contribution (money) to the  cause of national revival, for the support of the Provisional  Committee, and then for the opening of the university. We made  these facts known at that time and thanked via the newspaper all  those who made these donations. And now what? The group of  "leaders" has surrounded itself with armed persons and is  pursuing a policy that is bringing the Gagauz people burdens and  deprivations. The present leaders are rejecting all projects; no  proposals for a peaceful settlement of the matter are to their  liking. I am sure that were they given autonomy, even a republic  within a confederative Moldova, they would reject this also.  Because it would, all the same, be necessary to render account  and be responsible. And they have nothing to tell people; they  have brought them to poverty by their obduracy and unwillingness  to conduct a civilized and honest dialogue.    [Lyutyy] Konstantin Petrovich, how did the Gagauz Party  emerge?    [Taushanzhi] It was forced into being by the policy of a  small group of people called leaders who could by turns, without  shame or conscience, trample on anyone who thinks or, even more,  acts differently. The party's goals are a peaceful solution of  the Gagauz issue, the increased social protection of society,  and the realization of economic reforms, and we are opposed to  criminal privatization.    These are the people's hopes.    As far as our opponents are concerned, I would advise them  to  pay heed to the people. But they have become confused. They have  forgotten that the republic should serve the people, not the  other way about. It would now seem that people have been rounded  up by force as hostages; and I am overwhelmed by a sense of  grievance and exasperation that we can find ourselves the  victims in a political game, which is resumed on each occasion  by a "third party," attempting to incite disagreements between  the Gagauz and Moldovans. So I would like to say that the  slogan: "Nobodies have become everything," is once again  pertinent today; that a parallel can be drawn with 1946-1949,  when arrogance and ignorance were dominant and when questions of  the building of the kolkhozes, dispatch to Siberia, and so forth  were decided only by weapons. Can it be that 50 years later we  have taken this same route in Komrat?    It is hard to believe, but it is so. "President" Stepan  Topal  appeals to the people "to defend Gagauz's gains." What is he  talking about?! Can it not be seen that the living standard is  falling and that crime is growing menacingly? The "upper  stratum" has sunk to an impossible level. What is happening  currently in Komrat is reminiscent of a sandbox game: We have  created a republic with the name of "Laughter and Tears," we  have created a state, seemingly, in which turmoil and  lawlessness reign (but there is a heap of ministers, on the  other hand!). For this reason there is no Gagauz Republic either  de facto or de jure. There is a handful of adventurers, and  that's that.    [Lyutyy] What can you say about the party's immediate plans?    [Taushanzhi] Soon we will be choosing the parties to which  to  affiliate at the elections. We are oriented as yet toward the  three parties that support the integrity and independence of  Moldova, oppose unification with anyone at all, and support the  Gagauz areas being given special status within the framework of  international law. We regret that the Parliament of the Republic  of Moldova has not lowered for us the 4 percent quota at the  elections.    Further, we understand that the leaders from Komrat have a  desire to preserve the conflict with Chisinau (in order that it  might always be possible to exacerbate relations as they see  fit), but the position of certain ministers of the Republic of  Moldova, who in the guise of compromises are supporting the  present Komrat leaders in every possible way, is absolutely  incomprehensible.    Time will tell how correct our course proves, but even today  the number of people supporting and sympathizing with us is  getting larger and larger. And this implants confidence in the  choice of a difficult, but correct and honest path for the  achievement of the hopes and aspirations of the Gagauz people.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Letter: Strong case for forgiving debt of low-income Africa Sir, Mr Lawrence Summers, the chief economist at the World Bank who shot to fame when he proposed the transfer of polluting industries to the third world, has made a valiant attempt to rehabilitate himself by advocating a substantial forgiveness of the debt which is owed by low-income Africa (Personal View: 'The lessons of debt', August 3). The case for urgent debt forgiveness could not be stronger. Drought is threatening the lives of some 18m people in 10 southern African countries. The lives of another 130m are seriously at risk, according to the United Nations. Yet, instead of building food stocks and strengthening their agricultural sector against recurrent drought, these countries have been spending their foreign exchange earnings to pay back debt. In 1990, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Tanzania all used up more than a quarter of their foreign exchange earnings for this purpose. The situation would have been far worse were it not for the rescheduled payments and the build-up of arrears. Tanzania, and now Zambia, have been granted Trinidad Terms of debt relief on 50 per cent of the debt falling due in the next years. As Mr Summers acknowledges, much more is required. The World Development Movement agrees with the United Nations that all of the official bilateral debt of the poorest countries in Africa must be cancelled. But while industrial country governments, with the exception of US, are doing their tiny bit to reduce the debt burden, multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have failed sub-Saharan African countries. Around 40 per cent of their debt servicing (excluding Nigeria) goes to multilateral institutions, and this debt cannot be rescheduled. Mr Summers can only hope to start to rebuild his tattered image if he tackles the debt haemorrhage his own institution is causing Africa.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government and electric power companies on 17  February agreed to slow down the rate at which they use  plutonium and to delay -- by up to 20 years -- the start-up of  the second nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, the use of nuclear  fuel in light- water reactors, and the start of construction of  a demonstration fast breeder reactor.    Japan at present has an unusual plutonium utilization plan,  but in view of international criticism of the plan and its  economic feasibility, it seems certain Japan will make major  changes to it. These changes will be incorporated in the  government's long-term program on the development and use of  nuclear power, which is now being revised.    The second reprocessing plant is scheduled to be built after  the one under construction now in Rokkasho-mura, Aormori  Prefecture, is completed. Under current plans, the plant is  targeted for completion and start-up by around 2010. The plan  is being revised to delay completion until 2030.    The reason given for the revision is that if the plant  starts  up in 2010, the plutonium it produces may be in excess of  domestic requirements. This would break the national pledge not  to "possess plutonium in excess of needs."    In addition, the government and power companies have not yet  been able to decide on what new technology should be used on the  second reprocessing plant -- on the reprocessing of fuel  generated by the fast breeder reactor, for instance.    The revised long-term plan, consequently, is not expected to  carry a specific plant completion date but to state, instead,  that a policy on the issue will be presented in about 2010.    Since the delay in the construction of the second  reprocessing plant will mean that existing power plants become  short of storage space for the spent fuel from nuclear power  reactors, the revised plan will present measures which include  dry storage [kanshiki chozo].    The power companies have between them agreed to  simultaneously start using plutonium in light-water reactors in  1998.    Under the current plan, two reactors are supposed to begin  using plutonium in the latter half of the 1990's, and 12 others  are to begin using it after 2000. Under the revision, each of  the 10 electric power companies will use it in at least one of  their reactors, and up to 15 reactors will be using it  nationally by 2010.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFE-PASSAGE DEAL WITH AFGHAN REBELS REPORTED;  </P> <P> FOOD, FUEL CONVOY REACHES KABUL  </P> <P> A convoy of several hundred trucks carrying food and fuel from the Soviet Union  reached the Afghan capital virtually unscathed Saturday following a deal  reportedly struck between rebels and President Najibullah.  </P> <P> Afghan officials said up to 600 trucks arrived in Kabul from the Soviet border  town of Termez, and 300 more are expected today.  </P> <P> Drivers reported foul weather along the route down the Salang Highway from the  Soviet border to Kabul through territory held by Muslim rebels, but only a  single attack, apparently launched by a rival group not a party to the deal.  </P> <P> "There was only one moujahedeen attack," said Abdul Fatah, a convoy organizer.  He said three rockets were fired from mountains north of Kabul. One set fire to  a fuel tanker, but the driver survived.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allowed Safe Passage  </P> <P> An Afghan official said Najibullah and his Marxist People's Democratic Party of  Afghanistan government struck a deal with a rebel commander controlling Kabul  province and the Salang area to allow the convoy to pass safely.  </P> <P> He declined to name him, but a diplomat said it probably was Ahmed Shah Masoud,  the most successful moujahedeen field commander in the nine-year fight against  Afghan troops and the now-departed Soviet forces.  </P> <P> Masoud is reported to have extended his reach northward to Kunduz province near  the Soviet border.  </P> <P> "Yes there was a deal," said Fatah. "Masoud does not stop food and fuel for  Kabul now. The rockets were fired by Gulbuddin's men," he added, referring to  Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a hard-line Afghan rebel leader opposed to any compromise  with Najibullah.  </P> <P> The deal would account for both the arrival of the convoy, which had been  delayed for nearly a week, and the absence of rebel shelling or rocket attacks  on Kabul in the past 12 days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Food and Land  </P> <P> The official said the quid pro quo for the rebel commander would be food, land,  fertilizers, an assurance that he would be allowed to retain de facto control  over his areas of influence and even the right to buy arms.  </P> <P> The officials said that the week's delay in the arrival of the trucks, eagerly  awaited in a city short of flour, meat and fuel, was caused by snow, not rebel  attacks, and that the government forces still control all four of the main  roads leading to the city.  </P> <P> A deal with Masoud could bolster Najibullah and his party against the rival  government elected by rebel political leaders at a council meeting, or shura,  in Pakistan last month.  </P> <P> It would also lend credence to reports of a rift between rebel political  leaders and the moujahedeen fighters who waged the war against Soviet and  Afghan troops.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hard Winter  </P> <P> The past winter has been the worst in years in Afghanistan, and snow still lies  thick on the hills surrounding Kabul.  </P> <P> In spite of shortages, most foods are still widely available in Kabul at a  price. The poor are the worst affected, but there appears to be no threat of  starvation.  </P> <P> Fruit, vegetables, cooking oil and other necessities are on display in the  shops and bazaars and those lining up for bread are mainly poor people unable  to afford decontrolled prices.  </P> <P> Some officials said a voucher system for bread, gasoline, sugar and some other  staples would be announced this week. It was not clear whether the convoy's  arrival would alter this.  </P> <P> The most visible effect of the shortages is the lack of traffic on the roads  because of the scarcity of gasoline.  </P></p>

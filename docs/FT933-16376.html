			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Chianti rings the changes - Wine WHEN IN 1984 the whole Chianti region was awarded the top Garantita appellation, the wine's reputation and sales suffered. For how can millions of bottles produced by thousands of growers be 'guaranteed?'. However, two negative factors were reduced at the same time. The high stipulated percentages in the blend of dull, high-yielding Trebbiano grapes and over-productive Canaiolo were cut and and now are often ignored. One grower in the Classico zone said: 'I have Trebbiano in the vineyard but not in the wine.' Also the maximum permitted yield per ha was reduced from 70 to 52.5 hl. Moreover, in the leading Classico district the need for improved quality has been recognised and, with the support of the Black Rooster Consorzio's 600 members, Sangiovese Classico 2000 was set up in 1988. Experimental vineyards were organised throughout the area. New Sangiovese clones and new cultivation methods are being tested at a time when the massive and often ill-advised planting in the 1960s and early 1970s must soon be replaced. New legislation is planned to alter the future of high-quality vino da tavola. These were started with Antinori's Tignanello 1971, as a protest against the high percentage of Trebbiano and other minor grape varieties in the official blend and the refusal to admit the Cabernets and Merlot. The Classico appellation will be allowed blends containing 100 per cent Sangiovese, already a feature of vini da tavola, including Isole e Elena's esteemed Ceparello and Fontodi's Flaccianello. Further, this would be permitted for single-vineyard wines such as Tignanello, which would be entirely acceptable to Antinori. In five years' time, one leading grower told me, vini da tavola will be confined to the basic wines they were intended to represent. Then, minimum planting density per hectare will be increased from 2,500 to 3,500 vines, although this is thought to be insufficient by the best growers, who plant between 4,000 and 5,000. though no further reduction in maximum yields is yet provided for, informed opinion believes they should be reduced to 40-45 hl per ha. But in Italian wine politics nothing is certain until the decree is signed. Moreover, the Classico proprietors are expecting a separate Chianti Classico DOCG, as reasonably they claim a higher status than the great mass of Chianti made from Pisa to Siena. A new DOCG would also apply to the small district of Rufina, to the east of Florence, which includes such respected estates as Frescobaldi, Selvapiana and Grati. Finally, a Vino da Toscano is projected. The effect of all these changes would be to create a pyramid with single-vineyard wines at the top. This would certainly make selection easier for consumers. The developments will not only apply to Chianti. Sassicaia on the Tuscan coast at Bolgheri, where white and rose wines are already DOC, is likely to become Sassicaia Bolgheri DOC, and, in view of its long-established reputation, DOCG; to be followed by the new Ornellaia. Altogether, this will cause a revaluation of the role of superior Chiantis. In the old, fiasco-bottled days, Chianti was regarded as little more than a quaffing wine, with little concern for vintage or maturing possibilities. But today the Riservas have to be kept in cask for three calendar years, and even the normal Classico must have a year in wood before being marketed. Good vintages like '85 and '88 deserve at least seven or eight years in age, and the exceptional ones like '82, '83 and '90 often much longer. As few of us are familiar with the varying quality of the vintages, notes on the last 12 Classicos may be helpful: '81 - good bouquet, medium body, developed early but ageing well; '82 - after an exceptionally dry summer an outstanding vintage, harmonious and at peak; '83 - again very hot summer, fine nose, good body, lower than normal acidity; '84 - very wet September, and poor, light wine; '85 - big structure, full-bodied, highly regarded year, and still very good; '86 - early vintage, big aroma, well-balanced, softer than '85 or '88, but concentrated; '87 - high yields after rain at vintage, moderate quality, to be drunk; '88 - big wine, still closed, tannic but should develop well; '89 - generally a poor year, light and for early drinking, few Riservas; '90 - outstanding - 'the best for 50 years', said one grower in adjoining Rufina. True also in Classico. Still closed. A wine to keep; '91 - light wines for early drinking, not much quality; '92 heavy rain from the end of September spoiled the crop, but those who picked early made attractive wines.</p>

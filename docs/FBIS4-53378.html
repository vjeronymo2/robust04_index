			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 19 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Economic growth  in the Asia-Pacific region is a challenge but is in the same  time also an opportunity for ASEAN which conduct an open  economic system, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Industry  and Trade Hartarto said here on Wednesday.    "To face the challenge, ASEAN's economy should be turned  into  a more efficient one. Apart from that the quality of their  products as well as management should be improved to achieve  world standards," he said at an international conference,  entitled "Waves of The Future -- ASEAN, Vietnam, and China:  Opportunities for World Business."    At the conference which lasts from May 17 through 19, the  Indonesian coordinating minister further said that a number of  opportunities would be wide open for ASEAN investors to conduct  business in rapid developing countries in the field of industry,  including China, India, and Vietnam.    "These countries are potential markets for our exports," he  added.    According to Hartarto, those countries provide comparative  advantages in industry which is labour-intensive with relatively  low labour wages and a hard working labour force.    ASEAN should make the necessary adjustment if it wants to be  successful in an increasingly stiff competition.    Hartarto also touched on the success of the Uruguay Round  and  the acceptance of GATT and its connection with ASEAN. He  further believed that the success of the Uruguay Round would  contribute to ASEAN's economic growth and after the ratification  of the GATT, the Association of Southeast Asian nations would  have access into the international market without any obstacles.    In his working paper entitled "ASEAN: New Opportunities and  Challenges," the coordinating minister reiterated the ASEAN  position and that of the developing countries which rejected the  interconnection of trade with social and labour standard issues,  urging that these issues be tackled by existing international  organizations.    The ASEAN labour ministers, who convened here from May 16  through 17, urged the International Labour Organization (ILO) to  oppose the Western countries pressure to protect their domestic  markets.    The Western countries should not be permitted to force the  ILO to apply stiff labour standards as a precondition for the  developing countries to obain market access, said a joint  communique of the ASEAN ministers.    After seven years of negotiations on the GATT, the 125  participating countries agreed to implement the GATT at the last  meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco on April 15.    The centre of attention of the GATT is world economic growth  based on free trade and multilateral system or on an open and  transparent system.    The World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trade  body, will replace the GATT and is expected to have more power  to eradicate global protectionism.    Meanwhile, social clauses interlinked with international  trade agreements are considered as a new form of protectionism.  Hartarto stated that the European Union and the NAFTA should  remain open and transparent as was the case with the ASEAN  economy which adhered to the open system, so that in the future  Europe, North America, and Asia would achieve a favourable  economic balance without one region considering itself dominant.    Hartarto went on to state that when competition became  increasingly stiff, increasing productivity in the three regiona  would become a driving force for world economic growth and  expansion of world trade which in turn would also create new  opportinuities for all countries. The coordinating minister for  industry and trade also revealed that the ASEAN Free Trade Area  (AFTA) was established to face global challenges. The aim of  the AFTA is to enhance economic cooperation among the ASEAN  member countries through the application of the Common Effective  Preferential Tariff (CEPT) which will be in force as of January  1993, Hartarto said.</p>

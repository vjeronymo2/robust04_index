			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Redefining the Treasury role Sir, Sir Terry Burns' belief that 'the Treasury should not remodel itself as merely the finance department of UK plc' is correct ('Civil Service Reorganisation: Mandarins try to please the critics', October 20). It is in fact the Treasury's financial control functions which should be taken away so that it becomes only the Ministry of Economics (It was in trying to start up a competitive ministry that the then prime minister Harold Wilson made one of his many mistakes.) The Treasury could also inherit some of the regulatory trade functions of the Department of Trade and Industry with consequent savings there. The Treasury may have a poor record in forecasting, but anyone who has had anything to do with it knows that its ability to handle budgeting and financial control is even worse. We need a new ministry with new people who understand these things. What is required is an inquiry into the system as it works at the moment, including the auditing function and parliamentary scrutiny, and some consideration of alternatives (including those methods used by our EU partners). This must be done by a group which has internal civil service and external industrial and financial experience and not by the Treasury's inspectors, another group which in my experience fell far short of what was necessary to discharge the function.

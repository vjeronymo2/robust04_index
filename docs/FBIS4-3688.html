			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  Premier Li Peng met with Kyrgyz parliament leader Medetkan  Sherimkulov here today.    In the meeting, Li noted that the legislative bodies of the  two countries have built up a good basis for cooperation. He  hoped to see further exchanges between the two parliaments at  all levels.    "With joint efforts of leaders and peoples of the two  countries, Sino-Kyrgyz relations will surely be promoted." he  said.    Sherimkulov, who visited China last May, said he expected to  receive Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's  National People's Congress, in Kyrgyzstan at an early date, so  as to usher in a new stage of contact between the parliament of  the two countries.</p>

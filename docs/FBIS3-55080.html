			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In December, a meeting was held in Khyriv in Lvov  Oblast between representatives of the Lvov Railroad and the  National Railroads of Poland. The meeting was devoted to  Ukraine's repeated requests to initiate direct railroad links  between the Ukrainian juncture of Khyriv and Kroscienko in  Poland. This would grant Ukraine additional access to Germany,  Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Having spent 222  million karbovanetses on preparations for this undertaking,  Ukraine planned to open the route on 31 December 1993.    However, the Polish side declared that the lack of  appropriate infrastructure for customs and border troops would  hinder the process. The Poles also did not agree to operate a  joint customs and border checkpoint on Ukrainian territory.  Following this declaration, Lvov Railroad Deputy Manager  Tkachuk threatened to block the Polish Przemysl-Kroscienko route  stretching in part via the Ukrainian station of Khyriv.  According to MOLODA HALYCHYNA, the threat worked and the Polish  side gave in.    Volodymyr Kulyk, head of the International Routes Department  deemed as "absolute nonsense" the report on Tkachuk's ultimatum.  According to him, the route will open no sooner than 31 May 1994.</p>

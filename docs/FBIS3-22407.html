			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Algeria and France: A Partnership To </F> Fight Pollution" -- first paragraph is ALGER REPUBLICAIN  introduction]    [Text] Researchers and industrialists who are partners in a  French- Algerian program for scientific cooperation in the area  of used water treatment will meet on 21 January at the French  National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) in Montpellier to  assess their work.    Focusing on establishing efficient, innovative technologies  and the training of national specialists in Algeria through a  knowledge transfer, this program, after two years in existence,  was found to have yielded a "very positive" outcome by the  CNRS's Languedoc-Roussillon regional delegation. The delegation,  in a communique sent Friday to APS, found that "original  solutions have been found to treat effluents from the National  Cellulose and Paper Industry's [CELPAP] pulp paper plant in  Baba-Ali, near Algiers" and that "about 15 internships have been  served in Montpellier by Algerian engineers."    "This effort," the delegation added, "which is aimed at  implementing new membrane technologies to remove the pollution  from the water supplies of the countries of the Maghreb and at  the fight against pollution in the Mediterrean, has been  strengthened by another cooperative program financed by the  European Community between the Montpellier teams and the  Algerian (especially from the National Polytechnic and  Houari-Boumediene University) and Moroccan (University of Fes)  teams."    According to the CNRS's regional delegation, "the success of  this cooperation is based on the sharing by numerous agencies  (universities, research agencies, and industrialists)" and it  emphasized "the importance of the specific progress made in  Montpellier in the area of membrane technologies."    These programs, based on the principle of partnership and  shared objectives, reflect the spirit and the organization of  scientific cooperation with countries on the southern rim of the  Mediterranean as envisioned by the CNRS and reflect the  willingness of that agency to strengthen relations with the  industrial sector.</p>

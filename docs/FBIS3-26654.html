The meeting relayed the guidelines of  the national meeting on judicial and security work, summarized  last year's judicial and security work in Beijing, and made  arrangements for this year's work. Chen Xitong, secretary of  the municipal party committee, stressed: This year, all  professions and trades in the municipality must regard the  safeguarding of the capital's political stability and social  order as a matter of prime importance. Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan  and Chen Yiping, deputy secretary general of the Central  Political and Legal Commission, attended the meeting and made  speeches.    At the meeting, Wang Tong, member of the standing committee  of the municipal party committee and secretary of the municipal  political and legal committee, made a report entitled "Implement  the Guidelines of the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, Go All Out To Safeguard the Capital's Political  Stability and Social Order, and Make Even Greater Contributions  to Helping the People Become Relatively Well-off."    It is learned that last year, political and legal  departments  in the municipality conscientiously implemented the guidelines  of the 14th CPC Congress, persisted in the party's basic line,  further emancipated the mind, strengthened and reformed the  judicial and security work, gave full play to their functions  and role, and safeguarded the capital's political stability and  social order in coordination with various other departments  under the support of the broad masses of the people. As a  result, a fine social environment and legal guarantee were  provided for reform, opening up, and economic development, a  marked progress was made in improving the style of thinking and  the style of work among the ranks of judicial, procuratorial,  and court workers, and the goal of "making this year's work  better than last year's" was attained.    Li Qiyan said: The capital's judicial and security work is  very important. The good result achieved in this work last  year was ascribed to the hard work of the comrades on the  political and legal fronts. In this new year, our tasks on  reform and development are heavy, while our tasks on judicial  and security work are even heavier. To successfully accomplish  these tasks, we should first of all emancipate the mind and  focus the judicial and security work on ensuring the creation of  a peaceful and stable social environment and ensuring the even  faster development of the economy. We hope that the comrades of  judicial and security fronts will enhance understanding, work  hard, and use practical actions to ensure that the party's basic  line is truly implemented in Beijing and ensure that Beijing  will do all its work in an even better manner, with economic  construction as the central link.    Chen Xitong said in his speech: We must pay attention to  maintaining the capital's political stability and social order  by regarding it as the matter of prime importance. This is the  most important task of all professions and trades in the  municipality. This year, our country will set forth major  measures for reform, and reform has entered the new stage of  pressing ahead in an all-round way and making breakthroughs in  key areas. Currently, our country's situation is very good, and  the people throughout the country are high-spirited and working  vigorously, thus setting off a new upsurge of construction. To  ensure the implementation of reform measures and the even faster  development of the economy, a peaceful and stable social  environment is indispensable. Therefore, the capital must  achieve success in safeguarding political stability and  maintaining social order.    He added: The capital's work concerning public order must be  grasped further. Generally speaking, Beijing's situation in  public order is good, but it still lags behind the demand.  Thus, we cannot be satisfied with it. The work concerning  public order is the matter with which all the people should be  concerned. We should pay attention to tackling the problems  concerning public order in a comprehensive way and truly set up  a network of mass participation in preventing and controlling  crimes. We should also successfully maintaining public order to  ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic  construction.    Chen Xitong said in conclusion: Party committees and  governments at all levels must assume responsibility for  security work and introduce strict responsibility system. Party  committees and governments at all levels should be responsible  for maintaining social order and stability, and whenever there  are problems, they should be ready to face and tackle them. We  should set up strict responsibility system to make all  departments and regions to be responsible for "defending the  land." This is the only way to mobilize the initiative of the  masses.    Also attending the meeting were leaders Yang Chaoshi, Meng  Zhiyuan, Feng Mingwei, Shen Rendao, Sheng Liangang, Su  Zhongxiang, He Fangbo, and Fan Yuanmou.</p>

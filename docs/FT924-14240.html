			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: A transport of delight - Spoken Word GOOD RECORDINGS of Spoken Word can transport us, lock, stock and barrel, into other worlds and other eras. While we listen we are, in a real sense, spell-bound. Easily top of the latest collection of spell-binders is Edward Petherbridge's reading of E M Forster's first novel, his tragi-comedy of 1905, Where Angels Fear To Tread (Sterling Audio Books SAB OS2; six cassettes; five hours; unabridged). In a luminous performance of the greatest delicacy and intelligence, Petherbridge realises suburban Sawston, all prickly English respectability, as well as the dusty and sun-drenched Tuscan hill village of Monteriano, where a young, well-to-do, silly widow from Sawston is regretting her hasty marriage to an idle Italian youth. (The gulf between the southern and northern temperaments pre-figures uncannily the greater chasm discovered in A Passage To India.) The comedy is dry, the tragedy appalling. Almost a century later, in Rat Race by Dick Francis, nicely read by Ian Ogilvy (Word For Word Audio Books WFW 102; four cassettes; six hours; unabridged), we enter a special world where small-time air-taxi charter firms touch the world of racing. Taut story-telling, tense action, first rate listening. From the same list, Ruth Rendell's whodunnit, Wolf To The Slaughter (WFW 105; six cassettes; six hours; unabridged), a story of sadism and sexual obsession, is strongly and sympathetically read by Robin Bailey with one of the most persuasive voices in the business. John Buchan's Salute To Adventurers (Schiltron Audio Books SPF 090; six cassettes; eight hours 22 minutes; abridged) published in 1915, is set in the last years of the 17th century and recounts the adventures of impoverished young Andrew Garvald from the Lanark moors, sent on business to far-off Virginia. What landscapes Buchan could record, what action] One of the most rewarding adventure stories I have listened to for a long time, and superbly read by the Scottish actor Robert Trotter. Colin Wilson achieved instant fame at the age of 25 when his study of alienation, The Outsider, was published in 1956. In The Essential Colin Wilson, a CD from Nimbus Records (NI 5124; 68 minutes), he lays bare the heart of his existentialist philosophy. 'The Peak Experience' he celebrates is instantly recognisable, and he is an optimist. He believes humanity may evolve to inhabit that world of fulfilment we only catch glimpses of at present. An expert speaker, and a fascinating listen. It makes you think. Wilson has also written a provocative introduction to another CD, which the Medici String Quartet has made to celebrate the inauguration of Kingston University. Mozart's Journey To Prague (MQCD 6005; 79 minutes; DDD) is a playlet (written by Wilson himself for the occasion) in which a chance meeting between Mozart (Richard McCabe) and the Countess of Shinzburg (Dorothy Tutin) gives an opportunity for much good talk and a master class on his quartets for 'her' musicians, who give a delightful concert. There are two other highly entertaining words-and-music recordings from Nimbus Records, each consisting of two CDs: Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince with four other stories from the same volume (NI 1797; two hours approx; music from Vaughan Williams, Granados, Ravel and Shostakovitch), and an abridged version of Alice In Wonderland (NI 5046/7; two hours approx; music from Mendelssohn's String Symphonies). The reader in both is the protean Sir John Gielgud at his exhilarating best. Probably intended for the children, but will be much enjoyed by their elders. This season's harvest of short stories includes some real winners. The Dead And Other Stories (CSA Telltapes TTDMC 415; two cassettes; three hours approx) is a selection from James Joyce's Dubliners (published in 1914), read with dIgnity and charm by the Joyce specialist, T P McKenna. Five lively miniatures lead up to the beautifully observed and subtly developed longer story, The Dead, about a small Christmas dance and a middle-aged husband's unexpected access of desire. A darling set. The Bottom Line And The Sharp Edge (TTDMC 414; two cassettes; three hours approx) offers seven stories from clever Fay Weldon, who examines her contemporaries with a cool stare and generally finds more to blame in the men than in the women. The first story, Man With No Eyes, and the title story are outstanding; all are strongly read by Julie Christie. Woman's Hour Short Stories (BBC Radio Collection ZBBC 1335; two cassettes; two hours 30 minutes) is a collection of 12 attractive 12-minute stories, some very moving, such as Cora Sandel's There's A War On, some hilarious, like Rumer Godden's To Uncle With Love, with jewel-bright readings from Patricia Hodge, Beryl Bainbridge, reading one of her own stories, Kate Binchy and others, including three men. Jeffrey Archer's A Quiverful Of Arrows - Vol Two (TTDMC 410; two cassettes; three hours approx) has six stories, the two longest of which are about money and all of which have Archer's famous 'twist in the tale'. Expertly read by Martin Jarvis. The Vicar Of Nibblewick And Other Stories (Random Century Audiobooks RC 114; two cassettes; three hours approx) is the first recording of any of the late Roald Dahl's short stories for grown ups, and the title story (in truth a rather inflated joke) was written not long before he died. Of the other five, two are frightening, one is quaint, Mr Botibol is delectable (but did the author think he had invented the name of Angel Botibol, that respected London tobacconist?) And Taste, about wine-snobs, is displeasing. Stephen Fry reads them all with a nicely ironical tone (but with one mistaken pronunciation which will be picked up by even the least snobby of claret-fanciers). He also delivers Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Verses (RC 116; two cassettes; three hours approx) with panache and high good humour in the best performance of them I have heard. I firmly believe that there is a place for abridged versions of novels and Random Century Audiobooks produces some good ones. The narrator of Margaret Atwood's Cat's Eye (RC66; two cassettes; three hours approx; abridged) claims that 'Time is not a line but a dimension . . . You don't look back along time but down through it, like water.' She has come back to Toronto and ineluctably relives the unhappiness her hateful 'best friend', Cordelia, inflicted on her in childhood. But why isn't Cordelia there now, when she needs her oldest friend to grow old with? Thanks to Kate Nelligan's reading, Toronto has us spell-bound.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 20 June, Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE Minsk  Group, and Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's special  envoy, conveyed a joint letter to President Geydar Aliyev,  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, and the head of the Armenian  community in Daghlyk Karabakh on the need for the consolidation  of the cease-fire agreement in the region. An AZERTAC  correspondent has asked Vefa Gulizade, state adviser on foreign  policy affairs, to comment on the letter. He said the following:    I wish to stress that the letter is the initial outcome of  the effective cooperation between the CSCE and the Russian  Federation. Jan Eliasson held talks with [name and title  indistinct], First Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin [name as  heard], and Vladimir Kazimirov in Moscow during the past few  days. The need to find a peaceful solution to the dispute  between Armenia and Azerbaijan within the CSCE framework was  emphasized. The representatives of the nine CSCE Minsk Group  members will meet in Vienna on 7 July. Vladimir Kazimirov will  also attend that meeting. The most important point in the  letter is the call to the disputing sides to take advantage of  the cease-fire and sign a political agreement to completely end  the bloody confrontation and move to resolve all the problems  through talks.</p>

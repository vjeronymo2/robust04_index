			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: M&amp;S helps Stirling double to Pounds 5.8m STIRLING GROUP, the clothing manufacturer which supplies Marks and Spencer, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.64m to Pounds 5.84m in the year to March 31 on turnover 48 per cent higher at Pounds 100.8m. Mr Peter Sheldon, chairman and chief executive, put the advance down to a number of reasons, but singled out the long-term solidity of its relationship with M&amp;S, its 'principal customer', which accounted for about Pounds 70m of turnover. This, however, was from a period of 53 sales weeks at M&amp;S. High volume production runs for M&amp;S had lengthened as the retailer reduced the number of suppliers, Mr Sheldon said, enabling Stirling to achieve greater efficiencies and lift operating margins for its M&amp;S business to 7 per cent. Mr Sheldon said that although Stirling was 'very reliant' on M&amp;S, so also was M&amp;S on its leading 10 suppliers. He said the year had been 'one of consolidation of our recent acquisitions'  -the most important of which was another M&amp;S supplier, Ritz Design, in December 1991 for Pounds 19.2m. It contributed Pounds 40m of turnover and enabled the group to be closed with the loss of some 440 jobs. Mr Sheldon said that progress was due to the contract division, with importing and brands making 'only small contributions'. During the year Boftex, a UK importer with a Hong Kong-based sourcing operation, was bought for Pounds 440,000. Since its integration and the ironing out of volume problems, Mr Sheldon expects an improvement from the import side. Main customers here include C&amp;A, Burton, Littlewoods and BhS. Brands, which include Rigby &amp; Peller and Fantasie, take a while to achieve strong profits growth, Mr Sheldon said. Net interest payable was Pounds 712,000 (Pounds 199,000) - the Ritz acquisition included Pounds 4.5m, now Pounds 3.5m, of medium-term debt. The final dividend is lifted to 1.35p (1.15p) for a total of 1.85p (1.65p), covered 2.1 times by earnings of 3.92p (3.08p) per share.</p>

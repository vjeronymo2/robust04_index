			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Risk and Reward: Place your bets on the Bundesbank's next move WILL European interest rates fail to drop as fast next year as forward prices in the money markets predict? Or will they fall faster? Whichever the outcome, a rash of structured products is currently on offer for investors who want to gear up their bets on what the Bundesbank does next. Betting on the speed of European interest rate cuts has been a popular game from New York to Tokyo for more than a year now. Following the September mayhem in currency markets, though, activity has picked up in recent weeks. Earlier this year, US investors were driven by a desire to earn high European-style interest rates at a time when US rates were low. The 'diff swap', which enables them to swap a US income stream for a European-style one, was one answer. Now, though, they are more interested in how to benefit from the falling differential between interest rates in the two continents. Structured notes issued by banks are one answer - particularly for US or Japanese investors who want to avoid the risks of holding European currencies. Returns to the investor are tied to the change in the differential between US and European interest rates over the next year. For instance, the spread between US and German six-month Libor is nearly 500 basis points at present, while the markets expect the gap to have narrowed to a little over 100 basis points by the end of 1993. Goldman Sachs, one of the US banks in London to sell structured notes, predicts that the spread a year from now will stand at 360 basis points. It therefore recommends a note that pays out a premium if the gap does not narrow to less than, say, 250 basis points. If the markets are right, of course, and the gap narrows faster than this, anyone buying such a note could quickly see their investment being eaten into. Yield curve bets like these could be constructed by investors from scratch, avoiding the investment banks' own profit margin, though for all but the biggest that may prove difficult or expensive. An alternative bet which has been popular among Japanese investors this year is the reverse floater, says Mr Nick Burge of Nomura International. Normally issued in small tranches under medium-term note programmes, these instruments pay a higher yield as interest rates fall. Reverse floaters were a popular bet on falling Japanese interest rates at the start of this year, he says, and have now taken hold in European currencies as well. RENEWED tensions in Europe's exchange rate mechanism in the lead up to the Edinburgh summit caused some parts of the currency options market to all but seize up at the end of last week. Gridlocks like this have become familiar in recent months, ebbing and flowing with the tide of speculation in the spot foreign exchange markets. With markets becoming seasonally less liquid anyway as the end of the year approaches, it seems unlikely that things are likely to get better soon. 'Liquidity in (options on) the smaller ERM currencies has been very thin - though it has held up quite well in the Pounds /D-Mark,' said Mr Keith Darlington of ICI's treasury department. Mr Bob Jolly, an associate director of County NatWest Investment Management, agreed: 'FFr/D-Mark is not being quoted at all, or is being quoted on massive spreads.' Volatility for one week FFr/D-Mark options was being quoted on Friday at a spread of 5-15 per cent: a reflection of the fact that few banks wanted to write options, since to do so would leave them exposed to any sharp swing in the exchange rate. For ERM currencies expected to move within narrow fluctuation bands, these volatility levels showed just how high the pressure on the franc had risen by the end of last week. The French currency is not alone. The implied volatility levels used to price options on most European currencies have been edging higher again in recent weeks, having slipped back after the traumas of September. This is not just within the ERM: the three-month volatility of both sterling and the D-Mark against the Dollars was around 15-16 per cent at the end of last week.</p>

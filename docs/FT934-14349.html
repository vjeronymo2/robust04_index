			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Curb on blood products may spark trade dispute A FRESH trade dispute is brewing as the European Community moves to restrict and eventually ban US imports of blood plasma and related products worth Dollars 650m (Pounds 430m) a year. Plasma importers are lobbying hard in Brussels against the proposed restrictions - and the US government is preparing to intervene on their side if necessary. The EC in 1989 adopted the goal of eventual 'self-sufficiency through voluntary unpaid donations' after blood products, mainly from the US, infected several thousand Europeans with the Aids virus, HIV. But until this year, little had been done to implement the policy. Europe uses 6.3m litres a year of plasma, the clear protein-rich fluid in which blood cells float. Half of this comes from paid American donors. Most is shipped as frozen plasma from which medical products such as Factor VIII, immunoglobulins and albumin are extracted. Prompted by resolutions in the European Parliament, the Commission is backing measures to boost production from volunteer donors and phase out imports. These will be considered at a meeting of EC health ministers in December. Three countries - Belgium, France and the Netherlands - are leading the way with legislation to ban products from paid donors. They are already self-sufficient or nearly so. Germany, Italy and Spain are far more dependent on US imports and could not realistically phase them out for some years. Advocates of self-sufficiency and voluntary donation include the Red Cross and most national blood collection agencies. They say paid donors are more likely than volunteers to be infected with sexually transmitted and blood-borne viruses - and that paid donation unfairly exploits poor and vulnerable people. On the other side are commercial manufacturers, which claim that procedures for screening plasma and eliminating infection are superior in the US. Mr Bob Reilly, executive director of the International Plasma Products Industry Association, said: 'From our point of view, European 'self-sufficiency' is a trade barrier and any attempt to stop Dollars 650m worth of US imports on 'safety' grounds is unjustified protectionism.' Member companies of the IPPIA include Baxter International, the giant US blood products group, as well as US subsidiaries of Germany's Bayer, France's Rhone-Poulenc and Japan's Green Cross. Caught in the middle are patient groups such as the European Haemophilia Consortium, which supports self-sufficiency from unpaid donors as a long-term objective but rejects 'any unrealistic timescale for implementation' that would disrupt supplies of the clotting agent Factor VIII.</p>

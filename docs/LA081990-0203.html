			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE LEADERS OF THE BANDS  </P> <P> When popular bandleaders became the new American heroes, Hollywood jumped on  the bandwagon. True to American motion-picture tradition, these musical heroes  were white, mostly pleasant young men looking for a special sound and finding  it with an amiable, supportive woman.  </P> <P> None was more popular than The Glenn Miller Story (1954, 116 minutes) now  available on MCA videotape and laser video disc with a newly restored  stereophonic-surround sound track and a sharp, color-perfect picture  (especially impressive on disc).  </P> <P> The film was popular because Miller was one of the best known bandleaders of  the Swing Era, and the audience came in humming his familiar songs: "Moonlight  Serenade," "String of Pearls," "Pennsylvania 6-5000," "Tuxedo Junction," "In  the Mood," "Chattanooga Choo Choo" and "Little Brown Jug." Also, Jimmy Stewart  played Miller and June Allyson was his perky wife. The fun is in seeing how the  songs fit into the romanticized biography roughly based on his life.  </P> <P> In The Fabulous Dorseys (1947, 88 minutes, Republic tape and disc), Tommy and  Jimmy played themselves-two bickering brothers-with Janet Blair as the girl  caught between them. A contrived jam session featuring Ziggy Elman, Ray Bauduc,  Charlie Barnet and Art Tatum is the film's highlight along with such familiar  hits as "Marie" and "Green Eyes."  </P> <P> After the Dorseys, Hollywood decided that actors would take over the parts. The  Benny Goodman Story (1955, 116 minutes, MCA tape and disc) starred Steve Allen  as Goodman and Donna Reed as his best girl. Goodman himself dubbed Allen's  playing, and the supporting cast of musicians (including Harry James and Lionel  Hampton and Teddy Wilson) were admirable.  </P> <P> Another sentimental biography to be released on home video is The Five Pennies  (1959, 117 minutes) with Danny Kaye as trumpeter Red Nichols and Barbara Bel  Geddes as his patient wife.  </P> <P> Louis Armstrong and a batch of fine jazz musicians play cameo roles, and when  they are on the screen the music is first-rate. Sal Mineo gives a dynamic  performance in The Gene Krupa Story (1959, 101 minutes, "CA/Columbia tape) that  at least didn't ignore his drug addiction. The most dramatic and best-acted  music biography was only "inspired" by the life of Bix Beiderbecke and featured  Kirk Douglas (with Harry James playing) as the Young Man With a Horn (1950, 112  minutes, Warner tape and disc). Doris Day was the wholesome girl and Lauren  Bacall acted the bad girl in this work of fiction.  </P> <P> It wasn't until later that the lives of black jazz artists came to the screen,  but these films also were blatantly dishonest in their music and biographical  facts. Most failed to capture the struggle of blacks trying to overcome white  control of the music industry.  </P> <P> Lady Sings the Blues (1972, 144 minutes, Paramount tape and disc) with Diana  Ross as Billie Holiday was pure soap opera with one cliche after another. Even  Richard Pryor's Piano Man didn't help much.  </P> <P> Perhaps the best musical biography yet produced came out in 1988 and told the  story of Charlie "Bird" Parker, the brilliant jazz saxophonist who, like so  many other African-American musicians, steadily disintegrated under the  pressure of a white-dominated society and drug addiction.  </P> <P> Bird (161 minutes, Warner tape and disc) has a bravura performance by Forest  Whitaker and one of the best sound tracks ever put together-it features  Parker's own solos recorded three and four decades ago cleverly mixed into  newly recorded settings.  </P> <P> Director Clint Eastwood captures the man and his music better than any other  jazz film biography, and does a commendable job in showing the pervasive racism  that forced a superb musician such as Parker to hire a white trumpeter to front  the otherwise all-black group. Even so, most of the cliches of the musical film  biography remain intact even up to the faithful woman, Chan, played by Diane  Venora, the mother of Parker's two children and the key dramatic figure in the  film.  </P></p>

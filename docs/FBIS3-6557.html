It  is about a probe of a scandal that seems to have dominated the  domestic media and had overflowed externally. Coming out of  testimony, the person remarked being really encouraged to have  participated in something where the finding of fact is  important, as opposed to innuendo and rumor-mongering and gossip  and sensationalism.    In whatever is done on a personal or other level, there has  to be a fairly healthy respect for others even if there should  be emotions played up to get persons embroiled. When too much  risk is raked up, or when there is reason to believe there could  be undue muck-raking, there is good reason to speak up.    In this paper yesterday, there was a piece of news that  reflected badly on the intent behind a disclosure that the  United States Senate had passed a bill authorizing the  establishment of "Radio Free Asia", a broadcasting service to  target the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea, Cambodia, Myanmar [Burma], Laos, and Vietnam.    Concerned that such an act might harm friendly relations,  the  director general [D-G] of the Political Department of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs had invited the Charge d'affaires of  the U.S. Embassy to the ministry and conveyed Myanmar's deep  regret that such a decision had been taken.    The D-G pointed out that the creation of the surrogate  broadcasting service was unjustifiable as there already existed  a plethora of radio stations in the Asian region, even pointing  out that our listeners are adequately served by foreign sources  even including the Voice of America.    The D-G made it plain that if "Radio Free Asia" should  become  operational and Myanmar is targeted, it could in no way be  considered constructive or promoting the development of good  relations between Myanmar and the United States.    We would venture to add that should that radio station  materialize and should Myanmar be targeted, we might have to  borrow one of the American jingles and say "It ain't funny, but  sure is corny". Let us hope we do not have to do that. We are  equally opposed to innuendo and rumor-mongering and gossip and  sensationalism.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Prudential Securities in Dollars 371m settlement PRUDENTIAL Securities is to pay Dollars 371m in a settlement connected with high-risk real estate and energy investments it sold during the 1980s. It is the second-biggest financial settlement enforced by US securities regulators. The payout results from an agreement hammered out between the Prudential Insurance subsidiary, the Securities and Exchange Commission, securities regulators in 49 US states and the National Association of Securities Dealers. The securities firm was involved in 'massive misconduct' in the sale of investments in more than 700 so-called limited partnerships between 1980 and 1990, the regulatory bodies said. The partnerships  - vehicles set up to allow groups of individuals to pool investments in property and energy ventures  - were in many cases sold as low-risk investments, when in fact they involved large risks. Some Dollars 330m of the settlement will be paid into a fund for investors who lost money, while the rest will be distributed in fines to the securities regulators involved. Any of the 320,000 limited partnership investors who believe they were misled by Prudential will have to file a claim before they can receive compensation. The settlement exceeds the Dollars 290m paid by Salomon Brothers after the Treasury bond auction scandal, but is less than the Dollars 650m levied on Drexel Burnham Lambert. The bulk of these settlements were in the form of fines, rather than compensation payments to investors. Prudential has paid out Dollars 260m to groups of investors to settle claims arising from losses on limited partnerships. Texas is the only US state which did not participate in yesterday's deal. It is pursuing a separate settlement over the sale of substantial property investments in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.</p>

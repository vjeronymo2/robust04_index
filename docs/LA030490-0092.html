			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN NEWS: PREDATOR SNAIL UPDATE  </P> <P> With everything beginning to grow furiously toward spring, it is time to get  ready for snails, which will become much more active as the weather warms.  </P> <P> For those who want to try the predacious decollate snails instead of snail  baits, here are three sources:  </P> <P> Foothill Agricultural Research in Corona, (714) 371-0120 ($60 for a 1000).  </P> <P> Integrated Pest Management in San Gabriel, (818) 287-1101 ($25/100).  </P> <P> Sespe Creek Insectary in Fillmore, (805) 524-3565, ($7/100).  </P> <P> Prices do not include tax or shipping but all three can send the snails through  the mail.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, general deputy chairman of </F> the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Janos Kecskes Szekely; place  and date not given: "No One Has Nostalgia for the Regime in  Hungary"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Szekely] If the current  forecasts are correct about the 36-percent chance of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] then you will have so many  deputies in parliament that you can again establish a one-party  system in Hungary....    [Szekerees] I very seriously think that it is certain that  Hungary will not have a one-party system. In my view, some six  to eight parties will be in Parliament. It is not a realistic  alternative, either, that the government will have a one-party  system. I expect that the mandates will be in proportion to the  popularity of the parties, however, we will only find this out  on 29 May. The MSZP will not come to power -- as you claimed --  when it comes to government, because governing is not the same  as being in power -- power, fortunately, is divided. It has  many actors and the government is not the only factor in power.  Parliament, the president of the republic, the Constitutional  Court, and publicity are similar kinds of tools. Therefore, I  say that the MSZP will be one of the parties in government. In  my view, Hungary will have a coalition government. Whatever the  election results are, it is certain that a stable government  that is able to operate can only be established in Hungary if it  stands on the broadest possible political basis.    [Szekely] If membership in the government does not mean that  someone possesses power then why do you attack the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] by saying that, in possession of the  power, it has not done such and such things?    [Szekeres] Rather than saying that in possession of power,  the MSZP says that the government's -- and not the MDF's alone  -- performance was not good enough to entitle it to continue in  government. The next government -- providing that the MSZP is  in it -- will change mainly in the sense that it wishes to rely  on expertise to a greater extent, including the state's expert  teams and the social organizations, interest groups, and other  professional organizations. In my view, it will change because  governing will become predictable, therefore, people will be  able to know in advance what the government will represent.  Governing will also become more open, the government will be  able to have a better dialogue with society. As a result of all  this, governing can and will change. [passage omitted]    [Szekely] Are you really honest and predictable?    [Szekeres] I trust that we are and will remain so.    [Szekely] This is contradicted by the pragmatically  demagogic socialist election program, in which the planned  economic measures almost correspond to the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] type orthodox-liberal shock-therapy concept  and will have exactly the opposite effect to the promises made  to poor people on improving their living standards. Your  planned tax changes will also affect people on low incomes the  worst. You also promise things in your program that have  already been achieved by the current government, for example  curbing inflation. Where is the honesty here?    [Szekeres] I believe that we talk very honestly about what  can be expected and what measures we will take. When we talk to  people about our concept, we talk on the basis of this program  and we do not make promises. I know that both the conservative  and the liberal press has raised this criticism against us, but  this is unfounded. We very honestly tell that we are facing a  very difficult 18 months, so we even mention the length of time  our planned measures will take to bring results. I believe that  our program is not a liberal one. I do not even know what the  term liberal economic policy means, I cannot interpret this in  Central-Eastern Europe in a transitional society. I cannot see  that it is liberalism that creates the similarities between the  our economic program and that of the SZDSZ and the Federation of  Young Democrats [Fidesz]. I emphasize this because,  surprisingly, economic research institutes pointed out that the  Fidesz's and the MSZP's concepts are closest to each other, and  not the SZDSZ's and the MSZP's. The reason is that the room for  maneuver has become narrow. Whoever is in government, he will  have very little room for maneuver.    [Szekely] If you are offering the same as the Fidesz or any  other party then why should we elect you out of all the parties?    [Szekeres] I think that this has psychological conditions.  I myself have been thinking about the reasons for the increase  of our public support in the past 18 months. We have had some  research done for us on this issue to see what people actually  think about the MSZP. Three factors were emphasized, and our  increased support is probably due to these factors. The first  is that a view has emerged that the MSZP is an expert party. To  put it more simply, they believe that the Socialists know what  they want and they are good at their jobs. Another factor  people emphasized was that we are a predictable party,  therefore, it can always be known in advance what stance we  would take on an issue. This makes us a little boring -- I  admit this -- but this is a very important value for people in a  transitional society like ours, which is in a flux. The third  reason is that they consider us to be an open party because they  say that they feel we are dealing with their problems. People  have more faith in us than in other political parties for these  three reasons. [passage omitted]    [Szekely] Perhaps even you did not believe four years ago  that you would win the next elections. If the MSZP thinks in  the long term, and if its governing will be the same kind of  disaster for the country as the previous one, then what strategy  do you have to survive even this? In other words, do you not  think that this possible return is too early?    [Szekeres] Personally, I did not think four years ago that  the MSZP's public support would increase to such an extent. I  thought that this would take 10 to 12 years. I thought that the  government or the liberal opposition would put up a better  performance, therefore, I accept what you say. However, for a  political party, if it feels responsibility for the country, it  is not a good question whether it wishes to govern in a given  situation. We have to consider whether, today, it is possible  to form a stable government in Hungary that is able to operate  without the MSZP. I think that it is not, because only an MDF,  Christian Democratic People's Party, SZDSZ, and Fidesz  cooperation could successfully counter us, but this would not be  able to function. However, if we do not now take on the  governmental role, who knows in what condition the country will  be in two, three, or four years' time? Possibly much worse.  Therefore, we have to accept the responsibility of government  and we have to try to avoid losing people's confidence. The  only method to achieve this is through complete openness.

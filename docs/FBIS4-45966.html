			<p>BFN     [text] After Alain Juppe's remarks this morning, Francois  Leotard has said he thinks that nuclear tests should continue.  The defense minister restated this before the finance select  committee of the National Assembly. He is thus in complete  disagreement with Francois Mitterrand who yesterday afternoon  reaffirmed his determination to maintain the moratorium on  French nuclear testing.</p>

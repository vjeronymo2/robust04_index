			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Labour accuses Lyell of insolence Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, was accused of being 'insolent' in the Commons yesterday when he declined to answer questions about Mr Tim Devlin, Tory MP for Stockton South, who ceased to be his parliamentary private secretary last week. The charge was made by Mr John Morris, the shadow attorney general, who asked for an assurance that Sir Nicholas had not been approached by Mr Devlin in a case involving alleged drug offences. The attorney general said in February that Mr Devlin had not been involved in a consultation about the case. Mr Morris also asked for confirmation that Mr Devlin - who says he resigned but whom government whips say was sacked - would not be replaced. Sir Nicholas answered: 'I am surprised that the shadow attorney general should concentrate on such a matter.' Mr Morris asked: 'Are you unable to give a categorical assurance or are you just plain insolent?' Sir Nicholas said he was able to do so, but the matter did not arise from the original question. The case of alleged drugs offences had been handled by Customs and Excise.</p>

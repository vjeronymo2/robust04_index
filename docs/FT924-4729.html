			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Going to market THE LIKELY demise of the Unlisted Securities Market, the USM, tells something about the mood of the times. These days, the high-risk, entrepreneurial image that went with USM membership is the last thing any sensible company boss wants. Better to stay private or aim for a full listing on the stock exchange, with its overtones of mahogany panelling and 19th century sobriety. In Britain, more than in any other country, small companies have been encouraged to turn to the fully regulated listed stock markets for finance. The USM, though intended as a more lightly regulated version of the main exchange, in practice had rules very like its parent. Germany, for example, supplies small-company finance primarily through the banking system, rather than through the equity market; and in the US, the sort of companies that in Britain find their way on to the USM or the lower rungs of the main stock market are traded under rules less onerous than those imposed by the traditional exchanges. The UK's emphasis on stock-market finance - as opposed to the German reliance on debt - stems in part from the need for an equity cushion to protect companies against punishingly unstable economic policies. It has also come about, however, because the UK has an infrastructure devoted to bringing firms to market - accountants, merchant banks, stockbrokers - but not to providing other forms of finance. When banks did make equity-like loans to small companies, at the peak of the 1980s boom, they charged too little for the risks they were taking and structured the relationships poorly. If small companies do come to market, they find that their likely investors, large institutions, are only interested in buying sizeable stakes, to justify the cost of the investment decision. Company ownership thus tends to take the pattern of infrequently traded blocks of shares, more like a private placement market than a true public stock market. All these factors help explain the USM's likely disappearance. With luck, merging it into the main market will push the stock exchange to pay more attention to improving the service it offers to all smaller companies. Another incidental benefit might be a more realistic assessment on the part of small companies about when a listing is appropriate. Once economic recovery begins, however, and small companies come back into favour, the debate about suitable vehicles for small-company finance will resume. At one end of the spectrum would be the creation of a new USM, a genuinely low-cost, lightly regulated new issues market restricted to professional investors. At the other would be an initiative by some, at least, of the big banks to obtain equity rewards if they are to take equity-style risks in lending. If this debate is brought into clearer focus, the USM will not have died in vain.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Usdaw to fight Sunday law THE SHOP WORKERS' union, Usdaw, has moved to counter government proposals for legislation to expand Sunday trading, expected in today's Queen's speech. Delegates at the union's annual conference unanimously backed their executive committee's call to move the focus of the anti-Sunday trading campaign to influencing new legislation and away from simple condemnation of shops trading illegally. Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary, said the union would continue to call for law enforcement, but delegates had to realise that large stores would continue to trade illegally. The union gave qualified support for the so-called 'rest' proposals, of the Keep Sunday Special, the anti-Sunday-trading lobby. It will also press Euro-Fiet, the body that represents the interests of shop workers at European community level, to join Usdaw in sponsoring a conference on trading hours legislation. Earlier, the union reaffirmed its support for wages councils, the bodies that set minimum statutory pay levels for about 2.5m workers, of which more than 1m are shop workers.</p>

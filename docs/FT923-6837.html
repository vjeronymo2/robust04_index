			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Observer: Evacuee from Downing St Anguish and red-faces in Whitehall at the prospect of John Major returning home from his Spanish holiday on Sunday to find that he has joined the swollen ranks of London's homeless. His flat above the shop at 10 Downing Street is uninhabitable because of large-scale building works to strengthen its defences against terrorist attacks. Windows are being ripped out and walls reinforced in the wake of last year's IRA mortar attack. Major had planned to stay in his constituency home in Huntingdon while the work was completed. But that was before the convening of the Yugoslav peace conference in London next week. Becoming a commuter from Huntingdon or Chequers would prevent him from working with the officials preparing for the conference. Contractors are now working frantically but officials admit that there may not be time to put back the chintzy furniture and bomb-proof floral curtains. One suggestion is that Major will have to borrow the spare room in Douglas Hurd's London house at Carlton House Terrace. Of course, there are one or two nice hotels in the area but the Treasury would be reluctant to foot the bill. So Observer will happily pass on to No 10 any offers of a few nights' cheap and cheerful B&amp;B. Brixton might be a favourite.</p>

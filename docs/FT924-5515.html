			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Reluctant MPs vote to tighten their own belts THE HUMAN TRAGEDY of the recession is finally being grasped at Westminster. Faced with a government proposal to freeze their salaries for a year, MPs cast aside such esoteric matters as the Maastricht treaty to debate something about which they are genuinely both knowledgeable and passionate - their own remuneration. The controversy is not new. According to House of Commons' records, the question has been a live issue since 1322 when knights received an attendance allowance of four shillings a day. Scaled up to take into account compounded inflation, that may well be a more generous sum than today's base Pounds 30,854 salary, although no one was so ungracious as to make the point. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, led off the debate by arguing that, as cabinet ministers had forgone their pay rise, MPs should do the same. This, he explained, was a goodwill gesture to the several million low-paid public sector workers who this month heard they must endure a 1.5 per cent ceiling on their wage rises. Mrs Margaret Beckett, his opposite number from the Labour benches, described the policy as a smokescreen intended to 'create an illusion of fairness'. Top salaries for such people as judges would not be affected, she pointed out. As Labour opposed the pay ceiling for setting an unacceptable precedent, she argued, logic suggested it should oppose a freeze for MPs. Such logic does not extend to Labour's front bench, who for public relations purposes chose to abstain. In an unseemly interlude, Mrs Beckett's flow was interrupted by Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman, a feisty Tory backbencher, with an ungallant reference to Mrs Beckett's employment of her husband as a government-paid personal assistant. Her opponent returned the compliment with a reference to Mr Kellett-Bowman's comfortable seat on the Euro-gravy train as an MEP. Less charitably still, Labour MPs began dredging the members' interests directory to expose the greed of their opponents. Several, however, made the mistake of listing membership of a Lloyd's syndicate as a benefit. After itemising an armful of his own directorships, Mr Patrick Nicholls replied for the Tories that Labour MPs felt strongly on the issue because they were unemployable outside the House. He added the observation that an MP's pay now amounted to 87 per cent of that of the deputy chef of the members' dining room - without, however, passing judgment on which job was more socially useful. In the event, MPs bit back their resentment, swallowed the humbug that had suffused the House all day, and voted by 321 votes to 103 to tighten their belts. Debate, Page 8</p>

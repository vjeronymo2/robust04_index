			<p>BFN     [Text] Political dealings are becoming more intense in the  Haitian capital in an effort to compel parliament to fill the  institutional vacuum left when the government of Prime Minister  Robert Malval resigned on 15 December 1993. Right after the  Easter truce, political parties that rallied together in a  coalition addressed the Haitian legislators. Until now, steps  taken have been in political meetings, but now tend to extend  beyond this scope into the street. The party leaders behind this  movement are insistently asking for the application of the  Constitution's Article 149, and are threatening to mobilize the  population, their crowd of supporters, in the next few days. A  first step might have been taken with the public radio  announcements calling the senators and deputies to action in  solving the crisis. More should perhaps be known today with the  conference to be held by the Coordinating Committee for National  Mobilization.</p>

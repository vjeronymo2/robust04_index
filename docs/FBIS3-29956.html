Especially, shoes, cosmetics and enamelware have won  popularity on home and foreign markets.    The workers of the light industry there are making  innovations in production in hearty response to the  revolutionary economic strategy of the party. They  overfulfilled the January assignments by two percent. And they  are greeting significant February with a greater upswing in  production.    Sinuiju, the border city and the capital of North Pyongan  Province, is one of major light industrial cities of Korea.    The city has tens of modern factories under central or local  management. They produce thousands of kinds of light industrial  goods needed for the people's life.    The Sinuiju general chemical fibre mill, a grand  self-reliant  chemical fibre producer of the nation, supplies fibre to light  industrial factories across the country.    The Sinuiju cosmetics factory produces large quantities of  cream, aromatic powder, toilet soap, tooth paste and other  high-class cosmetics containing Ginseng (Insam), a specialty of  Korea.    The shoes produced in the city account for more than 20  percent of the nation's total.    The textile mill, the woollen mill and the knitting mill  produce a half of the province's total.    The plastic daily necessities factory, the household  articles  factory, the garment factory and the pharmaceutical factory in  the city are also well known nationwide.    Before the liberation of the nation, the city was a small  commercial and consumer city with a backward textile industry  and pulp and paper-making industry of a small scale.    The light industry of the city has made a rapid progress  under the wise guidance of the great leader President Kim  Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The total light industrial output value of the city is 76  times the 1944 figure before the liberation.    The light industry of the city relies on its own raw  material  base and light industrial machine production base.    Sinuiju University of light industry creditably discharges  its mission as a training centre of light industrial technicians  and a centre of scientific research.</p>

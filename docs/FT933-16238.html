			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Arts: Berkeley's Jungle Tale - Cheltenham Festival The 49th Cheltenham Festival, its programmes looking more chipper and enterprising than they have for the best part of 20 years, opened on Saturday with the premiere of Michael Berkeley's first opera. Baa Baa Black Sheep was commissioned by the festival and staged by Opera North, which will take Jonathan Moore's production into its main season in the autumn. It is an ambitious, challenging work to a very fine libretto by David Malouf, with a dramatic consistency which is only finally undermined by the unevenness of the music. The subject is a wonderfully potent one. At the age of 23 Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story 'Baa Baa Black Sheep' about Punch, a six-year-old born in India of English parents who is shipped back to England with his sister Judy to be educated 'to be English'. For five years they are entrusted to the manic Auntirosa and her House of Desolation, where Punch suffers constant abuse and humiliation, from which there seems no deliverance. Only in old age was Kipling able to admit that the bleak story was autobiographical, that these were his own experiences as a schoolboy in England and they had marked him indelibly. In Kipling's story Punch cannot find a way to revenge himself for the beatings and bullying he suffers from Auntirosa and her teenage son; he is too young, too weak, to carry out the murder he craves. In the libretto Malouf's imaginative leap has fused this tale with episodes from the Jungle Books, identifying Mowgli as Punch's alter ego, and so providing the boy through fantasy with that outlet for violent justice. The parallels fall beautifully into place - Auntirosa is Baldeo the white hunter, her husband, a mild, sympathetic Sea Captain, is Akela; Harry equates to Sheer Khan, the tiger over whom Mowgli eventually triumphs; Punch's family are the Wolves, and the three Indian retainers whom Punch has left behind become Baloo, Bagheera and Ka. There is nothing cosy, no Disney anthropomorphism about the jungle scenes; the success of the scenario, Berkeley's music and Moore's production is to make Mowgli's power struggles and his efforts to win acceptance just as real and unsentimental as the depiction of Punch's desolate existence. And by presenting these two Kipling worlds as congruent and interlinked, Baa Baa Black Sheep adds yet another layer to its teasing allusive mixture. Berkeley's score is equally rich and dense, the vocal lines rewarding and his orchestral writing full of busy, muscular detail. The musical language is homegrown, derived generously from Britten with occasional Tippett-like touches (from The Vision of St Augustine, unfashionably). Though there is a roughness, an almost expressionist edge to some of the writing that is Berkeley's own, the obvious origins of those gestures finally prove too distracting. It is hard to resist a mental tick-list of the sources as they swell and fade - ensemble writing from Peter Grimes, lean, exposed instrumental writing and (inevitable, perhaps) the writing for the treble Punch from Turn of the Screw, a sudden baleful upwelling from War Requiem and so on. More intriguing, though, are the gamelan sonorities, sourced from Death in Venice, which infiltrate the textures and represent the memories of India that Punch has to struggle so hard to preserve. There are no quotation marks around these, and as they add weight and washes of colour to the orchestral sound they offer an aural equivalent to the multilayering and ambiguities of the text. Moore's production and David Blight's designs (some inappropriate palm trees apart) are intelligent and effective, with the transformations from Victorian England to fantasy India well managed; Paul Daniel realises and releases the energy of Berkeley's music with an intensity that never falters. The singing too is first rate: Malcolm Lorimer sings the demanding parts of the Punch and the boy Mowgli with undaunted precision and presence; the baritone William Dazeley makes Mowgli the young man exactly the potent, semi-heroic figure the role demands. Fiona Kimm adds Auntirosa to her gallery of sharply characterised eccentrics; Philip Sheffield makes Harry a gruesome caricature, Ann Taylor-Morley copes well with both the unrewarding part of Judy and the much more interesting and sexy one of Grey Wolf. Among the roster of family and other animals Clive Bayley's lucid, eloquent Bagheera and Eileen Hulse's anguished Mother deserve special mention. Whatever the imperfections it is a fascinating evening. Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham; sponsored by PCAS. Further performances Wednesday and Friday. Cheltenham Festival runs until July 18.</p>

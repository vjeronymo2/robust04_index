			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Belgrade to cut ties with Bosnia Serbs over peace plan Yugoslavia said yesterday it would cut ties with Serb-held Bosnia following the Bosnian Serbs' refusal to endorse the latest international peace plan. The move brought a cautious welcome from the western members of the five-nation group that framed the plan. It is the most determined effort yet by the leadership of what remains of Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - to force its kin in Bosnia-Hercegovina to end the war and ease the effect of western sanctions. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, said it was 'senseless and absurd' to reject the peace plan, which partitions Bosnia. 'They're rejecting peace at the moment . . . when their acceptance would bring about the lifting of sanctions against those without whom they cannot exist.' However, the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, told his people to be ready to fight on alone. 'We are prepared to be hungry, naked and barefoot, but we must fight for our freedom,' he said on television. 'We have sources of energy, we have enough food, we have factories for production of weapons and ammunition.' The Bosnian Serbs' parliament in Pale rejected the plan which would have given them 49 per cent of Bosnia against the more than 70 per cent they hold now. A referendum on the plan is scheduled for August 27 and 28 but this has been seen as little more than a delaying tactic. Under the new effort to isolate Bosnian Serbs, especially from arms supplies, the Belgrade government said it would shut its borders with Serb-held territory in Bosnia to goods except food, medicine and clothing. The effectiveness of the closure remains to be seen, however. Similar action ordered in May last year when the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen peace plan proved fruitless. The US yesterday welcomed Serbia's announcement but warned it was still ready to lift the embargo on arms shipments to the Bosnian Moslem government, unilaterally if necessary. White House officials said the Serbian announcement was 'an encouraging sign, but we will have to see what the ramifications are'. They warned pressure was growing from the US Congress to supply arms to the Bosnian Moslems. Economic sanctions have taken a heavy economic toll in Yugoslavia and a government statement outlining the moves against the Bosnian Serbs made no effort to hide Belgrade's bitterness at the rejection of the plan. Local economists and western diplomats estimate that 5 per cent to 20 per cent of Yugoslavia's gross domestic product has been spent on military and financial support for the Bosnian Serbs who depend on Belgrade for arms and food. Reuter adds: The Bosnian army yesterday took Pecigrad, a rebel Moslem town in the Bosnian enclave of Bihac. It was the base of Mr Fikret Abdic, a business tycoon who prospered by trading with the surrounding Serbs. His forces have been fighting the Moslem-led government in Sarajevo since a disagreement last September over whether to accept a UN peace plan. Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

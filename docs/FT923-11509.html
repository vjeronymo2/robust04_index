			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring battle at Etonbrook intensifies THE BATTLE over a capital restructuring at Etonbrook Properties grew increasingly heated yesterday as the company's largest shareholder attacked directors over fees paid to associated consultancies since 1988. Mr Andrew Perloff, who through three companies and a personal stake controls 15 per cent of Etonbrook, said companies associated to its directors had taken Pounds 1.5m in fees since 1988 compared with payments to ordinary shareholders of Pounds 105,342 over the same period. The information had come from the accounts, he said. Mr Keith Moss, managing director, said yesterday that the fees were partly due to the ordinary running of the company, and partly a board incentive set up under the Business Expansion Scheme. 'The board received 20 per cent of the development profits,' he said. 'It was an incentive . . . 750 shareholders invested with us on that basis.' The claims form part of a dispute over plans to repay Pounds 1.2m in preference shares which fell due on April 1. That would require a reduction in share capital as Etonbrook does not have enough distributable reserves. In a letter to shareholders Mr Perloff rejected Etonbrook's claim that the preference shareholders could wind up the company if not repaid as he claimed company law required repayments to be made from distributable profit.</p>

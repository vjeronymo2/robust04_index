			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Debenham Tewson in Pounds 11m merger DEBENHAM TEWSON &amp; Chinnocks, the quoted property adviser, yesterday announced a merger with Bernard Thorpe, a firm of chartered surveyors, in a deal worth Pounds 10.9m. It also announced a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 727,000 to Pounds 936,000 for the six months to the end of October. Its share price rose 6p to 71p. This deal is the latest of a series of mergers within the chartered surveying industry in the past year, as the severe downturn in the property industry has forced firms to cut costs and seek stronger partners. DTC said the purpose of the deal was to expand its regional network. The merger will result in cost savings of about Pounds 2m a year, as a result of reductions in staff numbers and accomodation costs. The combined group would have had a turnover of Pounds 55m in the last financial year. In the year ended April 1992, Bernard Thorpe incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 274,000 and had net assets of Pounds 1.8m. Mr Richard Lay, chairman of DTC will be the chairman of the merged group, which will be called DTZ Debenham Thorpe. Mr David Buck, the chief executive of Bernard Thorpe will become vice-chairman. Mr Anthony Turnbull, DTC's chief executive will become chief executive of the enlarged group. Debenham will issue 9.79m new shares, representing 23.6 per cent of the enlarged share capital, and up to a further 750,000 new shares on June 1 1994. Bernard Thorpe's partners have agreed not to dispose of the shares before April 1996. Mr Lay said that DTC expected a 'a satisfactory outcome' for the full year, with a significant contribution from Bernard Thorpe in the second half. In the year to October 1992, DTC's turnover rose from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 17.53m. Earnings per share rose from 1.22p to 1.81p. An interim dividend of 1.2p (1p) was declared.</p>

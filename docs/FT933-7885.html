			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Yen's rise likely to speed deregulation: Reform would help public benefit from currency's surge THE renewed surge of the yen brought signs yesterday that the Japanese government was preparing to speed up market reform in an attempt to boost the sagging Japanese economy and cut the high trade surplus. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, has indicated that the structural reform of Japan's markets would be discussed when ministers meet today for emergency talks on the economic situation. The government believes measures such as the deregulation of markets would not only help pass on the benefits of the high yen to the public but also deflect foreign criticism that Japan's closed market is keeping its surplus high. The yen's latest sharp rise is attributed to a combination of factors: Yen buying by institutional investors who expect a reduction in the official discount rate from 2.50 per cent to 2.0 per cent to improve prospects for Japanese bonds and equ-ities. Speculative money fleeing from European currencies into the relatively safe haven of the Japanese yen. The return of relative stability to Japanese politics has heightened the view of the yen as a safe currency. Falling Japanese investment flows to overseas markets, which have reduced demand for dollars. Loss-cutting selling by Japanese exporters and investors in currencies against which the yen has risen, such as the Australian and Canadian dollars and European currencies, which has affected the yen-dollar rate as well. Behind all these moves is a spreading belief that the yen will continue to rise until the US is convinced that Japan is serious about reducing its trade surplus. Comments last Friday by Mr Walter Mondale, the newly appointed US ambassador to Japan, that he considered correcting the bilateral trade imbalance an urgent priority have revived the view that the US may use the threat of a strong yen to goad the Japanese government into action. The yen's initial rapid rise earlier this year was similarly triggered by comments by US government officials suggesting the Clinton administration wanted a stronger yen. 'There is a perception that the US has no intention of supporting the dollar,' says Mr Masayuki Takaura, chief of dollar-yen dealing at Sanwa Bank in Tokyo. The situation has caught the just-formed Japanese government in a bind. The US government wants Japan to reduce its current account surplus substantially by stimulating the domestic economy through fiscal measures, such as an income tax cut. However, the coalition government under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has publicly stated that, due to the difficult financial situation the government faces amid the recession, it is not prepared to reduce income taxes immediately. Nor is the government inclined to cover the shortfall in revenue by issuing deficit bonds. Although the US and Japan are to begin official talks next month within a new framework for discussing bilateral trade and economic issues, there are no indications so far that differences on how to tackle the trade imbalance can be resolved. Many traders agree that in the long term the current level of the yen-dollar exchange rate is not sustainable, since it does not reflect economic fundamentals. But they also believe the yen's rising trend is unlikely to be quickly reversed, unless the US changes its policy stance or unless Mr Hosokawa's government sends a strong signal that it is prepared to tackle the surplus in a way that would satisfy the US. A cut in the discount rate is unlikely to do the trick, say traders. 'That would not have such a major impact because the US is demanding fiscal measures to stimulate domestic demand,' Mr Takaura says. Until the Japanese government can convince the US that whatever measures it adopts will be as effective in reducing the trade surplus as an income tax cut, it will continue to face the prospect of a relentlessly rising yen.</p>

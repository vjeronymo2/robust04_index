			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Belgrade spirits away zeros from spiralling dinar In another desperate attempt to slow hyperinflation, the Yugoslav National Bank yesterday slashed nine zeros from dinar notes. The move, which will mean 1bn dinars is now equivalent to one dinar, had been expected to go into effect on January 1. But Politika, the Serbian newspaper, yesterday reported that huge payments of pensions, wages and consumer spending before New Year holidays had forced early redenomination. Economists said that only draconian measures - including stopping the printing of money and massive reductions in government spending - could salvage the dinar. They believed the increased spending expected yesterday would force the dinar to plummet even further on the black market. Belgrade economists also said redenomination was introduced earlier than scheduled as the national mint - working 24 hours a day - could not print notes fast enough to keep pace with inflation. Public disquiet surfaced yesterday when Serbian coal miners went on strike, demanding wages in hard currency. Tanjug news agency said power cuts would come into effect today. On October 1 the central bank slashed six noughts from dinar banknotes. The official rate of monthly inflation climbed to 20,190 per cent in November and is expected to soar to 250,000-500,000 per cent for December. The average monthly pension can buy 13 loaves of bread for 1,690bn dinars (DM1.8). On Friday the National Bank issued a 500bn dinar note, the highest denomination and equivalent at the time to DM7 on the black market. By yesterday afternoon the note had plunged to about 40 pfennigs. The D-Mark has virtually replaced the local currency. Shopkeepers mostly demand payment in D-Marks or change their prices on an hourly basis. Pfennig coins, DM5 and DM10 notes are prized. A Belgrade grocer said she usually raised her prices by a 'enormous percentage' in order to have a day off from constantly rewriting new prices as the dinar dropped. People are often paid in bread, sugar, oil or meat rather than increasingly worthless dinars. In state stores, prices are no longer expressed in dinars but in 'bodes', points in Serbo-Croat, which are tied to the D-Mark. The economy of the rump Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - has been hit by the collapse of trade between the former Yugoslav republics. It has also been devasted by bills for nearly three years of war in Bosnia and Croatia, exacerbated by United Nations sanctions.</p>

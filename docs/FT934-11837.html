			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Management: Berlin connection - Efforts to alter staff attitudes at a German cable group Rainer Hemmann has set himself two goals. As manager of KWO Kabel, the east German cable maker bought by Britain's BICC last February, he naturally wants his enterprise to become competitive on the world market. But he also wants the 2,200 employees to ask questions. 'The company will only succeed if everybody takes the initiative,' says Hemmann, who moved to east Berlin last March after BICC poached him from Siemens. He had been running one of the German company's subsidiaries in the Slovak Republic. 'In the old days of centralised planning, employees were penalised for asking questions. They were not allowed to have a personal opinion,' he explains. 'By contrast, we want to know what our staff thinks, so that management here in Berlin can understand the local culture and what motivates people. After all, BICC's philosophy is based on delegating responsibility to local management.' Last month KWO demonstrated its commitment to employee involvement by inaugurating a DM6m (Pounds 2.5m) training programme. Spread over 30 months, courses will include computer, management, leadership and language training. But it is the first - 'Understanding the Business: The Enterprise in the Market Economy' - which attempts to create a corporate identity based on espousing the principles of the market economy. 'Over the next year, every single member of the workforce, divided into groups of 20, will attend this two-day programme. It will focus on understanding the BICC group, why it has bought KWO and what KWO Kabel wants to achieve,' says John Woodthorpe, director of strategic planning. The big challenge, though, is how to shift attitudes away from the centralised planning structure to the needs of the market economy. Hemmann readily concedes that this is a long process which requires a lot of patience. 'For example, when we took over KWO, we inherited excellent technicians and fine engineers. But nobody asked, indeed, nobody was concerned, about the quality of the product. The staff at KWO were told to produce a certain number of kilos of cable, which they did. But the enterprise was producing about 20 per cent of scrap. Yet this was recorded as production of cable.' To cut waste, the management realised it had to link the level of wastage with explaining the principles of the market economy. 'At first, we set out a few clear guidelines,' says Hemmann. 'Under the centralised economy, we tried to show how the producer was boss, but in the market economy the customer is king; how shortages of materials were part of a planned economy, but in a market economy, orders have to be won through quality and competitiveness,' he added. On a practical and often basic level, the management has had to show that everything has a price. 'There was so much wastage. Heating was regulated by opening or closing the window - typical of any country in eastern Europe. Nobody thought about turning the knob on the radiator, or introducing a thermostat system,' says Hemmann. To help achieve a shift in values, the company has introduced two structures of communication: a vertical system, which entails more than simply issuing ideas from the top down - it seeks to generate discussion about them from the bottom upwards; and a horizontal system designed to foster communication across all departments within KWO. The first system, the widely used cascade model, was recently introduced at KWO. It is aimed at encouraging employees to become involved in decision-making. 'That means asking questions,' says Woodthorpe. 'When the management has a suggestion and we want to get feedback, we brief the team leaders of each department. They in turn brief their own members to whom they distribute the sheets of suggestions and invite questions or comments about them.' When the system was first introduced in May, there was little response from the employees. By last month fear and deference were giving way to more open attitudes. The management was receiving remarks and answers to 70 questions. This method is having a positive effect on productivity. When BICC took over KWO, average productivity was about 60 per cent below those in the cable industry elsewhere in Europe. To monitor the improvement, the management introduced a system of assessment on a monthly basis. Productivity is now about 70 per cent of world levels. The scrap ratio has fallen to 2 per cent. The target is 0.8 per cent by 1995. The horizontal, or second method of communication, cuts across all departments in KWO and is regarded as equally important for changing old habits and reflexes. 'When BICC took over KWO, a strong fief mentality existed in the enterprise. People were penalised for trying to do more than what their job description spelt out. There was no concept of the internal customer,' says Hemmann. 'For instance, if we want to design a new cable, it cannot be done in a vacuum. The employees must know the nature of the product, the costs, the availability of equipment, the marketing and the needs of our customers. 'In other words, to get a product off the ground we need a horizontal system of communication. KWO is an integrated structure, each department depending on each other for success and winning customers. This helps forge a much stronger understanding and corporate identity with the company because everyone is involved.' Strengthening the employees' identification with the company may also help the staff overcome any suspicion that KWO is just another foreign-owned company in eastern Germany managed by wessies, or west Germans, who will look down on the ossies, or easterners. This is a prevailing view, although diminishing, among east Germans. 'I do not make any distinction about where anybody comes from,' Hemmann insists. 'Everybody is a KWO employee. If you start creating different categories (between westerners and easterners) you will never achieve the corporative objective of making one company.'</p>

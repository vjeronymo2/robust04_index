			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL WOOD; GRAND OLE OPRY'S RAGTIME PIANIST  </P> <P> Del Wood, 69, the Grand Ole Opry's ragtime pianist whose 1951 recording of  "Down Yonder" sold more than 3 million copies. Miss Wood became a member of the  Opry in 1953 and was the only person regularly featured at the Grand Ole Opry  keyboard. Known as "The Queen of the Ivories," her real name was Adelaide  Hazelwood. In an interview with the Associated Press in 1984, she said she  still practiced about three hours a week. "I'd never go on the Opry without  first doing a run-through. If I live to be 100, I'm going to do the best I  can," she said. Miss Wood's parents gave her a piano on her fifth birthday, and  she was schooled in classical music until ragtime -- a jazz-influenced style of  pop music -- became her passion as a teen-ager. "Ragtime has so much  get-up-and-go that it's infectious; it's part of our heritage," she said. She  cut a record featuring "Mine All Mine" for RCA, with "Down Yonder" on the flip  side. "Down Yonder" was second on the pop charts for 27 weeks and was also a  country hit. Miss Wood also played in the movie "Rhinestone," which starred  Dolly Parton and Sylvester Stallone. In Nashville on Tuesday after a stroke.  </P></p>

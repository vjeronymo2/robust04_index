			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Belarusian free trade unions began an indefinite  political strike in Minsk on Tuesday [15 February]. The goal of  this action is to force the parliament and government to resign.    About 2,000 people gathered in Independence Square in front  of the government building. Approaches to the government  offices have been blocked by the police.    INTERFAX correspondents have not noticed any military  equipment in the streets adjacent to the square.    A police officer in charge of ensuring the security of the  place, who preferred to remain anonymous, told INTERFAX that the  law-enforcement bodies had to put up with volitions [as  received] of the Independence Square's status, according to  which no mass actions can be held in it except celebrations of  the official national holidays. He also said that the police  did not disperse so as not to fan tensions. [sentence as  received]    Belarusian Parliament Speaker Mechyslav Hryb told INTERFAX  that the current political situation was complicated. He also  said that his attitude to the strike was negative. All  political problems must be tackled without pressure or violence,  and at the negotiating table, he said.    Hryb believes that the idea of holding the strike was  initiated by the Belarusian strike committee and the opposition  Belarusian Popular Front, not by the workers. "These  organizations pursue their own goals which have nothing to do  with the interests of ordinary workers," he said.    He noted that the political strike may delay the conclusion  of the monetary agreement with Russia.    He also pointed out that in the current situation the law  enforcement bodies will act strictly within the limits of the  law, and that all illegal actions will be curbed.    Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich told INTERFAX  that the strike committee was manipulating the current economic  problems to destabilize the economy.    To quote Kebich, the strike leaders' assertions that many  industrial enterprises had stopped work at their call were  ungrounded. Many factories stopped working for economic  reasons, long before the strike was announced, he said.    Neither the strike committee, nor the Belarusian Government  could tell INTERFAX how many people had gone on strike.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: IMI declines 3% to Pounds 35.5m - Recession in mainland Europe blamed for downturn at mid-term THE RECESSION in mainland Europe and a loss in computing services affected IMI, the international engineering company, which reported a Pounds 1m fall in pre-tax profits in the half year to the end of June. The near-3 per cent decline to Pounds 35.5m came on the back of increased sales of Pounds 546m (Pounds 515m). The shares fell 7p to 287p. However, three of the group's four businesses increased operating profits and the loss-making titanium business broke even in June. The latter received a further boost by winning a long-term Pounds 10m deal to supply parts to Pratt &amp; Whitney. Mr Alan Emson, finance director, said: 'We have been anxious to break into the US market for a long time; we will now be supplying about 10 per cent of Pratt &amp; Whitney's needs.' Special engineering, which incorporates the titanium operations, saw operating profits rise from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 8.1m. Building products and drinks dispensing increased profits to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 10.9m) and Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 14.7m) respectively. The exception was fluid power. With more than half of its business in continental Europe where the impact of the recession has been most severe, profits fell from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 9.1m. Other and corporate business incurred a Pounds 3.8m loss (profits Pounds 400,000) as two of its computer companies, Brook Street and Redwood, slid into the red. The company blamed the loss on the downturn in information technology and the cost of introducing new software. Mr Emson criticised the electricity duopoly which he blamed for a 16 per cent increase in electricity prices. IMI spends around Pounds 10m a year on electricity. 'We will be breathing into a lot of regulatory ears about this. It is an increase that business can ill afford.' Borrowings, which are mostly denominated in US dollars, rose to Pounds 129m (Pounds 112m), representing gearing of 34 (31) per cent. The increase was due to the stronger US dollar. Earnings per shares fell to 6.9p (7.3p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 4.2p. COMMENT It must be somewhat galling to turnaround a loss-making business only to find another operation slide into the red. It would have been more worrying, however, had the loss been reported by one of the core businesses. As it is, the deficit in the small computer operations should prove short-lived. The profit fall in fluid power has more long-term implications. IMI believes it has come to the end of its recession-induced rationalisation. But if the downturn in mainland Europe continues, further cost cutting measures may be necessary. With forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 74m, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 20. That looks high enough given the uncertainty on the Continent.</p>

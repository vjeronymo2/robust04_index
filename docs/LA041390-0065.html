			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> THATCHER'S WOES BOOST SPECULATION: WILL SHE 'CRACK' UNDER THE HEAT?;  </P> <P> BRITAIN: THE PRIME MINISTER'S FUTURE IS CLOUDED BY A DROP IN POPULARITY. SHE  SAYS SHE'S NOT READY TO RETIRE.  </P> <P> A subtle but significant change has crept into the seemingly incessant  speculation here about Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's political future.  </P> <P> While the focus has previously been on such outward signs of her problems as  plummeting popularity ratings and humiliating anti-government demonstrations,  it now seems increasingly to deal with her state of mind.  </P> <P> A senior Parliament member from Thatcher's own Conservative Party volunteered  at the end of an interview the other day that he thinks the British government  can still turn its fortunes around "if she keeps her nerve."  </P> <P> Speaking between hors d'oeuvres at a cocktail party, an admiring Western  diplomat said the main, near-term question about the prime minister is whether  she will "crack."  </P> <P> And even one of her aides conceded that a much discussed scenario has her so  overcome by depression at the state of her administration that she resigns.  </P> <P> The aide quickly dismissed that possibility. "We're not for mid-term cracking!"  he assured.  </P> <P> In fact, few claim to see any obvious signs that Thatcher is buckling under the  political pressure. And she makes light of such suggestions.  </P> <P> "I did not come here to retire," she assured party stalwarts with a smile in  the opening lines of an address shortly after her party suffered a stunning  defeat in a parliamentary by-election.  </P> <P> In a luncheon speech to the Scottish Distillers' Assn. not long before, she  said: "As I come up to the 11th anniversary as prime minister (May 4), I take  great comfort from the fact that malt whiskies reach their full maturity only  in the 12th year -- and after that, there is a premium in their price and their  value."  </P> <P> Still, the fact that even one of her closest Tory collaborators would call into  question her nerve is a remarkable change in the image of the woman Moscow once  dubbed the "Iron Lady." Skeptics may have doubted whether Thatcher was skilled  enough to control the fire, but until now they seldom suggested that she  couldn't stand the heat.  </P> <P> The change occurs on the eve of a summit meeting with President Bush in Bermuda  today that should theoretically provide a welcome reprieve. Leaders the world  over count on high-visibility foreign forays to deflect attention from domestic  problems.  </P> <P> This visit, however, seems to be generating more British press comment about  Thatcher's allegedly diminished role on the world stage. It hasn't diverted  attention from her troubles at home; it threatens to compound them.  </P> <P> "In the 14 months since Mr. Bush's inauguration, the balance of Atlantic and  European power has shifted quite dramatically," wrote Peter Jenkins, a widely  read political columnist for The Independent newspaper. "The Soviet Union has  become a less formidable adversary; Germany -- about to be united -- the  dominant Western European power, while Britain has looked increasingly isolated  from the mainstream of international developments. This has diminished Mrs.  Thatcher's usefulness to Washington."  </P> <P> The press here has also picked up the psychological theme.  </P> <P> The relatively pro-Thatcher Sunday Times editorialized the other day that she  "is clearly entering a night of the soul." The Independent ran a lengthy piece  of commentary on "what makes prime ministers give up the ghost."  </P> <P> Several papers have probed the possible psychological implications of new,  10-foot high gates that now block the end of Downing Street, where No. 10 is  Thatcher's official residence. One psychiatrist was quoted as saying that the  person so protected must feel "an enormous sense of isolation and betrayal at  the hands of people who had failed to be grateful for years of selfless public  service."  </P> <P> Probably more pertinent is that a Thatcher abdication seems the only likely way  this government will change before the next general election, scheduled for  mid-1992. With a 98-seat majority in Parliament, her Tory party doesn't have to  worry about votes of confidence in the meantime.  </P> <P> Theoretically, she could face a leadership challenge from within her party  that, if successful, would also force her out of No. 10. A Sunday Times poll of  100 Conservative members of Parliament last month found one in four saying that  Thatcher should stand down before the next election.  </P> <P> But there is no clear-cut successor, and a possibly bitter struggle to replace  her could damage the party badly. Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine  appears to be the front-runner in any succession race, but former party  chairman and spokesman of the party's right wing, Norman Tebbit, has pledged to  fight rather than see Heseltine take over.  </P> <P> "The scenario I think is quite likely is that when she becomes convinced that  she'll lose the next election, she'll go quietly," commented author and  political scientist Anthony Sampson.  </P> <P> Thatcher is now the most unpopular prime minister since Gallup began polling  here 50 years ago, with only one in four Britons approving of the job she is  doing. All the polls show the Conservatives trailing the arch-rival Labor Party  by at least 20 points, with the gap widening.  </P> <P> Sampson speculated that Thatcher may step down voluntarily before next fall's  annual Conservative Party convention. She could "go in a respectable way by  using Denis (her husband) as a pretext," he added. Denis Thatcher is 10 years  older than the prime minister, who will be 65 in October.  </P> <P> Thatcher insists she intends to run for a fourth term. And her strategists  present a cogent case that she could still pull it off.  </P> <P> They concede that the economy, an issue that has helped her tremendously in  past elections, has turned sour, with interest rates at a punishing 15% and the  latest inflation figures, released Thursday, showing prices headed upward at  more than an 8% annual rate. However, her strategists see a turnaround by the  end of the year.  </P> <P> By then they hope that a combination of time and tinkering will have made the  highly unpopular "poll tax" for local government services more acceptable.  </P> <P> Even under that scenario, however, a harsh test of the "Iron Lady's" mettle is  likely over the next several months.  </P> <P> The Conservatives face a drubbing in local elections scheduled for May 3. The  initial installment payments are due on the new "poll tax" later this month,  and soon opponents of the levy promise that a boycott campaign will force the  government either to back off or start throwing ordinary people into jail.  Neither option would do much for Thatcher's popularity.  </P> <P> As The Economist weekly put it the other day: "The idea that Mrs. Margaret  Thatcher may no longer be prime minister by the autumn must now be taken  seriously."  </P></p>

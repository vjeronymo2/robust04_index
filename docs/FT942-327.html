			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Industrial users demand EU sugar reform Industrial users of sugar yesterday demanded fundamental reform of the European Union's sugar regime, describing it as 'anachronistic'. European consumers paid two to three times more for sugar than the world price, costing them up to Ecu5.5bn extra a year, said the Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar. The committee, which represents companies purchasing and processing 70 per cent of the sugar consumed in Europe, said the current regime, unchanged since 1968, 'rewards producers on the basis of the least efficient, not the most efficient'. The European Commission is due to present proposals for reforming the sugar sector by the autumn. Sugar, along with wine and fruit and vegetables, was exempted from the far-reaching shake-up of the common agricultural policy in 1992. The pressure for reform has been increased by last December's Gatt agreement, which requires cuts in subsidised EU exports of sugar of more than 10 per cent. The committee said European supply far exceeded demand, which meant taxpayers had to foot the bill for export refunds on sales of surpluses to the world market. 'In addition, there is the fact that rigid national production quotas, which are inconsistent with the concept of a single market, block production moving to the best suited areas in Europe,' it said. The committee called for gradual cuts in sugar prices and for liberalisation of the quota system, to enable quotas to be transferred across national boundaries. 'We are calling for progressive, gradual reform, not overnight change, so that all parties concerned can work together to achieve a more efficient sugar regime,' said Mr Tom Harrison, committee president.</p>

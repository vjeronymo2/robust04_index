			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Oriel turns in Pounds 1m for first quarter Oriel Group, the insurance broker, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.06m in the first quarter of 1994, against a loss of Pounds 146,000 last time. The group, having completed the restructuring which began in 1992, made an operating profit on continuing activities before exceptionals of Pounds 1m for the whole of 1993. But the inclusion of discontinued activities left a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 74,000) for the year. However, reflecting the group's underlying profitability and the expectation of further progress this year, the final dividend is a same-again 3p for a maintained total of 5p. Full year losses per share were 8.9p (5.8p), but this had improved to earnings of 2.9p (2.4p losses) for the first quarter. The full year loss was struck after a Pounds 1.6m write-off arising from the disposal of Hayward &amp; Company, while in addition, further provisions of Pounds 200,000 were charged. Warranty Holdings, the new car warranties company acquired during the year, turned in a 1993 pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.01m.</p>

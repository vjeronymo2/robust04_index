			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: THE HALF-AMAZING, HALF-CRAZY GREENING OF CD SOUND  </P> <P> It sounds crazy. Completely wacko. Like one of those "I Was Kidnapped by a Sexy  UFO Hunk" tales you'd expect to read in the tabloids in the check-out lane at  Ralphs.  </P> <P> But how's this for a shocker: If the stories circulating in the audiophile  community are true, you can significantly improve the sound of your compact  discs (are you sitting down?) simply by marking the inner and outer edges of  the disc with a green felt marking pen.  </P> <P> Call it the Big Green Clean.  </P> <P> It's the hot new topic of debate among CD fanatics -- and a claim being taken  seriously by CD experts, most notably Pete Howard, publisher of the respected  International CD Exchange (ICE) newsletter and resident Rolling Stone CD  columnist. Howard says he discovered the craze when one of his subscribers sent  him a story from a Beaverton, Ore., paper detailing claims made by an audio  store owner there.  </P> <P> After interviewing several other people who've tested out the theory -- and  trying it himself -- Howard is no longer a complete skeptic.  </P> <P> "I was intrigued, as would anyone who discovered that you could make what  amounts to a $1,000 upgrade on your sound system by simply spending $1.25 for a  green felt marking pen," he said. "I think you'd have to say it's half-amazing  and half-ludicrous. But I'm getting calls from people who are using adjectives  like 'incredible' and 'terrifyingly improved.' Everybody seems to agree there's  something there."  </P> <P> The green felt marker fad isn't the only craze sweeping the CD ranks. According  to a four-page story by Sam Tellig in the current issue of Stereophile  magazine, you can also improve CD sound quality by coating your CDs with (now  you really have to sit down) Armor-All spray cleaner. (You coat the playing  surface and wash off the Armor-All before playing.)  </P> <P> Both schemes sound pretty farfetched to us. But Howard isn't so sure. "What  makes this such a potentially fascinating story is the implication that after  millions of CDs have been tested and manufactured, consumers can suddenly buy a  green marking pen or a cleaning spray cleaner and dramatically increase their  CD sound. Enough people have come to me that you'd have to say something is  happening here, even if you don't know what it is."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, none of the Green Clean proponents can explain why the marking  pen works. And it's too soon for official test results from audio authorities.  Is there a sound technological principle at work? Not likely, says Ed Outwater,  Warner Bros. Records' vice president of CD quality assurance.  </P> <P> "It doesn't sound like this is within the realm of possibility to me," said  Outwater. "A CD operates by a laser bouncing up into the play-side of the  machine, where it reads the digital information. So how a green felt pen  marking on the outside of the disc would have any impact is beyond me."  </P> <P> Outwater was similarly skeptical about the oven-cleaner hypothesis. "CDs do get  dirty, but the grunge simply impedes tracking. Cleaning the disc won't improve  the sound clarity."  </P> <P> For a second opinion, Pop Eye asked Grammy-winning producer Hank Neuberger, an  audio consultant for the recent Grammy telecast, to take a Green Clean  blind-fold test. Neuberger listened to two CD versions -- one greened, the  other unmarked -- of Steely Dan's "Hey 19" and the Band's "King Harvest." The  results?:  </P> <P> "Granted, it wasn't the most scientific experiment, but I really don't think  you could hear much difference," he said. "Maybe the green-coated CD had a  little more clarity in the upper-middle range. But it was very subtle, if  anything."  </P> <P> Neuberger said the craze reminded him of the hubbub nearly a decade ago when  Bob Clearmountain, then a hot rock producer, began mixing albums on tiny Yamaha  NS-10 studio speakers. "Everyone heard he got his special sound by taping  Kleenex over the tweeters," Neuberger said. "So not only did everyone go out  and buy NS-10's, which are now standard in every studio in the world, but  everyone was asking -- what kind of Kleenex did he use?"  </P></p>

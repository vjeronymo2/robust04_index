			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / The birth pangs of a capitalist eastern Europe THERE ARE, it has been said, lies, damned lies and statistics. Whether this aspersion on the world's statistical organisations is justified, it is certainly justified of the statistics produced by the late communist regimes of eastern and central Europe. To these regimes statistics were instruments of control and propaganda. As with the economies they purported to measure, the legacy of that unhappy past lingers into a difficult present. Nevertheless, statistics are needed, warts and all, because eastern Europe is a region with a significant economic potential that is undergoing an unparalleled transformation. This week's International Economic Indicators do, therefore, contain the first in a quarterly series on central and eastern Europe, derived from the Eastern European Statistical Bulletin published by Business Strategies. What these statistics describe is the fate of the old socialist industrial economies. These have collapsed. Industrial output in Poland, for example, fell by 45 per cent between early 1989 and mid-1991, as is shown in the chart. The declines measured for Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, though smaller than for Poland, were still huge by any normal standards. Equally evident is the appearance of open inflation. Poland's price level has risen no less than forty-fold since early 1989. Nevertheless, Poland has halted its hyperinflation, while the CSFR and Hungary have done better still. In the latter two countries the inflation has been more a one-off adjustment revealing hitherto concealed inflationary pressures than an ongoing inflationary process of the kind that beset Poland. Meanwhile, Bulgaria and Romania are both still in the grip of soaring prices. What such figures reveal is suggestive. What they conceal is vital. They conceal, for example, the fact most goods were unavailable at their notional prices before liberalisation, at least without queueing for hours. Similarly, the rise in unemployment shown in the table hides the fact that many workers, though supposedly 'employed', were actually idle. The data are obtained through three main channels. The first is the national state statistical offices, which were originally an integral part of the centrally planned economies. These offices were closely associated with the old bureaucracy and its network of controls. The second channel is the central bank of each country, the source of much financial information. The third is international financial institutions, such as the IMF, the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Each of these sources has its particular advantages and disadvantages. But the most important difficulties lie with the official statistical offices on which everyone must ultimately rely. Three big problems arise. First, national accounts were historically based on the concept of net material product (NMP), which excludes most of the service sector of these economies. The GDP estimates now provided do not yet conform to western systems of national accounts, though efforts are being made in this direction. Second, many indicators are distorted by the use of artificial exchange rates. Third and perhaps most important, the burgeoning private sector is still not included in national accounts. Despite these difficulties, it has been decided to present figures based on the official sources rather than make what would inevitably be arbitrary adjustments. In time, the data will get better. But they will probably get better as slowly as the economies, which - at least in the cases of Poland and the CSFR - are now showing some modest signs of recovery. Yet these recoveries are vulnerable, as much to political as economic events. Just how vulnerable is revealed by the table's division of the CSFR into what are soon expected to be the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, this division being certain to damage the initial economic prospects of both, but particularly of Slovakia.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- This table presents the major economic statistics currently published on six east European countries. Current price figures for gross domestic product (GDP) or net material product (NMP) are in billions of USDollars. Trade figures are in millions of USDollars. All are converted from national currency units (NCU) at the exchange rate shown (NCU per Dollars , period avgs). Constant price GDP or NMP growth is given as an annual percentage change. Yearly and quarterly values for consumer prices, wages and industrial production are in index form with 1991=100. Monthly values are annual percentage changes. The unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the civilian labour force.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BULGARIA

Notes: Latest population estimates (end 1991, millions) - Bulgaria 9.0; Czech Republic 10.3; Slovak Republic 5.3; Hungary 10.3; Poland 38.3; Romania 23.2. GDP estimates are mainly derived from NMP data. NMP differs from GDP primarily in its exclusion of the service sector. Figures for the current balance refer only to trade in convertible currencies. Visible balance and export data include all trade. Czech and Slovak values in italics are federal figures. (As a rough guide, Slovak trade share in 1990 was 24.2% of total Czechoslovak exports, and 25.7% of total imports). Sources: State statistical offices and central banks, IMF, World Bank.

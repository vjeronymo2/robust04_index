			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Gardening: How to defend the city tree - The vexed question of Tree v. Neighbour WITH THE coming of spring, one person's tree becomes another person's nuisance. My introduction to the fraught area of Tree v. Neighbour came a few months ago. A majestic plane tree grows at the bottom of the north London back garden overlooked by our flat. In summer, its branches make a curtain so tall and wide that it screens not just our five-storey house but several others from those opposite. One might have thought such a beautiful tree would have been universally popular - but no. A member of the local conservation committee spotted that the council had granted an application for drastic pruning. The applicant was not the tree's owner, but a developer with a garden flat across the wall who presumably hopes to recoup his investment quicker by claiming the flat 'benefits from a sunny garden.' Anguished calls to the council planners brought bad news. Several of the plane tree's largest branches lean out above the applicant's garden, albeit at a great height. We were told that although our tree has the statutory protection of growing in a conservation area, these overhanging branches constitute a nuisance. In common law, the developer has the right to wield the axe even if it leaves a butchered tree. Sobered by this discovery, I travelled south to discuss the troubled life of the inner-city tree with Paul Akers, chief arboricultural officer for Westminster City Council. Compared with trees officers in other London boroughs, Akers has a palmy time. Westminster is Conservative and wealthy. Most of its eight acres is a conservation area, meaning most trees are statutorily protected. Westminster residents are generally the types to favour a greener borough. A Citizens' Task Force reports any pruning which may be unauthorised as well as damaged council trees. There is little vandalism. New plantings achieve a 95 per cent 'take'. A free advisory service exists for Westminster residents with problems about trees - not only those in public places but in their own or other people's gardens. Free booklets are on offer. In cases of tree versus resident, trees officers face tricky situations and trees can be the losers. Residents complain that lime trees along the street drop sticky mess on their cars or that crab-apples are splattering the pavements. 'The council cannot ignore the complaint, yet we don't want to over-react.' Complaints about trees cutting out light are common and pose problems because they are so subjective. Even though it goes against the grain, Akers will often recommend that trees causing a nuisance are pruned. It may appear butchery to the tree-lover, but inside an overshadowed property there may be someone who is house-bound. People often need warning that pruning can be counter-productive, thanks to trees' fantastic powers of regeneration which results in still denser foliage. Trees officers will also often advise that overcrowded sites should be thinned, although they may well suggest that young ones are planted for the future. In the matter of our plane tree, Akers considered that the legal position was less black-and-white than our own planning department (too short-staffed to visit the site) had ruled. There is 'a conflict of legal views' about what happens when a tree in a conservation area or protected by a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) overhangs a boundary. I was given a further booklet, Trees and the Law by JGS Harris (Pounds 3.50, obtainable from the Arboricultural Association*). It covers the law only as it stood at August 11989, and will be updated. However, a case is cited in which a court ruled that someone was wrong to have lopped overhanging branches off a tree protected by a TPO because he had 'only suffered a small inconvenience in the use and enjoyment of his garden' and the nuisance was not therefore actionable. What exactly is the value of a Tree Preservation Order (TPO), I asked? A TPO will be placed on a tree which is beautiful or important, perhaps because it screens an eyesore; normally it should be visible from a public place. In Westminster, this means that virtually any front garden tree has a TPO, and most in back gardens as well. One can apply for a TPO, which costs nothing. Once a TPO is applied, a tree cannot be cut at all without the prior consent of the council. (Fruit trees are not normally given TPOs because they require heavy pruning.) Cutting and pruning must be carried out according to British Standard regulations. A TPO is registered as a charge on the property. Contravening a TPO can result in a Pounds 2,000 fine. If permission is granted for a protected tree to be felled, perhaps because it is old or diseased, the owner will be instructed to plant a replacement. Whether they actually do is a different matter, and planners do not necessarily have the resources to check. Akers points out that many fights over urban trees need not occur if suitable species had been chosen in the first place. Gardeners always need to think of the ultimate height and spread of a tree. It makes sense not to plant trees hard up against a boundary. And even if the tree is not be placed so that it overhangs, Trees and the Law states that if you obscure a neighbour's light he may be able to get an injunction ordering the trees to be kept under control, or he may claim damages. But if such considerations mean that the inner-city tree must always be a small, sparse-leaved specimen, then we are surely all losers. Our graceful giant is still some way off coming into leaf and the developer has gone quiet, perhaps taken aback by the strength of local feeling. Or could it be that he, too, has heard the ominous words about a conflict of legal opinion? Conflict equals expense, and our green curtain might look a little too costly to tear down. *Arboricultural Association, Ampfield House, Romsey, Hants SO51 9PA; 0794-68717.</p>

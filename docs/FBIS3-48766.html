			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) has given its leader Yohei Kono full  authority to decide on holding talks with the ruling coalition  on political reform, LDP officials said Friday [28 January].  Kono will be free to decide whether to have a make-or-break  top-level meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on the  issue, they said.    The LDP, the main opposition party, reached the decision at  a  meeting of its Executive Council, the officials said.    Kono signaled willingness to have a faceoff with Hosokawa to  help break the deadlock brought about by the House of  Councillors' rejection on January 21 of the government's  political reform package.    The more powerful House of Representatives passed the four  bills on November 18.    "In the face of the difficult situation, I will do my best  as  the party president to make the party's final decision," before  the end of the current Diet session on Saturday, Kono said at  the meeting.    The ruling coalition and the opposition camp, including the  LDP, failed to reach a compromise on political reform Thursday  midnight at a meeting of a joint council of the two houses.    Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito [New  Government  Party] and the coalition's chief negotiator, who chaired the  meeting, declared an end to the effort by the joint council to  find ground for a compromise.    The joint panel was made up of 10 members from the coalition  who voted for the bills in the lower house and 10 legislators  from the opposition who opposed the bills in the upper house.  Both sides rejected the other's proposals.    Lower house speaker Takako Doi urged Ichikawa to continue  trying to reach a compromise in the joint council.    Meanwhile, Hosokawa expressed his willingness to hold talks  with Kono in an attempt to break the impasse. In a meeting  Friday morning with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa reaffirmed his  resolve to meet Kono, coalition sources said.    The coalition and the LDP, however, remain far apart over  both electoral reform for the lower house and reform of  political fund-raising, and even if Hosokawa and Kono meet, the  prospects of reaching an accord are slim, political analysts  said.    If the talks end in failure, some coalition members hinted,  the coalition will send the package back to a plenary session of  the lower house to seek a two-thirds majority to pass the bills.    This would require some 70 rebels from the LDP to vote for  the package.    If the bills fail to be passed, Hosokawa will be forced to  have his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower house for  a snap election, the analysts predicted.    Hosokawa said Thursday he will not cling to power if he  fails  to achieve political reform by Saturday's closure of the  parliamentary session.    The reform package is intended to introduce a new electoral  system for the lower house involving a mix of single-seat  constituencies and proportional representation to replace the  existing multiple-seat districts, as well as tightening curbs on  political funding.</p>

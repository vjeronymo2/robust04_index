			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (1): Yearning for stability - After nearly four years of upheaval, South Africa desperately needs a political settlement. Both Nelson Mandela and President FW de Klerk are determined to deliver a negotiated government of national unity. But time is running out THE centre holds. It held when South Africa faced the biggest political crisis of the post-apartheid era, the assassination of African National Congress leader Chris Hani. It held when the butchers of Boipatong and Bisho cut down innocent blacks. It held when black hands murdered white farmers. Over the past year, the centre has held against all the odds, against every threat from right or left. And it holds still. For a country divided by history and design, with one of the world's highest rates of crime, political violence, unemployment and poverty, that is something of a miracle. Over the next year, there is every chance that the centre will grow stronger still - if only because the spectre of racist radicals to left and right will frighten the ANC and the ruling National Party into an ever-tighter embrace. Weakness has always been the cement which bound their reluctant alliance - each knew it could not survive without the other - and that bond can only grow as inevitable defections to hard-line black and white parties (such as the black supremacist Pan Africanist Congress and the Afrikaner nationalist Conservative Party) render each weaker still. But within that centre ground, the most momentous shifts are taking place: for sometime over the Easter weekend - the fateful weekend of the Hani assassination - the National Party passed an historic point of no return. The balance of power - still nominally Pretoria's, with its control of the security forces, the administration and the fiscal purse-strings - began to tilt in favour of those who must eventually take over as the dominant force, the ANC. President FW de Klerk, with all his police and soldiers, had no choice but to hand over responsibility for law and order to ANC president Nelson Mandela. Mr Mandela - not Mr de Klerk - issued a televised appeal for calm, in tacit admission that only he could prevent the threatened descent into chaos. Mr de Klerk controlled the state; but Mr Mandela controlled the nation. Since then, President de Klerk has done all he can to restore the credibility lost during that period, when National Party supporters finally faced the inevitable: the loss of monopoly white power, and the spectre of black rule. He has ostentatiously wielded the levers of power - rejecting, to ANC howls of outrage, an independently-chosen board of governors for the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation - and insisting (as he does elsewhere in this survey) that the hand of a National Party leader will remain on the tiller for the foreseeable future. But many of his supporters - and a substantial section of his caucus - seem to have lost faith in these assurances. White morale has never been so low, generating a boom for international removals companies. According to the most recent opinion poll, National Party support among whites has fallen below 25 per cent for the first time. This may not be good news for South African democracy. For Mr de Klerk's mission has ever been to ensure that moderate forces - led by him, and including the Afrikaner nation which he alone can protect - can prevent a black government from ruling unchecked. If he thinks this goal is threatened, he is likely to harden his bottom line. He has made clear his demands: the National Party will require what amounts to a veto over cabinet decisions on fundamental issues - until at least the end of the century, perhaps beyond. ANC leaders reject this, though they have conceded the first post-election cabinet will include all leaders with more than 5 per cent of the popular vote (with cabinet posts distributed proportionately) and that Mr de Klerk will have what amounts to a veto over a very limited number of issues. They have also conceded that significant powers be devolved from central to regional governments - another check on ANC domination, demanded by Mr de Klerk - but the detailed distribution has yet to be agreed. In narrowing the gaps on these issues, Messrs de Klerk and Mandela will finally answer the question they have so long avoided: who will wield real power in the new South Africa? The answer seems obvious: the ANC and the National Party together - but not necessarily under conditions of true democracy. First prize remains a government of national unity ruling under a negotiated multiracial constitution, with maximum popular legitimacy. But stability - however it is achieved - is a close second, and gaining. After nearly four years of political upheaval, South Africa yearns for stability: without it, the economy cannot recover from its four-year recession; schools will remain in chaos; the water will not run and the toilets will not work in the townships; crime cannot be contained. And South Africa risks losing the skilled people who alone can prevent it, in the words of one leading Afrikaner, from 'sliding into Africa'. Both the ANC and the National Party are determined to deliver stability. For the moment, they are still striving for first prize, a negotiated government of national unity, ruling under a more or less liberal constitution. They may well get the first instalment of that prize soon: a 26-party transitional executive council with narrow authority to oversee government in the run-up to elections tentatively set for April 27 next year. But it falls far short of the constitutional deal which must be agreed by September if elections are to be held in April. The game plan is for the ANC and government to force through the 26-party constitutional negotiating forum their own outline agreement on a new constitution, which calls for a five-year multiracial power-sharing cabinet, proportional representation, a bill of rights, and substantial devolution of power to regions. Their dual challenge is to finalise their own agreement on power-sharing (which could prove more difficult than anticipated, if Mr de Klerk is serious about a permanent arrangement) while trying to drag other parties into the deal. Their goal is to ensure that those who could do most to sabotage elections and destabilise a new government - the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, the black-radical Pan Africanist Congress, the right-wing Conservative Party and the moderate-right Afrikaner Volksunie - will give a new constitution their blessing. They may soon conclude that is an impossible task. So far, they have kept all parties at the table primarily by skirting important issues; but time has run out on such leisurely tactics. Before September, they must agree an interim constitution under which to hold elections; settle a host of problems such as the powers of the transitional executive, and of independent commissions to oversee elections and the state broadcast media; resolve the issue of joint control of the security forces and political armies; and agree the principles by which writers of a final constitution will be bound. This list goes on and on. Negotiators from both sides make clear that a deal will be pushed through, no matter who disagrees (Inkatha's broadly constructive attitude at the talks suggests Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi has accepted that reality). Legitimacy will be guaranteed either by free and fair elections (a long shot, given the present violence), by a popular referendum - or not at all. Dissent will be dealt with either within the constitution, or outside it, but it will be dealt with. It would be a shame if South Africa ends up with no more than - in the words of ANC constitutional expert Albie Sachs - 'deracialised oppression'. But if the choice is between peace, stability and economic growth on the one side - and democracy on the other - South Africa may yet decide democracy is a luxury it cannot afford.</p>

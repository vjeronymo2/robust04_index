			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (5): Touche - a telling riposte to rivals - To match the subsidies offered by Beijing and Sydney, Manchester has come up with a way of helping athletes from the poorer nations / Manchester Millennium Foundation WHEN Beijing and Sydney each decided to offset the high costs of travelling to them by offering to pay for all competitors and officials, the other bidders for the 2000 Olympics had a problem. High travel costs had been a potentially telling argument against Beijing and Sydney - particularly for the developing countries. But paying for the substantial travel costs would make it difficult to produce a profit from hosting the Games. Moreover, the developed nations do not need financial assistance to transport their competitors and officials to the Games, wherever they are held. This even applies to Britain, where part of the funding for the team has to be raised by public appeal. What Beijing and Sydney have both offered is a subsidy to each national Olympic committee (NOC) - countries such as the US, which usually sends the largest team and always has the largest number of qualifiers, will therefore be the greatest potential beneficiaries. But later today, Manchester will deliver a telling riposte by announcing a means-tested subsidy for nations needing help. It is called the Manchester Millennium Foundation and would support sport in poorer nations to ensure that more of their athletes were able to compete at the Olympics. The plan covers not only transport to the Games, but training and welfare of potential competitors in the four years leading up to them. Sports equipment would also be provided where needed, eliminating the richer nations' advantage in preparing for top-level competition. The cost of travel and access to training and competition facilities in Britain would also be met. This would include pre-Olympic competitions where the Games facilities are tested - and where the most promising athletes and teams get the feel of Olympic venues. All of these facilities are readily available to competitors from developed nations with Olympic medal potential. What the Millennium Foundation will aim to achieve is a level playing field for athletes from the third world. Manchester's organising committee has promised to guarantee the foundation Dollars 25m from 1996 if the city stages the Games. It has also proposed that the foundation would be an independent body to ensure fairness. It would be run by a board comprising members of the IOC, NOCs, the British Olympic Association and the Manchester organisers of the 2000 Olympics. The foundation would be at its busiest in the 12 months before the Games, as competitors build up their performances to peak in July 2000. What is being offered, in fact, are equal opportunities for all athletes to peak and to be able to compete at the Games. Competitors eligible for funding by the foundation would be nominated by their own national Olympic committee. NOCs would determine whether training costs, travel grants or equipment - or whichever combination of the three - were most appropriate. Support would also be provided for sports science and sports medicine. The principles of operation are not dissimilar to those at the United Nations. Most of its work takes place in developing countries, but is funded by developed member states, which can generally afford to fend for themselves. However, the Millennium Foundation would be less political, as a result of its independent control by the Olympic movement, which would ensure due regard for Olympic ideals. Bob Scott will tell the IOC in Lausanne today: 'Britain's Olympic history is long and unbroken and its commitment to the ideals of the movement are deep. 'The creation of this foundation has been based on the ideals of the Olympics and will fully promote equal opportunities for all competitors and nations of the world.'</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Strong sales lift Texas Instruments to Dollars 2.5bn Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer, reported record second-quarter results, driven by strong sales of semiconductor products. Earnings were above Wall Street expectations, but attention focused on TI's prediction that growth in the world semiconductor market will 'moderate somewhat' in the second half of the year. Its shares fell sharply to Dollars 83 3/4 at mid-session, down from Thursday's close of Dollars 86 3/8 . Net revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.5bn, up 19 per cent from Dollars 2.1bn in the same period last year. Profits from operations were Dollars 292m, up from Dollars 173m, while net income was Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.93 a share, compared with Dollars 112m, or Dollars 1.18, last time. TI said its second-quarter revenues and earnings were boosted by its semiconductor operations, the company's largest business. Semiconductor revenues increased by 29 per cent over the same period last year, TI said, with strong growth in memory chip revenues. TI also noted double-digit growth in sales of application-specific and mixed-signal semiconductor products. 'Forces driving the longer-term growth of the world (semiconductor) market remain intact,' TI said. 'The Asia-Pacific region continues to be the fastest growing semiconductor market in the world.' TI is expanding its resources in Asia to meet a rapidly expanding customer base, the company said. For the half-year, revenues were Dollars 4.96bn, up 24 per cent from Dollars 3.99bn in the first half of 1993. Net income was Dollars 318m, or Dollars 3.35 a share, compared with Dollars 192m, or Dollars 2.04. The first-half results include a first-quarter Dollars 132m pre-tax charge for costs of restructuring TI's European operations and the sale of some computer product lines. The charges were partly offset by a one-time gain of Dollars 69m from royalty revenues.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Engineering Council fires salvo in debate on reform THE ENGINEERING Council, the umbrella body for the UK's 44 professional engineering institutions, yesterday entered the debate about the future of the profession yesterday by rejecting proposals from the presidents of four big institutions. The council was making its first statement on a debate initiated in January by Sir John Fairclough, its chairman, which might lead to a new single body that would replace the council and unite the engineering profession. The proposals, now nearing the end of a year-long consultation process, have caused intense controversy among Britain's 290,000 professional engineers and technicians, and the institutions that represent them. The institutions are wary of handing over too much power to the new body, while many individual engineers say the reforms need to be more radical to improve the image of engineers. Last month the presidents of the instututions covering civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering said the new body must provide leadership and vision, speak for the profession on strategic issues and ensure that engineering's contribution to society is recognised. They added that it 'must establish an effective partnership with the institutions and be accountable to the community of engineers'. Yesterday the council agreed with the presidents on the need for leadership and vision, but disagreed on how to achieve it. For the new body to be powerful, it said, would involve the transfer of 'significant power' from the institutions to the new body. The body, it said, 'would need to have direct control of its subordinate organisation, and this therefore will necessarily exclude concepts of equal partnership'. The council also rejected the idea that membership of the new body's council should be confined to the institutions on a numerical basis. That, it said, would turn the council into the 'creature of the institutions and would sideline the interests of industry, education and the desire of engineers on the council's register to have some form of representation'. The salvo from the council highlights the difficulties for Sir John and the unification steering group he chairs in reconciling different views on the future of the profession. The steering group issued a consultative document in August and an interim report is expected by March.</p>

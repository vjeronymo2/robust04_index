			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Funding to rise 2.3% in real terms - Home Office MR KENNETH Clarke, home secretary, yesterday announced that funding for Home Office services next year will be just over Pounds 6.1bn, an increase in real terms of 2.3 per cent over planned provision for this year. The funding allows for: Continuing improvements in the prison system. Extra help for victims of crime. Maintaining the current level of policing. Mr Clarke said: 'The current public spending round has had to be tough because of the need to restore growth to the economy. The package which has been agreed for the Home Office shows a strong commitment to the priorities of law and order, criminal justice, prison improvements and support for victims. We have achieved this by prudent financial management. Pay increases for all the public sector groups for which I am responsible will be tightly controlled. This includes police and firefighters.'</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bouygues to lift holding in road-builder Bouygues, the French construction and public works group, will increase its stake in road-building company Colas to about 60 per cent through a capital increase and by acquiring part of an indirect stake held by the French subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell oil company, AP-DJ reports from Paris. Colas's board decided yesterday to carry out a capital increase that will inject between FFr700m (Dollars 133.2m) and FFr800m cash into the road-builder and help it pursue its expansion, notably outside France, Bouygues and Shell said in a joint statement. At present a holding company called SITP, which is 65 per cent owned by Bouygues and 35 per cent by Societe des Petroles Shell, controls 67 per cent of Colas' capital.</p>

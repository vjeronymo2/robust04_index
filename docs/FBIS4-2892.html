			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian Serbs'  Information Ministry has decided to revoke press credentials for  all American journalists working in "the Serbian republic" and  banned them from the territory as of today.    The ministry said that as of April 14, work credentials of  American journalists are revoked and they are forbidden from  entering the territory of the self-styled Bosnian Serb republic.    It also said that press credentials and visas of all foreign  journalists issued by the UN peacekeeping forces are no longer  valid.    The move followed NATO air strikes against Serb positions  around the UN-designated "safe area" of Gorazde on April 10 and  11. The Serbs accused the United States of siding with the  Muslims and being directly involved in the Bosnian civil war,  and regarded it as an "aggressor."    For a long time, Bosnian Serb authorities have been  dissatisfied with the "distorted and anti-Serb reports" filed by  U.S journalists.    On Tuesday, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia revoked press  credentials for the AFP News Agency and the CNN TV Network and  denied a WASHINGTON POST reporter's visa to enter Serbia.</p>

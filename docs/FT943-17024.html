			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Most British Coal staff face axe The vast majority of British Coal's 3,000 managerial and clerical white-collar staff face redundancy as the corporation prepares for the run-down of activities in preparation for an end-of-year handover to private-sector mining companies. British Coal, which employs 12,000 to 13,000 compared with more than 200,000 a decade ago, said run-down of staff levels will start almost immediately. Mr Kevan Hunt, employee relations director, said the majority at national and group headquarters were unlikely to transfer to the successor companies but would be made redundant before privatisation. According to Coal News, the corporation's newspaper for employees, about half of staff at national and group headquarters and ancillary activities will leave by the end of November. Several hundred more will go by the end of the financial year next March. Every department will be affected, although formal discussions on the rundown and severance arrangements have still to be held with the appropriate unions. The corporation said the staff rundown would be arranged to minimise the impact on normal business. The newspaper quotes Mr Hunt as firmly denying rumours that a pay and redundancy package made available to employees until May 20 is about to be re-offered. According to the corporation more than 9,200 management, clerical, weekly-paid staff, opencast supervisors, pit officials and mineworkers accepted the package but 3,000 did not. The package offered redundancy terms of up to Pounds 27,000 and a one-off payment of Pounds 6,000 but required employees to work more flexible hours. It was opposed by both the National Union of Mineworkers and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers.</p>

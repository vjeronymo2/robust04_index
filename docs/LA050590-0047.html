" Alvarado said. "And I said, 'You're not  in a groove, either.' He knows what a groove is now."  </P> <P> Anderson slammed three home runs Friday -- including a game-winning solo shot  in the bottom of the seventh -- to lead Kennedy to a 16-15 win over Cleveland  in a North Valley League game at Kennedy.  </P> <P> Anderson, who has six home runs, was four for five with seven runs batted in  for Kennedy (15-8, 10-5 in league play).  </P> <P> Chatsworth 12, Taft 11 -- A two-out, bases-loaded bunt by Tommy Lee (four for  four, four RBIs) in the bottom of the seventh drove in the winning run in a  wild West Valley League game at Chatsworth.  </P> <P> With Chatsworth (18-5-1, 10-4-1) trailing, 11-10, in the seventh, Mike Mancuso  doubled in a run to tie the score. Taft then walked Mitch Root to load the  bases, but reliever Reed McMackin (8-2) fanned for the second out, setting the  stage for Lee.  </P> <P> John Erganian had four hits and Benji Belfield slammed his sixth home run for  Taft (10-12-1, 8-6-1).  </P> <P> Granada Hills 8, San Fernando 7 -- Jon Condos' double to left sparked a six-run  sixth inning that lifted the visiting Highlanders (6-14-2, 4-9-2) to a North  Valley League victory.  </P> <P> Bryan Martin was three for four, Gabe Miller had two hits and two RBIs and  Condos had a double, a triple and two RBIs to lead Granada Hills.

Walter White was four for four and scored two runs for Saugus  (16-5-1, 12-1).  </P> <P> Quartz Hill 8, Antelope Valley 1 -- Ron Turner allowed three hits and no earned  runs in a complete-game Golden League victory for visiting Quartz Hill (9-11,  5-8).  </P> <P> Agoura 18, Calabasas 5 -- Brian Smith hit two home runs and had five RBIs to  lead Agoura (13-8, 8-0), which clinched its second consecutive Frontier League  title.

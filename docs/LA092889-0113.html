			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLY CUBS!;  </P> <P> CHICAGO CARRIES ON, CARRIES TEAM ON ITS BIG SHOULDERS AFTER NL EAST IS WON  </P> <P> Odds are that Pablo Picasso wasn't much of a Chicago Cubs fan, but Wednesday  the huge Picasso statue that stands guard over the Loop's Civic Center plaza  was sporting a huge, blue Cub cap with a big red C in the middle.  </P> <P> Someone also put a Cub jersey on the statue of Nathan Hale in front of the  Chicago Tribune building. And the streets were suddenly awash in Cub jerseys,  buttons, banners and banter.  </P> <P> "WE'RE IN," declared the banner headline in the Chicago Sun-Times, and anybody  who had to ask who the We referred to surely must have been a foreigner,  extra-terrestrial or worse. It was the Cubs, the break-your-heart,  swoon-in-June, they'll-find-a-way-to-blow-it-somehow Chicago Cubs.  </P> <P> Not this year, however. Or at least not so far this year. The Cubs, who  stumbled through spring training and began the season a reasonably good bet to  finish in their customary spot near the bottom of the standings, clinched the  National League's East Division title Tuesday night with a 3-2 victory over the  Expos in Montreal.  </P> <P> Chicago went wild. Within minutes of Tuesday's last pitch, thousands of  shrieking fans poured into the streets near Wrigley Field. Police chased them  off after about an hour's worth of singing, chanting and drinking, but the  party was just starting.  </P> <P> Although the team was still in Montreal for another game, the city held a huge  noontime pep rally in the civic center plaza that featured local sports and  media stars and, of course, politicians eager to bask in the glow of a winner.  </P> <P> More than 5,000 fans roared approval as Mayor Richard M. Daley painted a big  black X next to the word division on a huge banner that also had spots reserved  for future marks next to the words pennant and World championship.  </P> <P> "Today, we are all Cubs fans," declared Daley, who grew up in the shadow of  Comiskey Park, home of the White Sox -- who figure to finish last in the  American League's Western Division and are definitely the second team in this  second city.  </P> <P> To outsiders, such hoopla might seem a bit premature. After all, the Cubs still  have to beat the Western Division champions, probably the San Francisco Giants,  just to get into the World Series. But Cub fans are a special breed, steeped in  pessimism and inured to adversity. No matter how well the team is doing, the  average Cub follower knows that failure is just around the corner.  </P> <P> The team hasn't won a World Series since 1908 and hasn't even played in one  since a few weeks after the Hiroshima bomb was dropped. The Cubs did win the  division title in 1984, but then blew a two-game lead and lost the playoffs to  the San Diego Padres.  </P> <P> Chicagoans are still muttering about 1969, the infamous year the Cubs built a  huge lead going into the closing weeks and still managed to drop the division  title to the Amazin' Mets.  </P> <P> With such a dubious record behind them, Cub fans can't afford to pass up a  reason to cheer.  </P> <P> "I didn't think they would make it this far," said Dave Livingston, 22, who  turned out for Wednesday's rally. " . . . All the way!" he chanted.  </P> <P> Another fan, Rob Pierson, 27, drove more than 20 miles from his suburban home  to join in the postgame revelry outside Wrigley Field Tuesday night, and he was  on hand for Wednesday's celebration as well.  </P> <P> "We're it!" he screamed, in a hoarse voice.  </P> <P> Cub fever also triggered a run on Cub memorabilia Wednesday as customers  flooded sporting goods shops and other stores to snap up T-shirts, caps and  other products with the team insignia on them. Long lines formed outside the  two official Cub stores in the Chicago area.  </P> <P> Michael Wisniewski, merchandising manager for the shops as well as for  concession stands at the ballpark, said the stores sold more than 20,000  shirts, sweaters and other garments, 5,000 caps and another 5,000 pennants  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I ordered 20,000 garments to take us through the first two games," he said.  "It didn't last the first day."  </P> <P> Anticipating the impossible, fans placed more than 28 million calls over the  weekend to a special phone line as they tried to order playoff and World Series  tickets. The dialing deluge jammed circuits in northern Illinois for hours.  </P> <P> Chris Kadota, waiting patiently in line to buy a Cub cap, said he personally  accounted for 500 of those calls -- and never got through. But then Cub fans  know how to live with disappointment.  </P> <P> Chris Blumentha knows. The die-hard Cub fan, an art student, said she is  willing to pay up to $100 for a ticket to get into a playoff game. Even at that  price, she said, it will be worth it.  </P> <P> "I might never see this again," she said.  </P></p>

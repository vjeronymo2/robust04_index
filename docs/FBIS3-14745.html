			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of state and </F> Supreme Council chairman; place and date not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] The third round of talks held in Geneva on the  comprehensive settlement of the Abkhazian conflict has ended  without success. Although through efforts taken by the Georgian  party, the United Nations, and the Russian federation there  appeared hopes that a consent could be reached over the return  of refugees and the political statute of Abkhazia within the  Georgian borders, the Gudauta group again took a destructive and  uncompromising position thus, actually, failing the talks and  making the situation extremely tense.    I consider it necessary to remind the world community that  Abkhazian separatists have perfidiously violated agreements  signed by them three times. This was nothing else but a  disgraceful disregard of fundamental norms of civilized  behavior. Regardless of these unacceptable activities of the  Gudauta group, and in order to avoid further bloodshed, the  Georgian side spared no efforts to use all possible means for  the peaceful settlement of the conflict. In this respect,  significant assistance was received from the United Nations  Organization, the Russian Federation, the CSCE, and the Group of  Georgia's Friends [a US-based group that includes former  political figures Shultz, Baker, and others]. I cannot help  thanking them for all they did in order that a settlement of the  conflict by political means would become possible.    It is regrettable that in response to their efforts the  Gudauta group launched a new wave of genocide of Georgians, the  tragic effect of which we are already facing. Hundreds of  people were killed and injured, while 15,000 joined those  300,000 refugees who were forced to abandon the land of their  ancestors in order to avoid death. The Abkhazian separatists  have again ignored universally accepted norms and did not permit  a group of UN observers, including the head of the group,  General (Videkaar), to go to Gali Rayon and give an appropriate  assessment of the events taking place there. I believe that  this scandalous act was not followed by an adequate reaction  from international organizations and the whole world community.  Fundamental international norms were disregarded and all this  cannot be left unpunished if we are aspiring to build a just and  harmonious world.    Despite all the abovementioned, the Georgian leadership  regarded it possible to participate in the following meeting in  Geneva in order to completely use even the smallest opportunity  to settle the Abkhazian conflict peacefully.    It is evident that the Gudauta side failed the talks with  the  aim to exterminate or drive a small part of the Georgian  population still remaining there out of Abkhazia, make the  return of refugees impossible, and cut them off from their  motherland Abkhazia forever.    The situation is extremely tense today. I can declare with  all responsibility that in case the negotiating parties, the UN  Security Council, and the Russian Federation fail to find the  fastest way to come out of the crisis, a spontaneous explosion  and renewal of large-scale combat operations will be  unavoidable. This will be followed by a bloodshed the scale and  cruelty of which will exceed everything witnessed by the much  suffered land so far. The events will develop spontaneously and  it will be impossible to keep them under control.    Therefore, we do agree to an immediate continuation of  negotiations. I, personally, am ready to visit the UN Security  Council, meet the UN secretary general, his plenipotentiary  envoy, the leadership of the Russian Federation, and  representatives of friendly countries in order that the  catastrophic effects that will certainly follow the failure of  the Geneva talks are avoided.    A dialogue that will be held in Washington and New York  during my official visit to the United States following  President Clinton's invitation will have to provide a  substantial contribution to a political settlement of the  Abkhazian conflict.</p>

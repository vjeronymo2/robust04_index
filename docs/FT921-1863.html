			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Gadaffi 'ready to hand Lockerbie suspects to UN' THE US and Britain were sceptical last night of a report that Libya was prepared 'in principle' to hand over to the United Nations two men accused of masterminding the bombing of a Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie. The report surfaced as Libya's North African neighbours, headed by Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, engaged in a flurry of meetings to try to head off UN Security Council moves to impose sanctions against Libya, including an arms and civil aviation embargo. In Tunis, an unidentified North African diplomat was quoted as saying that Arab states were 'intensively working' on a solution and that Libya had agreed in principle to surrender the two accused Libyan agents to the UN secretary-general. But British and US officials suggested that Libya might be seeking to win time before an eventual vote on a proposed Security Council resolution calling for sanctions - expected early next week. Britain and the US have demanded, backed by UN resolution 731, that Libya hand over the two men - Mr Abdul Basit Ali Magrahi and Mr Lamin Khalifa Fahima - for trial in either the US or Scotland. France has also demanded that Libya surrender four men suspected of bombing a UTA flight over Niger in 1989. US officials said Libya's unconditional surrender of the two men would suffice to forestall a vote on the UN resolution. Other western officials said the move might ease but not entirely remove pressure on Libya, since Tripoli, under the terms of resolution 731, should still hand over the men linked to the UTA bombing and disassociate itself from all acts of terrorism. Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's regime has wriggled uncomfortably under the pressure from the US, Britain and France. It has proposed a string of solutions short of western demands while stockpiling vital goods and shifting billions of dollars of overseas assets in case of sanctions. Anxiety among Libya's neighbours that Col Gadaffi's regime might be fatally destabilised by external pressure has prompted a concerted attempt to broker a solution, led by Egypt. In its scramble for a way out, Libya yesterday despatched a senior envoy to Riyadh to meet Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi foreign minister, while Major Khoueldi Hamidi, a Libyan defence official, held two sessions of talks with King Hassan of Morocco on Thursday.</p>

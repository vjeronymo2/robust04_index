			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muwaffaq Madani] </F>   [Excerpts] Beirut -- Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has  stated that the recent series of explosions and the political  confusion in his country sought to bring down the state.  However, it had the opposite effect. [passage omitted]    In an interview with AL-BAYAN, the Lebanese prime minister  said that certain individuals tried to exacerbate the situation  and divide the people to influence the visit Pope John Paul II  is scheduled to pay to Lebanon on 28 May. He said they wanted  to influence the pope to adopt the opposition's viewpoint and  stand. Al-Hariri stressed that the pope's visit will take place  as scheduled in spite of all these circumstances. [passage  omitted]    Al-Hariri told AL-BAYAN that his government is in the  process  of adopting a plan to review the recent threats against the  state.    Al-Hariri stressed that this review, which his government  started by tackling the situation on the judicial, security, and  information levels, stems from the fact that his government will  puruse its tasks without a cabinet reshuffle.    Al-Hariri said he expects the general atmosphere in the  Middle East, particularly in Lebanon to change in light of the  satisfaction with the UN Security Council resolution condemning  the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.

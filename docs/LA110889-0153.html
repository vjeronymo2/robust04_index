			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TAIWAN REFUSES TO BAN DRIFT NETS  </P> <P> Taiwan will not bow to international pressure to ban the use of drift nets by  its fishing fleet, the government's top official in charge of fisheries said  today.  </P> <P> "We cannot ban the practice outright as it would affect the livelihood of many  fishermen," said J. C. Lee, acting director of the Fisheries Department.  </P> <P> Taiwan, which Lee said is home to about 260 drift-net fishing boats, has been  accused by the United States and South Pacific nations of wreaking ecological  havoc in the Pacific by using the so-called "wall-of-death" nets. They are also  used by Japanese and South Korean fishing boats.  </P></p>

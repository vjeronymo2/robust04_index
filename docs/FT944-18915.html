			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / SPD guns for Kohl with 100-day plan Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday launched their final assault on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition, two weeks and two days before election day, with the publication of a 100-day action programme to revive the German economy. It includes all the top priorities in the party's future government programme, from job creation to equal rights for women, with a big tax reform package intended to help the lower-paid. There was no sign of controversial plans to introduce a national speed limit, heartily disliked by the powerful motor industry. But, instead, it does include an ingenious scheme to give the owners of ageing motor cars a DM1,000 (Pounds 410) 'scrap bonus' if they swap them for a new model, to revive vehicle production. The party brought out its three biggest guns to bombard the government yesterday with a plethora of proposals to boost demand, create new jobs, and redistribute the soaring tax costs of German unification - all intended to be under way within three months of taking office. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic party (SPD) leader, flanked by Mr Oskar Lafontaine, his deputy and finance spokesman, and Mr Gerhard Schroder, his greatest rival and would-be economy minister, sought to galvanise a wilting German electorate into the final straight, just as the latest opinion polls begin to show signs that the SPD is starting to close the gap on Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. The 100-day programme would be launched by a round table of trade unions, employers, and the German Bundesbank, to design a new job creation strategy as soon as the election is over, the SPD leader said. Over four years, he believes 2m jobs could be created with a DM20bn programme, and 700,000 more in new environmental schemes. As for the party's tax plans, they would mean real reductions for 80 per cent of the tax-paying population, at the expense of the highest income earners, he said. And families will get a big increase in monthly cash payments for each child, to replace the present system of tax allowances. 'Everything we want to do in the first 100 days is intended to stabilise the economy,' Mr Scharping declared. The plans to boost car sales bear the inventive stamp of Mr Schroder, the prime minister of Lower Saxony and supervisory board member of Volkswagen, who was Mr Scharping's great rival for the party leadership. Not only is it intended to give a lift to the ailing motor industry. The 'scrap bonus' plan, first floated by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's chief executive, would appear to turn the old voters' adage on its head: far from worrying whether they should buy a used car from Messrs Scharping, Schroder and Lafontaine, they are simply being asked to sell them.</p>

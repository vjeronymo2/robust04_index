			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Penn State officially became the 11th school in the Big Ten, but it doesn't  mean the conference will change its name.  </P> <P> "Right now, the Big Ten still sounds right even though it may very well be the  Big Ten with an asterisk," said Stanley Ikenberry, president of the University  of Illinois.  </P> <P> Because of scheduling obligations, Penn State is not likely to play a Big Ten  football schedule until the mid-1990s. Other sports should be able to  participate sooner, some as soon as the 1990-91 school year.  </P></p>

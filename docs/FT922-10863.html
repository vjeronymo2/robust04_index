			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Wenham to become LBC Radio chairman LBC RADIO, the London commercial station is to appoint Mr Brian Wenham, former managing director of BBC Radio, as its chairman. Mr Wenham will not only reconstruct the radio company's board but will also lead its bid to retain its franchise, which will be advertised next March. the decision follows the resignation of Mr Christopher Chataway as LBC chairman. Mr Chataway remains chairman of Crown Communications, LBC's parent group. The speech-based service will face stiff competition for the renewal of its licence. Applicants will almost certainly include a consortium put together by Mr Douglas Moffitt, LBC's financial editor for 17 years, who refused to sign a new contract last year. Mr Moffitt has been talking to Sir David Nicholas, former chairman of Independent Television News, about the possibility of leading the franchise application. Mr Brian Hayes was another high profile departure from LBC. He resigned in 1990 after Mr Charlie Cox, the general manager, decided to reschedule for later in the day the morning phone-in programme which Mr Hayes had run for 14 years. LBC has been affected by redundancies, losses at Crown, and what has been seen as the abrasive style of its Australian management. In the year to September 1991, Crown's total deficit came to Pounds 6.79m compared to pre-tax profits of Pounds 611,000 previously. RFM, the company's French radio subsidiary incurred losses of nearly Pounds 3m. The appointment of Mr Wenham, chairman of Crown's small television subsidiary, represents an attempt to strengthen the board in what may be a fight for survival. LBC has already been increasing its audience share, according to industry research.</p>

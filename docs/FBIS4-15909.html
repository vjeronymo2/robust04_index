			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kiev -- Yuriy Serheyev, head of the Foreign  Ministry information department, confirmed at a ministry  briefing on 12th April that Ukraine's Foreign Ministry handed a  note of protest to the Russian ambassador's adviser, Anatoliy  Kovalyov, on 9 April in connection with the situation in Odessa  port on which UNIAN reported before. The note says, in  particular, that the hydrographic navigation equipment based on  the territory of Ukraine remains Ukraine's property until the  division of the Black Sea Fleet. The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs regards the acts of the Russian side as unlawful and  emphasizes that they are a violation of international law.  Ukraine demands that Russia return the equipment and discipline  the people involved in the action. "It can be qualified as overt  terrorism," commented Yuriy Serheyev.    Today's Ukrainian-Russian relations are complicated also by  the fact that, according to some media reports, Russia intends  to deploy military bases in former USSR republics. "Such a  mechanism of deploying military bases on foreign territory is  indeed used around the world, but only given the willingness of  the country where the bases would be deployed," Yuriy Serheyev  stressed.

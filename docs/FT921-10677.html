			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Unauthorised decisions on pensions by Maxwell MR ROBERT MAXWELL made the investment decisions for the Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Fund, even though he was not authorised to conduct investment business, a former trustee told the House of Commons yesterday. Capt Peter Jackson, who became a Mirror Group pension fund trustee early in 1987 after the Maxwell Group acquired British Airways' helicopter division, told the Parliamentary Select Committee on Social Security that Mr Maxwell controlled the other trustees. Among other things, trustee votes and discussions counter to Mr Maxwell's interests were omitted from minutes of meetings. Capt Jackson added that pension funds' cash was held in a Maxwell bank account at Coutts &amp; Company. If trustees questioned the custody they were reassured that the interest rate paid to the pension fund was higher than that which would have been available anywhere else, he said. Capt Jackson produced a letter from the MGN pension fund solicitors, dated August 5 1987, telling the trustees that the requirements of the new Financial Services Act, under which Mr Maxwell would have had to obtain authorisation to conduct investment business from a self-regulatory organisation, were expensive and time consuming. Thus, the letter said, it was advisable that Bishopsgate Investment Management, which was already authorised by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation should take on managing the MGN pension funds. However, Capt Jackson said that up until he left the fund in April 1989, he believed that Mr Maxwell was making the investment decisions. He said that trustees did question some investments obviously related to Mr Maxwell. However, trustees were never told that Mr Maxwell had connections to many of the fund's largest investments. Sir Jeremy Rowe, chairman of the Occupational Pensions Board, defended his organisation's role in safeguarding Maxwell company pensions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Friday in Moscow Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev had a private meeting with the chairman of Tajikistan's  Supreme Soviet Emomali Rakhmonov.    A joint press conference on the results of these talks which  was planned beforehand did not take place. "The question  concerns not only the delicacy of the problems discussed by  Rakhmonov and Kozyrev. We had no opportunity to meet with the  press because we had to go to Viktor Chernomyrdin," one of the  members of the Tajik delegation reported to Interfax.    Sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry reported to Interfax  that Kozyrev and Rakhmonov discussed the process of the  inter-Tajik dialogue, the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border,  and the situation in Tajikistan. "We have declared once more  that many problems facing Tajikistan today can be solved if the  Tajik-Afghan dialogue results in a civil peace in the republic,"  a high ranking Russian diplomat declared in his interview with  Interfax.    He reported that the parties had only indirectly touched  upon  the issue on Tajikistan's joining the ruble zone. "This is the  subject for negotiations between the Tajik leader and the  Russian Prime Minister,' he said.    According to Interfax interlocutor, Russia does not link the  issue on Tajikistan's joining the ruble zone with a complete  normalization of the situation in the republic. "One should be a  realist -- the settlement process in Tajikistan will take much  time and the issue on the expansion of the ruble zone concerning  Tajikistan can be solved quicker," he said.</p>

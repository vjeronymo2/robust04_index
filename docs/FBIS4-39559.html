			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikita Gololobov report in the "Power" column: </F> "Chernomyrdin Will Soon Return to Moscow. German Specialists  Say His Health Is Excellent"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] According to the DPA agency,  "seven specialists have examined Chernomyrdin but made no  diagnosis. According to chief urologist Professor Rudolf  Gogenfellner, Chernomyrdin's health condition is excellent."    The question arises: Is Chernomyrdin's unexpected trip to  Germany a way of "setting the stage" for his resignation "for  health reasons"? It is noteworthy that, according to a source  in the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, people from the  entourage of First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, who are  currently staying with him in Malaysia, indicated that their  "chief" might soon become prime minister. Oleg Soskovets, who  did not rule out such a possibility, seems to be further  distancing himself from his boss.    Another likely candidate for the post of head of government  -- Commodity Producers Federation Chairman Yuriy Skokov -- is  behaving amazingly calmly in this situation. According to a  source in the federation apparatus, the federation is working in  a normal mode.</p>

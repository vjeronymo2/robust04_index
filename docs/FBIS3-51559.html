			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panama City, 23 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- The Nationalist  Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena) elected today Ruben Dario  Carles, former Panamanian comptroller general, its presidential  candidate for the 8 May 1994 elections.    Carles--whom his opponents have accused of having obstructed  the disbursement of budget funds for social programs while in  the Comptroller General's Office--was elected by a majority vote  at the Molirena national convention held at the convention  center in the capital.    Molirena decided last night to cease supporting the  government alliance which has led the country since 1989. This  has prompted Panamanian President Guillermo Endara to announce  that he will reshuffle his cabinet in view of the possible  withdrawal of Molirena ministers from the government.    The path toward the election of the septuagenarian was  cleared after Panamanian Vice President Guillermo Ford renounced  during its convention his aspirations to be the presidential  candidate for this political group.    Guillermo Guijano, the Molirena former housing minister who  suffered heart problems in the past hours, was chosen first vice  president candidate, and Tomas Herrera, of the Civic Renewal  Party (PRC), was chosen for the second vice president slot.    Carles will be nominated by new right-wing parties, namely,  the National Renewal Movement, PRC, and a faction of Popular  Alliance (AP), led by former Mayor Mayin Correa, which were left  out of the elections by the Electoral Tribunal (TE).    The Arnulfista Party (PA) also held its national convention  today. This party, to which President Guillermo Endara belongs,  elected as is presidential candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber,  widow of Arnulfo Arias Madrid, a caudillo and three-time  Panamanian president.    Moscoso, who is a novice in politics, is the sole female  presidential candidate and will head a new alliance supported by  the minority Authentic Liberal Party (PLA), the only remaining  party of the 1989 opposition alliance.    PLA leader Arnulfo Escalona was nominated for the slot of  first vice president, and Jose Teran, of the minority Liberal  Party (PL), which was part of the previous military government,  was chosen for the second vice president position.    These three parties were joined by other minority groups,  namely, the Popular Nationalist Party (PNP), Independent  Democratic Union (UDI), and an AP faction. A reply from the  National Unity Mission (MUN), which objected to Escalona's  candidacy, is expected.</p>

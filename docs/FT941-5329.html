			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets watch Germany and the US - Currency Markets Attention this week in foreign exchanges will focus on the two central banks whose activities have combined recently to throw financial markets into disarray. On the one hand all eyes will be on the Bundesbank on Tuesday to see whether, and by how much, it cuts the repo rate - the key rate it uses to establish the level of money market rates. Last week the German central bank trimmed the rate by 3 basis points to 5.97 per cent from 6 per cent. Most observers expect it will continue the 'salami' process of trimming rates down in small, weekly increments. On the other hand, the market remains very skittish about the US inflation outlook. Although the Fed did not tighten policy on Friday after the release of employment data, many believe a tightening remains imminent - and the sooner the better. Most analysts agree that weak European economies need lower rates and look to Germany to provide a lead. They argue that Europe needs decisively to 'decouple' from the US, where economic recovery is much more advanced. One factor inhibiting the Bundesbank is the industrial dispute in the engineering sector. At the end of last week, employers and unions were trying to reach agreement, but few expected the central bank to move decisively while the whiff of strikes and lock-outs remained in the air. Various data releases this week - principally tomorrow's fourth quarter GDP figure, expected to confirm a 'double-dip' at the end of last year - should lend support to the case for a monetary easing. Two main factors are currently influencing the dollar: the trade dispute with Japan, and the market view that the Fed is likely to push rates up again. Last week the dollar actually rose after President Clinton announced the re-activation of the Super 301 executive order which will allow the US to impose trade sanctions against Japan. The market's obsession with the US inflation outlook will have to wait until next week for price data. In the interim, Friday's retail sales figures and the Fed's tan book, to be released on Wednesday, are sure to be the subject of intense scrutiny. Sterling has been out of the limelight since the furore over last month's 25 basis points cut in rates. Most observers expect another cut of similar magnitude, but the Bank of England is expected to wait until later in the month, or April, when it has fresh, and supportive, inflation data.</p>

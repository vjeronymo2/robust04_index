			<p>BFN     [Text] President Boris Yeltsin is meeting with heads of the  Russian Federation's republics in one of his residences  southwest of Moscow Thursday. Opening the meeting, Yeltsin  pointed out that the old tradition of meetings with heads of the  republics is being revived. "We plan to hold such meetings five  to seven times a year," he said. "Such a meeting is being held  for the first time after the adoption of the Constitution and  elections to the Federal Assembly. In the past months a lot of  changes have taken place, political stabilization is gaining  momentum. The ruinous division of power has been overcome."    Yeltsin particularly noted that he "practically has no  differences" with the speakers of the Federal Assembly Chambers  Ivan Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko with whom he has been meeting  on a regular basis. Yeltsin said that after adopting the  constitution, new federative relations started to form. Out of  88 subjects of the Federation, the elections took place and  "were registered" in 61, and 17 subjects did not gather the  necessary number of votes. Yeltsin expressed hope that elections  to local bodies will be fully completed this year. Then a full  balance of powers will be established, the president noted.</p>

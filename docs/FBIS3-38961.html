Addressing the Human Rights  Commission meeting in Geneva, the leader of the Pakistan  delegation, Mr. Iqbal Akhund, said the only possible solution to  the Kashmir dispute is the one which is acceptable to the people  of Kashmir. He said that it will bring peace to the people of  the subcontinent and strengthen the forces of democracy and  progress in Pakistan and India. The Pakistan delegate said that  over the last 45 years, India has maintained its occupation of  occupied Kashmir, but has been unable to win the support of the  Kashmiri people. At present, there are 600,000 Indian troops in  occupied Kashmir engaged in suppressing the popular uprising  against Indian occupation.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Caledonia ahead 26% to Pounds 45m - Bulk of growth provided by associated companies Caledonia Investments, the investment vehicle controlled by the Cayzer family, yesterday announced a 22 per cent increase in its net asset value during the 12 months to March 31, from 559p to 681p. Pre-tax profits increased by 26 per cent, from Pounds 36m to Pounds 45.2m. The bulk of the growth came from the associated trading companies, primarily Bristow Helicopters and Exco, which increased their contribution from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 23.7m. The results were in line with analysts' expectations, and the shares were unchanged at 688p. Bristow was only owned for 9 months of the 1992-93 year, but the company had a strong year in 1993-94, repaying Pounds 36.5m of debt to reduce the total to Pounds 79m. Mr Peter Buckley, chairman, said a weaker oil price had led to a tougher North Sea market, and Bristow's earnings were likely to decline in the current year. Exco, included for seven months in 1992, contributed Pounds 41.5m, up 52 per cent, in the year to December 1993 aided by a surge in volumes in the government securities market. Exco's flotation should be launched next week, but Caledonia has said that it will maintain its 27.3 per cent stake. The flotation will not affect the stake's book value, but it could substantially boost external valuations of Caledonia's worth. The industrial division, principally 75 per cent-owned Amber Industrial, contributed Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.8m) which included Pounds 700,000 from the sale of Causeway Steel Products. The property and services division suffered a loss of Pounds 1.8m due to a Pounds 3.7m provision against valuations. The company has a broad spread of smaller investments. These include a 23 per cent stake in Close Brothers, the merchant banking group, which is now worth about Pounds 51m after a profits turnround last year. Caledonia is proceeding with a 33 per cent stake in Sun International, which recently invested in a Dollars 125m (Pounds 82.2m) resort development in the Bahamas. At the year end, Caledonia had cash and short-term deposits of Pounds 59.2m. The recommended final dividend of 10.8p makes a full-year distribution of 16.2p (15p), up 8 per cent.</p>

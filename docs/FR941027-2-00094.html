POC Contact Technical Representative: Barrett Rock, 202&hyph;395&hyph;7600. The Government is interested in receiving proposals that address the development of services and materials to support scientific measurements, environmental education, teacher training, and program evaluation as part of the GLOBE Program. The GLOBE Program is an international education and science program that will involve students all over the Earth in measuring their local environment and creating a global set of data to be shared via the Internet that will be used to create global environmental images for the students and by environmental scientists. GLOBE is driven in part by the measurement needs of scientists and will be structured to teach students about the Earth's environment, thereby generating increased interest in science and awareness of the changing global environment. A public briefing will be held from 10:00 to 12:00 on November 3, 1994, in the Auditorium of the Department of Commerce, which is entered on 14th St. between Constitution Ave. and E St. in Washington, DC. Organizations planning to attend should provide a list of attendees, limit two per organization, to John Schmidt, 202&hyph;395&hyph;7600, FAX 202&hyph;395&hyph;7611. The Program Announcement, which contains a detailed description of the competition, will be released on or about October 28, 1994; deadline for receipt of proposals is December 15, 1994. Any award is subject to availability of funds. Proposals will be evaluated by a peer review panel, which will meet in January, 1995. Written requests for copies of the announcement should be directed to Dr. Barrett Rock. The GLOBE Program, 744 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20503.

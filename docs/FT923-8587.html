			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Manders confirms its rejection of Kalon offer MANDERS (HOLDINGS), the paints, inks and property group fighting for its independence from Kalon, the Yorkshire-based paints maker, yesterday officially rejected its rival's final Pounds 93.5m offer. However, it is understood that in a later development, Manders is having to issue a retraction of at least part of its document. Mr Roy Amos, chairman, repeated that the offer 'grossly undervalued Manders', that Kalon's share price - static at 89 1/2 p yesterday - was fragile because of its over-dependency on a 'handful of large customers' and that the combined Kalon/Manders business could not achieve the Pounds 5m cost savings claimed by Kalon. He also said that Kalon's management record in chemicals and industrial coatings was 'dismal', that it had not produced a profits forecast and that its offer was not underwritten. It is thought that Kalon complained of this last point saying that it did not want to underwrite its original all-share offer, preferring to preserve cash for the development of the combined businesses. Kalon increased its share offer from 8-for-3 to 17-for-6 at the end of last week and added a cash alternative of seven of its shares plus 150p for each three Manders shares. Mr Mike Hennessy, group managing director of Kalon, dismissed Manders' document as a 'kneejerk reaction full of the old arguments'. He questioned the motives of Manders' management in its 'change of mind' over the possible sale of the Manders Centre and of Windeck, Manders own-label paint factory, revealed in the last few days by James Capel. Capel also forecast that Kalon would increase pre-tax profit to Pounds 13m this year from Pounds 9.2m last year.</p>

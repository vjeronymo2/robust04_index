"Figurative  '50s: New York Figurative Expressionism," seen here last year, has moved on to  the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio,  Texas. Last year's controversial "Chris Burden: A 20-Year Survey" is now at the  Carnegie Mellon University Art Gallery in Pittsburgh and will travel in August  to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston.  </P> <P> Seen in Newport Beach last spring, "Gunther Forg:  Painting/Sculpture/Installation" opened earlier this month at the San Francisco  Museum of Modern Art. And when "L.A. Pop in the '60s" closes at Newport Harbor  on July 9, it will be packed for shipping to the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle.  Future stops include the Palm Springs Desert Museum, the Neuberger Museum in  Purchase, N.Y., and the Phoenix Art Museum.  </P></p>

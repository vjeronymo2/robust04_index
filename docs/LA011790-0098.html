			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE EPI THREE;  </P> <P> FASHION: THE SIBLINGS BEHIND EPILADY HAIR REMOVER HAVE A VERY PROFITABLE EYE  FOR GADGETS.  </P> <P> Their new Santa Monica headquarters are already too small. The telephones in  their Virginia Beach, Va., customer service center ring to the tune of 2,000  calls per day. In less than three years, they have launched 20 personal care  products and talk about a 1989 sales figure of $200 million.  </P> <P> Meet the entrepreneurial Epiladies (a.k.a. the Krok sisters): Sharon, Arlene  and Loren. Young (31, 29, 24 respectively), smart and born to hate the hair on  their legs.  </P> <P> "Basically, we've always been obsessed with that problem," explains Sharon Krok  Feuer. Their solution has made them the talk of the cosmetics and the  personal-care industries. They are the women behind the Epilady, a hand-held  device with a rotating coil that pulls hair out at the root. Also to their  credit are EpiSauna, EpiSsage, EpiPed and EpiSmile, to name a few of the  goodies from their EPI (Essential Personal Items) Products company.  </P> <P> Their success depends in part on their eye for good gadgets. Instead of  inventing every one, they frequently acquire the distribution rights for  existing items, or they buy products outright from the inventor. Epilady, for  example, was developed by two Israeli engineers and is manufactured on a  kibbutz in Upper Galilee.  </P> <P> Five days after Loren and their father, Solly Krok, discovered the  revolutionary hair remover, the family owned distribution rights in the United  States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. (Solly Krok is a South African  philanthropist and multimillionaire, who with his twin brother owns Twin-Med,  an international pharmaceutical company. One by one, the sisters moved to the  United States.)  </P> <P> Stephen Ross, EPI Products' chief financial officer and a longtime friend of  the Krok family, says there has always been a game plan: "To become a major  personal care company in the United States. With that decision, we built up a  dental and a skin-care division to go with our hair-care division.  </P> <P> "It's totally unusual. You can count on one hand those who have gone from  nothing to $200 million.  </P> <P> "We believe in divine providence," Ross says, "but we enforce that by being an  extremely philanthropic organization. We give large amounts to charities. It's  our belief that what goes around comes around. That's a lesson taught to us by  Mr. Krok. He taught us to give."  </P> <P> The business does seem to have grown by divine providence. Epilady was launched  in the United States in 1987 at Bloomingdale's Manhattan store. Fifteen hundred  units were sold during the first week, even though it took extensive  advertising, in-store videos and a toll-free number to get consumers past the  fear of discomfort associated with the product.  </P> <P> A few months later, in what seems to be the story of their lives, the Krok  sisters came across their next product.  </P> <P> As luck would have it, the Epilady was featured in a newspaper Sunday magazine  story about new grooming devices that also included a photograph of a portable  mini-facial sauna from Miami Beach, Fla.-based Bernhard Industries.  </P> <P> "It was a beautiful shot" recalls Arlene. "We said, 'We love this product.  Maybe we should contact the owner.' " They did, "he was dying to sell," and  three months later EpiSauna was launched.  </P> <P> Not long after, Loren stumbled upon what would become EpiSmile (a four-ounce,  $12 cylinder of toothpaste sold only in department stores). It was invented by  Dr. Irwin Smigel -- the New York dentist who pioneered a tooth-bonding  technique -- specifically as a whitener for bonded teeth. Later, he says, he  found that it removed stains on all teeth. Loren used it and raved to her  sisters about what was then Super Smile; they tried it and wanted it for keeps.  </P> <P> Smigel says at least three giant corporations were after his secret formula.  But it went to the Krok sisters "because I really trusted them. Super Smile was  very difficult to make. Either a chemist or I had to be there to check on every  batch. I was always afraid one of the big companies would dilute the formula to  make it easier to produce. The EPI people were willing to put in writing there  would be no changes without my permission. That was good enough for me."  </P> <P> Despite a heady string of successes, the Krok sisters, by all accounts, remain  down to earth. Employees, suppliers and retailers say they are accessible and  receptive to new ideas. The EpiHeat pack, for example, was suggested by a  supervisor in the Virginia Beach Service Center, and Smigel says he has just  sold EPI Products the rights to another formula.  </P> <P> Within the industry, about the worst anyone has said of the Krok women is that  they drive a hard bargain.  </P> <P> Arlene, for example, got MEPRO, the Israeli manufacturer of Epilady, to agree  she would get "a million-dollar yacht" if EPI Products sold more than 3 million  of the hair removers in the United States during the first year.  </P> <P> Six months later, EPI Products had filled the quota, and MEPRO came through  with a 68-foot sailboat and a full-time captain.  </P> <P> "The three sisters have the reputation of being very tough, but I don't think  that's bad," says Suzanne Grayson, a marketing consultant in Santa Barbara and  author of the Grayson Report, an industry newsletter. "Considering what they  have accomplished . . . they have done an incredible job.  </P> <P> "They have managed to find a niche in which they are all alone. They have no  real competition, which is certainly not true in the rest of the cosmetics  industry. And they've done a very good marketing job; they've been able to be  mass and class at the same time, which is a neat trick."  </P> <P> The company is structured so that Arlene, a wiry, hip-dressing workaholic, is  the president in charge of operations. Soft-spoken Sharon, married and the  mother of two young children, is executive vice president in charge of  advertising and marketing. Loren, the most glamorous of the three, lives in New  York, where she handles East Coast operations and telephone sales. She is the  co-producer of the current Broadway revival of "Meet Me in St. Louis."  </P> <P> "When we started, we decided it would be a family business where we could all  work together," says Bernice Krok Ungar, 26, the fourth of the Epiladies and  the last of the seven Krok children to settle in California.  </P> <P> "We're all very close and very close in age," she says, adding that two  brothers, Ian and Martin, have their own businesses in Irvine. A third brother,  Paul, is a student at USC and might be the first male in the family to work at  EPI Products.  </P> <P> "When he's not busy at school he sits in on meetings," says Bernice, whose own  project is working on a new line of "back to nature" cosmetics.  </P> <P> "To stay in business, you have to come out with more and more products," says  Arlene, who is always on the lookout for such modern marvels as EpiBrush -- a  self-cleaning hairbrush that was knocking around the Far East with no takers  until the Kroks came along -- and a cellulite fighter called EpiSsage, which  they discovered at a Danish trade show.  </P> <P> As more and more products come rolling out, and competition increases (among  the most recent, Remington Products introduced Smooth and Silky, a hair-removal  device similar to the Epilady), the Kroks have expanded their strategy. They  now offer "ultra" versions of their original products to department stores and  have put less deluxe models into stores at the K mart level. They also rely on  extremely slick, massive advertising campaigns (currently budgeted at $42  million).  </P> <P> The clout behind EPI is undeniable.  </P> <P> "No one is going to turn down anything EPI comes out with in the future," says  Doreen Erickson, J.C. Penney cosmetics buyer for beauty accessories.  </P> <P> "What I'm saying is, if they came out with an EPI handbag, we'd be watching to  see what they would be doing with it."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> d. develop and submit, consistent with this Policy and based on a schedule in an appropriate enforceable mechanism, a long-term CSO control plan as soon as practicable, but generally within two years after the effective date of the permit issuance/ modification. However, permitting authorities may establish a longer timetable for completion of the long-term CSO control plan on a case-by-case basis to account for site-specific factors that may influence the complexity of the planning process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPDES authority should include compliance dates on the fastest practicable schedule for each of the nine minimum controls in an appropriate enforceable mechanism issued in conjunction with the Phase I permit. The use of enforceable orders is necessary unless Congress amends the CWA. All orders should require compliance with the nine minimum controls no later than January 1, 1997. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Phase II Permits_Requirements for Implementation of a Long-Term CSO Control Plan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once the permittee has completed development of the long-term CSO control plan and the selection of the controls necessary to meet CWA requirements has been coordinated with the permitting and WQS authorities, the permitting authority should include, in an appropriate enforceable mechanism, requirements for implementation of the long-term CSO control plan as soon as practicable. Where the permittee has selected controls based on the ``presumption'' approach described in Section II.C.4, the permitting authority must have determined that the presumption that such level of treatment will achieve water quality standards is reasonable in light of the data and analysis conducted under this Policy. The Phase II permit should contain: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Requirements to implement the technology-based controls including the nine minimum controls determined on a BPJ basis; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Narrative requirements which insure that the selected CSO controls are implemented, operated and maintained as described in the long-term CSO control plan; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Water quality-based effluent limits under 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1) and 122.44(k), requiring, at a minimum, compliance with, no later than the date allowed under the State's WQS, the numeric performance standards for the selected CSO controls, based on average design conditions specifying at least one of the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. A maximum number of overflow events per year for specified design conditions consistent with II.C.4.a.i; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. A minimum percentage capture of combined sewage by volume for treatment under specified design conditions consistent with II.C.4.a.ii; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. A minimum removal of the mass of pollutants discharged for specified design conditions consistent with II.C.4.a.iii; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iv. performance standards and requirements that are consistent with II.C.4.b. of the Policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. A requirement to implement, with an established schedule, the approved post-construction water quality assessment program including requirements to monitor and collect sufficient information to demonstrate compliance with WQS and protection of designated uses as well as to determine the effectiveness of CSO controls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. A requirement to reassess overflows to sensitive areas in those cases where elimination or relocation of the overflows is not physically possible and economically achievable. The reassessment should be based on consideration of new or improved techniques to eliminate or relocate overflows or changed circumstances that influence economic achievability; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead Pilkington, the glass maker, reports interim results on Thursday and is expected to see profits fall once more. A cut in the dividend is likely after the reduction in the year-end dividend in June. There is a wide range of estimates, with the pessimists expecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 10m or less, against Pounds 50.6m, after more exceptional costs. There is the chance, though, that Mr Roger Leverton, the new chief executive, will take the opportunity to announce substantial redundancies, and make provisions which could push the group into losses. Interim results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle on Monday are expected to reflect tougher trading conditions in the beer market and two disappointing summer months for its UK holiday operations. A five per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 110m is forecast. Siebe, the engineering systems and controls group, looks set to continue its solid performance since its Pounds 357m acquisition in 1990 of US group Foxboro. Analysts forecast a modest improvement in pre-tax profit to Pounds 76.5m (Pounds 75.2m) for the six months to September, when results are published next week. The interim dividend is likely to be increased marginally, to 3.3p - last year's payout was 6.05p but there was a one-for-one capitalisation issue in September. Airtours, the UK's third largest package holiday company, is expected to report on Monday pre-tax profits of between Pounds 34m and Pounds 36m for the year to September, against Pounds 27.5m last time. The collapse of some smaller travel companies will probably have offset some of the summer discounting and a strong end to the year (since July) is expected. Also reporting on Monday is Westland, the helicopter group. Profits are expected to edge up from last time's Pounds 23.7m to about Pounds 24m or Pounds 24.5m. The group's order gap could continue until after 1994, in which it is possible there will be no helicopter deliveries. Profits could stay at the current level for the next couple of years. Carlton Communications, the television and video group, is likely to report on Tuesday a rise of some 15 per cent in pre-tax profits for the year ended September to around Pounds 102m. Expectations are that Thursday's interim pre-tax profit at Great Universal Stores, the retailer, should be slightly ahead at about Pounds 193m (Pounds 187m). Compass Group, the catering and hospitals concern that recently bought the Travellers Fare snack shops business, is expected to report a rise of about Pounds 3m in annual pre-tax profit to Pounds 35m.</p>

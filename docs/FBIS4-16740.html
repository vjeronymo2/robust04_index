			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 Apr -- If Russia does not join the  Partnership for Peace program, the world could be returned to a  cold war situation, in the view of Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of  the Duma defense committee. He announced this at a news  conference today in the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly.  Sergey Yushenkov said he is surprised at the position of the  Russian Federation's executive authority, "which is not trying  to demonstrate the advantage of Russia joining the Partnership."    The Russian Federation president, defense minister, and  foreign minister should immediately declare their intention to  join the program, in spite of the latest events in former  Yugoslavia, Sergey Yushenkov asserted. At the same time, he  stressed, those who "made the decision to carry out the bombing  near Gorazde should admit their error."    The Duma committee chairman noted that a new situation has  come about in relations between the West and Russia following  the bombing of Serb positions. The Russian foreign minister's  refusal to sign the document was the result of this. "The air  strikes," Sergey Yushenkov stressed, "mark the end of the  `romantic' phase of our relationship. Further divergence of our  views, even including a break-up, is now possible. Or else our  relations can develop on a completely pragmatic basis, in which  the real interests of the sides will be heeded."    Speaking in favor of joining Partnership for Peace, the Duma  committee chairman stressed that in his view this document does  not contain a single initiative which has not already been  proposed, in one form or another, by the leadership of the USSR  and the Russian Federation.    Referring to the main "trump card" held by Russian opponents  of the Partnership -- the claim that the document does not  reflect "the Russian Federation's special status as a great  nuclear power" -- Sergey Yushenkov noted that only Russia  itself, by taking part in the program, can determine this  status. "If Russia really does want to maintain this status, it  has more interest in signing this document than other  countries," he stressed.    Sergey Yushenkov believes that membership of the Partnership  does not in any way mean that the Russian Federation will join  NATO in due course. In his view, the program is "just one of  the steps toward the building of a new system of universal  security." The program itself, he noted, is "merely a protocol  of intent -- the attitude which Russia does eventually take  during possible involvement in Partnership-sponsored measures is  another matter."</p>

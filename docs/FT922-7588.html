			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Afghanistan factions fail to resolve differences AFGHAN Defence Minister Ahmad Shah Masood met hardline guerrilla chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar but the two rivals failed to resolve their differences, Tehran Radio said yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia. The radio, quoting an Afghan Defence Ministry source, said the two met outside the Afghan capital Kabul on Saturday. 'During the meeting Hekmatyar once again insisted on his demands, saying that General Abdul Rashid Dostum's forces should leave Kabul. Masood, however, opposed his demands,' the radio said. Gen Dostum's Uzbek forces defected from the former government of President Najibullah and were crucial to Mr Masood's capture of Kabul and his eviction of Hekmatyar's men from the city later. The Defence Ministry source said Mr Hekmatyar and Mr Masood would meet again on Sunday for a second round of talks. Guerrillas loyal to Mr Masood drove Mr Hekmatyar's forces out of Kabul in a battle for control of the capital earlier this month. Mr Hekmatyar's forces later shelled Kabul but the capital has enjoyed relative calm since the start of a ceasefire 11 days ago.</p>

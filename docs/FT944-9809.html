			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Schumacher takes world title despite crash Germany's Michael Schumacher leading Britain's Damon Hill in the Adelaide Grand Prix yesterday. On the 36th lap the pair crashed out of the race spectacularly, which meant that Schumacher became the first German world motor-racing champion, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. Schumacher was leading when Hill clipped the side of the German's Benetton-Ford while trying to overtake on the inside of a turn. Out went Schumacher. And out went Hill's Williams-Renault, which suffered structural damage. The British driver had needed to pip Schumacher to snatch the title. Yesterday's race was the climax to a Formula One season marked by tragedies and controversies. In the end, though, motor racing confirmed its status as one of the most glamorous of big-time, big-money sports. Britain's Nigel Mansell won the Adelaide race in a Williams-Renault as his team took the constructors' championship for a third year running. Schumacher won the drivers' championship with 92 points. Hill had 91, followed by Gerhard Berger of Austria (41). Schumacher won eight races this season, Hill six.</p>

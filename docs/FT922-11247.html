			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / International Bonds: Spotlight on credit analysis FOR EVIDENCE that a corporate bond market is developing in Europe, look no farther: a band of specialist credit analysts is springing up around the City of London, bringing a new approach to European bond investment. The new breed of fixed income analysts is no different in many ways from the army of equity analysts that already follows the most heavily-traded stocks. The name of the game is the same, to spot undervalued securities and tip off investors about their merits. Investors remain concerned primarily with currency and maturity when picking bonds to buy. Credit comes a poor third: provided a bond carries a single-A rating from one of the leading rating agencies (or, for some choosy investors, a double-A) then many investors look no farther. Two things are changing. One is the growing list of European companies that is looking to tap the international bond markets. According to Mr Mike Denham, head of fixed income at Prudential, one of the few UK investment institutions to start developing in-house credit skills: 'We expect to see some increased opportunities in the debt markets due to the increasing disintermediation of banks. That means we have to have a better understanding of credit quality.' The second change is the EC's progress towards monetary union. Convergence of European bond yields may have been put on hold temporarily, but few in the bond market doubt that economic and monetary convergence between members of the EC will continue in the long term. As that happens, there will be less opportunity to turn a profit by playing the spreads between different European currencies - and so a greater attention to the spreads between different credits. US banks - which, thanks to the more developed US bond market, have experience in credit research since the mid-1970s - are among the leaders in developing specialist analysis in London, although they are far from alone. JP Morgan Securities, for instance, imported a credit analyst from the US 18 months ago and now has three people working in the area in London. Merrill Lynch appointed its first credit analyst in London three years ago, while Morgan Stanley has followed suit more recently. Among European banks, UBS has recently appointed a credit analyst to work in its debt and treasury division. Credit Suisse First Boston has been in the business longer than most, with its first analyst in place five years ago. But it, too, has been developing recently, bringing together its internal credit analysts with others who advise investors to create a five-person team. CSFB's analysts have been organised on industry lines, much as equity analysts are usually organised. Almost without exception, all these banks expect to recruit more specialist analysts in the near future. Growing attention to credit analysis has given birth to a new kind of literature from the bond-market houses, similar to the 'tip sheets' sent out by equity analysts. Recent examples: a paper on the UK property sector from CSFB, a disquisition on the virtues of Welsh Water from Barings, and an analysis of the relative value of selected Eurodollar credits from JP Morgan. Does this signal tough new competition for the rating agencies, which until now have had a virtual monopoly on public credit information? Not necessarily, since the independence of the credit analysis emanating from bond houses may at times be open to question. Much of it is part of a service to corporate clients, generated to back up new bond issues launched by a particular house. Other research is intended to stimulate investors to trade. Rating agencies, though, offer no comment on the value of securities. They are also frequently criticised for being late when changing their ratings - leaving plenty of scope for analysts to delve for undiscovered value in the growing European corporate bond market.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREENBACK ADS  </P> <P> With the best minds in Washington continually failing to come up with a  workable plan to reduce the deficit you'd think the problem was a difficult  one. Look again! The answer is so simple it's staring George Washington in the  face.  </P> <P> Let Uncle Sam sell advertising space on the backs of our paper currency. Just  think, little billboards in our wallets. Imagine the price McDonalds would pay  to advertise a Big Mac on a greenback! And how much do you think Mrs. Paul  would fork over to place "In Cod We Trust" on the back of a fin? How about a  little ad on the back of a single that says, "If this bill's for US, this Bud's  for YOU." Or an Alpha Beta ad that reads, "One dollar off with this coupon!"  Five'll get you ten Madison Avenue will have the deficit cleared up in no time.  </P> <P> JEFFREY SCOTT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

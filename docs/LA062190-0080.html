			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FUN FOR THE YOUNG;  </P> <P> ACTIVITIES: HUNDREDS OF ANTIDOTES ARE AVAILABLE TO REFUTE YOUNGSTERS' AGE-OLD  SUMMER COMPLAINT -- 'THERE'S NOTHING TO DO!'  </P> <P> With vacation just beginning, organizations all over the South Bay are working  to keep young people this summer from ever having to say: "I'm bored. There's  nothing to do."  </P> <P> Parents who have waited until the last minute to plan entertainment for their  children will find that scores of classes and dozens of public and private  camps still have openings.  </P> <P> Available are a surfing class in Hermosa Beach, horseback riding in Palos  Verdes, arts and crafts in Inglewood, piano playing in Hawthorne, pumping iron  in Torrance and beach bingo on Catalina Island.  </P> <P> If those events prove too mundane, how about contests in gum-blowing,  frog-jumping and lip-syncing? Or a crash course on the stock market at Los  Angeles Harbor College for pint-sized brokers?  </P> <P> The various activities range from one-time sessions to summer-long programs and  are being sponsored by camps, community organizations, colleges and city  recreation departments.  </P> <P> Day camps throughout the area have openings, including one that welcomes the  entire family, sponsored by the Gardena YMCA. Held at Lake Sequoia in the San  Joaquin Valley over Labor Day weekend, the camp allows parents and children "to  do a lot of goofy things that people don't do in the city," such as  frog-jumping contests, said the YMCA's Jenny Mulhollin.  </P> <P> Those seeking refuge from the heat will find swimming lessons offered at pool  after pool and, cooler still, ice-skating instruction at Ice Capades Chalet in  Rolling Hills Estates.  </P> <P> There are programs in volleyball, softball, soccer, tennis, ballet and  aerobics, a two-week Kung Fu Camp at Hesse Park in Rancho Palos Verdes, and a  jazz dancing class at the Hermosa Beach Community Center.  </P> <P> "If you're going to be hanging out in your body for 70 years, you should learn  to move it right," said Mona Jean Cedar, a professional dancer who will teach  the jazz dance class for children 8 to 16.  </P> <P> Children will not only dance to music by Paula Abdul, New Kids on the Block and  other popular artists, they also will learn the "difference between nightclub  dancing and trained dancing," Cedar said.  </P> <P> Surfing instructor Jim Cubberley, who has been riding waves for 30 of his 40  years, will share his expertise at Hermosa Beach. He says his classes are most  popular among those who live near the beach and who grew up elsewhere.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of people that have the California beach lifestyle in their head  -- girls, volleyball, surfing," he said. "Many of them are from places like New  York and Chicago and have always wanted to come out to California to learn to  surf."  </P> <P> The surfing classes are open to those 17 and over. A popular body-boarding  course that Cubberley teaches for children 8 and over is already closed.  </P> <P> Those more interested in exercising their brains than their muscles will find  chess instruction offered by the Gardena Recreation and Human Services  Department.  </P> <P> National master Robert Snyder said his classes, open to children 7 to 15, are  as much entertainment as instruction. He use rhymes such as Knights on the rim  are dim to teach youngsters the strategies of the game.  </P> <P> Other academic activities will be offered at the "College for Kids" program at  Harbor College in Wilmington. At the stock market course, children 10 to 14  will learn the differences between commercial banks and savings and loans, and  delve into stocks, bonds, mutual funds, certificates of deposit and individual  retirement accounts.  </P> <P> "If kids can get the basic concept of saving money when they're young, they'll  be in a better position later on," said instructor Gary Cummings, a financial  planner based in Torrance. "Most people spend 40 hours a week working just to  pay their bills."  </P> <P> Based on past experience, Cummings said, participants will fall into three  groups when the course is over: those who know more than the average adult does  about financial planning, those who have some idea of the fundamentals, and  those who "might as well have been playing basketball."  </P> <P> Don Brown, associate dean of instruction at El Camino College in Torrance, said  he is surprised by the number of young people enrolling in the college's basic  mathematics course for junior high and high school students.  </P> <P> "You'd think that would be the last thing a kid would want to take in the  summer," he said. The college also offers classes in astronomy, weightlifting,  automotive repair, spelling improvement and other topics.  </P> <P> At county libraries in Lennox, Carson, Hawthorne and other South Bay cities,  children can earn small prizes for spending their summer months reading.  </P> <P> "Kids love buttons; kids love stickers, and some of those kids will read that  book so they can get (them)," said Tom Martinez, youth services coordinator of  the County of Los Angeles Public Library Western region. "For the kids who  already read, (the gifts) are just icing on the cake."  </P> <P> Those interested in the arts will find many avenues for expression across the  South Bay.  </P> <P> In El Segundo, future actors 9 and over may enroll in a six-week movement class  that turns everyday movements and situations into dance. Margaret Theriot, who  developed the concept in a master's thesis at UCLA, will teach the Friday  morning class.  </P> <P> In Manhattan Beach, the Recreation Department is offering a clown workshop that  will teach juggling, pantomime, yo-yo tricks and face painting. The class  begins June 30.  </P> <P> In Hermosa Beach, children 9 to 14 can appear in a production of "The Wizard of  Oz" at the end of an eight-week theater workshop.  </P> <P> "The main goal is to teach them enough to come up with a production at the end  of the course," said instructor Linda Locke. "They do learn a lot, but they  learn by doing."  </P> <P> Pat Tierney, who will teach cartooning in Gardena, expects to see the faces of  Bart Simpson, Dick Tracy and the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles pop up this  summer in the Sunday morning class for children 8 to 13.  </P> <P> Those in a beginning cooking class at El Camino College will come home with  different sorts of creations. The catalogue promises "tantalizing recipes and  informative cooking tips."  </P> <P> At the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, a variety of one-day workshops and  weeklong camps that delve into the mysteries of the sea and the shore will be  offered for first-graders through high school students.  </P> <P> In one of the museum's one-day workshops -- "It's a Small World After All" --  students will use microscopes and video cameras for detailed study of miniature  marine life.  </P> <P> A weeklong camp called "Ichthyology and Other Slimy Words" will allow fifth-  and sixth-graders to study sharks and other fish, examine the museum's 36  aquariums and net sea specimens from Cabrillo Beach.  </P> <P> "They are both very popular programs that accomplish a great thing," said  museum spokeswoman Bee Powell. "They get students acquainted with the ocean  early in their lives -- and what better thing could you do for the  environment?"  </P> <P> Staff writers Gerald Faris, Shawn Hubler, Kim Kowsky, Greg Krikorian, Ian Rose,  Deborah Schoch, George Stein and Tim Waters contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A partial listing of summer youth activities available in South Bay  communities.  </P> <P> SUMMER IN THE SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> Carson  </P> <P> City Summer Program -- The city runs an extensive recreation program at its 12  parks; 830-7600.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A senior official in the U.S. Association of  Automobile Industries has said that at Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks, U.S. negotiators had asked their Japanese  counterparts to go along with a U.S. demand for setting a target  for selling 100,000 American-built cars three years later on the  Japanese market. Commenting on the U.S. official's remark at a  regular news conference on 27 January, Hideaki Kumano,  administrative vice minister of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry [MITI], said: "The Japanese Government cannot  commit itself to goods that Japanese consumers buy. The U.S.  demand cited by the official is out of the question and an  inconceivable concept."</p>

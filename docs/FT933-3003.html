			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Content of satellite channel queried THE European Commission is worried that a new satellite television channel, due to start broadcasting into the UK tomorrow, may be too American, Andrew Hill writes. The Commission has written to Mr Peter Brooke, the minister for national heritage, to find out whether TNT &amp; Cartoon Network will broadcast enough European programmes to meet EC requirements. TNT &amp; Cartoon Network belongs to Turner Broadcasting System, owner of the CNN news organisation, and begins transmission in the UK tomorrow. It will be devoted to classic cartoons, such as Bugs Bunny and The Flintstones, as well as Hollywood films.</p>

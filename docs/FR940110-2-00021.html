			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this methodology we succeed both in allocating an amount for SG&amp;A expense equal to that incurred by TCM, and in attributing a positive value for SG&amp;A expenses to all TCM's further processing operations,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , including cases of ``swap-downs'' of masts (substitutions of low-value masts for masts of higher value).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : TCM argues that, in the ESP program, for situations in which FMV is based on constructed value (CV), the Department neglected to deduct direct selling expenses from FMV. TCM argues that such an adjustment is in accordance with the Department's longstanding practice. TCM cites section 772(e) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.41(e); Tapered Roller Bearings from Japan (52 FR 30700, August 17, 1987); Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan (50 FR 45447, October 31, 1987); and Spun Acrylic Yarn from Italy (50 FR 35849, September 4, 1985).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners assert that the Department must first define the direct selling expenses variable before a COS adjustment can be made, noting that the variable was not defined in either the Department's January 29, 1992 ESP program or in a memorandum dated February 5, 1992. Petitioners claim that, if the direct selling expenses variable is not defined, neither the respondent nor petitioners will be able to verify that the correct COS adjustments were made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : We agree with TCM. We were satisfied with the respondent's reporting of direct and indirect selling expenses as submitted. Therefore, we have made a COS adjustment using the direct selling expenses variable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : TCM argues that the Department incorrectly accounted for credit income earned on U.S. sales in PP comparisons. According to TCM, the Department added credit income earned on U.S. sales to both USP and FMV, despite the fact that credit income is realized on U.S. sales only. Accordingly, TCM requests that the Department revise its calculations to eliminate the addition to FMV of credit income earned on U.S. sales for these final results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's Position <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : We agree with TCM and have eliminated the addition of credit income to FMV for these final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Petitioners argue that verification of TCM's cost data is necessary because this data has never been verified. Petitioners state that TCM's cost data was neither verified in the investigation, because the cost data was not accepted, nor in the first administrative review, due to the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War. Petitioners assert that good cause for verification still exists and is shown by petitioners' April 9, 1991 letter to the Department, which petitioners claim documents extensive discrepancies in TCM's unverified cost data. Accordingly, petitioners claim that the Department should conduct verification of TCM's cost information prior to issuing its final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCM replies that the Department is not required to conduct verification of TCM's COP data in this review. According to TCM, the Department is required to conduct verification in an administrative review only if an interested party files a timely request for verification and if the Department has not conducted a verification during the two immediately preceding reviews. TCM also notes that the Department is not required to verify all sections of a respondent's questionnaire response. In this context, TCM argues that the Department satisfied these requirements in the previous review by conducting verification of TCM's HM and U.S. sales, and further manufacturing expenses. Because the Department was able to verify TCM's information in the previous review, TCM argues that no further verification is necessary in this review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's Position <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : With respect to administrative reviews, the Department is required to verify information under section 776(b)(3) of the Tariff Act if the Secretary concludes that good cause for verification exists, or if a timely request for verification is received from an interested party and the Department has not conducted a verification during either of the two immediately preceding administrative reviews. The current administrative review is the second review of the antidumping order in this case. Thus, verification is not required under section 776(b)(3) of the Act. TCM's HM sales, U.S. sales and U.S. costs, including value-added cost data from TCM's related facilities in the United States, were verified in the previous administrative review. The Department determined that TCM's data reporting methodology was sound and reliable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because verification was not required and all other aspects of TCM's sales were successfully verified in the previous review, because our analysis of TCM's response did not indicate any significant discrepancies, and because petitioners did not make a compelling case that TCM's data was seriously flawed, we determined that presently there was no good cause to verify TCM's submitted cost data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Petitioners argue that for the final results, the Department should revise the method it used to adjust for commissions on TCM's sales. For PP transactions, petitioners submit that the commission offset rule directs the Department to reduce USP by the lesser of the HM commission or U.S. ISE when commissions are paid in one market and not in the other. Petitioners contend that TCM failed to report ISE for its PP sales and that the Department should accordingly deny the commissions claimed by TCM for its HM sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

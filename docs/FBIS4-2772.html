			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 9 (CNS) -- The Ministry of Labor  recently put forward proposals for the restructuring of the  labour system with the aim of setting up a basic framework in  five years for a new labour system in conformity with the  socialist market economy system.    The ministry has worked out a general proposal for labour  reform to cover employment, salary distribution, social  security, employment service and exploitation of vocational  techniques. A spokesman for the ministry revealed that the  reform of the labour system had entered a stage where  comprehensive restructuring was in place.    First, autonomy of employment enjoyed by enterprises  especially involving salary distribution had been further  carried out. The practice of two-way choice in which both an  employer and a job- seeker share equal opportunity to determine  the employment and labour contract have gone into effect.  Workers who have not yet been included in the labour contract  practice will also be under the contract system by means of its  implementation within a particular enterprise or in an entire  area. According to the system, employers, enterprises and  employees are entitled to the concluding, the cancelling and the  terminating of an employment contract.    Second, supplementary reform related to labour restructuring  has seen new development including formation of an initial  network of 17,000 employment service agencies across the  country. There are about eight million job-seekers successfully  entering employment each year through these agencies.    Third, a breakthrough has been made in setting key problems  including reform of the social insurance system. The ministry  recently put forward unification of social insurance which means  introduction of a unified insurance system for various  enterprises and workers no matter the ownership of the  enterprise and job position held by a particular worker.  Unified premium, treatment and use of the insurance funds are  involved in the social insurance reform. Layoffs are possible  with the approval of the trade union when a particular  enterprise is either on the verge of bankruptcy in which  rectification is conducted according to law or facing difficult  conditions in their running. The existence of different  employment systems namely the fixed one and the contractual one  will also see a breakthrough in settlement during this year.</p>

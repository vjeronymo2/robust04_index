			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WINE COUNTRY GIRDS FOR INVASION OF DESTRUCTIVE PEST  </P> <P> The wine bug phylloxera, which devastated the world's vineyards a century ago,  is back, and experts say California vintners may have to spend about $500  million during the next decade to thwart the pest.  </P> <P> "It's costly, but they will just have to bite the bullet," said Jeffrey  Grannett, an entomologist on the University of California's Phylloxera Task  Force.  </P> <P> "It's the type of thing that's going to be widely felt over many years."  </P> <P> Vintners in Sonoma and Napa counties, California's premium winegrowing areas,  are getting ready to replant vineyards with vines resistant to phylloxera  (pronounced fih-LOX-eh-rah), a burrowing plant louse.  </P> <P> Mike Fisher, a partner in Motto, Kryla &amp; Fisher, a wine industry accounting  firm, estimated that more than 13,000 acres of vineyard will be replanted in  the Napa Valley alone.  </P> <P> Replanting costs up to $15,000 an acre and means three to five years of lost  production while the new vines reach maturity.  </P> <P> There have been 90 sightings of the pest in the valley and 12 in Sonoma County,  Fisher wrote recently in the trade publication Wine Industry Update.  </P> <P> The winegrowing regions of France and California were ruined by phylloxera  between 1870 and 1900. Vineyard acreage dropped from 20,000 to 3,000 in the  fledgling industry in Napa County.  </P></p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: In search of tax-efficiency - Expatriates Are life policies a suitable investment for expatriates or are the benefits of their tax-efficiency exaggerated? 'Qualifying' maximum investment plans which have a minimum 10-year term and which provide minimal life cover - 75 per cent of the prospective premiums payable - are a common investment for expatriates. They are often chosen because of the perceived tax benefits after return to the UK since no personal tax is payable on the proceeds, whether received as a single payment or a series of payments over a number of years. Unfortunately, perhaps fewer than one in 10 of the expatriates who invest in this way will achieve any significant tax benefits. Broadly, UK life companies pay tax on the income and gains of their life funds at 25 per cent, which is the same as the basic rate of tax paid by individuals. Investing in an offshore policy will not indefinitely avoid the payment of this tax because you must convert to an equivalent UK policy within one year of becoming a UK resident to maintain its qualifying status. Consequently, you will achieve no benefit at all if your marginal rate of UK tax is the basic rate when you receive your 'tax free' payments. Of course, if you are a higher rate payer, the situation is different, for you will have paid just 25 per cent via the life company against the 40 per cent that you would have paid as an individual. However, few returning expatriates these days pay higher rate tax. Bear in mind that if spouses can divide income equally between them, they would jointly need more than Pounds 56,000 a year (that is, more than Pounds 1m invested at an average rate of 5 per cent) to fall into the higher rate band. Unfortunately the situation is not neutral. You will probably have incurred a cost to achieve these, perhaps, illusory tax benefits. Investment performance may be inhibited by the limitation of your investment choice. Even if this consists of a 'menu' of 100 or more funds, that will mean that there are perhaps 25 times as many which are not available to you. Furthermore, you may be locked into the arrangement, since early termination is likely to produce a bad financial deal and you might suffer surrender penalties into the bargain. The majority of expatriates would be better off investing through non-contractual savings schemes, for example, a unit or investment trust, which allow them to increase, reduce, stop and restart contributions at will. However, the qualifying policy is not the only, or even the most important, life product offered to expatriates. Many are offered offshore single premium bonds which are designed to receive lump sums. The single premium bond appears in many guises, sometimes as a funding plan for Maximum Investment Plans, sometimes as a managed investment and sometimes as a pension plan. In all cases, the basic arrangement is the same. Once you have resumed UK residence, tax liability arises under the 'chargeable events' legislation. This allows you to withdraw 5 per cent per annum of the sum originally invested (the premium allowance) without provoking an immediate tax liability. A possible exception to this is the type of bond into which you can transfer any investments rather than, as is usually the case, being restricted to a set menu of funds. There is a pending High Court Appeal which will determine whether or not the premium allowance is available in this case. You will, however, provoke an immediate tax liability if you exceed the premium allowance and also if the bond is encashed. In the latter case, the previous 5 per cent draw-downs have to be taken into account to calculate the profit, which is chargeable at your marginal rate of income tax, subject to certain reliefs. The fact that single premium bond holders need pay no tax provided their draw-downs do not exceed 5 per cent a year, allows for long-term tax deferment. It is to your advantage if you can reinvest 100 per cent rather than just 60 per cent of your surplus income, even if you have to pay tax on all of it eventually. Unfortunately, calculations to quantify this benefit frequently fail to take account of the investor wishing to withdraw funds before they die. Should they do so, they are likely to trigger the pent-up tax charge and - in the early years of the bond - perhaps termination penalties. Since it is necessary to remunerate the insurance company, the underlying unit trust (perhaps) and the intermediary too, there is a tendency for the costs of life products to be both greater and more opaque than for other investments. Perhaps such a structure can generate meaningful advantages for you but that is not necessarily so. The structure of a life policy does not in itself present an inherent investment advantage although its tax advantages were often incontestable when top rates of income tax in the UK reached 97 per cent. Even a mediocre performance from a life policy could leave you better off net of tax than a well performing direct investment. However, now that such rates are a memory, life products are probably over-sold, particularly since today's financially sophisticated expatriates have access to a much greater range of investment choices than before.

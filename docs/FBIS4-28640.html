			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 12 June that, in connection with  aggravated tensions on the Korean peninsula over the North  Korean nuclear issue, the Defense Ministry is now conducting  on-the-spot inspections of the state of reserve munitions --  such as weapons, ammunition, oil, and food needed for a war --  and the supporting system in the Army, Navy, and Air Force.    The Defense Ministry has inspected the munitions supply  system by regularly examining related papers so far, however, it  is exceptionally conducting actual inspections on it because of  the seriousness in the situation on the Korean peninsula.    Inspection teams dispatched by the ministry to major  munitions bases throughout the country are now conducting a  comprehensive inspection of the munitions supply system by  surveying the thickness of protection walls of warehouses of  explosive materials, such as ammunition and oil, and the state  of secured defensive facilities and supply lines.    The Defense Ministry will complete the inspection before the  end of June and will take supplementary measures after finding  out problems in coping with North Korea's possible intensive  artillery firing, air raids, and special troop infiltration in a  war.    The ministry will reflect the supplementary measures in the  operations training for protecting munitions supply facilities  during the planned Ulchi-Focus Lens exercise in August.    A Defense Ministry official said on 12 June: "It is expected  that, if an all-out war takes place on the Korean peninsula,  both South and North Korea will strike a serious blow to each  other in an early stage by mobilizing all their firepower.  Accordingly, it is necessary for sufficient munitions to be  supplied." He also said: "According to the result of the  inspection conducted so far, we have secured enough major  munitions -- weapons, ammunition, oil, and food -- to carry out  a war until we have support from outside."    Our country is supposed to have major munitions support,  including weapons and ammunition, from the United States and  other countries in case of war. It is anticipated that it will  take at least 45 days for a transport ship carrying military  supplies from the United States to the ROK. It is learned that  the ROK keeps reserve war materiel to stand for at least three  months.  (endall) 13 Jun mp/Austin/KMP26136.02/KA611306.07/kw 13/0321z Jun  BT  #2443  NNNN</p>

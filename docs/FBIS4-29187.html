			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Foreign-made semiconductor  chips captured more than 20 percent of the Japanese market in  the January-March period, according to both Japanese and U.S.  calculations, the Trade Ministry said Tuesday [14 June].    The foreign share for the reporting quarter came to 22.0  percent under a Japanese formula, a marginal drop from 22.1  percent in the fourth quarter of 1993, while the same share  under a U.S. method stood unchanged at 20.7 percent.    The foreign chip share for the year's first quarter remained  nearly identical to that in the preceding quarter, a clear  contrast from the downtrend seen in the first quarter of past  years, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) said. A 1991 bilateral chip trade accord calls  for Japan to maintain a "gradual and steady" increase in the  foreign share above the 20 percent level.    Both domestic chip consumption and foreign chip sales in  Japan declined in the January-March period from the preceding  quarter in terms of value. However, the pace of the fall for  both figures, which are not available according to mutual  agreement, was smaller in the latest quarter than in previous  years, the official said. "The latest statistics signal that the  penetration of foreign chips in the Japanese market has been on  the rise," the MITI official said.    Tori Sato, incoming chairman of the Electronic Industries  Association of Japan's Users' Committee of Foreign  Semiconductors, said in a statement that "the fact that the  foreign share remained close to the level attained in the fourth  quarter of 1993 indicated that both sides continue to make  progress in promoting access to the Japanese semiconductor  market." "We encourage foreign products to continue to work  with us in promoting greater cooperation between industries, so  that everyone will be able to prosper in the Japanese market,"  said Sato, also executive vice president of Hitachi Ltd.    In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said  in a statement, "the U.S. is pleased to see a market share of  over 20 percent has been maintained for two quarters in a row."  "The latest reading is extremely important for the fate of the  ongoing Japan-U.S. trade framework talks," he said.    The 1991 chip accord incorporates two different methods for  calculating the foreign share in Japan. The U.S. counts only on  the sales of foreign chips in the open market. The Japanese  formula allows a broader measurement that includes so-called  "captive" sales of U.S. companies to their Japanese subsidiaries  and those by Japanese companies under foreign brand names.    Based on the latest calculation, Japan and the U.S. will  hold  chip trade talks in Tokyo on Wednesday and Thursday. The  meeting will focus on reviewing implementation of steps agreed  on during the Hawaii talks in March this year, including the  "design-in" cooperation program for making semiconductors from  the development stage, the MITI official said.</p>

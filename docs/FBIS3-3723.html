			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Reporters Wang Cunli (3769 1317 3810) and Hua Weilie 5478 </F> 5898 0441]    [Text] Yinchuan, 13 Feb (XINHUA) -- With the opening of  ports in border areas, foreign businessmen were busy choosing  sites for investment and establishment of plants; areas of  cooperation in the cotton planting region, jointly invested in  and managed by some ten provinces and municipalities, continued  to expand; wagons and wagon- loads of industrial raw materials  were transported from mine pits to East China in order to  fulfill cooperation agreements; two-way exchanges of cadres was  conducted; trade fairs attracted both domestic and foreign  investors...... [ellipsis as published]. Five provinces and  autonomous regions from China's northwest region flung their  doors open to the outside world on an unprecedented scale. They  gave full play to their advantage of abundant natural resources;  comprehensively developed economic and technological cooperation  with other provinces and autonomous regions; introduced  investment from abroad and established economic relations with  other regions; learned from the experience of other regions for  their own development; made use of other regions' superiority to  make up for its own deficiency; and promoted the development of  the local economy.    The northwest regions of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia,  and Shaanxi are endowed with rich natural resources and have  long supplied a large amount of the resources and raw material  for the national economic construction. However, due to a weak  economic foundation, they were not effective at  self-development. With the deepening of reform of China's  economic system, and with the gradual lifting of prices of  resources and raw materials, these provinces and autonomous  regions--which in the past have relied on state subsidies and  mandatory production plans--have been forced one after another  to enter market competition. As a result, people in those  regions began to change their concepts and sought to open a new  path for development through extensive economic and  technological cooperation with other regions.    Advancing to the east and expanding to the west, reaching  out  to the north and descending to the south, introducing investment  from abroad and establishing economic ties with other regions in  China, and adopting an omni-directional opening up policy have  all become the common understanding of these provinces and  autonomous regions in developing the economy. So far they have  joined some ten regional cooperation organizations including the  Huanghe Economic and Technological Cooperation Zone, the  Northwest Economic and Technological Cooperation Zone, and the  Shaanxi-Gansu-Sichuan Economic Cooperation Zone. Last year  alone they concluded agreements with other regions on some  10,000 cooperation projects and on exchanges of goods worth over  two billion yuan. What is gratifying is that economic and  technological cooperation is not limited to project cooperation  and to exchange of commodities alone; they now involve joint  development. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region cooperated with  other regions to develop a cotton growing base; Gansu Province  jointly developed rare metal resources with other regions; and  Ningxia prepared to cooperate with other provinces to build a  power supply project. Funds from five provinces, autonomous  regions, and other regions for China's Huanghe Economic  Cooperation Zone Joint Stock Limited Company have initially been  put in place as scheduled. The operation of this company will  effectively help coordinate economic exchanges between various  provinces and regions as well as promote their development  through cooperation.    The five provinces and autonomous regions have changed their  passive stance and have begun to aggressively look for business  partners. Xinjiang concluded agreements of 2.1 billion and 1.7  billion yuan respectively from its holding of the "Spark Trade  Fair" and "Urumqi Trade Fair" in 1992. Last May, 2,044  contracts, agreements, and letters of intent worth 1.7 billion  yuan were signed at Shaanxi's Third Technological Results Fair.  At the same time, the five provinces and autonomous regions  have increased economic cooperation with coastal regions.  Qinghai Province entered into an economic cooperative  relationship with Shandong Province. They signed 51 projects on  introduction of funds, technological cooperation, and personnel  exchange, as well as 32 agreements on expanding friendly ties  during exchanges of leadership last year. They also carried out  1,700 personnel exchanges, with over 500 of these involving  cadres at or above county level and at or above department head  level. Qingdao Chemical Industry Institute has annually helped  train 50 specialized chemical industry personnel for Qinghai's  Haibei Prefecture during each of the last five years. Shaanxi,  Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Gansu have also exchanged cadres and work  experience with economically developed coastal regions. They  have broadened their economic vision and increased economic  cooperation projects through such kind of exchanges.</p>

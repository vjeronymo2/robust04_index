			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by M. Paydar: "Tehran, Beijing, New Delhi: ASEAN </F> Plus the ECO"]    [Excerpts] Early last week, only a few hours after the  visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Tehran, Indian  External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh arrived in Tehran. Singh  stated that the objective of this visit was to continue and  expand the warm and cordial talks between India and Iran.  [passage omitted]    Both India and Iran are large regional countries with a  special role in Asian security, both because of the vastness of  their territories, their command of maritime areas, their  erudite work force, their history and culture, and above all,  the fact that they belong to the Third World. [passage omitted]    The only weak point is India's differences with Pakistan,  which has become a problem as far as stability in the Indian  Ocean is concerned. At any rate, there is no doubt that if  Islamabad is excluded from security dealings, the logic behind  any regional political-security forecast or planning will  collapse. For various reasons stemming from its understanding  on its own national interests, Iran naturally wants some  breathing space for its foreign policy. By nature, the Islamic  Republic of Iran cannot limit itself to a small political,  economic, and security sphere. Therefore, it has always tried  to expand its strategic horizons in relationship to its  position. It is natural that the Indian subcontinent,  stretching as far as China's borders, is of special importance  in this sphere of interest. Logically, in the effort to develop  this area, it is practically impossible for Iran to ignore or  exclude Pakistan. Of course, this part of the process may be  delayed but it cannot be ignored. Therefore, any solution that  ends the Indian-Pakistani dispute is not only to Iran's benefit  but will also open up the last remaining door to cooperation  among the south-central Asian countries and the Indian  subcontinent, stretching from South Asia to east Asia. In other  words, it would make possible the final steps for uniting the  ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] and ASEAN [Association  of South East Asian Nations]. In this regard, ASEAN's Permanent  Secretary General Singh, who is in Bangkok for a meeting of the  organization's top officials, has stated that he will pay a  visit to Tehran soon. Pointing out that this visit is very  important, Singh stated that the ECO is extremely interested in  expanding its relations with ASEAN.    But will the expansion of Iran's relations with some  regional  countries be contingent on the internal relations in ECO? No  definite answer can be given to this question yet; the answer  depends on to what extent ECO will allow its members--namely  Iran--a free hand in regional cooperation. Naturally if the ECO  acts as a cartel like OPEC, members will face limitations, not  only vis-a-vis India but also other countries and other  economic-political alliances. Political and economic observers  believe that if the ECO acts like a regional cartel, it will  fail because none of the ECO members currently is economically  competitive, with all its members facing economic problems.    Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the six Central  Asian republics that were recently admitted to ECO all face  extensive economic problems. Even in the most optimistic view,  this alliance will only benefit the member countries themselves,  and to an extremely limited extent. Therefore, it has no  benefits for the Asian continent as a whole. Also, the increase  the ECO membership poses a problem because it is not clear what  benefits countries like Afghanistan and Tajikistan bring to it  apart from absorbing the organization's limited capital, which  mostly comes from Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan.    ECO's counterpart ASEAN consists of countries located in  south and southeast Asia; and despite the fact that it is a  regional body, it has also become an active and successful  political and economic group of worldwide significance, and it  also welcomes new members.    It is natural for ASEAN to want to expand its influence and  for the ECO to seek an effective atmosphere in which to operate.  But can these two alliances absorb each other?    Fortunately both sides have reasons enough to give a  positive  answer to this question. During the recent visit by Chinese  Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Iran as well as  the visit by Indian External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh, the  topic of cooperation between the ECO and ASEAN was seriously  discussed. Qian Qichen said that ECO-ASEAN cooperation and even  the formation of a new organization from the two is important,  adding that he had discussed the topic with Iranian officials.  India too welcomes the formation of a new organization in the  region because this would free it from unilateral dealings with  each and every ECO member, notably with Pakistan.    It now appears that the formation of a new alliance in the  region is an extremely necessary and inevitable fact and that  the coming visit by the ASEAN secretary general to Tehran will  be a very good opportunity for serious preliminary consultations  on this topic.    Apart from according Iran, India, and China outstanding  roles  in Asia, a new alliance would also endorse the Islamic  Republic's supremacy over a large part of Asia--from Asia Minor  to western China. And as stated by a Chinese diplomat of the  region:    "The formation of a new alliance in Asia would, first and  foremost, divide the region among three immense political and  economic poles. Iran and China would be the poles on either  side, with India in the middle linking the other two.    "The first pole's scope would include Turkey, Afghanistan,  and the newly-independent countries; and Iran will have full  supremacy over this pole because of the vastness of its area,  its seacoast, its air and land routes, its immense and  relatively skilled manpower, its membership in OPEC and access  to financial resources, its political stability, the general  inclination of its economy toward capitalism, its membership in  the Nonaligned Movement, and its fully independent policy."    Asked why Turkey would not assume such supremacy, the  diplomat answered:    "It is clear that Turkey lacks all these factors. Also, the  absence of political stability at home and its dependence on  NATO are problems that cannot be ignored. This is extremely  important to Iran, China, and India. Therefore, the western  sector extending to the central area of this alliance will be,  or should be, in the hands of Iran.    "Similarly, India can organize the middle section of the  alliance because of its technical and economic potentials, its  vast area, its supremacy over the Indian Ocean, the general  inclination of world capitalism to invest in India, very cheap  labor, and an annual economic growth rate above 8.5 percent,  ranking second only to China. So it can be a bridge between Iran  and China in this alliance. And, who knows, maybe this alliance  can play a part in ending the differences between India and  Pakistan, in which case Iran will gain another trump card."    This Chinese diplomat added: "The eastern front is also very  important. Actually, the balance between the central and the  western fronts is in China's hands. Because of its high  economic growth rate of more than 11 percent, its high technical  and agricultural levels and because of its generally favorable  economy, it is impossible for ASEAN to make any decisions  without taking China into consideration. Also, the regional  economy is greatly affected by China's economy. In 1997, when  Hong Kong is returned to China, this influence will increase.  Therefore, China will seek ways to expand its economic  influence."    Some political experts fully agree with the views of this  Chinese diplomat and say that regardless of the reason, the  formation of such an alliance at a time when countries are  showing preference for political, economic, and security  groupings and alliances rather than going it alone and at a time  when the meaning of national development is synonymous with  regional development, membership in supra-regional alliances  appears to be imperative. And forming and belonging to regional  and supra-regional alliances is now considered an important  factor in international relations and stances.    A general glance at the all aspects of Iran's domestic and  foreign policies shows an inclination toward such a polarization  in this region. Both the Chinese and the Indians have much  experience in workings and the uses of big alliances.  Therefore, Iran should prepare its diplomatic machinery to  participate in such an organization. The ECO is approaching the  end of its traditional role, and because of world economic  reality it will have to play a new role within a new entity; and  the winner will be the one that adapts the best.</p>

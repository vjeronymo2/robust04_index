A contingent of 225 Ghanaian troops, part of the  800-strong Ghanaian battalion, landed in Kigali yesterday. Its  main task is to maintain security in the whole demilitarized  area.    The other groups making up the Ghanaian battalion are  expected before the end of the month. The commander of the  Ghanaian contingent, Brigadier General Andoh, who has been in  Rwanda for the past month, is also the second in command of the  UNAMIR headquarters. With the arrival of new observers over the  next few days, the number of UN mission troops will increase to  2,600 troops and observers.</p>

[Begin recording] [Reporter Julia Mirabal] In the first  place, as regards financial matters, Mr.(Max Vincent),  cochairman of the delegation, says:    [(Vincent), in French] ...and, (?as I said), the French  Government is to sign, no doubt within the next (?month), an  agreement to guarantee investments. Consequently, regarding  investments, theoretically there should be no problems; and the  heads of companies are currently working on the matter of  exchanges.    [Mirabal] There are also other results.    [(Vincent), in French] ...(?create), on the basis of this  first contact, is, on the one hand, to (?have) the heads of  companies (?attend) the fair to be held in Santiago de Cuba and,  based on that exchange, set up a network of relations that will  permit us to create, on the basis of that undertaking, the need  and the desire to come work in Cuba.    [Mirabal] One of the steps toward contributing to Cuba's  communication with that part of the Caribbean is the  establishment of weekly flights; heretofore, they have been  sporadic.    [(Vincent), in French] Why? Because the potential for  Guadeloupe companies, on the level of both tourism and trade, is  very great.    [Mirabal] At the end of this brief dialogue, I asked Mr.  (Vincent) a question to which he responded in Spanish.    [(Vincent)] We feel that all the Caribbean Basin countries  are brothers, like the fingers of a single hand, and that they  should work together for the well-being of their peoples.    [Mirabal] This has been Julia Mirabal reporting on the  Cuba-Guadeloupe meeting. [end recording]</p>

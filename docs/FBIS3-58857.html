			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Francois Mitterrand by Svetoslav </F> Terziev; place and date not given: "Bulgaria Advanced in  Transition Toward Democracy"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Terzivev] Who could  guarantee Bulgaria's security after the disappearance of the  communist military system? Could it remain a neutral state or  should it join the Western structures, such as NATO and the  Western European Union [WEU]?    [Mitterrand] I fully understand Bulgaria's concern regarding  the situation we call the "security vacuum" in Central and East  Europe. There are several ways to cope with this situation.  The sense of insecurity, which is based on military  considerations, springs from various other forms of instability  that are related to the country's economic, social, and even  ethnic situation. Therefore, France has proposed initiatives of  preventive diplomacy that aim to prevent or decrease tension.  This is the essence of the French idea on the pact of  stability, which was adopted by the European Union. The other  possibilities lie in strengthening bilateral cooperation, which  we subscribe to. The third possibility is in working to bring  the countries of Central and East Europe closer together, on the  one hand, and the European security organizations and  associations, on the other. In this context, France advocates  opening up those structures to the aforementioned countries.  France proposed a formula for the association within the WEU of  the countries that have already been associated or are in the  process of associating with the European Union.    In addition, it is well known that the last NATO summit  adopted the Partnership for Peace initiative. As I said in  Brussels, this concept allows us to respond to the concern of  states that want to associate with NATO and also avoid Russia's  negative reaction -- which a new division of Europe would have  caused, something that would have been detrimental to European  security. For me, Partnership for Peace means that no threat  could be directed against the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of any partner state without affecting the other  partner states.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime  minister, has described the report issued by the UN secretary  general -- without waiting for the results and despite all the  efforts exerted by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  [TRNC] to reduce the conflicts to a minimum -- as unjust.    In a written statement, Karayalcin drew attention to the  fact  that the report was issued when the TRNC informed the United  Nations of its positive views, some of which involved certain  sacrifices. Stressing that the accusations leveled at the  Turkish Cypriot side regarding its lack of political will,  despite its constructive and positive approach, cannot be  received with understanding, Karayalcin added: No doubt  peaceful results cannot be achieved in Cyprus through an  approach that supports the views of one side and pressures the  other to accept the same views. The UN secretary general should  not expect this approach to be tolerated. Karayalcin added that  it should be known that one can reach a realistic and viable  solution in Cyprus only through the free will of the two sides  and through negotiations.</p>

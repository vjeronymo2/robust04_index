			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Motoyasu Matsumoto, New York] </F>   [Text] The Honda Canadian plant located in Alliston,  Ontario Province, reached a milestone in its localization  strategy. It began exporting small "Civic" sedans to Brazil and  Taiwan. In the past, all passenger cars produced at that plant  were sold in the United States and Canada. The move by Honda has  served as a significant incentive to the 1,600 employees of the  plant in that "the quality of Canadian-built Civics will be  tested in overseas markets for the first time."    The Canadian plant is located in a rural area about 90  minutes north of Toronto. Toyota and Suzuki also have production  plants in Canada, but, in the fall of 1986, Honda was the first  Japanese automaker to locate in Canada. Honda will also lead the  other Japanese makers in exporting to points other than the  United States.    At the beginning of this year an influential Canadian  newspaper published an article saying, "It appears Honda may be  withdrawing from the Canadian market." The article was based on  the implementation of NAFTA in January 1994. NAFTA provided for  the integration of the Canadian, U.S., and Mexican markets. If  production of small cars were centralized in Mexico, where labor  is cheap, and sold throughout North America, Honda could enhance  its profitability by improving its price competitiveness.  Speculation began to circulate in Canadian industry that "Honda  was going to open plants in Mexico, but close plants in Canada."    "The idea of closing our plant is absolutely incorrect,"  says  plant manager Shinichi Kawai as he laughs off the speculation.  The initiation of exports to Brazil and Taiwan is a response to  such rumors. Honda has established a clear-cut posture of  contributing to the local economy by using the Canadian plant to  produce exports. The formal announcement of the Mexican plant  early this month served to dispel speculation and calm rumors  about the closing of the Canadian plant.    Currently, the Canadian plant produces a combined total of  100,000 Civics a year in the three-door hatchback and two-door  coupe versions. The plant operates at one-half of what is  considered to be a break-even point of 200,000 units a year. A  tour of the plant reveals that it has only one pressing machine  line and gives one the impression that it is a compact  operation. That operating level was the basis for inspiring talk  of a shutdown.    However, Mr. Kawai makes the unusual revelation that  "accumulated losses were worked off in mid-1993." The reason why  the plant was able to produce a profit is that it is  operationally integrated with Honda's Ohio plants, which have an  annual capacity of 500,000 units.    As an example, of the two side panels for the two-door Civic  coupe, the Canadian plant produces the right panel, while the  left panel is made in the United States and the two plants  interchange those two parts. This approach is used to avoid the  duplication of metal molds between the two plants.    The Canadian plant is not staffed with a purchasing  department for parts and materials. Indirect costs were reduced  by placing responsibility at the U.S. plant for quality  assurance and price negotiations for parts. Mr. Kawai says, "The  U.S. plants operate three assembly lines and we operate the  Canadian plant as if it were the fourth assembly line."    Recently, additional efforts have been exerted towards  increasing the locally procured parts and material content of  Honda vehicles. The cars currently produced at the Canadian  plant carry North American parts in excess of the 50 percent  prescribed by NAFTA. Retention of NAFTA benefits will require  that that percentage be increased to 62.5 percent by the year  2000. However, Mr. Kawai has indicated a higher target, saying,  "Our goal is 67.5 percent."    The Canadian plant has been affected by a U.S. Government  proposal dating back to 1992 for a tariff surcharge. The U.S.  Customs Bureau charged that Canadian-made Hondas did not contain  locally procured parts and materials at the 50-percent level  required for duty-free export to the United States and had asked  Honda to make a huge payment in the form of a tariff surcharge.  Honda reacted strongly, saying, "The action was politically  motivated," and won recognition of its position at the very end,  but it also was made keenly aware of the fact that the local  content percentage could change significantly based on political  trends. Honda's goal set at 5 percent above the official goal is  inspired by the desire to avoid future friction.    However, no matter how much Honda raises its local content  goal and no matter how much it expands exports to areas other  than North America, any deterioration in the performance of the  U.S. Big Three automakers could lead to friction.  Notwithstanding, Honda has no choice but to advance its  localization efforts. Ford Motor, which entered the European  market, dedicated itself to the effort for over 60 years before  it won recognition as a member of local industry. It has been  only seven years since Honda opened its plant in Canada. It  still has much work ahead in its localization efforts.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Scheme submitted for Pounds 4.5bn airport A private-sector consortium has submitted plans to build a Pounds 4.5bn airport in the Vale of the White Horse area of Oxfordshire near Abingdon. Provisionally called Lox, the airport would have two runways, be privately financed and owned, and operated by airlines. It is thought it could be open by 2007. The plan faces fierce opposition as it would be on a greenfield site and would affect more than 3,000 houses. The consortium includes Ove Arup, the engineering company, and Pleiade Associates, the Bristol-based architects, designers and planning consultants. The application would in the first instance be considered by Oxford county council, with the Department of the Environment having the final say.</p>

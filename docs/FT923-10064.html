			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: Westpac sees ADollars 300m provision for bad debts WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the Australian bank, made a cautious prediction for the next 18 months in a prospectus issued yesterday for its ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 890m) fund-raising operation. It predicted it would make specific provisions for doubtful debts of less than ADollars 300m for the six months to September. The bank shook investors in May with provisions of ADollars 2.65bn for the March half, mainly reflecting plummeting real estate values, causing a loss of ADollars 1.67bn. The share issue, announced at the time, is needed to maintain capital adequacy ratios above central bank requirements. Westpac, which is raising the money through a three-for-10 issue of shares at ADollars 3 each, warned that Australia's severe economic recession would continue to affect financial results. Mr Frank Conroy, Westpac managing director, said yesterday the main task now was to pursue an asset disposal programme. He indicated that around ADollars 500m worth of mainly property assets had been sold since March 31. He added that he believed the bank had made adequate provisions, especially compared with its peers, but economic uncertainties precluded any specific profit forecasts. The prospectus contained a report from KPMG Peat Marwick, as independent consulting accountants, broadly confirmed the bank's balance sheet valuations and forecasts. But the accountants made clear they had not conducted an audit of Westpac, but rather examined previously audited information. The prospectus confirmed Westpac expects to pay a 12 cents final dividend.</p>

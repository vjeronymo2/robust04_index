			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Road deals worth Pounds 1bn announced Work is due to start on 22 new motorway and trunk-road contracts worth more than Pounds 1bn in 1994-95, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced yesterday, Charles Batchelor writes. The British Road Federation, which represents companies using roads, said this was fewer than half the number of schemes that the government had planned to carry out. It said that before cuts in the roads budget the Department of Transport had hoped to start 47 schemes worth Pounds 1.71bn. The government has drawn up a reserve list of seven projects which could start if any of the 22 projects is delayed. More than 50 construction contracts are already under way and more than Pounds 500m will be spent on maintenance next year. Estimated spending on new building will be about Pounds 1.3bn in 1994-95. Among new contracts planned for next year are bypasses of Derby, Bedford, Widnes and Newbury. Sections of the M1, M5, M25 and M40 motorways will be widened.</p>

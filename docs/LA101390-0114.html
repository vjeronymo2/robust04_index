			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. AD AGENCY TURNS ITS EYES TOWARD SPAIN;  </P> <P> CABLE: D'ARCY MASIUS BENTON &amp; BOWLES WILL SHAPE ADS TO PERSUADE CABLE  VIEWERS TO BUY "PAY-PER-VIEW" COVERAGE OF 1992 SUMMER OLYMPICS.  </P> <P> A big chunk of the 1992 Summer Olympics' "Pay-Per-View" ad campaign was handed  on Friday to the Los Angeles agency D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles.  </P> <P> Executives at the agency declined to reveal the size of the deal, but industry  sources estimate it to be more than $10 million.  </P> <P> Now, DMB&amp;B, which already places ads for Burbank-based NBC Television,  suddenly has its eyes on Barcelona. That's where clients NBC and Cablevision  will oversee round-the-clock Olympic coverage on three cable channels.  </P> <P> Although NBC's coverage of the major Olympic events will be free, subscribers  will pay a yet-to-be-determined fee to view extended coverage on cable  channels.  </P> <P> Besides DMB&amp;B, three other ad agencies and two direct-marketing companies  will also be involved in the campaign. But DMB&amp;B, which will shape the ad  strategy and place the ads on TV and radio as well as in magazines and  newspapers, is the only Los Angeles agency involved.  </P> <P> The ads will begin to appear in October, 1991, said James D. Helin, managing  director of the agency's Los Angeles office. Some ads will be geared toward  persuading consumers to buy pay-per-view as holiday gifts. About 25 million  homes are expected to have cable TV by 1992. Other ads will try to persuade  owners of bars and restaurants to purchase the package.  </P></p>

The four members of the Korean consortium are Yukong Ltd.,  Dongbu Industry Co., Hyosung Corp. and the Korea Mining  Promotion Corp., and they own 33.3 percent of the international  consortium in equal shares.    The mine is 15 kilometers from a railway line, has an  estimated 770 million tons of soft coal and covers an area of  475 square km.    It is the largest soft coal mine in the world in which  Korean  mining companies have a stake.    The Ministry predicted that the mine will produce between 4  million and 5 million tons of coal a year.    The Queensland government drilled 105 holes and finished  exploration at a depth of 18,810 meters. The international  consortium will drill 200 holes in three to four years.    The coal is suited for power generation and steel  production.</p>

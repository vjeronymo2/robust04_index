			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Riyadh, 15 Mar (SPA) -- A responsible source  made the following statement to SPA today:    Many people were amazed by and even condemned the statement  by Iranian religious leader 'Ali Khamene'i in his sermon of the  blessed 'Id al-Fitr, in which he alleged that the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia was creating difficulties for the Iranian pilgrims.  Everybody knows that the 17th meeting of the foreign ministers  of the Islamic states, held in Amman in the Hashemite Kingdom of  Jordan from 3 to 7 Sha'ban 1408 AH, corresponding to 21-25 March  1988, issued a resolution in which the numbers of pilgrims were  fixed on the basis of the ratio of people from every state to  the number of Muslims in the world. Thus, the number of Iranian  pilgrims was fixed according to the text of the above-mentioned  resolution, which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia abides by, as well  as all the Islamic states that signed the resolution in the  interest of all Muslims.    If some people make allegations which are not objective, out  of a personal motive in order to achieve purely local aims, then  it is up to the Iranian people to assess and be aware of that.    The source added:    It is a blessing from God Almighty on the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia and its king, government, and people that we are honored  to serve the Two Holy Places and look after the comfort and  safety of pilgrims, so they are able to perform the rites of  pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage and visit with all ease. In  order to achieve this noble aim and to allow capacity to go hand  in hand permanently with the continuous increase in the number  of pilgrims wishing to perform pilgrimage, it is necessary to  lay down continuous programs for extending the Two Holy Places  and provide additional space in the pilgrimage areas. Despite  this, and because of the limitation in time and space, the  capacity of accommodation requires that one stick to rules in  order to give the opportunity to all Muslims from the East and  West of the world according to just quotas, and we hope that  everybody cooperates with us in the interest of all. [passage  omitted]    Regarding Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i, who said "the  Muslim  Iranian people should be given priority over the other peoples  in performing this duty" i.e. the pilgrimage duty, the source  stated all Muslims are equal before God and that there is no  difference between an Arab and a non-Arab, or between a white  and a black other than in piety. God Almighty said "The most  honored of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most  righteous of you." [Koranic verse].    The source said in his statement that shouldering the  responsibility before God and the guests of His house [holy  shrine of Ka'bah], and consequently before our conscience, was a  matter which we were keen to preserve and endeavor to perform  with all our strength "and we shall not pay attention to the low  statements made by some or the fabricated media campaigns aimed  at causing provocation, confusion, and sowing the seeds of  sedition among the Muslims."    The source further said:    We are extremely astonished at the contradiction there is in  the way the Iranian leaders are talking to us. While President  'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the Islamic Republic  of Iran, continues to send his letters and his messengers to us  with a view to improving relations and bringing closer  viewpoints between the two countries, the spiritual leader 'Ali  Khamene'i surprises us with improper and irresponsible  statements followed by a frenzied media campaign. Which of the  two teams should we rely on and which of the two men should we  deal with?    However, we reject and condemn the style used by the Iranian  media and we also reject the statements made by Mohammad  Mohammadi Reyshahri [representative of Khamene'i and supervisor  of Iranian pilgrims] and quoted by the French news agency. We  warn against the continued use of such a style which does not  serve Islamic interests and does not achieve any good objective  in this respect.</p>

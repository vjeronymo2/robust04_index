			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices in Australian terms are holding firm, with better styles tending firmer and crossbreds particularly in good demand. However, weakness in the US dollar is inevitably reflected in Australian exchange rates, and from time to time recently Australian economic problems have tended to underline this factor. Overseas buyers consequently find wool a little cheaper to buy. The strength in sterling has led to more definite price reductions in the UK. Business is at present quiet but activity in early processing remains very good and signs of recovery from recession are cautiously indicated elsewhere.</p>

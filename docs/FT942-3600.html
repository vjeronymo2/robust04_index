			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Clearing the way for capital - A look at a model law to provide the basis for workable secured lending regimes in eastern Europe At the first annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Budapest in April 1992, Mr Andre Newburg, the bank's general counsel, raised a problem which was troubling international banks involved in financings in central and eastern Europe - how to take effective security over assets. A legal framework for secured transactions is essential to creating an investor friendly climate so vital to the emerging and transitional market economies of central and eastern Europe. The absence of workable laws on secured transactions restricts the availability of finance. Lenders will often only make funds available if payment is guaranteed by assets of the borrower. But most former communist states either do not have any rules on secured transactions or have to rely on rules dating from pre-communist regimes of the 1930s. The EBRD decided it had to take a lead. Under a former Linklaters &amp; Paines partner, Mr John Simpson, and a German lawyer, Jan-Hendrik Rover, it set up a Secured Transactions Project to draft a model law which could be used by these countries to shape a legal framework for secured lending. The brief was to produce something which could interface with the current legal systems of these countries. Since most of these countries' legal systems have civil law origins, it was not possible simply to lift laws on secured lending from common law jurisdictions such as England and America. But, says Mr Simpson, the common law systems seemed to offer the best features. 'We had to produce quickly something sufficiently simple to be of practical use which bridged the gap between common and civil law systems, but was not heavily influenced by any one system and which could be adapted to their own law. Not so much a model as a template,' he says. They were helped by an advisory board of 20 lawyers from 15 jurisdictions, five of them drawn from the former communist countries. By the Bank's third annual meeting in St Petersburg in April this year the model was ready. The model law is based on the idea of a single security right (a 'charge') in respect of all types of things and rights. The distinction between various traditional types of security rights - such as pledges of moveables, pledges of rights and mortgages - is merged in one right. A charge under the model is a property right and not a mere obligation. It entitles the person receiving security to enforce it by selling the things and rights taken as security and gives preference over unsecured creditors in insolvency proceedings. The model is limited to securing business credits. There is great flexibility over how the parties can define the debt or debts which are secured and the things and rights which are given as security. In both cases they can be described specifically or generally, they can be present or future, and they can change during the life of the charge. Under the model, charges should be a matter of public knowledge, with publicity achieved by requiring registration in a separate charges registry. Enforcement relies mainly on self-help, with the person holding the charge being given broad rights to sell the charged property as he feels appropriate. To preserve the balance between creditor and debtor, however, the model gives a right to any interested party to apply to a court for protection and claim damages from the person enforcing the charge for any loss suffered as a result of wrongful or abusive enforcement. Where the charge covers all a commercial enterprise's assets there is a further remedy of selling the business as a going concern. The rules on the creation of charges introduces a general distinction between registered charges, which have to be registered at the charges' registry, possessory charges for which registration is not required but where the chargeholder takes and must retain possession of the charged property, and unpaid vendors' charges which protect suppliers of goods who want to keep title to the goods. The model was generally well received in St Petersburg. But now Mr Simpson and Mr Rover must persuade the former communist countries to use it. Mr Simpson is optimistic they will. Hungary and Poland have already drafted secured lending laws which draw heavily on the model. But there are concerns that some countries with strong civil law traditions will see it as too influenced by US and English systems and opt for models closer to their own traditions, such as Germany's and Austria's. Mr Simpson says it was never the EBRD's intention to impose the model on the central and eastern European states, so it doesn't matter if a country decides it wants to omit parts of it. Although the new Hungarian collateral law draws on the model, it departs from it in several respects. For example, it opts for a court-run registration system which can be slow and costly - something the model sought to avoid. It also does not contain the model's unpaid vendor's charge designed to protect suppliers who want retention of title to their goods. 'The Hungarians took the view that providing for retention of title was not a pressing need,' Mr Simpson says. 'That doesn't worry us, because the important thing is that we are getting a law on secured transactions in Hungary. The unpaid vendor's charge can always be bolted on later.' Mr Philip Wood, a partner in London-based international law firm Allen &amp; Overy who sat on the advisory board, says that, although the model is very well thought out, it is bound to meet some resistance because 'there is no doubt it is very pro-creditor'. Where this approach conflicts with the pre-communist traditions of central European states, such as Bulgaria, the model is likely to hold few attractions. In central Asia, where many countries have only rudimentary secured lending laws or none at all, he thinks most will opt for a pro-creditor universal security law similar to the model. Russia has already done so with its 1992 pledge law, he says, and countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are showing interest. The biggest resistance to the model is likely over systems of registration and enforcement. In general, western countries prefer registration to be a simple, low-cost administrative act. But in many of the civil law jurisdictions of the former communist states such registration systems as exist tend to be court based - which means they are slow, cumbersome and costly. The registration system adopted in Russia under the 1992 pledge law is an example of what can go wrong, Mr Simpson says. Russia's system was based on the use of existing registries. But when parties came to register security interests they found many of these registries simply did not exist. Moreover, the Russian law exacts a registration charge or stamp duty of 3 per cent of the value of the assets secured. 'If the transaction involves a Dollars 1bn power project, that's a big hit,' he says. 'It just shows that if you tax any part of the creation of a charge you will make it unworkable.' As a result, the EBRD has set out to produce a blueprint for a simple computerised registration system based on new charges registries set up specially for the purpose, which Mr Simpson is confident will overcome these problems. The idea, he says, is to avoid the involvement of the courts so far as possible. Likewise with enforcement, he adds. The first thing every lender wants to know is how he can enforce the charge if things go wrong. In most former communist states enforcement is done through the courts. But the involvement of the courts at each stage of the enforcement process would be 'cripplingly slow', he says. It is vital that the enforcement rules interface with local insolvency laws, but they also need to be flexible enough to allow practical enforcement without court involvement, with the courts acting as long stop to protect the rights of the parties involved. Mr Simpson and Mr Rover know the model will not provide solutions to all the problems of secured lending in central and eastern Europe. They expect to meet strong resistance on such issues as enforcement and registration. But, used imaginatively, it should provide the basis for workable secured lending regimes in the region and, as such, it is a big step in the right direction.</p>

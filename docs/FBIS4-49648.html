			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin stressed during his talks with Kenyan President Daniel T.  Arap Moi that China is willing to further the friendly  cooperation with Kenya and strengthen the bilateral coordination  and discussion of international affairs.    During the talks lasting over one hour here this afternoon,  the two sides exchanged views on bilateral ties and African and  international issues.    Both of them expressed satisfaction with the smooth  development of Sino-Kenyan ties and shared the views that the  two countries, as developing ones, face the same tasks of  safeguarding peace and seeking development and that improving  bilateral relations is in the interest of the two peoples.    Jiang said that Moi, who had visited China twice, was an old  friend well-known and respected by the Chinese people.    He pointed out that China attached great importance to its  relations with Kenya and would like to consistently strengthen  and develop the cooperative ties in various fields on the basis  of the five principles of peaceful co-existence.    Jiang expressed his appreciation for Kenya's one-China  policy  and extended his thanks for Kenya's support of China to resume  its signatory status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade.    The two countries have supported and cooperated with each  other on the human rights issue, he said, adding that China  would like to further its cooperation and discussions with Kenya  on other international issues.    On bilateral economic and technological cooperation, Jiang  said that the Chinese Government encourages its companies to  conduct business abroad, and he hoped that the two countries  would carry out various people-to-people economic exchanges as  well as governmental cooperation.    Jiang also spoke highly of Moi's stand for Africans handling  African affairs by themselves, opposing foreign interference,  establishing a political and economic system according to each  country's own situation, and strengthening unity of the nations.    He gave a briefing to the guests on China's reform and  opening and the idea of implementing a socialist market economy,  as well as on China's independent foreign policy.    Moi said that the aim of the visit is to meet with the  Chinese leaders and acquaint himself with China's economy in an  effort to learn from each other and seek common development.    He said that the two countries had many common views on such  international issues as human rights, and no country should  impose its human rights conception on others since the domestic  situations were different.    He reaffirmed Kenya's one-China stand and warmly invited  Jiang to visit Kenya.    After the talks, the two presidents participated in the  signing ceremony of the bilateral agreement on economic and  technological cooperation, agreement on culture between 1994 and  1996, and protocol on educational exchanges.    Among those present at the talks were Qian Qichen, Chinese  vice- premier and foreign minister, Tian Zengpei, deputy foreign  minister, Chen Changben, chairman of the Chinese Government  Reception Committee and deputy culture minister, Chen Pingchu,  Chinese Ambassador to Kenya, S.K. Musyoka, minister of foreign  affairs and international cooperation, J.J. Kamotho, minister of  education, and James Simani, Kenyan ambassador to China.    Before the talks, Jiang Zemin held a greeting ceremony in  honor of Moi.    This morning, the Kenyan President laid a wreath at the  Monument to the People's Heroes.    The two sides also held ministerial talks today on  furthering  bilateral educational and agriculture ties.</p>

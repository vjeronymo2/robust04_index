			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney Despite the celebrated arrival of the European market, investors should perhaps be wary of companies with names prefixed by 'Euro'. First came Eurotunnel, now Euro Disney - businesses with high-flown ambitions, grand financing needs and unfathomable investment prospects. Euro Disney's news yesterday of poor attendance figures and a FFr492m first-quarter net loss was considerably worse than forecast. A profit is unlikely until at least 1995. The cost-cutting programme and marketing campaign may confound the worst sceptics, but even if successful, the immediate benefits to ordinary shareholders are uncertain. Any uplift is likely to be sapped by Walt Disney's management fees and royalties. This could cause financing problems for phase two of the project, especially since the stagnant French property market will prevent the easy realisation of development profits. Shareholders who have seen their shares fall well below the offer price are unlikely to stump up fresh funds. But, barring a turnround, Walt Disney may have to forego some of its fees.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of statement issued by the National Coalition </F> Government of the Union of Burma on the fourth anniversary of  the 1990 multiparty general election on 27 May]    [Text] The date 27 May is the fourth anniversary of the  1990 multiparty general election in which the National League  for Democracy led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won a landslide  victory. The result of this election showed the desire of the  entire Burmese citizenry for democracy. The SLORC [State Law  and Order Restoration Council] military clique has denied this  desire for democracy and continued to refuse to hand over state  power to the elected civilian representatives. Moreover, the  SLORC has also detained Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other  parliamentarians and democratic activists. The SLORC military  clique is not only violating human rights by arresting civilians  as forced laborers, but it has also conducted cease-fire  negotiations while isolating the ethnic and democratic forces  with the help of some neighboring countries. The Thai  Government is also strongly prohibiting the democratic  activities of the anti-SLORC groups inside Thailand. The rank  and file from the Defense Services, except the SLORC military  leaders, are also suffering from poverty like ordinary civilians.    In respect to [words indistinct] and various situations, the  National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma has made the  following demands:    Avoid giving legal recognition to the SLORC military clique  and the National Convention organized by the clique, stop the  SLORC human rights violations, find ways to hold (?a meeting)  that will allow Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other nationality  leaders to participate in it, and make SLORC comply with the UN  General Assembly resolution on Burma and the International Human  Rights Charter.    The statement also said the American Government must lay  down  a clear-cut policy on Burma. It also called for the  cancellation of Thailand's invitation to Burma to attend the  ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting, continued denunciation of the  SLORC (?by countries which helped pass the UN resolution on  Burma and by other countries), and urged the UN secretary  general to appoint a special Burmese envoy soon.</p>

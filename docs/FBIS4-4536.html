			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- Police raided the office of  a rightist group Saturday [2 April] in connection with the  arrest of two of its members who held two ASAHI SHIMBUN  executives hostage at the paper's headquarters in Tokyo the  previous day. Police searched the office of the "Taihi-kai" in  Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, after the arrests of its members  Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41, and Toshikazu Furusawa, 29.    Uchiyama and Furusawa were arrested Friday evening after  holding Kei Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge of the paper's  public relations department, and Mikinori Yoshida, 51, the head  of the secretarial department, for nearly six hours in an  executive reception room on the 15th floor. The two men were  armed with a handgun, a sword and carried four sticks of  dynamite, police said.    The rightists surrendered and released the two hostages  unharmed after police and the group's chairman, Kazuo Nakadai,  urged them to abandon their mission, police said.    Aragaki told reporters at the headquarters Saturday morning  that the two men repeatedly demanded during the hostage drama  that newspapers and television networks report their point of  view. He said he rejected their demands.    As the pair broke into the building, they passed out  pamphlets describing the country's mass media as a "Class A war  criminal" and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to "amend the tone of  its news coverage." The pamphlets also criticized Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for refusing to retract a statement  apologizing for Japan's wartime activities in Asia which he  termed a "war of aggression."    "(It) was an unusual situation but I did not feel any fear  because it didn't seem like they would hurt us," Aragaki said.    Aragaki said he told the two men as he was being released  that "(Japan) is a democratic society, so why don't we debate?"  He said Uchiyama replied, "we were reluctant to act like this  but it was our choice of life."    On October 20 last year, Shusuke Nomura, 58, then leader of  the group, entered the building and shot himself dead during a  meeting with the company's executives in protest over the use of  a cartoon parodying his group in a weekly magazine affiliated  with the ASAHI SHIMBUN.</p>

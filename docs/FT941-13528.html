			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: British Bloodstock cuts loss to Pounds 0.21m Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 213,000 were reported by The British Bloodstock Agency for the half year to September 30, largely as a result of the continuing cost reduction programme. Losses last time were Pounds 311,000. Gross revenue fell to Pounds 7.76m (Pounds 9.99m) while turnover rose to Pounds 1.76m (Pounds 1.67m). Losses per share were cut to 5.5p (8.1p). Mr Christo Philipson, chairman, said the bloodstock market was strengthening. However, he did not expect any dramatic improvement in results, largely because of the erosion in margins resulting from increased competition. The USM-traded company is principally involved with the purchase and sale, as agents, of bloodstock, stallion shares and nominations, as well as the management, insurance and shipping of bloodstock.</p>

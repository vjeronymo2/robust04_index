			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> NEWSPAPER GUILD REJECTS LATEST CONTRACT OFFER  </P> <P> Press-Telegram reporters, maintenance workers and other employees have rejected  the Long Beach company's latest contract offer by a 95-28 vote.  </P> <P> Union officials said they object to a proposed clause that would prohibit job  actions, such as boycotts or strikes, that could hurt the company economically  while the contract is in effect.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Newspaper Guild, which represents about 240 employees,  currently is carrying out such a job action, asking readers to sign cards that  would cancel their subscriptions if the union decides to turn them in. Union  leaders said they have gathered about 1,500 pledges.  </P> <P> Bob Rowell, the Press-Telegram's vice president of operations, said he was  surprised and disappointed by the vote. The company "has no plan to go back to  the bargaining table," he said. Todd Cunningham, president of the guild's  local, said he was hopeful the two sides could meet again. "We do want a  contract," Cunningham said. "And we're not very far. We hope they see it that  way, too."  </P></p>

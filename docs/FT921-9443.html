			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Banque Bruxelles in talks with insurance companies BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's second largest bank, is negotiating an agreement with two shareholders on insurance products. A co-operative deal between BBL and the shareholders could squeeze out a counter-proposal from Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance group. ING, which owns 5.9 per cent of BBL through a Belgian subsidiary, was at the centre of press speculation last year that it was poised to launch a paper and cash bid for BBL which would have cost the Dutch company the equivalent of more than Fl 3bn (Dollars 1.65bn). It declined to comment on the reports at the time. Responding to Belgian press reports yesterday, BBL said talks with two insurance companies - Royale Belge, 47 per cent of which is owned by Union des Assurances de Paris, and Winterthur of Switzerland - were 'well-advanced', and could involve 'very limited' movements of shares. UAP controls 9.35 per cent of BBL, and Winterthur 4.8 per cent. The bank played down the significance of the talks. 'It's quite normal that we should want to sell insurance products and that we should discuss this with shareholders,' the Belgian bank said. ING countered by saying that its proposal would enable all the various insurers who own a stake in BBL to participate in a partnership, with the exact level of involvement determined by the size of their shareholdings. The Royale Belge-Winterthur proposal, by contrast, would exclude all other BBL shareholders, including ING, which is keen to bolster its presence around Europe. ING also confirmed that last week it had informally raised the possibility of arriving at some form of co-operation in banking to BBL. It denied that these talks centred on ING expanding its stake in BBL.</p>

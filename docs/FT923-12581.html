			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: In the Bundesbunker The Bundesbank's mid-year review of its monetary targets was always going to be tense. With money supply growth more than 3 percentage points above its target ceiling, it urgently needed to reassert its credibility. Insofar as the council members care about the ERM at all, this had to be done without blowing it apart, along with hopes for European monetary union. The 0.75 point rise in the discount rate to 8.75 per cent serves both purposes for the time being. All the same, there should be little premature rejoicing from those in the UK who had been worrying about a move requiring base rates to rise in sympathy. Since the German banking system has only limited entitlement to borrow under the Bundesbank's discount facility, yesterday's rate increase will have a correspondingly small impact on the money market. Interest differentials with other European currencies remain largely unaffected. The move is more intended as an unequivocal signal of the Bundesbank's determination to curb credit expansion, however long it takes. That may explain why European equity markets registered the greatest disappointment. They have been slow to accept the economic implications for national economies of German rates staying high for the balance of the year. The UK looks particularly boxed in, especially after yesterday's bold rate increase by Italy. The risk is that sterling will remain weak while the recovery fails to materialise and political pressures mount, particularly around the party conference season in September. More worrying still is the thought that the Bundesbank can hardly have been making an idle threat. It has long established a pattern for discount rate rises to be followed fairly shortly by an increase in the more important Lombard rate. The differential between the two rates is also unusually narrow at 1 percentage point. The Bundesbank may simply be battening down the hatches for the long haul. But if credit demand does not slow reasonably soon, the markets will have grounds for worry that its next move may not be so innocuous.</p>

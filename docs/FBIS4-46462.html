			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Kozhokin, director of the Russian </F> Strategic Studies Institute, by Vladimir Khrustov under the  "Decision-making Mechanism" rubric; date, place not given:  "Information for Reflection Being Prepared for Top State Leaders  Adopting Political Decisions by Experts at the Russian Strategic  Studies Institute" -- first three paragraphs are introduction;  last three paragraphs are ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI note]    [Text] It is believed that information is the most  expensive commodity in the modern world. Indeed, without having  accurate, objective, unbiased, and obviously timely information  at your disposal, it is hard to make a correct decision.    The demands for information rise considerably and its role  increases many times over if it is intended for top state  leaders adopting political decisions. In this case, however, it  is not just "pure information" that is needed, but also  information that is analyzed beforehand by specialists and is  presented in the form of analytical reports with brief  conclusions and even recommendations.    The Russian Strategic Studies Institute [RSSI], formed by an  edict of the Russian Federation president, is one of information  and analysis centers working for the country's top organs of  power and administration. "What is the priority in your  activity, and who receives your materials?" -- a conversation  between your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent and RSSI Director  Yevgeniy Kozhokin, began with this question.    [Kozhokin] The institute's specialization is the problem of  Russia's national security in all its multifaceted aspects.  Hence the main range of consumers of our output: The  President's staff, the government apparatus, the relevant  Federation Council and State Duma committees, the Security  Council, the CIS Joint Armed Forces staff, and a number of  ministries and departments -- defense, internal affairs, the  security service, the Russian Federation State Committee for the  Defense Sectors of Industry, and others.    [Khrustov] What are the main avenues of the RSSI's  scientific research?    [Kozhokin] Targeted comprehensive programs form their basis.  I will briefly outline the basic ones.    The first one is Russia's national security. A number of  studies have been carried out within the framework of this  program to determine approaches toward a concept of national  security and the structuring of this problem. Methods of  recognizing and predicting threats to Russia's security are  being elaborated, and proposals for elaborating the strategy of  the country's national security are being prepared, taking into  consideration its new role and position in Europe and the  Asia-Pacific Region, and indeed the whole world.    The second one concerns the so-called nearby foreign  countries. The main point here is revealing factors of strategic  risk on Russia's borders, which have emerged following the  collapse of the USSR and the formation of the new independent  states: interethnic conflicts, territorial claims and disputes,  the creation of national armies and the quest for an autonomous  military policy, and the aspiration of individual states to  economic autarky.    The third is European security. This avenue of the  institute's activity specifically embraces problems that are  strategically important to Russia, such as prospects of European  political and economic integration, new developments in NATO  policy, in particular the "Partnership for Peace" program, the  West European Union, and the CSCE.    The fourth program is connected with ensuring Russia's  economic priorities. The institute is comprehensively  identifying the most important factors in the economic sphere.  Conceptual proposals for protecting Russia's vital interests in  the sphere of currency and credit, energy, and food security are  being elaborated. The latest trends in the development of the  world economy, which are influencing economic reform in the  Russian Federation, are being studied. Problems and prospects of  our country's participation in authoritative international  economic organizations are being examined.    Another important avenue of activity is military policy and  conversion. The purpose of this study program is to analyze and  elaborate proposals for Russia's top organs of state power in  the sphere of military doctrine and organizational development,  the conversion of the defense industry, the commercialization of  space, the arms trade, and military-technical cooperation with  foreign countries, taking world experience and the latest trends  in international markets into account.    We consider participation in the elaboration and  implementation of comprehensive conversion programs to be an  independent sphere in the activity of the RSSI. This involves  the coordination of efforts in formulate legislative initiatives  in the sphere of conversion; information and analysis backup for  conversion projects on the basis of developing data banks on the  state of markets for conversion output and on domestic and  foreign enterprises which are potential partners in the  implementation of conversion programs; and the conducting of  independent experts' appraisals and competitions for conversion  projects.    And finally, the last program, the sixth, concerns the  environment. A study of the environmental policy of foreign  countries is being conducted within the framework of this  program, the development of state-of-the-art environmentally  clean technologies is being examined, and proposals are being  elaborated to amend Russian legislation in the sphere of the  protection of the environment, in particular in connection with  military activity, and so on.    [Khrustov] What is the institute's output proper, and in  what form do the consumers receive it?    [Kozhokin] It is primarily information and analysis material  in the form of reviews, information, and memorandum. In order  to work out appraisals that are as objective and balanced as  possible, the RSSI makes fairly active use of seminars,  exchanges of opinion, and situation analyses, which are  regularly conducted with the participation of experts in the  interests of a number of Russian Federation ministries and  departments, the Security Council, and also parliamentary  committees.    For example, the institute has already produced around 20  situation analyses on the problems of Russia's relations with  the new independent states in nearby foreign parts, the economic  situation in the country, treaties on the reduction of strategic  offensive weapons, the role of the United Nations in the modern  world, the conversion of defense production, and other questions.    Of the major subjects which are "in progress," I would  single  out the conflict in Yugoslavia. The analytical material we are  currently preparing for the Russian Federation president and the  Security Council will also contain a forecast on the postwar  development of the countries which were once part of Yugoslavia,  and the Balkan region as a whole.    [Khrustov] It follows from what you have said that the task  of the RSSI specialists is to analyze information, summarize it,  and make forecasts. From what sources do you obtain this  information?    [Kozhokin] From all kinds of sources: Russian and foreign  scientific research centers, and the press. We also have  official information -- from ministries and departments.    [Khrustov] Do you rely on your colleagues from other  institutes?    [Kozhokin] Of course, and we involve them very extensively  in our work. This includes scientists from the Russian Academy  of Sciences, for example, the United States of America and  Canada Institute, the Europe Institute, and economic institutes,  as well as associates of departmental scientific research  organizations and experts from various sociopolitical movements  and organizations.    [Khrustov] What about colleagues abroad?    [Kozhokin] Yes, of course, them too. We understand the need  for the broadest cooperation with foreign scientific centers and  individual specialists for the purposes of an objective and  comprehensive analysis of the problems being studied at expert  level.    The RSSI is developing constructive relations with a whole  range of state structures, political organizations, and  scientific research centers of foreign countries. These include  the North Atlantic Assembly, the NATO International Secretariat,  the Atlantic Council, the Heritage Foundation (United States),  the National Defense University (United States), the  International Institute for Strategic Research (Britain), the  International Peace Institute (Austria), and others. I can say  that we have added to this list the Chinese Institute of  Contemporary International Relations and the PRC Academy of  Social Sciences Institute of East European and Central Asian  Countries, whose specialists were the RSSI's guests recently.

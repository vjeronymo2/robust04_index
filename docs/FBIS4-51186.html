			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zheng Jixin (6774 0679 0207) and reporter Ma </F> Chunlin (7456 2504 2651): "All-Army Production and Operation  Rectification and Reform Work Are Being Carried Out  Comprehensively"]    [Text] The Army-wide production and operation are being  reformed and reorganized as planned by the Central Military  Commission (CMC). Led by leading officers from the three  People's Liberation Army [PLA] general departments, the five  joint working groups organized by the three PLA general  departments and the CMC General Office headed for various major  military units a few days ago to check up on the work and  provide guidance. This is an important step by the leading  group for reforming and reorganizing all-Army production and  operation to implement the policy-decision made by the CMC to  shake up the Army's production and operation.    A meeting on Army-wide production and operation was held in  November last year. The CMC demanded that centralized and  unified control be exercised over production and operation  throughout the Army, that offices at all levels never go into  commercial production, that fighting troops do a good job in  agricultural and sideline production and non-fighting troops in  running industry, and that institutions such as hospitals,  warehouses, and scientific research institutes provide pay  services to society while fulfilling their work quotas. For  this purpose, the CMC further provided that the functions of  military units be separated from those of the enterprise and  that a separate system of production and operation be set up.  In addition, the CMC worked out policies and rules to  facilitate the reform and reorganization of production and  operation throughout the Army. After the meeting, various major  military units completed the tasks of mobilizing officers and  men and making preparations for the campaign, and they began to  put the CMC's decisions into practice early this year.    The joint working groups will primarily check up on the  preparation for and the process of the reform and reorganization  work, will understand whether various units' programs for  implementing the CMC decisions and their work plan have been  brought into line with the provisions laid down by the three PLA  general departments and their realities, will find out how the  reorganization work has been done, including the number, assets,  and receivable and payable debts of the enterprises whose stocks  and assets have been reappraised or those that have closed down,  suspended operation, amalgamated with others, switched to the  manufacture of other products, or severed ties with local  enterprises. The groups will also find out how the general  departments and various major military units have exercised  centralized and unified control over production and operation  and how the fighting troops have sorted out and turned over  their production and operation projects.    Before the joint working groups set out on the journey, Fu  Quanyou, head of the leading group for reforming and  reorganizing all-Army production and operation and director of  the General Logistics Department, gave a mobilization talk.  Zhou Ziyu, Zhang Bin, Xiong Guangkai, Liang Hong, and other  leaders from the three PLA general departments attended the  mobilization meeting.</p>

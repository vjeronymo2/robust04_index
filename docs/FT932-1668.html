			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: EIB to receive new facility to help smaller businesses EC LEADERS yesterday approved a new Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.35bn) soft-loan facility for the European Investment Bank to help small and medium-sized businesses and to fund road and transport projects in Europe. It is an extension of an Ecu5bn EIB credit line agreed at last year's Edinburgh summit. It will remain open beyond 1994, providing an interest rate subsidy of up to 3 per cent. The Copenhagen summit also agreed that EC finance ministers should study a European Commission proposal to provide an Ecu5bn bridging loan at market rates so that states have more money to spend on infrastructure. The loan would be available until the end of 1995, to be repaid later from structural funds. Commission officials expressed satisfaction that these short-term palliatives to Europe's unemployment crisis had won approval. But UK officials predicted they would be watered down in ministerial meetings in the autumn. Despite differences on how to revive growth and unemployment, EC leaders issued a strong call for a rapid lowering of European interest rates. They also gave a mandate to Mr Jacques Delors, to continue his study on how to reverse Europe's decline in competitiveness. Mr Delors will produce a white paper in time for the Brussels summit in December. Meanwhile, member states will submit ideas on how to cure 'Eurosclerosis' to the Commission before September 1. The Copenhagen summit signalled the opening shots in what will be a divisive debate on why Europe is failing to create as many jobs as Asia and the US. Britain is calling for a fundamental rethink of the EC's approach to job creation, stressing more flexible labour markets and lower social costs for businesses; other EC states are adamant that Europe's social net remain intact. Some EC officials predict the Delors white paper will be similar to that which launched the single market in 1985, which drew up almost 300 directives or laws. The present initiative is very different: the Commission's goal is to play a co-ordinating role rather than set detailed rules for member states to act. Officials believe the EC 'umbrella' provides cover for countries like Italy and Spain to take unpopular measures; but the opposite is true for the UK, where industrialists and politicians continue to jib at what they view as unnecessary interference from Brussels.

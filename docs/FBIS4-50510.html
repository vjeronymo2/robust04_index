			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Willy Wo-lap Lam: "Nobody Rocks the Boat During </F> Deng's Last Days"]    [Text] Once again economics has become the hand-maiden of  politics. And politics serves the goal of "stability",  Beijing's euphemism for one-party domination. To give the  impression that the economy is in order and everything is under  (party) control, various ministries and media have been  dispensing misleading and, at times, contradictory information.  And to prevent hyperinflation and unemployment -- a potent mix  that might jeopardise the "dictatorship of the proletariat" --  from worsening, numerous market reforms have been put on hold.    Let us first examine claims last Thursday [12 May] by the  Minister of the State Economics and Trade Commission (SETC),  Wang Zhongyu, that, according to a survey of 16 provinces and  cities, "barely 10 per cent" of enterprises had either stopped  production or were operating below capacity". Mr Wang,  sometimes regarded as Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji's point man for  fiscal liberalisation, then charged the foreign press with  exaggerating the plight of the state-owned sector.    The SETC chief's assertions contradict numerous internal and  public surveys that at least 40 per cent of government-run  enterprises in major cities have been shut down or are idling.  The situation would actually be scarier if Mr Wang's statements  were true. It would mean that the banks were again printing  money to bail out state-held firms, 47 per cent of which are in  the red.    Then there were the equally wild claims last month by cadres  and the media alike that inflation had been "brought under  control". These contentions were based on the fact that, in  March, the year-on-year increase in consumer prices was 0.5 per  cent less than that in February. Comparable figures for the  services sector and for producer goods were respectively 0.3 and  5.1 per cent.    These statistics -- and the rosy projections based on them  --  are queried by Western economists. Aside from the need to  bankroll money-losing enterprises and pay millions of workers  who are owed back salaries, the central government has been  unable to curb spending, due to its failure to stop localities  engaging in development projects that are outside state plans.    Speaking in Hong Kong last week, the Vice-Minister of  Construction Tan Qinglian said fixed-asset investment this year  would come to 1,300 billion yuan (about HK$1,157 billion), up 13  per cent from 1993. The semi-official China News Service (CNS)  [ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE] reported last week, however, that the  outlay on new infrastructure would actually amount to a  staggering 1,500 billion yuan.    And how about reports that grain production had "stabilised"  in spite of the massive depletion of arable land as well as the  dramatic speed with which farmers are forsaking wheat and rice  for commercial crops. Earlier this week, CNS quoted agrarian  experts as expressing optimism about future harvests because  "China's comprehensive ability to produce grain had in general  stabilised at the level of over 425 billion kilograms".    Informed sources said the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) and  the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) had come up with different  statistics for the 1993 grain yield, and a ferocious argument  had broken out over which set of figures should be used. The  substantially higher SSB statistics were challenged by the MOA,  which contended that, given factors including loss of land and  bad harvests, their figures were more realistic. The State  Council decided against the MOA, on the grounds that "most  people had assumed that China's capacity was 425 billion kg and  a figure significantly lower than that could trigger the kind of  panic buying that took place last December".    Even more disturbing than cooking the books, however, is the  decision by Beijing to maintain order and stability by  mothballing or scaling down reform measures announced last  November. Citing the fact that Beijing had lost 500 billion  yuan worth of state assets in the past decade, the central  government has clamped down on the key reform measure -- the  sale and radical restructuring of state-owned firms. The State  Council announced last weekend it had taken back powers by  provincial and municipal administrations to sell state firms to  foreigners or to convert them into shareholding companies.    Also under the pretext of restoring fiscal discipline,  Vice-Premier Zhu has ordered the temporary closure of futures  markets in areas including steel, sugar and coal. All existing  futures markets have to be re-registered after a strict auditing  process.    Displaying his colours as the Great Rectifier, Mr Zhu has  been touring the provinces dispensing old-style state fiats  along the way. The economic tsar ordered Guangdong and Zhejiang  to grow more grain. Guizhou was told to slash tobacco  production. And Heilongjiang and Liaoning were asked to change  the production lines of their enterprises. In a throwback to  central planning, specific targets were slapped on localities.  For example, the acreage for real-estate development for  Guangdong has been set at 100,000 mu (one mu equals 0.0667  hectares). Fujian was told to close 20 "wasteful" industrial  parks to save 102 sq km of land.    And in spite of its commitment to rejoining the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Beijing has put new restrictions  on foreign trade in an apparent effort to narrow its US$12  billion (HK$92.6 billion) a year trade deficit. For example,  Beijing arbitrarily stopped the import of a range of  petrochemical products in the spring, and local governments'  autonomous powers over foreign trade have been curtailed.    Summing up the conservative mode in economic policy, SETC's  Mr Wang said last week: "Whether it is today or tomorrow,  privatisation is not the necessary trend for the reform of  China's state-held enterprises. It is also impossible for the  state-owned sector to be replaced by other economic elements --  or for it to undergo major structural changes."    As Premier Li Peng reiterated on Monday, "maintaining social  stability is the major business that the centre and localities  must grasp".    The sober reality is that, instead of looking ahead and  finding long-term solutions, the leadership is making do with  stop-gap measures to shore up the regime, such as  re-centralising economic decision-making, propping up the ailing  state enterprises, and keeping the 200 million unemployed on the  dole.    Living under the shadow of Deng Xiaoping's impending death  --  and the power struggle that will ensue should he pass on -- even  usually vigorous politicians such as Mr Zhu are unwilling to  take the smallest risks.</p>

This is reflected  in his "Decree on the Citizens' Right to Information", received  by ITAR- TASS on Wednesday [5 January].    The president instructed the commission for legislative  proposals to prepare a bill "On the Right to Information", which  would be presented to the new parliament as a top priority  legislative initiative.    Until the adoption of such a law, the decree establishes the  duty of all government bodies, organisations, enterprises,  public associations, and responsible officials to ensure freedom  of information. In particular, the access to information which  is of public or personal interest to Russian citizens is  guaranteed.    The decree stipulates that the essence of decisions taken by  government bodies is to be explained more in-depth on radio and  television programmes. The state television companies have been  ordered to prepare a series of programmes which will explain the  activities of federal bodies.    One of the decree's points particularly declares that the  work of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of  power are to be given equal air time.</p>

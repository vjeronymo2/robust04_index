			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Thatcher unlikely to accept hereditary peerage MRS Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, is unlikely to accept a hereditary peerage in the dissolution honours next month, sources at Westminster said last night, Philip Stephens writes. They suggested she had told Mr John Major she would prefer to avoid controversy by accepting a life peerage, which would confer no title on her children. Peerages are also expected for cabinet ministers under Mrs Thatcher  - possibly Mr Norman Tebbit, Sir Geoffrey Howe, Mr Cecil Parkinson and Mr Nicholas Ridley.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTING WATER SUPPLY  </P> <P> Brown-Ferris Industries, operator of Azusa landfill, cannot be faulted for  promoting its case against the combined forces of the water industry and state  environmental groups before the State Water Resources Control Board. A  potential 40-million ton refuse depository (editorial, "Not the Right Spot to  Begin With," Sept. 30) generating a rate/ton averaging $15-$25 per ton until  the expected fill completion date of 2010 adequately reveals the motive.  Considering the legendary low overhead of the landfill industry, the situation  looks like a real money machine.  </P> <P> However, Region IX Environmental Protection Agency estimates a 30-year  $800-million bill required to purify the main San Gabriel basin water table, an  extensive underground "water tank" or reservoir, which could serve parched Los  Angeles regional needs if it were adequately cleaned up to contain excess  winter flows from the State Water Project and Colorado River.  </P> <P> The State Water Board's own staff has documented heavy concentrations of a  great variety of pollutants, including industrial solvents, which amount to the  greatest underground catastrophe in the state. By a substantial margin, we are  No. 1. These financial facts expose (former EPA administrator and current)  Brown-Ferris Chairman William D. Ruchelshaus' offer to build $20 million in  water treatment facilities at three sites to be puny indeed.  </P> <P> Despite Public Utility Commission regulation, our own water industry might also  be considered a money machine. Why haven't all the adjudication participants of  the Main San Gabriel Basin Water Masters installed these suggested water  treatment facilities on their own or with EPA financial assistant when we  became a Superfund cleanup site over 5 years ago? The voters of the San Gabriel  Valley await the answer to this question.  </P> <P> Our basin, critical to the future of Southern California, must be protected.  Both parties to the dispute have been negligent by not showing adequate  diligence. The state board should have denied the landfill expansion permit.  Local control has failed. The state's natural resources are burdened by  uncompensated costs borne for decades and the cleanup bill is now due.  </P> <P> WILLIAM ROBINSON  </P> <P> Director, Division 4  </P> <P> Upper San Gabriel Valley  </P> <P> Municipal Water District  </P> <P> West Covina  </P></p>

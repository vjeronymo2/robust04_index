The Baltic leaders meet in the Lithuanian seaside  resort of Palanga Friday [25 March].    In an interview with the Voice of America and the Latvian  newspaper DIENA, Brazauskas said much attention during the  summit will be paid to relations of the Baltic states with other  countries, including Russia. The three leaders also intend to  discuss steps that must be taken to approach the European Union.    Well-informed sources said one of Lithuania's initiatives  for  the summit is a joint resolution on coordination of actions in  international organizations. The Baltic presidents are also  expected to discuss the work of embassies and possibilities to  create joint Baltic consulates.    Lithuania intends to propose a resolution on cooperation  with  countries of the Visegrad Treaty, the Czech Republic, Hungary,  Poland and Slovakia.    According to the summit's program, the presidents are  scheduled to hold trilateral and bilateral meetings.</p>

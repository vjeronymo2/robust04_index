			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> HOPE ON MALARIA;  </P> <P> COLOMBIAN CLAIMING VICTORY IN RACE TO DEVELOP VACCINE AGAINST KILLER  </P> <P> There has never been an effective vaccine for malaria, scourge of the tropics  and killer of millions.  </P> <P> Now, many experts -- although cautious -- agree that rapidly advancing  knowledge about immunology and malaria has reached the threshold of producing a  vaccine that can prevent one of the most widespread and troublesome diseases  ever known.  </P> <P> And in the race to discover a preventive agent, one researcher, Dr. Manuel E.  Patarroyo, is claiming victory.  </P> <P> Patarroyo has tested his vaccine on hundreds of soldiers stationed in  Colombia's Amazon lowlands, where malaria is endemic. Until a report on the  field testing is published -- he has submitted it the journal Nature -- he does  not want to divulge details, but he smiles triumphantly when asked about the  result.  </P> <P> "It couldn't be better," said Patarroyo, 42. "It is extremely positive."  </P> <P> More than 100 million people a year are believed to suffer from malaria, and  the annual death toll worldwide is estimated in the millions, with most of the  fatalities in Africa. Although malaria can be cured with modern medicines, most  victims lack access to effective treatment.  </P> <P> The need for a vaccine has become more urgent in recent years because some  varieties of the disease, as well as some mosquitoes that carry it, have become  resistant to widely used medicines and pesticides.  </P> <P> In the United States, South America, Europe and other parts of the world,  researchers are applying bioengineering techniques in concerted efforts to  develop malaria vaccines. Among promising projects are those at New York  University, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the University of Maryland and the  Pasteur Institute in Paris.  </P> <P> Some research aims at protection from the malaria sporozoite transmitted by  mosquitoes. Other projects target the parasite at the merozoite stage in which  it attacks red blood cells. It is believed that any vaccine will have to be  protective against these different stages in the life cycle of the parasite  that causes malaria.  </P> <P> According to Patarroyo and other experts, his work is among the most advanced  blood-stage research being done anywhere. No one else has successfully tested a  blood-stage vaccine on human subjects, according to Dr. Lindsay Martinez, a  World Health Organization specialist in Geneva.  </P> <P> "He seems to have shown substantial levels of protection, and that is  encouraging," Martinez said of Patarroyo's research.  </P> <P> A thin man with a narrow face and a receding hairline, Patarroyo was wearing a  baggy sweater one recent Saturday morning as he showed a visitor through his  laboratories.  </P> <P> He explained the process of isolating merozoites, analyzing their atomic  </P> <P> structure and duplicating key parts of the structure by chemical synthesis.  Stepping into the chemical synthesis room, he scooped up half a dozen vials  full of white powder that might be mistaken for baking soda.  </P> <P> "This is it," he said, opening a vial and shaking white powder into the  visitor's hand. "This is the vaccine."  </P> <P> A vaccine is desperately needed in Colombia and some nearby countries where  malaria has been spreading rapidly. The Pan American Health Organization said  it received reports of 1.1 million cases in the Western Hemisphere in 1988, up  from 931,000 in 1984.  </P> <P> In Colombia, the number of reported cases jumped to 101,000 from 55,000 in the  same period, while Mexico reported an increase to 116,000 from 85,000. In  Brazil, Latin America's most populous country, the increase was to 565,000 from  378,000 cases.  </P> <P> "We can consider it an epidemic," said Joselio Branco, head of the Brazilian  Health Ministry's anti-disease campaign office.  </P> <P> Branco said the Brazilian death toll from malaria is not known, but he  estimated that between 1% and 3% of all cases are fatal. At that rate, up to  17,000 Brazilians died of malaria in 1988.  </P> <P> The World Bank is preparing to lend Brazil $99 million for an anti-malaria  program that will include spraying for mosquitoes and treating patients. The  Brazilian government will match the World Bank funds.  </P> <P> About 95% of Brazil's cases are in the Amazon region, and nearly half are in  Rondonia, a state the size of Oregon that is being invaded by settlers and gold  prospectors.  </P> <P> Orestes Muniz, vice governor of Rondonia, said the state's hospitals overflow  with malaria patients. "Sometimes there are two or three persons per bed,"  Muniz said.  </P> <P> Although Muniz had not heard of Patarroyo's research in Colombia, he said a  malaria vaccine would be a godsend for Rondonia.  </P> <P> "It would mean a liberation from the nightmare" of malaria, he said.  </P> <P> The histories of Latin America, Africa and Asia are replete with malaria  nightmares that have frustrated ambitious development projects and decimated  work forces.  </P> <P> When the French tried and failed to build a canal through Panama in the late  1800s, malaria and other diseases killed at least 20,000 workers over a decade.  The United States completed the canal only after controlling malaria and yellow  fever.  </P> <P> Malaria is believed to have been brought to the New World after the voyage of  Columbus. In tropical South America, malaria is one of several imported  diseases that helped reduce Indian populations to a fraction of their former  size.  </P> <P> Early in the 19th Century, Europeans found that quinine, distilled from the  bark of the South American cinchona tree, was useful in treating the disease.  In the 1880s and '90s, they discovered that malaria was caused by the  one-celled Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes.  </P> <P> DDT has been used to control the mosquitoes in some countries, but they are  becoming resistant to insecticide in many areas. And increasingly widespread  strains of the most lethal malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, have become  resistant to chloroquine, the most effective drug for treating the disease.  </P> <P> It is the P. falciparum parasite that Patarroyo's vaccine is designed to  combat.  </P> <P> In Colombia, where P. falciparum infests the southern Amazon area, malaria was  the registered cause of about 2,000 deaths last year, Patarroyo said. But he  estimated that the real number of malaria deaths could be three to four times  that number.  </P> <P> Patarroyo studied immunology at Rochester University under Dr. Gerald Edelman,  winner of the 1972 Nobel Prize for medicine, and later founded the Institute of  Immunology at the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Bogota. He now directs a  40-member research staff at the institute.  </P> <P> The synthetic protein combinations, or peptides, made in the labs are identical  to the harmless parts of the falciparum parasite that attach to red cells in  the blood, Patarroyo said. He said the peptides stimulate the release of  antibodies into the blood, providing protection should the real parasite  strike.  </P> <P> He predicted that the same principles of chemical synthesis will soon produce  not only vaccines for other varieties of malaria but also for such diseases as  tuberculosis and leprosy.  </P> <P> Patarroyo tested the vaccine on monkeys in 1986, announcing the results in  1987. He then tested it on groups of army volunteers -- first only a few, then  25, 70, 150.  </P> <P> The vaccine was "challenged" by injections of live malaria parasites. Patarroyo  reported that the protection was generally successful.  </P> <P> The vaccine has been field tested for the last nine months on soldiers  stationed in rural areas of southern Colombia. Patarroyo indicated that none of  the hundreds of soldiers who received two doses of the vaccine have come down  with malaria, while many unvaccinated soldiers in the same areas have.  </P> <P> He said he will report on field testing of the vaccine in articles to be  published this summer. Preparations are being made for more field testing in  Venezuela and Brazil.  </P> <P> The World Health Organization asked the U.S. government's Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta to verify the results of Patarroyo's trials with monkeys.  Dr. Trenton Ruebush, a researcher with the CDC's Malaria Branch, said trials  with monkeys in Atlanta were unsuccessful, so he and another CDC researcher  repeated the testing in Patarroyo's laboratories.  </P> <P> "What we are finding now is that in the trials being done down here, the  monkeys do show protective responses to all three peptides," Ruebush said in  Bogota. "We are satisfied that the antibody levels reported in the literature  are correct." Patarroyo said the Atlanta failure was the result of flaws in the  preparation of the vaccine by a private U.S. firm.  </P> <P> Ruebush commended Patarroyo's research. "Dr. Patarroyo's group here has made  some impressive steps toward the development of an effective malaria vaccine,"  the American said.  </P> <P> "But," he cautioned, "I think it is fair to say that we still are a long way  from a vaccine that would be used extensively in the field. Even after testing  it in other countries, a lot of hard work has to be done in evaluation before  it is distributed to ministries of health."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yaounde, 6 Jun (AFP) -- The Yaounde authorities have  made a second appeal to arbitration in the International Court  of Justice (ICJ) at the Hague for the Cameroon-Nigeria border to  be definitively demarcated, Cameroonian Justice Minister Douala  Moutome announced yesterday.    This new appeal, which concerns the whole of the  Cameroon-Nigeria border, from Lake Chad to the Atlantic, follows  "the occupation of Cameroonian villages in the northern part" of  the country, the minister added on national radio in Yaounde.    According to Cameroonian military sources, Nigerian troops  took up positions in two villages in northern Cameroon about two  weeks ago.    Such incidents have been common along the 1,500-km land  border between the two countries since the 1960's, particularly  in the Lake Chad Region.    In early 1994, Yaounde had already appealed to the ICJ  regarding its border dispute with Abuja over the Bakassi  Peninsula, an oil- rich region of 1,000 square kilometers in the  Gulf of Guinea, over which both countries claim sovereignty.</p>

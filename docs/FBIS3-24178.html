"We have a wealth of opportunity in Lithuania if we go after  it. But the opportunity is opening up right now and it will be  much more difficult to enter the market at a later point in  time," [Reykjavik] MORGUNBLADID quoted the center's founders as  commenting.    Icelanders have been fairly diligent at developing the  promising Baltic market since they became the first nation to  recognize Lithuania's independence in 1991.    Health firm Islenska Heilsufelagid is on the cusp of  starting  up production of pharmaceutical drugs in cooperation with the  University of Vilnius, while film studio Mydaver Saga is  producing animated films.    In addition, Icelanders and Lithuanians have teamed up in a  project to breed the Icelandic Horse.</p>

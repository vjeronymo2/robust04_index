			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 7, RIA -- The press centre of the  Russian Navy issued a statement today. The statement says that  recent articles have been putting a wrong and incompetent  interpretation on the retirement of some air-capable cruisers  from the Russian Navy. The point is that early in the 90s these  ships have served their time and required repairs. But repair  facilities being the property of Ukraine, placement of orders  became impossible. Creation of specialised facilities by Russia  would have taken much time and money.    In view of these factors it was decided to retire the first-  generation cruisers Minsk and Novorossiisk in the Pacific Fleet  and the Kiev in the Northern Fleet.    At the same time, the press service indicates, an  air-capable  cruiser of the next generation, Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as  its aircraft, is being put through its paces.</p>

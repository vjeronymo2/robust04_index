			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Costly journey to the market: After yesterday's announcement of job cuts and pit closures, British Coal faces a fight for survival A keen sense of the role played by coal in two centuries of British industrial history is needed to appreciate the full impact of yesterday's developments at British Coal. A fuel which provided the spark for an industrial revolution which eventually swept the world is to be run down, possibly shut off for good. Shock and anger were the predictable reaction to this historic moment. But there was also bewilderment at the scale, and even ruthlessness, of the operation, to say nothing of the timing. Why turn thousands of workers on to the streets in the depths of the worst recession since the second world war? Why slash output of a leading national resource at a time when coal imports are already rising sharply? Why try to transform coal into a commercial proposition when no other country in Europe has come remotely near achieving this? The answer to all these questions lies in the government's determination to end the cossetting which has kept British Coal alive for decades, and force it to earn its place in the world. Although privatisation is in view, a successful sale would be seen more as confirmation that British Coal had secured that place than as a goal in itself. Few people spoke more bitterly about the closures than the company's own chairman, Mr Neil Clarke, who said they were 'a scant reward' for the efforts miners had already put into streamlining the company. And even he raised questions about the wisdom of UK energy policy. But the cuts follow successive Tory governments' efforts - halting though they have been - to remove the distortions from the British energy market. Once the electricity industry was privatised two years ago and the power generators were free to buy coal wherever they wished, British Coal's only hope of survival lay in producing coal at the right price. Contracts with the generators account for three-quarters of its sales. The old subsidised contracts expire next March, and this dictated the politically awkward timing of yesterday's announcements. The new contracts that will replace them will be freely negotiated. If the government had wanted to postpone the cuts until the economy was in better shape, it would have had to extend subsidies even longer - something it was not prepared to do. Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, said yesterday: 'We are supporting British Coal to the tune of Pounds 100m a month. That is equivalent to all the support I give to the rest of British industry.' British Coal has been preparing for this moment ever since the bitter and protracted strike of the mid-1980s broke the back of union resistance. Already significantly leaner than those tumultuous times, the company has nearly trebled output per man, and even managed to report a Pounds 170m profit last year, albeit after the government had written off billions of pounds of debt. British Coal is the most efficient coal producer in the EC by a long way. But although this has involved cumulative pit closures and job losses far greater than those announced yesterday, the drive to become competitive continues. British Coal currently sells coal for about Pounds 1.80 a gigajoule, well above the world market price of Pounds 1.20gj. The new contracts now being negotiated with electricity generators would reduce the price to Pounds 1.50gj. But that will not be enough to staunch the flow of imports which now account for more than a fifth of the 90m tonnes of coal consumed in the UK each year. Mr Clarke forecast yesterday that British Coal would be fully competitive with imports by the end of the new five-year contracts. However, price is not the only pressure bearing down on British Coal. Last year's report by N M Rothschild, merchant banking advisers to the government, predicted that UK coal demand would fall to 65m tonnes by 1994/95 and 60m tonnes by the end of the century. Today, those figures might have to be reduced by a further 10m tonnes because of a decline in the electricity industry's needs. The factors shrinking the coal market include the growing popularity of natural gas as a fuel for power generation. With the North Sea now in full flood, supplies look plentiful until the middle of the next century. Gas has the advantage of being clean and easy to transport. By building new gas power stations, generators can take advantage of the latest technology which produces much more electricity from a given quantity of fuel. There are also environmental considerations. The UK has subscribed to a European Community commitment to reduce carbon emissions to their 1990 level by 2000. Although new technology has been developed to burn coal more cleanly, the existing power generation structure with its old and dirty stations makes expansion of coal inappropriate. Nor does the traditional case for coal - the security of supply - carry much weight these days. In spite of its advances, British Coal has yet to shake off its reputation as a costly and unreliable supplier. And the abundance of alternative domestic fuels has weakened whatever claim it had as purveyor of a vital national resource. But powerful though these arguments look, many people believe they have been overstated. Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former commercial director of British Coal who left the company earlier this year over disagreements about the cuts, says: 'They are not inevitable.' He points to the subsidies which continue to be handed to the nuclear power industry and to the distorted prices being paid in the 'dash' for North Sea gas. Coal also has to compete with electricity imported by cross-Channel cable from France's state-owned power industry, and with imported coal which British Coal alleges is being dumped by third-world countries. He believes the coal market could be sustained at 60m-65m tonnes a year. However, with the deed now done, the question is whether British Coal will be able to find a new life or whether the cuts have effectively condemned it to a lingering death. The prospects for a European coal business based on deep mines are not encouraging. Most EC producers have already closed their pits for good. Only two countries still produce coal in any quantity - Spain and Germany - and both subsidise it heavily, Spain to the tune of nearly Dollars 1bn a year. In contrast, countries such as Colombia, Australia and South Africa produce coal in high volume and at very low prices, mainly because their operations are open-cast. These are the producers against which British Coal will have to compete to survive. Another question mark over British Coal is the impact of the new electricity contracts. Although these have yet to be concluded, the outline agreement suggests that the tougher terms will reduce last year's Pounds 170m profit, though Mr Clarke stressed yesterday that British Coal would remain in the black. The shift towards gas also makes British Coal 'virtually unsaleable', according to the Coalfield Communities Campaign which is fighting the closures. The challenge facing the government will be to avoid any further cuts as it tries to entice would-be purchasers. Mr Heseltine is committed to selling off the 'largest viable' coal industry he can. There are potential buyers for the whole company, including two separate trade union-led buy-out plans. But he will also come under pressure to break British Coal into bits to satisfy the larger number of potential purchasers who are only interested in particular types of pit, or in operations in particular regions. The case for trying to keep British Coal intact rests mainly on the need to have the strongest possible bargaining partner against the duopoly of the two big generators, National Power and PowerGen. From the buyer's point of view, the bigger the company, the more widely the buyer can spread the risk that its mines will run out of coal. Size also brings economies of scale. On the other hand, a monolithic coal company might repeat the error the government made in failing to split up British Gas at privatisation, and has since required corrective action by the Office of Fair Trading. Two competing coal companies, constructed with a similar mix of businesses, might be needed to give the necessary competitive stimulus. Rothschild believes that splitting British Coal into two - though not more - would be viable. But forces are arrayed against a split. 'We've already got competition coming out of our ears,' says Mr Doug Bulmer, the president of the British Association of Colliery Management which hopes to lead a buy-out. There is a rival buy-out plan by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in alliance with East Midlands Electricity. The government will also have to decide whether British Coal should be sold as a free-standing group, or absorbed by a larger international conglomerate. Each course has different attractions. On its own, British Coal would be in charge of its destiny, but vulnerable. As part of a larger group, it would have stronger backing, but would be only one part of a company's global coal strategy. Either way, Mr Tim Eggar the energy minister, is keen for miners to have a stake in the company, though he may encourage them to settle for a profit-sharing scheme rather than the riskier direct share ownership. Yesterday's announcement and the eventual conclusion of the new electricity contracts will be the most important events in the run-up to the sale because they provide the vital information in assessing British Coal's value. Estimates of this value range up to Pounds 500m. The main variable is the extent to which the government takes over British Coal's huge liabilities for pensions, severance pay, free coal for workers and pit subsidence. It is expected that the Treasury will have to take on liabilities for British Coal's past activities, leaving the company to assume its new ones. But this will still leave the Treasury with a multi-billion pound bill, meaning that however much it secures from the sale it will end up with a large deficit on the deal. British Coal may achieve a new existence, but it will be unrecognisable in size and character compared with just 10 years ago. The company's fate shows how closely interlinked the strands of the energy business can be. 'Other people take these decisions. Coal suffers from the results,' said Mr Clarke. To which Mr Heseltine's reply was: 'British Coal cannot go on producing coal which cannot be sold.'</p>

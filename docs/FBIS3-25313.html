			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Election Boycott Heightens Risk of Violence -- The Freedom  Alliance (FA) boycott of the April election "has raised  political temperatures and heightened the risk of increased  violence," notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in  English on 15 February. By not contesting the election, "the FA  has put itself beyond the disciplinary sanction of the  Independent Electoral Commission, a development which will  complicate the task of controlling alliance zealots. Within  hours of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] decision to boycott the  election, gunmen suspected of having IFP links attacked the  Zevenfontein squatter camp, north of Johannesburg, killing four  people and wounding nine more. The victims were reported to be  ANC [African National Congress] supporters."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Constraints of Single Ballot -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in  English on 15 February in a page-10 editorial believes the  National Party (NP) and the ANC "may be inclined to withdraw  their offer of a double ballot, with separate votes for national  and regional government, now that the Freedom Alliance parties  seem likely to boycott the election. But the constraints of a  single ballot are plain. Only six of the 19 parties (including  the major contestants) are contesting everything. Their  supporters's single cross, in any region, will count for that  party in Parliament and regional legislatures. People voting  for any of the other 13 parties forfeit some choice." "One vote  is supposed to count twice; in many cases it may count once,  forcing voters to choose between a national say and a local one.  Our new freedom has limits."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   IFP, Freedom Alliance `Spoiling for a Fight' -- Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 15 February in a page-8 editorial "would  grant members of the IFP and the Freedom Alliance their right to  boycott the elections -- just as we do Azapo [Azanian People's  Organization] -- if they stopped their tactics of deliberately  spoiling for a fight. The fact that the other parties taking  part in the coming elections are doing everything to get these  organisations into the elections exposes their refusal to go to  the polls."</p>

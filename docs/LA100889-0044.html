			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GOOD HEALTH MAGAZINE;  </P> <P> NUTRITION;  </P> <P> THE DIET DILEMMA;  </P> <P> WEIGHT-REDUCING PLANS DO WORK -- FOR A WHILE. BUT THE TRUE CHALLENGE COMES WHEN  THE REGIMEN'S OVER AND THE DIETER RETURNS TO THE EVERYDAY WORLD  </P> <P> First, the good news: They work. The Nutri/Systems, the Jenny Craigs, the  Optifasts, the Weight Watchers and all the rest of the parade of mass-market,  enrollment-style diets currently on the American scene. Sign up, stick with it  and lose weight. If you're faithful, it's virtually guaranteed.  </P> <P> More good news: They're not considered dangerous. Stay within the doctor's  guidelines and the diet's strictures and you'll likely stay healthy.  </P> <P> The inevitable catch: The real world. Real meals. Real food. Actual day-to-day  eating without diet counselors, group support, weekly meetings, prepackaged  foods or strictly limited calorie intake. Going it on your own in the world of  restaurants and dinner parties and seemingly limitless food choices.  </P> <P> "These diets all have some really positive points about them," says Bettye  Nowlin, a registered dietitian and a spokesperson for the American Dietetic  Assn. "They all use behavior modification and all have an exercise component,  and you need both of those to be successful. But they're not realistic in the  long term. People aren't going to keep up these systems all their lives."  </P> <P> Still, say medical and diet professionals, the current crop of diet plans, many  of which have appeared only in the past decade, are far superior to their  gimmicky or ill-advised antecedents that emphasize practices such as food  combining, single-food diets, fasting and other questionable weight-loss  strategies. The newer diets, which shun such oddities and often recommend or  require close medical supervision and sound, basic nutrition, have little  relation to fad diets such as the nutrient-deficient Last Chance Diet that was  briefly popular in the 1970s and was blamed for several deaths.  </P> <P> But the new diets are playing for high stakes -- the enrollment-style diets are  estimated to be a multibillion-dollar industry -- and each offers a distinctive  "hook" to attract the approximately 100 million overweight Americans. The maxim  of the diet biz in the late 1980s remains: You gotta have a gimmick.  </P> <P> The enrollment-style diets fall into three basic types:  </P> <P> Liquid, or supplemented fast, diets. These plans typically are medically  supervised, either by the dieter's personal physician or one designated by the  diet facility. The regimen involves an initial period of abstaining from solid  food and subsisting on the low-calorie, high-nutrient liquid supplement. A  normal, balanced diet is then gradually reintroduced during a period of  counseling and behavior modification. Optifast and the Cambridge Plan are  typical examples.  </P> <P> Prepackaged food diets. Dieters are provided with full menus of prepackaged,  low-calorie foods that they prepare themselves. There are periodic group  meetings and behavior modification classes with diet counselors. The  Nutri/System and Jenny Craig plans belong to this category.  </P> <P> Low-calorie, "real food" diets. Participants attend meetings, behavior  modification classes and group support sessions while adhering to a specified,  varied low-calorie diet incorporating foods available at a grocery store. Diet  Center and Weight Watchers are examples.  </P> <P> All the diets, however, have one thing in common: claims of long-term success.  The responses of medical and diet professionals to those claims is equally  consistent. They say that, in most cases, they aren't true.  </P> <P> "(The diets) are, I think, fairly successful in the short run," says Albert  Marston, a professor of psychology at USC who specializes in the study of diet  and weight control. "All diets see good weight loss at the beginning. The first  problem people face is the loss of motivation after several weeks. They get  bored with the food or frustrated with not eating. The really big problem is  getting people all the way down to their goal weight."  </P> <P> Marston says studies he has conducted have shown that dieters reaching their  goal weight "have a far better chance of keeping the weight off. If they drop  out before that, the tendency is to gain (the weight) back."  </P> <P> (Claims by the diet plans notwithstanding, independent medical and nutrition  experts interviewed say 90% or more of dieters are likely eventually to gain  all or a portion of their lost weight back.)  </P> <P> For those who do reach their goal weight, says Marston, other pitfalls lurk.  While all the enrollment-style diets emphasize behavior modification and  counseling in proper nutrition and the psychology of eating, "they try to get  people to come back for maintenance (programs), but once people leave the diet  they tend to think of it as history," Marston says. "Attendance at follow-up  meetings is generally very poor, and that's a time when people need to be very  careful. Because when they slip, the attitude tends to be, 'Oh, I've blown it.'  They have a kind of fall-off-the-wagon attitude."  </P> <P> Dieters are less likely to suffer that slip if good eating habits are  emphasized from the very beginning of a diet, says Ann Coulston, a research  dietitian at Stanford University Medical Center.  </P> <P> "The two diets I would consider the best," she says, "are Nutri/System and  Weight Watchers, because they provide participants with real foodstuffs rather  than liquid drinks. They're learning how to eat less, which is what they're  going to have to do for the rest of their lives. When you start out like that  from the beginning, you have more time to help them learn to change their  behaviors.  </P> <P> "All the liquid nutrition diets go to weight maintenance at the end of the  treatment, which includes real food. But by that time, a lot of the  participants have dropped out. In 8 to 12 weeks, they've been on liquid only  and they haven't learned to eat in a different manner. It's a difficult thing  to achieve, and you don't achieve it with one or two weeks of instruction and  practice."  </P> <P> Liquid diet programs such as Optifast "try to teach people about proper eating  when they're not eating," says Marston, "and that makes it more difficult to  retrain them."  </P> <P> Most diet professionals interviewed say the Weight Watchers program was the  least regimented and therefore probably the most effective of the diet plans.  It is also the oldest, having been in business since 1963. Apart from the  plan's longevity and history of success, Coulston says, Weight Watchers  "provides an option of several levels of caloric intake. They don't force  people into very low-calorie diets. They rely on a good balance of regular  foods."  </P> <P> Weight loss under the Weight Watchers plan is far more gradual than the quick  loss that accompanies liquid diets, which helps to establish better eating  habits, says Coulston. However, she adds, there are traps.  </P> <P> "When you use real foods (as part of a diet) and portion them out for yourself,  you can more readily go overboard and maybe take a double portion."  </P> <P> This also can be a drawback of the prepackaged food diets, says Nowlin, for it  is possible that once dieters stop eating the prepackaged food "and start  eating their own food, this is where the breakdown can occur."  </P> <P> Also, say diet experts, a plan that does not include exercise is doomed. All  the enrollment-style diets provide exercise recommendations but, Marston says,  actual exercise classes at the diet centers usually are not included "for  liability reasons."  </P> <P> It is exercise, says Grant Gwinup, a professor of endocrinology at UC Irvine,  that is one of the ultimate determiners of permanent weight loss.  </P> <P> "More important than all the diets," he says, "is the outflow of energy that  can only be accomplished by an aerobic exercise program. People are unlikely to  be successful unless they change their life style and become very physically  active. That's a fact of life."  </P> <P> Another fact of life in the diet business is show biz, for there is nothing  like a good testimonial to put the spurs to a few thousand more overweight  potential clients. Phones at Optifast centers around the country rang for days  after talk show host Oprah Winfrey revealed a new size-10 figure, courtesy, she  said, of Optifast. And celebrities such as Elliot Gould and Susan Saint James  tout other plans in television and print ads.  </P> <P> "A lot of the advertising is misleading," says David Heber, the director of the  Clinical Obesity Center at UCLA Medical Center. "They use people in the ads who  have lost 100 pounds or more. Then they'll say that weight loss will vary with  the individual, but I don't think that lets them off the hook."  </P> <P> There is also what Heber calls "a disturbing trend in some of the 'shopping  center' programs such as Jenny Craig and Nutri/System, the lay-directed  programs" to market ancillary items such as food scales, measuring cups and  books. Weight Watchers, he says, also markets a line of frozen foods and other  food products available in grocery stores.  </P> <P> Still, Marston says, "there has, in general, been a great improvement in the  dieting industry. It's gotten more and more sophisticated and has been  providing better service. Like every business, there's always that effort to  strike a balance between concern for the dieter and a need to make a profit,  but even physicians could be accused of that."  </P> <P> Is there an ideal diet? That question can start diet experts arguing like  economists. To Heber, a clinical program closely supervised by a physician,  tailored to each individual's specific diet needs, is the answer.  </P> <P> "The weight-loss population is so heterogeneous," he says, "and people have  such individual problems, that if they find the wrong program they'll keep  looking for another until they succeed. Anyone who has the ability to do so  should participate in a medically supervised program, one that offers a number  of pathways for people to take depending on how much they want to lose and the  time they want to spend, with maybe a program with strictly whole food or  strictly meal replacement or any combination of the two where you can adjust  the calorie intake weekly. But not everyone can afford such an ideal program."  </P> <P> To Gwinup, the ultimate diet is no diet at all. Like other experts, he  acknowledges that many dieters -- numerous but usually undocumented in surveys  -- simply decide to eat less, eat right and exercise more. And often they  succeed once and for all.  </P> <P> Unlike other dietitians and eating authorities, however, Gwinup says any  regimen that deviates from the less-food-more-exercise model is nothing more  than window dressing.  </P> <P> "There's no such thing as a magic diet," he says. "Any diet that's deficient in  calories will make you lose weight. But generally speaking, the closer the diet  is to real foods that you buy in the grocery store, the more likely you are to  be successful in the long run.  </P> <P> "Although every diet is advertised to make you lose weight, if you're not  prepared to put up with hunger, forget it. People have to be taught to stay  hungry. If you can say that you're hungry, you can say that you're burning body  fat. If people did that, they would not have to do anything else in the short  run. It's uncomfortable, and my patients hate me for it, but you have to be  realistic with them."  </P> <P> Mass-market diet plans, Gwinup says, "are selling their patients dreams. It  doesn't make sense, putting the patient on something very artificial. Forget  all that lead-in business with gimmicks and let's get to the real stuff. Real  food."  </P> <P> Such a self-administered diet should be most people's first choice, Marston  says.  </P> <P> "I would do it in steps. First, I would try to do it on my own, because I think  the more independent we are with these problems, the more effective it is. If  that didn't work, I'd go to the diet programs.  </P> <P> "If the problem is more severe and the person has had no success with those  common programs, they should go to the physician-monitored programs with more  intensive care. The care and cost levels escalate depending on the trouble  you're having. Most people will have to shop around."  </P> <P> After the diet drinks, however, and after the flavor enhancers and the  sugarless candy and the prepackaged food and the low-cal frozen entrees and the  nutritional supplements, one great dieting truth emerges: In the end, they're  all the same.  </P> <P> "What people do ultimately," Heber says, "is eat the same diet to maintain  their weight in the long term -- a low-fat, high-fiber diet. Ultimately,  everybody's on the same diet."  </P> <P> ENROLLMENT DIET PROGRAMS AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> HOW IT WORKS  </P> <P> NUTRI/SYSTEM  </P> <P> After an initial round of interviews, goal-setting and counseling, participants  are put on an 800- to 1,200-calorie-a-day diet consisting of prepackaged foods  that can be prepared at home. During weight loss, participants meet weekly with  counselors. Periodic meetings are offered after goal is reached.  </P> <P> EFFECTIVENESS  </P> <P> Average weight loss of 2 to 2 1/2 pounds a week.  </P> <P> COST  </P> <P> No definite figures available. Cost will rise with the amount of weight  participant needs to lose. Prices also vary from center to center because each  operation is an individually owned franchise with fees set by the owner.  Acknowledged to be generally higher in price than the similar Jenny Craig plan  (see below).  </P> <P> MEDICALLY SUPERVISED  </P> <P> No.  </P> <P> ADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Food is easy to obtain and prepare. The program also offers a guarantee that if  participants do not reach their goal weight on schedule, Nutri/System  facilities and services may be used free until the goal is reached.  </P> <P> DISADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Lack of exposure to actual grocery store food during weight-loss phase. Cost of  prepackaged food.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW IT WORKS  </P> <P> JENNY CRAIG  </P> <P> Similar to Nutri/System, with a program using prepackaged foods and daily  calorie totals of around 1,000. When dieters lose half the weight they intend,  they may gradually introduce their own food choices into the diet regimen.  Weekly counseling and behavior modification classes are held during the  weight-loss phase, and periodic follow-up visits to centers are encouraged  after the weight is lost. Strenuous exercise is discouraged during weight loss.  Specially constructed programs for adolescents also are offered.  </P> <P> EFFECTIVENESS  </P> <P> Average weight loss of approximately 1 1/2 to 2 pounds a week.  </P> <P> COST  </P> <P> Varies by region of the country, between $185 and $235 for use of facilities  and services. Prepackaged food is extra, costing between $65 and $70 a week.  Once goal weight is reached, participants pay a $99 fee to cover maintenance  program for one year.  </P> <P> MEDICALLY SUPERVISED  </P> <P> No.  </P> <P> ADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Prepackaged food eliminates temptation in grocery stores. Weight loss is  guaranteed by a set date or further use of the program and materials is free.  </P> <P> DISADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Cost of prepackaged food. Lack of exposure to grocery store food.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW IT WORKS  </P> <P> CAMBRIDGE PLAN  </P> <P> A liquid-diet regimen incorporating 800 or 420 calories a day in the form of  drinks, soups or dessert bars. The 800-calorie plan -- the regular program --  is based on three daily servings of the liquid formula, plus 400 calories of  prepared frozen foods and other lean recipes. The 420-calorie, or fast start,  program, incorporates only the liquid or bar diet and is designed for those  with relatively little weight to lose or who want to lose weight quickly as a  preparation for entering the regular program. The physician-monitored program  (monitoring is done by participants' personal physicians) uses only the liquid  portion of the regular program and a small amount of lean or snack foods. It is  recommended for those with 30 pounds or more to lose. Behavior modification  program is self-administered with workbook and audio cassettes. Meetings are  optional.  </P> <P> EFFECTIVENESS  </P> <P> Average weight loss of 2 to 5 pounds a week on the regular program, up to 15  pounds in two weeks on the fast start program and 16 to 20 pounds in four weeks  on the physician-monitored program.  </P> <P> COST  </P> <P> About $120 a month with an initial investment of about $62.  </P> <P> MEDICALLY SUPERVISED  </P> <P> No. Personal physician monitors liquid-only program.  </P> <P> ADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Quick weight loss. Lack of strict regimentation.  </P> <P> DISADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Primarily due to low calorie count: Occasional initial temporary side effects  such as headache, diarrhea, frequent urination, fatigue, cold intolerance, hair  loss, constipation, dry skin, nausea, decreased libido and dizziness. Problems  in adapting to solid food after liquid-only phase.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW IT WORKS  </P> <P> OPTIFAST  </P> <P> Participants drink only a nutritional supplement, which provides 420 calories a  day, for the first 12 weeks of the diet. In the following weeks, lean foods are  gradually reintroduced into the diet and participants attend nutrition and  behavior-modification classes (this phase lasts until goal weight is reached).  Continuing classes and group meetings are available, as well as counseling on  nutrition and exercise.  </P> <P> EFFECTIVENESS  </P> <P> An average weight loss of about 85 pounds by the end of the program  (participants must be at least 30% above ideal body weight to qualify for  acceptance into the program).  </P> <P> COST  </P> <P> Roughly between $3,000 and $5,000 for one year.  </P> <P> MEDICALLY SUPERVISED  </P> <P> Yes.  </P> <P> ADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Close medical supervision, fast weight loss, counseling.  </P> <P> DISADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Primarily due to low calorie count: Possible temporary hair loss, dry skin and  intolerance to cold during the liquid-only phase. Problems in adapting to real  food after liquid-only phase. High cost. Time commitment required.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW IT WORKS  </P> <P> DIET CENTER  </P> <P> A five-phase program, beginning with a two-day transition from present diet to  leaner foods and some dietary supplements in tablet form. The second phase,  which lasts until goal weight is reached, incorporates lean foods and  supplements totaling around 1,000 calories and requires daily supervision and  weigh-ins. The third, or stabilization, phase allows slightly higher calorie  totals and a wider variety of foods, without supplements, and lasts a maximum  of three weeks. The maintenance phase incorporates weekly consultations for one  year. Weekly classes in nutrition, behavior modification, exercise and stress  management are offered throughout the program.  </P> <P> EFFECTIVENESS  </P> <P> Average weight loss of between 17 and 25 pounds in six weeks. If 50 pounds or  more need to be lost, counselors consult with participants' personal physicians  at each 40-pound loss interval.  </P> <P> COST  </P> <P> For a loss of approximately 30 pounds (average time: 9 weeks), $700. This  includes the cost of the stabilization program after the weight loss and one  year of maintenance. Franchises are individually owned and prices will vary  accordingly.  </P> <P> MEDICALLY SUPERVISED  </P> <P> No.  </P> <P> ADVANTAGES  </P> <P> No prepackaged foods, fasting or liquid-only regimens. Foods used in program  are obtained by participants at the grocery store.  </P> <P> DISADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Daily commitment to weigh-ins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW IT WORKS  </P> <P> PRITIKIN PROGRAM  </P> <P> Not a diet plan per se, but a regimented program designed to reduce risks of  cardiovascular and other disease through diet and exercise. Residential  programs at the Pritikin Longevity Center in Santa Monica (other centers are  located in Florida and Pennsylvania) emphasize low-fat, high-carbohydrate  eating, medical evaluation, counseling and exercise. Participants live and eat  at the facility for 13 or 26 days. A six-week, non-residential program called  Pritikin P.M. also is offered (three evening classes a week for six weeks).  </P> <P> EFFECTIVENESS  </P> <P> Average weight loss during the 26-day program is 13 pounds. On Pritikin P.M., 8  to 12 pounds.  </P> <P> COST  </P> <P> The 26-day residential program costs $7,541; the 13-day program costs $4,456.  Pritikin P.M. is $1,075.  </P> <P> MEDICALLY SUPERVISED  </P> <P> Yes.  </P> <P> ADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Close medical supervision. Intensive education. Supportive atmosphere. May be  covered by medical insurance. May be tax deductible.  </P> <P> DISADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Highly regimented eating plan; limited foods. High cost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW IT WORKS  </P> <P> WEIGHT WATCHERS  </P> <P> Flexible program in which participants adhere to a prescribed, varied diet  based on the four food groups. Varied menus -- none below 1,000 calories a day  -- allow participants to use grocery store food or Weight Watchers frozen meals  (also available at grocery stores). Quantity and variety of food increased with  progress of diet. Weekly optional group meetings and individual counseling.  </P> <P> EFFECTIVENESS  </P> <P> Varies, but dieters who are faithful to the program can lose about 2 pounds a  week or more.  </P> <P> COST  </P> <P> Varies with individually owned franchises, averages about $7 to $8 a week.  One-time registration fee of $12 to $25, depending on franchise.  </P> <P> MEDICALLY SUPERVISED  </P> <P> No.  </P> <P> ADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Long record of success. Lack of rigidity. Extensive food choices. Group  support.  </P> <P> DISADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Slower rate of weight loss.  </P></p>

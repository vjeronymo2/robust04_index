Current GNMA Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA is a wholly-owned corporate instrumentality of the United States within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (``HUD''). Through its single-class CNMA I and GNMA II MBS programs, GNMA guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by private institutions and backed by pools of federally insured or guaranteed mortgage loans. The GNMA guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each issue of GNMA I and GNMA II MBS has a single class of securities with one coupon rate and scheduled maturity. Annual volume of new GNMA guaranteed single-class MBS over the past four years has been approximately $65 billion in fiscal 1990, $63 billion in fiscal 1991, $72 billion in fiscal 1992, and $143 billion in fiscal 1993. Over 97% of this volume represents pools of single-family mortgage loans and, of this, over 86% are GNMA I MBS. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately 95% (approximately $850 billion in par value and $450 million of remaining principal balance) of all GNMA I and GNMA II MBS are held on deposit at PTC as of December 31, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Proposed GNMA REMIC Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA is now establishing a GNMA REMIC program under which GNMA will guarantee multi-class securities issued by REMIC trusts. The GNMA REMIC securities will be issued through single-purpose trusts created by GNMA-approved sponsors which will assemble GNMA-guaranteed single-class mortgage-backed securities to constitute the corpus of the REMIC trust. The sponsors will be private-sector entities such as investment bankers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal National Mortgage Association (``FNMA'') and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``FHLMC'') currently issue REMIC securities that are backed by GNMA MBS, in addition to a substantial volume of REMIC issues backed by their own collateral. Upon issuance, the General Counsel of HUD will render an opinion that GNMA's obligations under the GNMA guarantee of its REMIC securities will constitute absolute and unconditional general obligations of the United States, for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The authorizing Federal statute <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  provides that the GNMA REMIC program be implemented by GNMA's publication of a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and that GNMA subsequently publish regulations within twelve months of the publication of the initial notice, based upon the comments received and the experience of GNMA in carrying out the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 306(g) of the National Housing Act, 12 USC 1721(g), as amended by &sect;3004 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 339. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA will implement its REMIC program in two stages. During the initial stage, GNMA will restrict participation in the REMIC program to a small number of participants (consisting of sponsors, co-sponsors, trustees, trust counsel, and accounting firms) and a limited number of REMIC issuances. The initial stage will commence upon the closing of the first transaction, after publication of the notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and is expected to last several months, during which time GNMA will establish standard documentation, and guidelines and procedures applicable to the full implementation of the REMIC program. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA has not yet announced the date on which the initial stage of the REMIC program will commence, but anticipates that it will occur in the spring of 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA has retained Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Company as its financial advisor and Hunton &amp; Williams as its legal advisor in implementing the REMIC program, and is currently engaged in approving the initial program participants. After the initial stage, GNMA anticipates that it will publish a REMIC Guide containing program requirements and standardized documents as it does for its MBS programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While GNMA has not yet determined the characteristics of the GNMA REMIC tranches, for processing purposes it is assumed that the GNMA REMIC classes will have the same basic processing requirements as the VA REMICs, which PTC has had on deposit for approximately the last two years. It is assumed that, as in the case with the VA REMIC securities, all classes of the GNMA REMIC securities except the residual class will be established and maintained in book-entry form through the facilities of PTC, although holders will have the right to request certificated securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

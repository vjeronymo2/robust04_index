			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`Starting from Scratch' in the Eradication of </F> Coca Farms"]    [Text] The president's initiative to negotiate an extension  of the so-far strict and rigid deadlines the U.S. Embassy has  imposed on the elimination of excess coca farms deserves full  support from the entire country.    In Chapare, thousands of peasant families cultivate coca  leaves for meager earnings because the price paid for their  product cannot make them rich. The attractive profits remain in  the hands of Bolivian, Colombian, and U.S. drug traffickers,  especially U.S. traffickers, who distribute the product among  consumers.    According to official announcements, there are still 1,900  hectares of coca farms to be eradicated -- of the 4,500 the  previous government had promised to eradicate by 31 March -- and  it is obvious that in the week before the deadline's expiration  it will be impossible to fulfill the promise. Unless there is an  intention to provoke a serious confrontation much stronger and  more tragic than the ones that already have occurred in the  region.    This is the most serious and sensitive problem the nation is  now confronting. If the Chapare boiler goes off now, the other  conflicts underlying Bolivian society will immediately worsen,  provoking violence and instability. To avoid this, it is  necessary to make all efforts and to be extremely prudent and  patriotic.    If violence prevails in Chapare, there will be no  capitalization, participation, educational reform, or the other  proposals. There will be no more democracy, economic growth, and  inflation control. The country and all its social sectors would  lose their course, and our homeland would become the appropriate  stage for the situation that is desired by imperialists and by  those who advocate military action: a low-intensity war, rapid  deployment tactics, the use of new conventional weapons, and  clean, smart bombs.    Whoever thinks we are exaggerating should review the course  of world events to convince himself. Peaceful and prosperous  societies have suddenly been taken over by violence and,  obviously, by foreign troops. Peace is for society what freedom  is for men: It is not appreciated until it is lost, but while  we enjoy it, we do not realize that we are making use of an  essential value.    President Sanchez de Lozada's timely appeal to the U.S.  Government, before Vice President Gore, awakened a clumsy  reaction by Mr. Richard Bowers, which Bolivians have unanimously  repudiated. He did not use the language of an ambassador, or  even of a junior diplomat. It is hoped that his superiors in the  State Department will reprimand him, because our Foreign  Ministry has never dared do it, because of our longstanding  weakness.    The appropriate thing to do is to outline our position  directly to Washington, where Vice President Victor Hugo  Cardenas might go in search of justice. This is what Chayanta  chief Tomas Catari did 200 years ago when he made a long  pilgrimage on foot to Buenos Aires to complain to the viceroy  about the abuses of Governor Joaquin Alos.</p>

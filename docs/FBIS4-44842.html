			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Paul Croize: "Forerunner to European Space </F> Vehicles: A Model Capsule Built To Withstand Atmospheric Heat"]    [Text] Construction of the Community's Ariane  super-launcher continues, as does the preparation of the first  vehicles destined to service the international orbital station,  R-Alpha, from the year 2001.    On its very first flight, scheduled for the Spring of 1996,  the ESA's [European Space Agency's] future Ariane 5 rocket  should be launching an automated space capsule foreshadowing  those which Europe intends to use at the beginning of the next  century to put its astronauts into space. Presented yesterday  by representatives of Aerospatiale's "Space Defense" division,  this project, called "ARD" [Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator],  will be a very important technological step towards European  manned flight autonomy. It will in fact make it possible to  test the various types of material which could be used to make  the future capsule's heat shield, as well as the guidance  systems which will give considerably improved landing accuracy  compared to earlier space vehicles of this type.  <H5>  Distance From Ground is 1,200 Kilometers </H5>   While Ariane 5 is slowly taking shape at Les Mureaux, near  Paris, where Aerospatiale is starting to build the first flight  model (the first one should take off in the Fall of 1995), the  engineers feel that the future of this heavy launch vehicle must  be prepared for right now, particularly with respect to the  manned flights which its reliability rating, "boosted" to more  than 99 percent (whereas current versions of the European  launcher only achieve 95 percent), will render possible.    It is in order to prepare for a new activity, as far as  Europe is concerned, that Aerospatiale has just launched the ARD  project: costing in the order of 200 million French francs [Fr],  it will consist of the production, in just over two years, of an  Apollo-type space capsule weighing 2,800 kilograms. "It is our  understanding of the technologies connected with ballistic  reentry and our skills in the technical management of large  space systems which will allow us to carry out this program in  such a short time," explains Bernard Humbert, who is in charge  of "manned flight" activities at Aerospatiale.    Of course, this ARD capsule will only be an unmanned  prototype. However, its already respectable size will bring it  very close to the future "CTV" [Crew Transport Vehicle] which  the ESA is thinking of using from 2001 onwards to service the  international "R-Alpha" orbiting station: with a diameter of 2.8  meters and a height of 2.4 meters, the ARD will be roughly as  big as the Soyuz reentry module.    Developed with the participation of the Franco-British  company Matra Marconi Space with respect to the functional  electronics, and of German and Italian manufacturers  (essentially Dasa and Alenia), the ARD capsule will make a  suborbital flight lasting around 90 minutes. Although  relatively short, it will nonetheless allow Europe to test all  of the phases of a genuine mission to service an orbiting  station: after taking off from the Kourou space center in  Guyana, carried high in the nose cone of Ariane 5 (above a  telecommunications satellite which the rocket will put into  geostationary orbit during the same flight), the capsule will be  released into space over the southern tip of Africa, immediately  after extinction of the engine of its launch vehicle's central  stage. Propelled by the thrust effect from the latter, it will  climb to about 1,200 kilometers from ground level, far higher  than the 350 to 400 kilometers currently achieved by the Russian  Soyuz capsules when servicing the Mir station. The ARD will  then fall towards the Pacific Ocean, where it will splash down  some distance from the Chilean coast.  <H5>  Protective Shield </H5>   For the engineers, the main lessons should be learned during  the fifteen or so minutes when the capsule is reentering the  atmosphere. The main aims of the flight will then be twofold,  concerning on the one hand the way the capsule itself "holds  up," and on the other hand the accuracy achieved in guiding it  towards the scheduled splashdown point.    As far as its ruggedness is concerned, it is planned to  carry  out a detailed analysis of the aerothermal phenomena which occur  during the crucial phase of reentry into the upper layers of the  atmosphere, as well as of the effects of the notorious radio  "blackout" to which the vehicle, which will have an aluminum  structure, will be subject, and, of course, the effectiveness of  the protective shield, which will be made of a  silicone-impregnated silica fabric, while the capsule's rear  cone will be made of cork powder and phenolic resin.    With respect to the guidance system, it will be necessary to  evaluate the behavior of the reentry propulsion system (derived  from Ariane 5's attitude control system) as well as the  effectiveness of the descent system used: it will consist of  three parachutes measuring 16 meters in diameter which should be  steered so as to produce a landing accurate to around one  kilometer. This would be a distinct improvement over what has  been done to date: while the return of the Apollos which  conquered the Moon was achieved within a radius in the order of  20 kilometers, the Soyuz cannot be guided with greater accuracy  than around 10 kilometers...    If the operation is fully successful, a big step will have  been taken towards the setting up of a real manned space  transport system. On the condition, however, that the member  countries of the ESA will first agree to supply the Fr20 billion  or so which its realization will require. This program will in  fact have to be the subject of a meeting of the European  government ministers responsible for matters involving space,  which is planned for the end of next year.</p>

Jiang Zemin had a 40-minute meeting with a delegation from  the Kingdom of Cambodia led by First Prime Minister Norodom  Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen this afternoon at  the Great Hall of the People. The two sides exchanged views on  Sino-Cambodian relations and other issues.    On behalf of the Cambodian Government, Ranariddh thanked  China for its aid to Cambodia during its transitional period and  for its reconstruction.    Jiang Zemin said: The visit by the two prime ministers soon  after its inauguration shows that the Government of the Kingdom  of Cambodia attaches great importance to its friendly and  cooperative relations with China. The visit, a great event in  bilateral relations, will promote mutual understanding and  friendship and further advance friendship and cooperation  between the two countries in various fields.    Ranariddh said that his delegation held fruitful talks with  Premier Li Peng yesterday, and that he believed the visit would  further consolidate and improve Sino-Cambodian relations.    Jiang said: In 1993, Cambodia underwent an enormous change  of historical significance: After more than 20 years of war,  the country has now entered a new period of peaceful  reconstruction. This change not only reflected the Cambodian  people's common will but also was in line with the major trend  of peace and development in the region. The Chinese Government  sincerely hopes that the Cambodian Government will cherish the  hard-won peace, further advance the process of national  reconciliation, and mobilize all the Cambodian people to build  their country.    Ranariddh said: Cambodia has now entered a new period of  national unity. Although facing difficulties, Cambodians are  optimistic about their future. Under the leadership of King  Sihanouk, they will build Cambodia into a country of  independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and prosperity.    Jiang Zemin asked the two prime ministers to relay his best  wishes and heartfelt regards to King Sihanouk and the queen. He  said: King Sihanouk is the beloved leader of the Cambodian  people and respected friend of the Chinese people, and he has  made indelible contributions to Cambodia's independence.    Wang Wenyuan, vice chairman of the Jiusan Society, was  present at the meeting.    Earlier today the Cambodian guests laid a wreath at the  Monument to the People's Heroes and paid their respects to the  remains of Chairman Mao Zedong. They also visited the Xuehua  Electronics Group and the Beijing shirt mill. They are  scheduled to visit Hainan Province tomorrow.</p>

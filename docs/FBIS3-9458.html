Klara Stejskalova reports:    [Stejskalova] The Czech foreign affairs minister welcomed,  in  the beginning, the visit of the Netherlands royal couple to our  country. The two ministers then agreed that mutual relations  between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were good. That  is why questions of multilateral cooperation were the main topic  of their conversation.    They talked, above all, about the European Union [EU], which  the Czech Republic intends to join in the future. According to  the two foreign ministers, the EU is currently undergoing  dramatic moments, as confirmed by the current crisis on the  question of the lower blocking minority by percent required by  Britain. The emergent crisis only confirms the need for  discussion on the future philosophy of the EU.    The agenda of the Dutch-Czech talks also included questions  on the Partnership for Peace program and overall security in  Europe.</p>

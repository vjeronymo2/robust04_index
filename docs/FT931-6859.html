			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Indians buy E German mill DALMIA, one of India's largest private companies, yesterday moved closer to establishing a bigger foothold in Europe following its purchase of a cellulose and paper mill in the eastern German state of Thuringia. The purchase of Zellstoff-und Papierfabrik Rosenthal, which was arranged by the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of east German industry, coincided with the visit by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to south-east Asia. The enterprise, which has an annual production capacity of 150,000 tons of sulphite and cellulose, and 6,000 tons for paper production, last year achieved a turnover of DM153m (Pounds 64.8m). Traditionally, its turnover was earned on the domestic market, but following a restructuring by the Treuhand, which cost DM46m, sales to west European countries now account for 90 per cent of turnover. Dalmia, whose activities range from cigarette, cement and chemical production to the textile and paper industry, has agreed to invest DM70m in the company immediately, and a further DM150m in the next two years. It will also guarantee 405 of the 550 jobs for three years. Dalmia's total turnover last year was Dollars 725m, Dollars 500m earned through exports. Meanwhile, the Treuhand earlier this week announced it had reprivatised, or sold back to the original owners, more than 5,750 enterprises from 13,183 restitution claims.</p>

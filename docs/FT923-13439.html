			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / People: WPP selects new chairman WPP, Martin Sorrell's marketing services group, is elevating David Ogilvy, its 81-year-old chairman, to the title of President Emeritus. He will also continue as a consultant to the group. His move will take effect after a shareholders' meeting on August 5, called to consider a refinancing proposal which will, bankers believe, either save or break the company which ran into difficulties after borrowing heavily to buy companies - such as Ogilvy and Mather. Ogilvy's replacement as chairman is to be Gordon Stevens (right), who is a mere 66. He is described as an energetic chap, known for making witty asides during agm addresses - something WPP shareholders will appreciate, no doubt. He joined Unilever, the consumer products group, as a trainee in 1949, and became a director in 1976 when he was 'toilet preparations co-ordinator'. In 1978 he took charge of the marketing division, moving in 1983 to head Unilever's North American business, succeeding Michael Angus (as he then was) who had pulled that business out of losses. He retired in 1988 and since then has become non-executive chairman of Scholl, the footcare company. ***** Christopher Harrison and Andrew Hartley will be relinquishing seats on the board of James Wilkes, the engineering company, following the sale of the group's promotional products division last week for Pounds 11.4m. Some of Wilkes's shareholders were told by advisers at the time of February's failed bid for Wilkes by Petrocon that if the group maintained its independence the two directors would leave the board. The two directors' service contracts are being terminated conditional on the completion of the disposal. ***** John Hayden, deputy chairman of PROPERTY PARTNERSHIPS, is retiring. ***** John Cohlan has resigned from MOUNTLEIGH. ***** Michael Klanfar has resigned from ENTERPRISE COMPUTER HOLDINGS. ***** Bruce Ralph has resigned as chief executive of DOWTY but remains with the company and will undertake special duties; John Benson, director of human resources, has also resigned but will continue as a consultant. ***** Eric Coward has retired from SUN ALLIANCE. ***** John Lamberson has taken early retirement from WILLIS CORROON GROUP.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: O&amp;Y to reveal asset sales this week OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments, the beleaguered international developer, said it plans to announce the sale of assets later this week as part of its debt restructuring programme, AP-DJ reports from Toronto. The company said it continues to seek additional cash from its bankers as part of the restructuring. 'O&amp;Y also is pursuing other alternatives to address its liquidity problems, including the sale of assets, some of which will be announced later this week,' the company said. An O&amp;Y spokesman declined to elaborate. The company also said it missed making an interest payment of about CDollars 17m (USDollars 14.2m) due yesterday.

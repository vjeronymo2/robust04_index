			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: Victory over IRS brings relief to derivatives players LEGAL victory last week for the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the US government-backed mortgage provider, in a tax case brought by the Internal Revenue Service, has drawn a sigh of relief from derivatives users and practitioners in the US. Companies using derivatives have been growing increasingly nervous about the tax treatment of gains and losses made on hedges, following the landmark Arkansas Best decision in the Supreme Court in 1988. Although the Arkansas Best case did not involve derivatives, it had significant implications for the use of derivatives for hedging. But the potential applications of Arkansas Best have only become clear in recent years, as the IRS has started to take an increasingly aggressive stance on the use of derivatives. Part of the problem is there is no specific legislation in the US on the tax treatment of derivatives transactions used for hedging purposes. The fear among companies has been that they would be taxed for capital gains on any profits made from hedges, but would not be able to write off losses. While the interpretation of the Arkansas Best ruling was that hedging would be favourably viewed if related to inventory, the definition of inventory proved elusive. In February, the US Department of Agriculture was told by the IRS that its hedging programme for US farmers, which allows them to buy options to ensure a set price for the sale of commodities, was under scrutiny. Fannie Mae is not the only institution to have its tax returns challenged; other large companies, such as General Motors, have also run into problems over the use of derivatives. According to experts involved in the case, it involved a use of derivatives for hedging, which is common practice at Fannie Mae and other companies. During the period 1983 to 1985, Fannie Mae frequently hedged the funding of its purchases of mortgage assets in advance, to ensure that the market did not move against it after a purchase had been agreed but before Fannie Mae had issued bonds to fund the purchase. The hedge was achieved either by using the US Treasuries market or the futures or options markets. This is known as an anticipatory liability hedge, and is widely used, for slightly different purposes, by many companies. Since the future income stream from the mortgage assets would be ordinary income, the hedge would not work if any gains or losses were treated as capital gains or losses. Although the decision in favour of Fannie Mae was widely welcomed by derivatives professionals, many experts believe there is still a need for further clarification to end the uncertainty, which they believe is deterring many US companies from taking advantage of derivative markets to offset risk. Many companies have been using the over-the-counter swaps market, rather than hedging using exchange-traded futures and options, in the hope these would be more favourably viewed by the IRS, although this matter is also unclear. The Arkansas Best Coalition, a lobby group made up of corporate users, market practitioners and futures exchanges, has been working on draft legislation, and believes there are openings in the current tax bill. 'The court decided (in favour of Fannie Mae) on fairly narrow grounds,' limiting the scope for applying the decision to other cases, according to Mr Bob Mackay, director of the centre for the study of futures and options markets at Virginia Tech. However, the fact that the court rejected the IRS argument that short-term hedges are not allowed under the definition of Arkansas Best is a blow for the IRS. According to Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton, the US law firm, the case means that 'Congress won't have to find substantial revenues to pay for legislation mandating ordinary treatment for hedge gains and losses. Such legislation also is no longer subject to the accusation of being a 'corporate giveaway'.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams is to visit Spain's  Basque region next week.    Mr. Adams, who arrives in Spain on Monday [9 May] for a  three-day visit, is to have talks with Herri Batasuna (HB), the  political arm of the separatist group ETA [Basque Fatherland and  Liberty].    One of the Basque region's MEPs [member of European  Parliament] was in Belfast two months ago when he met Sinn Fein  members.    A Sinn Fein spokesman confirmed tonight: "He is going to  talk  about the peace process and to explain to people there what is  happening in Ireland. He has accepted a number of invitations."    Mr. Adams, who was in America earlier this year, is now  fighting through the courts seeking to have an exclusion order  banning him from Britain lifted.    Basque media and HB members said the visit was an historic  encounter between two independent movements.    "Relations between the Irish and Basque people and between  Sinn Fein and Batasuna is based on mutual solidarity for the  fight that both peoples carry out for self-determination and  independence."</p>

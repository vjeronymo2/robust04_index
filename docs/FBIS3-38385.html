Knowing that they have little  chance of receiving asylum here in Sweden, these refugees have  been trying to find asylum elsewhere before being sent back  home. Radio Sweden's Christopher Folick reports from the Danish  capital:    [Folick] In the past few months, some 500 Kosovo Albanians  from Sweden have been turned back from Denmark's borders with  Germany, mainly from Danish ferries arriving in north German  ports and the Germans last week began gradually imposing a  system of fines of up to 5,000 marks on transport companies  caught carrying illegal refugees into Germany from Denmark on  trains, ferries, and buses. The new reinforced checks will  mainly focus on ferries from Sweden and to Germany, as the  refugees tend to mainly use them to get to Denmark en route for  Germany. [passage omitted]    The tidying up of Danish controls stems from Germany's  recent  restriction and means that extra Danish border police have been  put in mainly at the ports of Helsingor, Copenhagen, and  Frederikshavn, the main entry points into Denmark for ferry  traffic from neighboring Sweden and Norway, as well as at exit  ports to neighboring Germany. The Danish move means primarily  an intensification of spot checks on all incoming travelers from  Sweden and Norway and will last for an initial three-months  period whereupon further consultations with Germany will be  carried out and the situation reviewed.

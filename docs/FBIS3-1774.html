The first cases of arsenic poisoning were discovered in 1991  in one of Guizhou's Prefectures inhabited by ethnic minority  people, and so far 1,908 victims have been diagnosed in the  province.    During the past three years the Guizhou Provincial  Government  has allocated 288,000 yuan to treat 1,696 such patients free of  charge. Most of them are recovering well.    This year the government will set aside another 500,000 yuan  for its treatment program.    Relevant government departments have also made comprehensive  surveys of the coal mines to close down those producing coal  with too high an arsenic content, to prevent any further arsenic  poisoning.</p>

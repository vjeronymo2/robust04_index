			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Philadelphia merger would consolidate options trading THE unsolicited bid for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (Phlx) launched by the Chicago Board Options Exchange would consolidate options trading in the US and put the Chicago exchange back into the growing business of foreign currency options trading. The deal, if successful, would also broaden the largest US option exchange's reach into the regional stock dealing business. CBOE members trade options, not stocks, on the exchange's Chicago floor, but the CBOE does a quietly lucrative business clearing stock trades through its regional electronic subsidiary, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange. The terms of the CBOE's merger proposal, made last week, were not disclosed, but published reports value the offer at Dollars 60m. The Philadelphia exchange has 505 members. The fifth-largest stock exchange in the US, the Phlx has had a record year. Although the bulk of its business is stock and equity options trading, about 10 per cent of its turnover is foreign currency options. The disarray in the ERM has brought big trades to the Phlx, particularly to its French franc and D-Mark options pits. The CBOE briefly traded foreign currency options in the 1980s, but ceded victory to the Phlx in 1987, passing its open accounts to Philadelphia in a good-natured surrender. Since then the Phlx's foreign exchange dealings have grown dramatically. Mr Nicholas Giordano, Phlx president, said his board would consider the CBOE's proposal. The Phlx rejected a similar takeover bid from the American Stock Exchange in 1990. Mr John Davidson, for seven years the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's clearing house, is to become manager of Morgan Stanley's US derivatives operations on December 6. In his new job he will oversee clearing for Morgan Stanley's on and off-exchange derivatives trading, and will maintain a 'continuing interest' in the discussions over a clearing house for off-exchange derivatives.</p>

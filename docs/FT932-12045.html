			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton in drive to prove Nafta free trade deal is still alive THE Clinton administration is making a concerted drive to prove that the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada is not dead. Mr Leon Panetta, the White House budget director, threw the administration and the Democratic congressional leadership into turmoil earlier this week with the warning that Nafta simply could not pass Congress. The loud criticisms of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas populist, were making the task much more difficult, he said. Since then, administration officials have gone out of their way to reaffirm their commitment to the treaty. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, insisted that the administration intended to complete this summer the side agreements on the environment, labour standards and import surges which President Bill Clinton has asked for. 'We intend to take Nafta to the Congress and we intend to meet the January 1, 1994 deadline for the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement,' Mr Kantor said. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, acknowledged that winning congressional approval would be difficult, but said Nafta's passage was important for US relations with the whole of Latin America, and not just Mexico. 'It's going to be a tough time passing it. It will not be easy, but I am optimistic that we will get there, and this year,' he said. Congressional leaders acknowledge that Mr Panetta's vote count is correct, but say that, with the side agreements still to be negotiated, it is scarcely surprising that Nafta does not yet have the necessary support. Foreign governments and Washington trade analysts have at times been perplexed over who in fact controls US trade policy, and there have been reports of rifts between Mr Bentsen, with a broadly free trade approach, and Mr Kantor, whose style has been more confrontational. Mr Bentsen, however, insisted that trade policy was Mr Kantor's responsibility.</p>

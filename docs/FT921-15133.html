			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Increased loss for British Bloodstock Increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 412,000 were announced by the British Bloodstock Agency for the half year to September 30 compared with a loss last time of Pounds 309,000. The USM-quoted wholesaling, agricultural materials and livestock group, had achieved a significant reduction in overhead expenses Mr Michael Wates, the chairman, said, but the deepening of the recession in bloodstock markets had outweighed the savings. He added that the sale of Thormanby Stud in December and two smaller properties had produced more than Pounds 500,000 which would reduce borrowings and interest charges. Although gross revenue fell to Pounds 8.52m (Pounds 14.6m) turnover moved just ahead to Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.85m). The loss per share increased to 10.1p (8.1p) and again there is no dividend.</p>

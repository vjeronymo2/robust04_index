Because there  are only a few of them, they control prices. The influence of  these economic groups on the lives of ordinary citizens goes  from the cement used for refurbishing a house to the cigarette a  person smokes with a cup of coffee, and encompasses a spectrum  from razor blades to sugar-cane firewater. Is this just  fantasy? Not at all. The above assertion is based on facts.    The Votorantim and Joao Santos groups, for example, account  for 70 percent of cement sales -- worth nearly $2.6 billion  annually -- on the Brazilian market. Souza Cruz and Philip  Morris control 98 percent of the cigarette sales while Gilette  controls 81 percent of razor blade sales. Believe it or not,  three groups -- Pirassunga 51, Velho Barreiro, and Pitu --  control at least 51 percent of the sugar-cane firewater market.    Luciano Coutinho is an economist from the State University  of  Campinas (Unicamp) who was hired by the government to coordinate  a study on the competitiveness of Brazilian manufacturing  companies. The study was recently delivered to the government.  Coutinho says: The Brazilian economy comprises mainly  oligopolists. A few companies and brand names control the  market, leaving only a small segment for their competitors.    Even in sectors where there are hundreds of manufacturers,  only a few are able to set prices. For instance, there are  between 1,200 and 1,500 textile manufacturers, but their prices  are closely tied to those set by half a dozen large companies  such as Hering, Pettenati, and Alcatez. Although there are many  brands of jeans, Vicunha and Alpargatas-Santista control 72  percent of the supply of denim, so they control garment  manufacturers too.    The same happens in the area of fibers and synthetic yarns.  Rhodia, Fibra (Vicunha Group), and Celibras control 75 percent.  To give an idea of how prices are pushed up, one only needs to  look at a survey conducted by the Industrial Marketing and  Studies Institute (IEMI). While garment prices increased by  81.23 percent this year, textile prices increased by 101.64  percent.    When it comes to electronic equipment, Brazilians are  controlled by oligopolists. Just four manufacturers -- Sharp,  Philips, Philco, and Semp-Toshiba -- supply 69 percent of all  television sets at a total annual cost of nearly $1.1 billion.  Domestic manufacturers do not have much a choice because only  RTC-Sharp and Philips supply television tubes. Except when  produced by autonomous manufacturers, all ice cream comes from  two companies: Kibon, which accounts for 80 percent of the  sales; while Nestle accounts for the rest.    The Philip Morris group owns Kibon, which operates only in  oligopolistic sectors. In addition to its undisputed leadership  in ice cream, Philip Morris also controls 70 percent of the sale  of powdered soft drinks through its brand name Tang, and 20  percent of cigarette sales through its brand names Marlboro,  Galaxy, and L&amp;M. Notwithstanding all this, Clodoaldo  Celentano  -- financial director of the Philip Morris group -- contends  that there is "a tough competition" in each of these three  sectors.    Celentano said: Some oligopolists may reach price agreements  under certain circumstances, but this is not our case.  Cigarettes, for instance, face tough competition because the  government is a majority partner in this sector. The government  is interested in maintaining its tax revenues, which account for  73 percent of the price of each pack of cigarettes.    Few companies are as closely identified with the word  oligopoly as Gessy Lever. Although its president, Umberto  Aprile, recently told O GLOBO he did not understand the meaning  of the word oligopoly, Gessy Lever -- a subsidiary of the  British-Dutch group Unilever, one of the world's largest groups  -- plays a significant role in various concentrated sectors of  the economy. Among others, it accounts for 72 percent of the  powdered soap market. It also accounts for nearly 30 percent of  margarine sales.    Gessy Lever, which tomorrow will have to justify its price  increases in URV's [Real Value Units] before the Finance  Ministry, is not willing to leave any room for its competitors.  In addition to controlling 75 percent of the powder soap  market, it has just invested $56 million in a recently opened  factory in Minas Gerais State, which will increase its annual  production to 550,000 tons -- well above the annual domestic  consumption of 420,000 tons.    Other companies operate in concentrated sectors of the  economy, but they are less noticeable and are thus able to keep  a lower profile. This is the case of companies manufacturing  fiber-cement roofing sheets and water tanks. Brasilit and  Eternit control virtually half of this sector, and their  factories have been consolidated in the past two years.  Furthermore, the French group Saint Gobain, the owner of  Brasilit, owns 17 percent of Eternit shares with voting rights.  Additionally, these two companies own Sama, the only producer  of fiber-cement in the country.    Carlos William de M. Ferreira, assistant to the chairman of  Brasilit, said: This does not mean that there is a concentration  of economic power in this sector.    A price survey conducted by the Sao Paulo State Association  of Civil Construction Industries shows that this concentration  in no way benefits its customers. Of a list of 65 construction  materials, fiber-cement roofing sheets registered the highest  increase in URV's in February -- 38.15 percent -- compared to  the average increase during the last fourth-month period of 1993.</p>

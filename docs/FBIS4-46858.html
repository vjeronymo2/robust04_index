			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marina Lebedeva report: "Refugee Problem Being Solved, But </F> They Will Have To Suffer for a Long Time Yet"]    [Text] There are over half a million refugees registered  in Russia. It is expected that in the next few years the number  of migrants could exceed 6 million. Will Russia be able to give  them the necessary economic aid and moral support?    Today the reality is such that refugees are in a parlous  situation. For example, 6,000 people who suffered during the  events in Sumgait and Baku have been temporarily accommodated in  boardinghouses, hostels, and hotels in Moscow and Moscow Oblast  for five years now. They are now threatened with eviction onto  the street. The joint-stock companies which have become the  buildings' owners have applied for court orders. Court rulings  have already been made on some applications. Other refugees  expect the same fate without any hope of defense.    This was discussed at a news conference at the  Russian-American Press Center.    For five years Moscow has been paying for refugees to live  in  hotels, and at current prices this is a fantastic amount of  money. But it turns out that the only alternative to this is  evicting people from the city. Apartments are found for  arriving workers under the quota system, for errant former first  secretaries of some krays and oblasts, and for former people's  deputies of the Soviet Union for whom the people simply cannot  nurture warm feelings, but there is only one sentence for  refugees -- eviction. On 18 May at Odintsovskiy Rayon Court in  Moscow Oblast it was decided to evict the Bagdasarov family --  consisting of a woman who has undergone a serious operation and  her two daughters. The same fate was suffered by the Smirnov  family from Kaliningrad near Moscow. The court decreed:  eviction without alternative housing.    Actions to evict refugees without giving them alternative  housing are a violation of human rights, the Russian Federation  Constitution, and international acts signed by Russia, the  conference participants noted. The Moscow and Federal Migration  Services, which are supposed to safeguard refugees' interests,  are siding with those who are evicting them and are submitting  to the courts evidence of refugees' refusal to travel to some  other regions. But at the conference the refugees produced a  whole file of documents -- refusals to accept them in the cities  and villages to which the Migration Service had sent them.  Meanwhile the Moscow Government, which has many of its own  unsolved problems, including a waiting list of thousands of  Muscovite families needing housing, is taking its own measures  to get rid of the refugees. Specifically, the opinion is being  circulated that Moscow is full of refugees who are creating a  criminogenic situation in the city. But, as was noted at the  conference, this information is clearly an exaggeration.  According to Ministry of Internal Affairs data the resettlement  of refugees in Moscow is 2.2 times less than throughout the  country as a whole. Nevertheless, confrontation between the  refugees and the Moscow authorities is intensifying, and not in  favor of the refugees.    Against the background of such a sorry picture the  appearance  in Russia of refugees capable of defending themselves in some  way arouses special interest.    On 2 June the first congress of organizations and  enterprises  of refugees and displaced persons opens in Moscow. It is being  held by Russia's "Compatriots" foundation.    Prudently excluding the capital and its oblast from its  field  of activity, the foundation has for several years been helping  to create compact refugee settlements and provide work for them  in other Russian regions. The "Compatriots" foundation now  comprises 700 small resettlement enterprises and 32 branches in  which refugees and settlers work as well. The foundation gives  interest-free credit over five to seven years to those prepared  to engage in enterprise for themselves. They themselves must  earn money for housing. And the refugees do earn it. In  Belgorod Oblast they assembled and sold 43 buses, and with the  money earned they constructed 19 cottages. In Lipetsk they  produce nails, in Pereslavl-Zalesskiy they produce ceramic  crockery.    Foundation President Boris Sergeyev believes that the most  important thing for the refugees is to integrate themselves and  not to be parasites. This is why, the foundation's president  explained, refugees make up no more than 51 percent of the work  force at their enterprises, the remainder being locals. As far  as I understood Sergeyev, the regions must realize that the  "bundle of belongings is not the only thing a refugee brings  with him to his new country of residence: Einstein was a  refugee." This is precisely the inscription on one of the  posters of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>

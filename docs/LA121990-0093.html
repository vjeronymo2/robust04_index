			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANKERS OPPOSE LEVY TO BUILD UP INSURANCE FUND  </P> <P> Banking industry authorities Tuesday criticized a proposal for a one-time  assessment of as much as $25 billion to shore up the sagging deposit insurance  fund, arguing that many banks can't afford it, that it will worsen a national  credit crunch and that bank customers may pick up a disproportionate share of  tab through higher fees.  </P> <P> Bankers interviewed agreed that there is a clear need to bolster the fund,  protect taxpayers and halt the slip in public confidence plaguing banks. But  they reacted unfavorably to a proposal outlined Monday by Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman that banks be assessed a special  fee equal to $1 for every $100 in deposits.  </P> <P> "A 1% assessment on deposits is an enormous amount of money. I don't see any  way you could do it in a one-time shot," said former Comptroller of the  Currency C. Todd Conover, who now is a banking consultant with the KPMG Peat  Marwick accounting firm.  </P> <P> The $25 billion is so large that it will far exceed what the nation's banks are  expected to earn this year. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has said the  banking industry is healthy enough to bail itself out, as has Seidman. That  point was challenged by Brookings Institution economist Robert Litan, who said  it would result in additional bank failures costing the bank insurance fund $8  billion.  </P> <P> But some banking authorities questioned whether the industry can provide such a  large infusion at a time when profits are sliding and when capital -- the  financial cushion banks maintain to protect against losses -- is so hard to  come by. Investors are already shunning banks, and Seidman's proposal, analysts  said, would undoubtedly make them even more wary.  </P> <P> "I think the critical question is whether the banking system can withstand that  kind of depletion at a time when they are trying to build capital and are under  regulatory pressures," said Joe Belew, president of the Consumer Bankers Assn.  </P> <P> Seidman said regulators are discussing with banks details about the huge  financial contributions, which are needed to protect the fund that insures bank  deposits up to $100,000. Regulators and lawmakers are eager to spare taxpayers  from any bailout like the one they are already paying for in the nation's  savings and loan debacle.  </P> <P> In return for the assessment, Seidman said, banks should be granted expanded  powers, including the right to diversify into other businesses and to open  branches across state lines without setting up separate banks. In addition,  banks should be allowed to count the money they pay to the fund as capital  regulations require them to maintain.  </P> <P> Some industry executives criticized the linking of the assessment with expanded  powers, saying the Administration is effectively putting a price tag on new  powers that should be granted to banks regardless. They also criticized the  proposal that the money paid to the fund be counted as capital, calling it an  accounting gimmick.  </P> <P> Independent banks were among the most critical of the proposal, saying the  "carrot" offered banks as an incentive to pay the assessment is designed almost  exclusively for large banks that are in a position to take advantage of the  expanded powers.  </P> <P> "There is almost nothing in this for smaller banks except reduced  profitability," said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the  Independent Bankers Assn. of America.  </P> <P> Banking officials also said the proposal will probably meet heavy resistance in  areas such as the Northeast, where banks can least afford to pay the fee.  </P> <P> "No doubt it will be a factor. New England banks are under a tremendous amount  of strain in comparison to California banks," said Stan Cardenas, senior deputy  superintendent for the California Banking Department.  </P> <P> A number of bankers said they were reserving judgment, noting that the proposal  is one of several possibilities being discussed. Executives said they favor  bolstering the fund over time instead of a one-time assessment.  </P> <P> The American Bankers Assn., the industry's main trade group, had little  specific to say about the proposal because officials there are still studying  it.  </P> <P> "It is going to be a burden, no question about it. It's a burden we are going  to have to shoulder to make sure the fund gets on a solid footing," spokesman  Mark Burneko said.  </P> <P> Bankers also said the proposal would drain too much from the banking system and  appears to conflict with efforts by others in the Administration to ease the  nation's credit crunch. One banker noted, for example, that an assessment of  $20 billion to $25 billion effectively takes some $400 billion to $500 billion  out of the system that would be available for lending. That assumes that for  every $1 in capital that a bank maintains it loans $20.  </P> <P> Separately, regulators recommended Tuesday that troubled banks pay a higher  rate for deposit insurance than healthy ones. Banks now pay a flat rate.  </P></p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Bonds: First offer backed by aircraft leases Lehman Brothers yesterday launched the first global offering of notes backed by aircraft leases, a Dollars 1bn nine-tranche deal for Aircraft Lease Portfolio Securitisation. The issuer is a special purpose vehicle which has bought the leases from GPA Group, now owned by General Electric of the US. The servicer of the leases is GE Capital Aviation Services. Only a small number of companies, including GPA and Northwest Airlines, have so far securitised aircraft leases, but the drying-up of tax-driven lease financing in the Japanese market has made securitisation appear more attractive. The Royal Bank of Scotland tapped the sterling sector with a structured floating-rate note via SG Warburg Securities. The deal is structured in such a way that interest will not accrue on days when six-month Libor exceeds 15 per cent; in return for that risk, investors receive a coupon of 6-month Libor plus 40 basis points. The deal met with good demand from banks, corporates, insurance companies and money market funds, said an official at the lead manager. Colombia's Banco Ganadero made its eurobond market debut with Dollars 125m of 9 3/4 per cent five-year bonds. Priced at a yield of 290 basis points over the US Treasury note, the deal saw good interest from international institutions, lead manager Citibank said. In Japan, another emerging-market borrower, Mexico's Pemex, announced it would postpone a planned Y20bn Samurai bond issue after market participants felt the pricing was out of line with market conditions. The issue, with Daiwa Securities as lead manager, was to be made up of 5.35 per cent five-year bonds priced at par. 'The pricing was way too tight,' said an official at a Japanese house, which, along with other underwriters, had declined Daiwa's invitation into the deal. Elsewhere, Bayerische Landesbank issued Dollars 200m of 7 per cent four-year bonds via Swiss Bank Corporation. Yielding 12 1/2 basis points over the US Treasury note at its 99.94 re-offer price, some dealers said the pricing was too tight, but the lead manager reported demand from Swiss, German and Benelux investors.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL  </P> <P> Thank you for publishing "No Peace for the Peacemakers" by Hillel Bardin, Op-Ed  Page, Sept. 16.  </P> <P> The original Zionist myth was "There are no Palestinians" period. Recently the  Israeli government replaced the original with one that states: "There are no  Palestinians who are willing to talk peace."  </P> <P> Bardin's column went a long way to shatter this myth. He eloquently presented  the case of only five Palestinians. Like them, there are thousands who have  been jailed, expelled, or even killed by the Israelis.  </P> <P> We not only have a moral stake in the peace between Israel and the  Palestinians, we also have a huge financial stake. Our moral obligation is to  make sure that our money is not used to silence the peacemakers.  </P> <P> SAMI M. ODEH  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SPARSE AUDIENCE GREETS DUTCH ENSEMBLE QUINK  </P> <P> Never heard of Quink, the vocal ensemble that sang Friday night in Orange Coast  College's Robert B. Moore Theatre? If the meager numbers that attended the  concert are any indication, you are not alone.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Quink is worth hearing. The five-member a cappella group from the  Netherlands -- in existence since 1978, but not heard in this country until  1985 -- offers a strikingly translucent blend that its members apply to styles  ranging from Renaissance madrigals to contemporary arrangements.  </P> <P> Homogeneous transparency can illuminate much in itself. In this program, the  interplay of Hindemith's contrapuntal lines in "Vom Hausregiment," from his  "Funf Lieder nach alten Texten," emerged with shimmering clarity. Equally  successful were 16th-Century composer John Farmer's simple madrigal "Fair  Phyllis" and the imploring sections of Benjamin Britten's 'Hymn to St.  Cecelia," the former bathed in a pure innocence, the latter clothed in  reverence.  </P> <P> In the course of the evening, however, transparency and attractive tone too  often settled into a pleasant blandness. Though bolstered by flawless  intonation and tasteful application of vibrato, Hindemith's "Frauenklage" -- a  lady's lament over the imminent, inevitable parting from her love -- cried out  for a shift to darker tone, while emphasis on polished simplicity glossed over  the playfulness of Thomas Morley's "Now Is the Month of Maying."  </P> <P> Quink's anomalous name was invented by its members -- sopranos Machteld van  Woerden and Marjolein Koetsier, contralto Corrie Pronk, tenor Harry van Berne,  and bass Kees-Jan de Koning -- as a composite of various Dutch words including  kwinkslag (humor) and kwetteren (to chirp). If Friday's accent was on the  latter, it was not without its lighter side. A trio of animal-inspired  selections by contemporary Catalan composer Manuel Oltra -- "Bestiari" --  twinkled with good-natured humor aided by clipped, synchronized accent in  "Rata-Pinyada" (The Bat) and strident-edged trumpeting in "Elefant." Quink  closed with the same type of silliness that often peppers appearances of the  better-known Kings Singers: Paul Patterson's "Spare Parts," a bluesy take-off  on the Frankenstein story, and "Sag mir nicht 'adieu,' " an imitation of a  1930s recording complete with static and skips.  </P></p>

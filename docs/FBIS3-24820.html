			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The rebels have struck again, but it was only this  morning that the news was reported. On 28 January, they  attacked a convoy from Dirkou, which was under military escort,  killing two people, wounding another, and making away with a  quantity of items. Here is Mounkali Agadem with a report.    [Begin recording] As has been the practice for some time  now,  the 28 January convoy was escorted by soldiers. Everything was  proceeding smoothly until the convoy reached some 30 km from  Agadez, where the attack took place. The assailants attacked  right in the middle of the convoy, while the military vehicle at  the rear had stopped a few kilometers away to guard a vehicle  that had broken down. The rebels therefore had more than enough  time to commit their act.    After unsuccessfully ordering a truck to stop, they shot the  driver, killing him instantly. A woman, who was on the same  truck, was burned to death. The third occupant had his ear shot  off. As if that were not enough, the assailants set fire to the  vehicle, causing extensive damage to the goods, which were  estimated at more than 2 million CFA francs by the driver's  mate, who had his ear shot off. The assailants then proceeded  to attack the other vehicles, from which they took television  sets, food items, tape recorders, and other goods. They loaded  the goods onto their three vehicles before bolting away.    The soldiers, after they were alerted, pursued the  assailants, but they have not found them. According to their  commanding officer, the search is continuing.    It should be noted that this is the third rebel attack in  less than a month in Agadez Department, where a lot is expected  from the outcome of the next meeting between the government and  the rebels. We were not able to go and see for ourselves the  extent of the damage on the spot, where apparently the vehicles  were still burning even until yesterday. We were, of course,  unable to go because we did not have any military escort because  all trips in that region can only be done under escort. [end  recording]</p>

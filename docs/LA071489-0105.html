			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Hilton Hotels Corp.: The Beverly Hills-based hotel operator reported  second-quarter profit of $42 million, up 3% over a year ago. Revenue totaled  $265 million, up 6%. The results reflected a 14% gain in income due to improved  results at facilities in New York, Chicago and Hawaii, which more than offset  start-up losses from two full-service hotels and one all-suite hotel. Gaming  income also edged up 2% to $36.8 million.  </P></p>

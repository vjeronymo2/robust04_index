			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / SIB agrees to relax rules on unit trusts THE Securities and Investments Board has bowed to pressure from investment managers and substantially relaxed earlier proposals for rules which will govern unit trusts specialising in futures and options. Final rules published yesterday lay down less stringent investment guidelines than draft regulations published in December. The SIB said it did not expect further amendments to the proposals before they passed into law later this year. Yesterday's document follows earlier proposals by classifying futures and options funds as either low-risk funds or higher-risk 'geared' funds. However, the investment regulations relating to geared funds have been substantially relaxed. The SIB had proposed to limit the amount a geared fund could invest in futures and options to 10 per cent of its total assets. That limit has now been raised to 20 per cent of total assets, with the rest of the fund invested in cash or highly liquid securities. In addition, the earlier rules proposed limiting to 4 per cent of total assets the amount a geared fund could invest in any one category of futures and options - equity, currency or commodity derivatives, for example. This strict capping of exposure to any one market has been dropped. Instead, investment managers will be obliged to 'exercise reasonable prudence in relation to the diversification' of investment. This does not apply to derivative products, such as futures contracts based on an index of stocks, which are 'by their nature already broadly diversified'. This opens the way to funds based on index futures such as the FT-SE 100 index future quoted on the London International Financial Futures Exchange. The changes have pleased many investment managers, but prompted bitter complaints from others in the unit trust industry who fear that more risky futures and options funds will give the industry a bad name. Even firms enthusiastic about the new regulations said they hoped that the rules governing marketing would be strict. Members of the International Stock Exchange voted at an extraordinary general meeting yesterday to defer elections to the exchange's council until the autumn, allowing a reorganisation of the council membership to take place. They also voted to allow the council to transfer the business and assets of the London Traded Options Market, owned by the exchange, to the London International Financial Futures Exchange. The two markets are due to merge later this year.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: Seeds of economic discontent Sir, Official figures for inflation often do not seem to accord with experience. I offer an interesting example of the discrepancy, namely the price of packets of seeds. I do not throw the old packets away and have them going back up to 10 years, to 1983. Prices that I have looked at have gone up at the rate of about 10 per cent a year over this period and at a very regular progression. As an example, I would give figures for cabbage seed (winnigstadt). The cost in pence per packet were as follows (some years missing) from 1983: 27, -, 33, 36, 39, 43, -, 51, -,  -, 69. If you plot these figures on a log-scale, you will find a beautiful straight line, as though it were company policy to increase prices by 10 per cent a year automatically. A packet of this seed will cost Pounds 1 in 1997. In the course of this exercise, I bought a packet of polyanthus seeds this year at Pounds 2.10. Inside there were 20 seeds which I weighed at 21mg, or about 1mg per seed. This works out at just less than Pounds 3,000 per ounce, which is very well up on gold. More examples of particular price inflation would be interesting. Robert Harkness, emeritus professor, University College, Gower Street, London WC1</p>

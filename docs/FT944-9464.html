			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (6): Dealers become more selective - The number of City dealing rooms is shrinking City dealing rooms are shrinking in size, according to the 1994 UK Dealing Room Survey, which reports a drop of 4,365 dealing positions compared with 1990, a contraction of 14 per cent. There are now also fewer dealing rooms overall - 1,533 compared with 1,712 in 1990. This contraction in the market, coupled with a more cautious attitude towards expenditure, means that dealing-room suppliers are having to work harder for their money. The increasing use of standard hardware, such as personal computers and Unix systems, has resulted, too, in suppliers not being able to differentiate themselves by the computers they sell. Instead, they must try to stand out by being better at fusing the many information products which dealers use into an integrated system. This is a complex process because different news and information feeds use different communications protocols, and display data in different ways. Important suppliers in the market for equipping dealing rooms include Reuters (which owns Teknekron), Dow Jones Telerate, BT, Micrognosis, Capiti, ACT Financial, and some of the world's largest computer companies. Janet Wood, a spokesperson for Telerate believes that companies which have expertise in communications technology (such as information providers like Telerate and Reuters) have an advantage in this market, though BT's name also appears on a lot of dealing-room bids. Customers are more interested in the information they get on their screens than on the technology they use to view it, says Ms Wood. This helps to explain why Reuters - the leading information vendor in this market - is also the dominant supplier of data management/dealing systems (with its Triarch and Teknekron systems). Nearly 200 Teknekron dealer positions, based on Unix workstations from Sun Microsystems, were recently installed at Japanese company, Nomura's UK subsidiary. Peter Green, Nomura UK's front-office systems director, says they provide data from Reuters, Telerate and Knight-Ridder direct to the desktop in a consolidated screen environment. Instead of the different services appearing in separate windows on the screen, they look as though they are all coming from the same place. Nomura's new system also provides real-time spreadsheet capabilities. This means that as data comes in from information feeds, it can automatically update positions (for example the amount of a particular share/currency held) recorded in an Applix RealTime spreadsheet (sold by US-based Applix). Mr Green says: 'By the end of the year, we should have another 100 users on the Teknekron system. We're moving away from a large host-based dealing system, to true client-server computing where processing is distributed.' The company plans to expand its dealing operations in a number of areas. Nomura is investing more than Pounds 10m in its new dealing systems. According to the dealing-room survey, financial institutions will invest more than Pounds 1bn in new dealing room technology over the next 12 months. In addition to capital expenditure, they will spend a further Pounds 1.7bn in ongoing costs, including subscriptions to online information services and telecommunications costs for dealing. Financial online services will account for an average 65 per cent of this figure - costing about Pounds 40,000 per dealer per year. More than 75 per cent of UK financial institutions use a Reuters information service, according to the same survey, with its nearest competitors being Dow Jones/Telerate, Bloomberg and Knight-Ridder Financial. But Stephen Kimsey, author of the survey, says: 'Although annual dealing-room spending on information services will increase, companies are cutting back on the number to which they subscribe. This now stands at around three per dealing room, compared with an average of four in 1993.' This is partly because companies are cutting back on 'me too' services, and partly because some of the leading information providers have added value to their services - making rival services less necessary. Improvements include making services accessible through Windows-based interfaces (such as those available from AT Financial Information), adding more historical data, or providing information on extra markets (such as the Japanese equity market). In addition, Reuters has introduced a business television service and plans to transmit company annual general meetings live to dealers' desks. But even without TV on the desktop, dealers can still suffer from information overload. They have so much information crammed on their screens that they are starting to want higher and higher resolution screens, says David Purcell of Microvitec, a leading supplier of specialist monitors for dealing rooms - 'we are starting to see demand for CRT (cathode ray tube) screens with a resolution of 800 dots across and 600 dots down and for screens with diagonal screen width of 15in. or 17in. The problem is that the bigger the monitors, the more space they take up on dealers' desks.' One alternative is to use LCD (liquid crystal display) screens, such as those used in portable computers. These are much flatter and give off less heat. Sharp Electronics says its LCD screens will be used in a big dealing room system, where instead of several overlapping windows of information being displayed on a single screen, each window will be displayed on a separate LCD screen. Meanwhile, the systems used by settlement staff in the back office are also changing - 'the back-office market is developing, with many people downsizing from mid-range systems, such as IBM's AS/400,' says Mr Kimsey. Most are planning to move to Unix or PC-based systems linked to the dealing room system. 'There is a quiet revolution going on. For years, the City wasted a lot of money on technology. Now people ask: 'Do we really need it?'. They are more interested in functionality than technicality,' he says.</p>

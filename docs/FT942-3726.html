			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Talks on trade 'not complete' The achievement of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks 'is still far from complete' and European Union leaders must treat its ratification with urgency, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, said in Dublin yesterday. Mr Sutherland told a meeting of the EU economic and social committee that Europe had 'a responsibility to give leadership on ratification' by the 125 states that signed the Gatt agreements in Marrakesh in April. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) which will replace Gatt, is due to be established by January 1, 1995 under the auspices of the Uruguay Round agreement. It will have stronger powers than Gatt to enforce the liberalised trade arrangements which now extend to agri-culture, services, textiles and intellectual property rights. The Uruguay Round agreements 'will reward those who have embraced competition as an ally with improved opportunities to compete in the fastest-growing markets in the world - the upper-income developing countries'.</p>

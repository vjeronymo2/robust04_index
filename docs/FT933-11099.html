			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Ginsburg on course THE US Senate judiciary committee yesterday unanimously approved the nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to be the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court and sent it to the Senate for final action next week, Reuter reports from Washington. The vote was 18-0 to approve Judge Ginsburg, a 60-year-old federal appeals judge from the District of Columbia. The full Senate is expected to confirm her before the start of the congressional summer recess on August 6 as the nation's 107th Supreme Court justice and its second woman member. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joined the court in 1981. Judge Ginsburg was nominated on June 14 by President Bill Clinton to replace Justice Byron White, who retired at the end of the court's last term. The high court's next term begins on October 4.</p>

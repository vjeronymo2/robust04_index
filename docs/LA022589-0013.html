			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES'  </P> <P> I have heard several of my fellow Muslims, both here in the U.S. and all around  the world, call for the death of Rushdie. They have claimed that this book is  blasphemous and that it has insulted the feelings and beliefs of all Muslims.  While I do agree that the book is an attack upon my religion and that I do  consider the book an insult to myself and to all Muslims, I still, however,  consider the life of a human being infinitely more valuable than an insult.  </P> <P> After all, with time, and through the deep love of our religion, injured  feelings can be healed and insults forgotten. But a human life can never be  brought back!  </P> <P> HAMID TELAGAHANI  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

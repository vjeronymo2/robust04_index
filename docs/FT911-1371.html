			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Economics: German data will be scrutinised THERE are no economic statistics scheduled for release in the UK or France but plenty this week in Germany and the US. With the D-Mark so weak on foreign exchanges, and anxiety growing about the shape of the post-unification economy, the releases will be scrutinised for signs that the German decline has been exaggerated. This might prompt sentiment that the D-Mark is oversold. Improved weather in March could boost the production data scheduled for release this week. For eastern Germany, data is thin on the ground but anecdotal evidence suggests further output falls this year. Analysts expect foreign manufacturing orders to have revived after the dollar's recovery. Orders offer good clues to future growth in gross national product, which is expected to slow to 1.9 per cent this year from 4.5 per cent in 1990. Unemployment data should continue to show that joblessness is falling in the west of the country, but not as fast in April as in March. The current account, meanwhile, was in deficit for the second month running in February, partly as a result of Germany's contributions to the allied effort in the Gulf War. With domestic demand strengthening, Germany's merchandise trade position has been deteriorating, with export volumes lower than a year ago and imports markedly higher. In the US the focus will be on the Treasury's quarterly refunding. Though the outlook for US bonds is favourable - with last week's cut in the discount rates and evidence of subdued inflation likely in producer prices figures on Friday - there are fears that the Treasury will eventually have to raise more funds because of the recession. This is making the market anxious about supply and the likely absence of Japanese buyers. Other notable events and statistics, with median market forecasts from MMS international, the financial research company, include: Today: US, wholesale trade balance for March, start of Treasury Quarterly refunding, consumer credit (down Dollars 1bn), three-year note auction, senate banking committee hearing. Tomorrow: Canada, housing starts (110,000). US, 10-year note auction. France, Victory Day, all markets closed. Thursday: US, 30-year bond auction, weekly initial claims and weekly money supply data. All markets in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Austria and Switzerland closed for Ascension Day. Canada, new housing price index. Australia, April employment (down 20,000) and unemployment rate (9.4 per cent). Friday: US, producer prices index (0.1 per cent), excluding food and energy (0.2 per cent). Canada, employment growth (flat), unemployment rate (10.6 per cent). During the week: Germany, April unemployment (west down 15,000, east up 40,000), vacancies, unadjusted for April, industrial production and manufacturing orders for March, current account balance (down DM3.5bn) for March.</p>

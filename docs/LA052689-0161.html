			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ENIGMATIC 'EVENING WITH BOULEZ AND ZAPPA'  </P> <P> The world will little note nor long remember what was said during "An Evening  With Pierre Boulez and Frank Zappa" at UCLA. Should it care, the affair -- part  of the ongoing Festival Boulez -- was videotaped.  </P> <P> "Let's think of this as an aleatoric entertainment event," Zappa urged the  capacity crowd in Schoenberg Hall Auditorium at one point Tuesday. On those  terms, as a muted triumph of personality over content, the evening was not  without simple -- and simplistic -- charms.  </P> <P> Revelations in the dialogue, moderated by David Raksin, were few. The  conversation ranged from Boulez's earnest description of how he tunes  individual chords in Webern's orchestral music to Zappa's equally serious  explanation of where he found his theory that AIDS is the result of a CIA  conspiracy.  </P> <P> Boulez in particular proved unexpectedly reticent. Asked for his feelings about  the work of some contemporaries such as Schnittke, Lutoslawski and Gubaidulina,  Boulez said: "I prefer to keep my opinions to myself." Asked what he attempts  to bring to listeners in a performance, he responded: "I cannot tell you. I  don't know what it is that I convey."  </P> <P> He did confide his impression of minimalism: "If I may be nasty, I think it is  minimal." Zappa, for his part, claimed never to have heard a piece by Philip  Glass, or indeed, to listen to anything recreationally except a Boulez  recording of Webern.  </P> <P> Zappa's comments covered mostly familiar ground, from his dissatisfaction with  the Music Business and his low regard for rock journalism -- "Compared to  Rolling Stone, there's a wealth of information (in Hustler)" -- to the futility  of composing in the United States today and his frustrations with performance  standards -- The most important goal in his life? "I'm still waiting for an  accurate performance."  </P> <P> Regarding future projects, Zappa discussed the "world orchestra" of ethnic and  electronic instruments which he has proposed to the authorities planning the  1992 world's fair in Seville, saying he will be leaving for Spain soon to  discuss an offer to finance the project.  </P> <P> Boulez said his most important project was a series of concerts of music by  young composers, to be given in Paris in the fall. His name has come up as a  possible candidate for some of the currently vacant music director positions,  but in a press-only tune-up before the evening's program officially began, he  reiterated his disinclination for such work: "I don't want to be in charge of  an orchestra anymore. I want to concentrate on composition and research."  </P> <P> The liveliest confrontations of the evening came not between the two erstwhile  iconoclasts, but between Raksin and the audience. Ushers collected written  questions from the audience, which Raksin read to Zappa and Boulez, with much  derisive commentary on the intelligence and relevance of the questions.  </P> <P> That produced heckling from the audience, including the suggestion that their  questions compared favorably to those of Raksin, who saw fit to ask Zappa and  Boulez for their comments on the songs of Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern. There  were also frequent shouted demands from the audience for more sound  amplification.  </P> <P> One suspects that John Cage -- who was the butt of considerable affectionately  contemptuous kidding -- would have reveled in the contradictory,  theater-of-the-absurd evening.  </P></p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / MPs demand copier leases change THE CAMPAIGN to extend greater protection to customers of controversial photocopying leasing contracts will be stepped up tomorrow when a group of MPs meets Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, to press for changes in the law. The photocopying business has been the target of widespread allegations about high-pressure sales techniques which have led many businesses and organisations to sign onerous and unfair leasing contracts. The Office of Fair Trading announced in February, in response to more than 3,000 complaints of malpractice and contract abuse, that it was launching an inquiry into the hiring and leasing of office equipment. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has also just submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry the initial conclusions of a review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. He is believed to have told the department that, among other measures to improve consumer law, there is a case for widening the legal protection available on contracts involving private individuals to small businesses and other incorporated bodies. Changes could mean that bodies such as schools, hospitals, clubs and charities - all of which have alleged being tricked into expensive contracts  -would win a two-week 'cooling off' period after signing up. The present Pounds 15,000 ceiling on such contracts could also be raised, possibly as high as Pounds 50,000. Companies which break the law can have their consumer credit licences revoked by the OFT, which has warned that it will do so if it finds evidence. Members of the Campaign to Clean Up Photocopier Contracts, which has gathered more than 3,300 complaints from customers - particularly those taking out cost-per-copy-agreements - will also attend tomorrow's meeting, which is being led by Mr Nick Hawkins, Conservative MP for Blackpool South. A spokesman said the campaign was still receiving complaints and would continue to press ministers for action. Some of the leading photocopier leasing companies have responded to recent criticism by establishing a trade association to promote good practice.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHANG OUSTS LECONTE FROM GRAND SLAM CUP;  </P> <P> TENNIS: THE TEEN-AGER FROM PLACENTIA REACHES THE SEMIFINALS OF THE MUNICH  TOURNAMENT BY BEATING THE FRENCHMAN IN TWO SETS.  </P> <P> U.S. Davis Cup hero Michael Chang became the first player to reach the  semifinals of the $6-million Grand Slam Cup when he beat Frenchman Henri  Leconte today, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.  </P> <P> Chang, the 1989 French Open champion from Placentia, Calif., kept his  concentration despite Leconte's constant clowning and will play either Pete  Sampras or Yugoslavia's Goran Ivanisevic in Saturday's semifinals.  </P> <P> The victory guaranteed Chang, who beat world No. 1 Stefan Edberg in the opening  round, at least $450,000 in prize money.  </P> <P> The left-handed Leconte, who broke Chang as he served for the first set but  lost the tiebreaker, 7-3, took home $300,000.  </P> <P> Leconte, who had to pull out of last month's Paris indoor tournament with a  knee injury, had more and more trouble with his serve as the match progressed.  </P> <P> The 30th-ranked Frenchman, who beat seventh seed Thomas Muster of Austria in  the first round, broke Chang to go 2-1 up in the second set.  </P> <P> But he served two double faults to help Chang pull even in the next game and  collapsed to the floor in disgust after giving away the third break point.  </P> <P> Broken again in the sixth game, again with a pair of double faults along the  way, Leconte was unable to get back into the match.  </P> <P> Chang, the Placentia teen-ager who helped the United States win the Davis Cup  final against Australia nearly two weeks ago, chased every ball across the  carpet court and maintained the upper hand.  </P> <P> He got to match point on serve and then had the satisfaction of seeing the  tiring Leconte put a service return into the net.  </P></p>

Sharpening Political System Controversies  (Part Two of Two) -- The Drafting Committee Passes the Two Ch'a  [Ch'a Chi-ming and Cha Liang-yung] Plan, for Which Lu Ping and  Li Hou Claim Not To Have Cast Supporting Votes    Two months later, the [Basic Law] Drafting Committee met in  full session at the Huayuan Hotel in Guangzhou, with its theme  being to examine and vote on all drafts of the Special Group, in  preparation for the Second Advisory Draft of the Basic Law. It  was decided at this meeting that, in addition to voting one by  one on the terms proposed by the Special Group, the Drafting  Committee would first obtain the stipulated number of joint  signatures, and then might set forth additional draft  resolutions beyond the Special Group's drafts.    Prior to this meeting, I had suggested to Ji Pengfei the  possibility of holding a meeting of the Drafting Committee's  party members, to reach a party consensus. Ji Pengfei had  barely heard my suggestion when he told Li Hou and Lu Ping to  individually "notify" the Drafting Committee's party members.    The balloting showed an unexpected result, in that Cha  Chi-min's [2686 3444 3046] motion was passed. Cha Chi-min's plan  added four terms to Cha Liang-yung's plan for "examining"  procedures for general elections by the whole people for the  Fourth Session of the Chief Executive and the Fifth Session of  LEGCO. These four terms were: 1) it must be approved by the  majority of the legislators; 2) it must be endorsed by the Chief  Executive; 3) it must be approved by the NPC; 4) it must be  endorsed by a vote of over 30 percent of qualified voters.    While Cha Chi-min's motion had certainly not aroused  attention in advance, it was close in thinking to that of  certain Drafting Committee members on the mainland and in the  Hong Kong superstructure at the time, so that its passage was  not unexpected. But when the public controversy over Cha  Liang-yung's plan arose, with many holding it to be too  "conservative," the two "Cha" plans were combined, turning out  to be even more "conservative," which was certainly not expected  by the Chinese leadership.    After the Cha plan was passed, Lu Ping told Li Chu-ming  [2621  2629 6900] that he had not guessed that Cha Chi-min's revised  plan could win the two-thirds support, and that he had not voted  in support of it. Li Hou also told reporters that he had  abstained from voting.    At this plenary session of the drafting committee, certain  proposals of the special group were not approved, such as the  motion on the SAR Government's fiscal policy, which did not win  a two-thirds vote of the committee members in attendance, so was  returned to the special group for redeliberation, and the  proposals by committee members, such as T'an Yao-tsung [6223  5069 1350], on labor welfare, which were also not passed.    It was guessed that the fiscal policy motion failed because  it was voted against not only by several Hong Kong Drafting  Committee members with close connections to the British Hong  Kong government, but also by mainland committee members. The  original plan of this draft had shown concern that the British  Hong Kong government, in its 12 years of rule before its  withdrawal, might change its past fiscal policy, by changing its  tax rates and overreaching itself to build more public  facilities, which would add more profitable  construction-contract opportunities for British firms, while  putting a heavier burden on Hongkongers. While the Basic Law  could not interfere in fiscal policy during the British Hong  Kong administration's tenure, it could still have a political  impact to restrict it somewhat.    As to this provision, not only had the British Government  called for its revision more than once through diplomatic means,  but certain drafting committee members from Hong Kong with close  connections to the British Hong Kong government had also  repeatedly proposed amendments to it in special group meetings.  Certain mainland drafting committee members also dissented  with it, their main concern being that it would tie the future  SAR government's "hands," keeping them from acting in line with  future realities. So while its failure was unexpected, it was  also understandable.    But the failure to pass of the labor welfare motion was very  hard to understand. As the Hong Kong Drafting Committee  members were weighted toward industrial and business circles,  their votes against it were understandable. But as the  mainland drafting committee members were mostly Communist Party  members, their voting not in favor of it, but rather against it  or abstaining, was unexpected.    The substance of this motion was the right of Hong Kong  workers to strike, as well as matters such as collective  bargaining between labor and capital, and the establishment of a  central accumulation fund. As the PRC Constitution did not have  a provision on strikes, some advocated that Hong Kong should not  either. But I supported the "left faction" labor union view,  advocating that the Basic Law should list the right of Hong Kong  workers to strike.    Prior to this plenary session of the drafting committee, I  had discussed the matter with Ji Pengfei, noting that Hong Kong  was a capitalist world where strikes were a very important  weapon in struggles between labor and capital. While strikes  are a method of last resort that should not be applied lightly,  we should not deprive workers of this important right.    Collective bargainaing is also very important, as it is the  only way to enable workers to rely on their united strength to  obtain successful terms in negotiations with capital. Moreover,  as most Hong Kong workers were not organized, with "left,"  "center," and "right" labor unions decentralizing working class  unity, collective bargaining laws and regulations as grounds for  negotiating with capital could relatively increase  organizational might. Of course, in resolving labor-capital  disputes, it is also necessary to adhere to the principle of  [protecting] the rights of both labor and capital, by not  overdoing things.    As Hong Kong's labor welfare was insubstantial, with no  retirement safeguards, the central accumulation fund was a  legitimate demand for resolving the matter, so that we should  have supported it in principle. While a central accumulation  fund would certainly be hard to implement, it could be  accomplished through flexible means. Unless the Basic Law  included this principle, it would be impossible to safeguard  workers' elementary rights, with the decreased worker support  for the Basic Law being unfavorable to Hong Kong's social  stability and prosperity. While Ji Pengfei had endorsed all of  this at the time, the motion still was not approved.    After this meeting, Ji Pengfei called a meeting of the  party's directors, deputy directors, secretaries, and deputy  secretaries to discuss the meeting, where all were essentially  satisfied with the outcome of the balloting, as most of the  motions that should have passed did, while the ones that we  hoped would not basically did not. While Cha Chi-min's bill was  unexpected, it was certainly not the final plan, so could still  be amended through certain procedures. As to the fiscal  policy, Li Hou and others took the initiative to suggest  striving to amend certain words, and then asking for another  vote. As to the labor welfare proposal, I asked Ji Pengfei, Li  Hou and others to work on persuading mainland committee members  to support it in future voting, especially emphasizing that "the  Basic Law must not disappoint Hong Kong workers," which Ji  Pengfei agreed to.    But after the 4 June incident, at the final Plenary Session  of the Drafting Committee, when the Basic Law draft was voted  on, the item on "collective bargaining" was still not adopted.  As I had already been declared retired and transferred back to  the mainland at the time, I was no longer taking part in the  internal meetings on Hong Kong and Macao hosted by the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office, so had no way of knowing really why  this item was not adopted.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / House of Fraser nears bank deal on restructuring: Fayeds' debt plan cuts number of creditors and simplifies corporate structure HOUSE of Fraser Holdings, the stores group controlled by the Fayed brothers, is close to agreement with its bank creditors on a financial restructuring package which involves the renewal of some borrowing facilities for five years and a reduction in the number of its bank creditors from around 20 to seven. One of the group's bankers said yesterday that they had also secured agreement from the company, which owns Harrods department store, to a simplification of its corporate structure. House of Fraser Holdings owns a string of subsidiary companies. The group's bankers want some of these to be merged, so that it is easier for bankers to assess the group's financial performance. Bankers have also asked the Fayeds to appoint independent non-executive directors to the board of their UK holding company. However, they are unsure whether the brothers will agree. The group has been in talks with its banks for weeks about how to repay a Pounds 190m term loan, due for repayment this year. A banker said yesterday that all the bank creditors had given 'oral agreement' to a deal which has three main elements: Around Pounds 60m of the loan will be repaid with part of the Pounds 156m proceeds of the group's sale of its 10.6 per cent holding in Sears, owner of Selfridges. A group of seven banks is renewing its part of the Pounds 190m loan and providing an additional Pounds 40m for five years. Around 13 banks, owed around Pounds 100m, are being repaid in full. A banker said the group of seven core banks was in effect putting up the Pounds 40m to buy out the loans provided by the other 13. All seven are participating in this new loan. The seven banks, which will continue to have an exposure to House of Fraser, are Midland, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and National Westminster of the UK, Deutsche and Dresdner of Germany, and Credit Suisse of Switzerland. Those not renewing their lines are believed to include six Japanese banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Sumitomo, Industrial Bank of Japan and Tokai. The original Pounds 190m facility was arranged in 1988 by Midland's merchant banking arm, Samuel Montagu, and had a five-year maturity. House of Fraser's complicated corporate structure is illustrated by the way in which these funds were divided between two parts of the group. The facility was available for use by two companies, House of Fraser plc and House of Fraser Property Investment plc. The banks which are being bought out had provided loans to House of Fraser plc alone. The other banks, those that will remain as lenders, provided loans to both House of Fraser plc and House of Fraser Property Investment. Both are subsidiaries of House of Fraser Holdings plc, which is in turn owned by Alfayed Investment and Trust SA, a company incorporated in Liechtenstein. The registered and beneficial owners of the whole of the issued share capital of the Liechtenstein company are Mr Mohamed al Fayed, Mr Ali Fayed and Mr Salah Fayed. House of Fraser plc owns the group's department stores and other retailing interests, which include Harrods, Dickens &amp; Jones, Kurt Geiger, the shoe retailer, and Turnbull &amp; Asser, the shirtmaker. In the year to January 25 1992, House of Fraser plc, which has many subsidiaries, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 26m, down from Pounds 41m in the previous year. Yet House of Fraser Property Investment incurred a Pounds 3.3m loss, principally because of Pounds 21m in interest payments. It owns the group's properties, which had a book value at the end of January 1992 of Pounds 338m. It has only one subsidiary, House of Fraser (Eleven), which had 'no activity' in the year, according to the accounts. A banker said the total bank debt of all the UK companies after the restructuring would be around Pounds 500m - the bulk of it provided by the seven core banks - down from a peak of Pounds 800m a year and a half ago. Another banker said the group had never missed an interest payment. The remaining debt comes up for repayment in tranches during 1994, 1995 and 1996. Mr Michael Cole, a director of House of Fraser Holdings, said performance of the stores in the year to January had been significantly better than last time. He described the figures as 'bullish'. Bankers are hopeful that there should not be a problem in repaying or refinancing future principal payments in the coming three years. A banker said: 'What is taking place is an orderly restructuring of House of Fraser's debt. This is not a financial crisis.' The deadline for signing the loan renewal is the end of the month. 'To all intents and purposes, the deal is done', a banker said. The Fayed brothers acquired House of Fraser for Pounds 615m in 1985. A 1991 Department of Trade report on the takeover said the Fayeds 'dishonestly misrepresented their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources'. The Fayeds are challenging the report at the European Court of Human Rights.  ------------------------------------------------------------ HOW THE OWNER OF HARRODS IS TRADING  ------------------------------------------------------------ Year-end January (Pounds m)               1991-92     1990-91  ------------------------------------------------------------ Turnover                                  1,165.0     1,269.0 Operating profit                             53.0        78.1 Interest                                    -99.4      -124.4 Other operating income                       20.5        20.6 Pre-tax loss                                -13.9       -14.9  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: House of Fraser Holdings  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Mandela asks UN to look into violence MR Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) leader, yesterday urged the United Nations to appoint a special representative to investigate violence in the black townships of South Africa, which he said had made impossible further negotiations on the country's constitutional future. In a speech to the UN Security Council, Mr Mandela blamed the white South African government for the violence and said the council had an obligation to 'intervene to end the carnage'. He accused Pretoria of a 'cold-blooded strategy of state terrorism'. Mr Mandela was speaking in support of a council resolution put forward by Organisation of African Unity states calling for the appointment of a special representative of the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, to investigate the township violence. The aim would be to create conditions for a resumption of constitutional negotiations. Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign minister, is expected to support some form of UN mission when he addresses the council this morning, although the Pretoria government opposed earlier efforts by the OAU nations to seek the dispatch of a force of UN monitors to the country. Mr Mandela said the envoy should investigate the violence and help the UN decide on measures to help end it. The council's subsequent action, he added, should include 'continuous monitoring' of the situation. 'The blame lies clearly at the door of the regime,' he added. 'It and nobody else has the law enforcement presence and legal authority to stop this violence and act against the perpetrators.' President F W de Klerk earlier said two battalions with a reputation for brutality in operations in black townships would be disbanded. Mr de Klerk's warning about the country's tense political climate was underlined yesterday. Several shops in the centre of Pietermaritzburg, the Natal provincial capital, were looted after several hundred ANC supporters tried to occupy the city hall. Police said 25 people were arrested, but were freed by a crowd that surrounded the vehicles in which they had been detained. South African business and labour leaders are near agreement on a 'charter for peace and economic reconstruction' which includes a call for elections for a transitional parliament within six months, Michael Holman and Philip Gawith write from Johannesburg. The South African Defence Force said yesterday it was 'investigating the background' of an SADF member who allegedly took part in a plot to kill Mr Dirk Coetzee, a former South African policeman living in London.</p>

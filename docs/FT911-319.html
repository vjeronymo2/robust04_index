			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Palma drops dividend on Pounds 2m losses LOSSES HAVE deepened at Palma Group, the Leicester-based textile company, in the 13 months to January 31. From a deficit of Pounds 246,000 in the year 1989, the group declined to losses of Pounds 2m pre-tax. This came on turnover down at Pounds 29.93m (Pounds 31.98m), though continuing activities contributed Pounds 18.04m (Pounds 17.75m). Mr Peter Bailey, chairman, said that 'in a very tough period, trading conditions were as bad as at any time' in the board's memory. At the outset there was low demand and it had deteriorated further. The result was affected by an exceptional provision of Pounds 240,000 (nil) for reorganisation at Pex, and increased interest of Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 707,000). Losses per share totalled 7.97p (0.83p) and the dividend is passed. The total payout last time was 3.7p. During the 13 months, the Montfort Somercotes subsidiary was closed, and certain of the Clothkits mail order assets and its name were sold to Freemans, the catalogue operation.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Midlands funds - spoilt for choice / The proliferation of finance New funds and fresh schemes to help small companies have been proliferating across the Midlands with such bewildering confusion that concern is growing about fragmentation. The problem now may be not that there is inadequate finance to help aspiring executives, but that there is too much choice. The initiatives have one thing in common. There is a clearing bank involved somewhere. Since the end of September, Midland Bank has begun two funds for start-up businesses, one of Pounds 300,000 with Birmingham Venture, part of the Chamber of Commerce, and another of Pounds 260,000 with Birmingham Training and Enterprise Council. Lloyds Bank has joined with six government-funded agencies and local solicitors and accountants to set up the Pounds 550,000 Arrow Fund to help the small, growing business. Barclays, as the agent for the European Investment Bank, has emerged with a rebate scheme which provides cash for companies using lease finance and creating jobs at the same time. There is more to come. National Westminster Bank shortly will announce that it is heading a group of 18 private-sector groups providing Pounds 2m largely to fund a Business in the Community plan to foster voluntary sector commercial projects. In January, Aston Reinvestment Trust, the nascent community bank for east Birmingham, will hold its first board meeting. Among the institutions to which it is talking about funding are Co-operative Bank and National Westminster. In February, the University of Central England will outline a project to help potential fast-growth businesses where senior managers, already in employment, are seeking to break out on their own; behind it will be Midland Bank and 3i, the venture capital group. This intensity of clearing bank interest at an end of the market which historically banks have tended to find difficult, time-consuming and risky is not confined to the Midlands. Banks give local shape to national plans. Midland, for example, has 30 local loan funds. Indeed, the banks appear now to be competing for business which previously they eschewed. 'All the banks see the value of being involved,' said Mike Conroy, a small-business specialist at Midland. It is a sharp change from two years ago when banks were pilloried for what was perceived to be their indifference to an ailing small-business sector. It is the result of a confluence of circumstances. The government's 1993 Competitiveness White Paper played a part with its stress on encouraging banks to provide a wider range of products. The banks' own desire, after the criticism of the recession years, to escape the charge that they would only lend against the collateral of physical assets chimed with that urging of the government. The banks also met a movement from another angle. David Hall of Business Link Birmingham explained that the subsuming of the Enterprise Allowance scheme into the government's Single Regeneration Budget meant that local Tecs, Business Links and councils were looking for new funds. The banks found ready partners to act in a sector where the personality and prospects of a potential borrower are more significant than his assets. The vehicle of partnership proved to be the loan fund. The fact that organisations such as Tecs and Business Link had the facilities and willingness to school potential borrowers through the writing of business plans meant that the banks could deal with the fund clients at one remove. The banks could administer the loans but they were spared the time-consuming task of giving pastoral care to borrowers with a negligible business track record. They had a comfort factor, somebody to look after their money for them. Certainly, the banks are unlikely to make much profit out of the funds. The Midland funds and the Arrow fund offer loans at 1 per cent above bank base rate, the sort of interest charged to blue-chip multinationals.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHERE ARE THEY NOW? 6 STORIES REVISITED;  </P> <P> BEBOP RECORDS: WHERE A FIXTURE OF RESEDA'S MUSIC SCENE ONCE WAS, VORTEX OFFERS  ART AND POETRY READINGS.  </P> <P> When Bebop Records closed in June, the Valley lost one of its favorite  hangouts.  </P> <P> Bebop sold used records by day, and by night became an unusually eclectic stage  for song and poetry.  </P> <P> Such well-known musicians as Los Lobos, Exene Cervenka and Jane's Addiction  performed there. The likes of Jim Carroll, Kate Braverman and La Loca read  there.  </P> <P> But owner Richard Bruland called it quits after eight years when city officials  cited him for hosting performances without a proper permit.  </P> <P> Now the Reseda shop has reopened with much of its aestheticism intact. A  Burbank woman named Melody Cooper has rented the storefront and converted it  into a gallery.  </P> <P> The newly named Vortex offers shelves of pottery and walls filled with  paintings and collages. Art classes are given on a regular basis. Poets will be  glad to know that a small performance space in the rear is used for 7:30 p.m.  readings on the second and last Wednesdays of each month.  </P> <P> "I'm trying a lot of different things," Cooper said. "I want to keep changing  the art on display."  </P> <P> Twenty local artists are showing works at the gallery. When there are no  customers, Cooper works on her own art, pottery. Two wheels and a considerable  amount of clay dust inhabit the premises.  </P> <P> And Bruland -- who left the business world to concentrate on his painting -- is  scheduled to show some of his work at Vortex in the coming year.  </P> <P> "Richard is happy to be gone and doing his art," Cooper said. "And I'm very  happy to be here. I think it's good for everybody." DAVID WHARTON  </P></p>

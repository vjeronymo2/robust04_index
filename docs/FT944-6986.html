			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages recovery in low volume Wall Street US share prices reversed the declining course seen earlier in the week to close yesterday's half-day session solidly higher in extremely light volume, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33.64 at 3,708.27. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.36 at 452.29, while the American Stock Exchange composite gained 2.25 at 434.65. The Nasdaq composite was up 5.82 at 742.52. Trading volume on the NYSE came to 109m shares. Program trading early in the morning helped to push the market to a positive close for the first time since November 16. The market closed at 1 pm for the Thanksgiving holiday, after being shut on Thursday. US Treasury prices also reversed their previous course, holding steady after a week of relatively steady gains. Two-year notes were flat, while the benchmark 30-year Treasuries gained slightly. Several cyclical stocks rebounded from losses earlier in the week. Aluminum Company of America rose Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 80 3/8 , Allied Signal gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 32 1/8 , Caterpillar was up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 53 3/8 , United Technologies climbed Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 56 1/2 and International Paper increased Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 69 5/8 . Both Bankers Trust and Gibson Greeting gained on news that the two had settled a lawsuit filed by Gibson over derivative losses. Bankers Trust rose Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 57 1/8 and Gibson was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 13 7/8 after the companies announced an out-of-court settlement that essentially released Gibson from Dollars 14m that it owed the bank from two swap agreements. The settlement put an end to the smaller of two derivatives-related suits filed against Bankers Trust. American Depository Re-ceipts of Sony, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, rose Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 51 3/4 after Mr Akio Morita, the chairman, announced his retirement. Sony was the first Japanese company to have a listing on the NYSE. News that Archer-Daniels-Midland planned a Dollars 700m expansion of an Iowa plant did not help the agribusiness giant. Its shares fell Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 28 1/2 . Brazil Stock prices closed 3.8 per cent lower in thin Sao Paulo trading, dragged down by tight liquidity, concern about small banks, and anxiety about how President-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso will form his cabinet. The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares ended off 1,747 at 43,987. Analysts said that stocks were depressed - the Bovespa index has dropped 8.3 per cent this month - as major domestic and foreign players were mostly out of the market. Venezuela Caracas plunged across the board to a four-month low, led by panic selling of the benchmark stock, Electricidad de Caracas. The Merinvest composite index closed 2.85, or 2.4 per cent lower at 117.24, down nearly 20 per cent this month. Electricidad de Caracas tumbled 12.00 bolivars to 199.00 bolivars, down 40 per cent since October 28, as investors offloaded existing shares to participate in a one-for-six rights issue.</p>

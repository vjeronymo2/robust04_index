			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / US House Speaker hits at Ulster violence MR Thomas Foley, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, yesterday issued a vigorous condemnation of violence by both republican and unionist terrorists in Northern Ireland and called for the resumption of political talks on the province's future. Coming from a prominent Roman Catholic politician of Irish ancestry, the statement was warmly welcomed by the UK government, which has been nervous about US policy on Northern Ireland since Mr Bill Clinton, in last year's American presidential campaign, called for the appointment of a US special envoy to the province. Mr Foley attacked the bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army which last week killled a child in Warrington as 'senseless savagery', and condemned the bombing this week by the Ulster Freedom Fighters of homes of Sinn Fein councillors in Northern Ireland. But he also added blunt criticism of US groups which raise money for Irish terrorist groups. 'These villainous attacks are a grim and signal lesson to anyone who, through financial or other assistance, supports groups and organisations supplying the wherewithal to perpetrate the terrorist's cowardly, despicable attacks against humanity,' Mr Foley said. British Prime Minister John Major tried to deflect Mr Clinton from appointing a special envoy when he visited Washington last month, but the US president said last week, during a visit by Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, that he was still giving 'serious consideration' to the idea. Indeed, Mr Foley's name was one of those mentioned as a possible envoy, although the speaker's office made it clear he was too busy shepherding Mr Clinton's legislative programme through Congress to take on another role. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday warmly welcomed Mr Foley's statement, calling his words 'very wise'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eric Zemmour: "Pasqua, the Reasons for His </F> Anger"]    [Excerpt] The conflict between the interior minister and  the justice minister is a classic of French political theater.  But, this time, it is the whole of Edouard Balladur's policy  which is being questioned by Charles Pasqua, who is determined  to show his strength one year before the presidential election.    For a long time Charles Pasqua was Balladur's favorite. In  spring 1993, the prime minister gave him priority in legislative  matters during those famous "first 100 days," beyond which, it  seems, reforms are more difficult to implement. He supported  him with his full weight in the battle which the interior  minister launched against the Constitutional Council on the  right of asylum. And when Charles Pasqua, wearing his second  hat, that of regional development, launched a "tour of France,"  Edouard Balladur immediately joined him. Charles Pasqua was at  the time presented as the deputy prime minister. With a  vocation to take over the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's  office] once Balladur was installed in the Elysee [presidential  palace]. The "honeymoon" period is over. Charles Pasqua is not  an enthusiastic supporter of the Balladur method. Without  saying so publicly, he thinks that the government is backing  down too much, too often, and is not bold enough. In his  introductory speech on his immigration laws, he had explained  that it was necessary to coordinate with other ministries,  responsible for justice, urban policy, and so forth.    However, one year later, Charles Pasqua can see that this  has  not happened. That is why he attacked the judges who snubbed  him by bringing back the two young Algerians to Lyons, and  through them, he attacked Justice Minister Pierre Mehaignerie.  That is why he is also attacking urban policy -- or rather the  lack of it -- and Simone Veil, the minister responsible, when he  says: "The police cannot be society's road sweeper. Economic,  social, and cultural life must be restored to these districts  and they must no longer be abandoned to their fate, like ghettos  within national territory." [passage omitted]</p>

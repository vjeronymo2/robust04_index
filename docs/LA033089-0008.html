			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF YOU DANCE WITH KADAFI ON CHEMICAL ARMS, KISS THE AMERICAN MARKET GOODBY  </P> <P> Every day, step by step, Libya's lunatic leader, Moammar Kadafi, comes closer  and closer to producing chemical weapons and perfecting the means to deliver  them over long distances. If he gets there -- and he might well, not in years  but in months -- we've got a new and deadly ball game in the Middle East.  </P> <P> And Kadafi is not the only problem. Iraq not only has but has used chemical  weapons in its war with Iran. Iran and Syria are hellbent on developing their  own chemical weapons capability. And other Third World nations are moving in  the same direction.  </P> <P> The evil genie is already out of the bottle. There may still be time to get him  back in there, but only if we act now.  </P> <P> We've got the right overall policy. Our aim is to eliminate chemical weapons  entirely. In fact, we've been reducing our own stockpiles of chemical weapons  for years. The Soviets have now said they will start destroying theirs, too. I  hope so. But let's make sure this offer is not just a sham, designed to get us  to halt production of the newer, safer binary chemical weapons that we have  developed to help offset the massive Soviet stockpiles and production lines. We  have to make sure the world -- allies and adversaries alike -- understand this  bottom line: The United States is prepared to agree to the destruction of all  of our chemical weapons when the Soviets are ready to sign a binding,  worldwide, verifiable agreement to ban all such weapons.  </P> <P> But even as we try to negotiate this global ban, more and more nations seek to  acquire chemical weapons. We're trying to stop them by pushing the adoption of  a major international agreement to control the export of technology and  equipment. We made some progress on that score recently at the Paris conference  on chemical weapons. That must remain a top priority. But we also have to face  facts: We're not going to have a good agreement for many months, perhaps years.  </P> <P> We can't just sit back and wait for that day. We have to act now, with every  bit of leverage we have. If Kadafi takes that last step and starts producing  chemical weapons, we should make clear our determination to do whatever is  necessary to deny him the opportunity to use his deadly new toys.  </P> <P> And we have to do one other thing. According to many reports, Japanese and West  European firms, in a sickening pursuit of the almighty dollar, or yen, or  Deutsche mark, are helping Kadafi and his crowd produce chemical weapons or  develop the means to deliver them. No firm that knowingly engages in that kind  of reckless activity deserves the right to profit from the American market.  That's why Sens. Jake Garn, John Heinz and others from both parties have joined  me in introducing legislation that states this sound and simple proposition: If  you deal with the likes of Kadafi on chemical weapons, you can kiss the  American market goodby.  </P> <P> Specifically, the bill requires the President to investigate and report on any  firms engaged in such activity, and then bans all such firms from selling their  products in America or contracting with our government anywhere in the world  for many years.  </P> <P> Do we have the right to take such action? You bet we do. Our security  interests, our allies and friends, the lives of American citizens, they're all  at stake.  </P> <P> Do we need to take such action? We have to. If we don't, who will?  </P> <P> And finally, do we need to act now? We had better. Because one of these  tomorrows, it may be too late.  </P></p>

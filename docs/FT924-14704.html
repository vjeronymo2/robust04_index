			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: GM faces threat of new strike GENERAL Motors, the struggling US vehicle-maker which has suffered two strikes at parts plants over the past five weeks, is threatened with a stoppage at an electrical plant in Anderson, Indiana. The United Auto Workers union yesterday issued a letter authorising a strike at Inland Fisher Guide if a dispute could not be resolved in the next five business days. A stoppage by Inland Fisher's 3,400 hourly-paid workers could seriously disrupt GM production. The plant supplies tail lights, parking lights and other exterior lighting for most of the group's North American cars. Although the various strikes have particular local causes, they are also seen by analysts as a warning shots to GM by the UAW over job losses.</p>

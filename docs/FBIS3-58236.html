			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>   [Excerpt] Prime Minister John Major claimed victory at the  NATO summit in Brussels today as the Allies adopted his bold new  plan for selective air strikes against the Serbs.    The prime minister was able to forget his domestic troubles  briefly as the two-day meeting of NATO leaders ended with a  renewed readiness to break the Serb stranglehold on Sarajevo and  other threatened areas.    Mr. Major launched the initiative late last night to break  the deadlock over NATO's next move to try to restore lasting  peace in the former Yugoslavia.    "We have got everything we wanted, this has been a triumph,  a  success," senior British Government sources said after other  NATO countries backed Mr. Major and included a reference to  increased action in Bosnia if necessary.    The NATO summit's final declaration reaffirmed last August's  pledge to carry out air strikes in principle.    But it also went further, urging the authorities commanding  United Nations forces in Bosnia to draw up urgent plans to get  besieged Canadian troops out of the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica  and open the airport at Tuzla to restore humanitarian relief.    The bold proposal is designed to restore NATO's credibility  in the Bosnian crisis, step up the West's military pressure, and  appease French demands for nothing short of full-scale bombing  raids.    Mr. Major highlighted the problems in the Muslim enclave of  Srebrenica, where Serbs are preventing Dutch troops replacing  300 Canadian troops, and the Serbs' refusal to allow the airport  at Tuzla to be reopened.    The Allies are determined to open Tuzla airport as its  closure is severely hampering humanitarian operations in  northern Bosnia.    There is also widespread anger at the Serbs' refusal to  allow  the Canadian troops out of Srebrenica after a six-month tour of  duty which was supposed to have ended just before Christmas.    The Serbs have blocked all attempts to move in the Dutch  contingent which is waiting to replace the Canadians.    The NATO declaration will also re-emphasise the alliance's  commitment to use warplanes to break the stranglehold on  Sarajevo if the situation in the Bosnian capital becomes  untenable.    A large allied air force is poised for action at bases in  Italy and on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic.    Britain has a squadron of Jaguar attack jets at Gioia del  Colle in Italy and eight Sea Harrier jump-jets aboard the  carrier Invincible.    NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said it was his  understanding that the declaration meant that the allies would  use air strikes if Serb forces continued to besiege Srebrenica  and keep the airport at Tuzla closed.    "What I see is a stronger determination to implement (air  strikes) and to get rid of obstacles," he said.    "It is my impression that there is a clear determination not  to continue just the situation as it stands. I am not able to  say any more at this very moment."    Mr. Woerner said NATO was entering "a new era of  cooperation." He also referred to a key passage in the summit  declaration which states: "We expect and would welcome NATO  expansion that would reach to democratic states to our east as  part of an evolutionary process taking into account political  and security developments in the whole of Europe."    The summit was an historic turning point, he said. "NATO's  transformation has made a big step forward. We are now well on  track to the 21st century."    The emerging democracies in Central and East Europe,  including Russia, were being invited to forge closer military  links with the 16-nation alliance under a U.S. initiative called  Partnership for Peace.    This was described as an evolutionary process which could  eventually lead to full membership for a number of countries.    "The offer is there -- the door is open," Mr. Woerner said.  "I call on our cooperation partners to seize this opportunity  to build a relationship with NATO."    The summit also agreed to take urgent action to protect  against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as  nuclear missiles around the world.    It also saw a reaffirmation from U.S. President Bill Clinton  of America's commitment to Europe's security.    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said that U.S. commitment had  not been in doubt but it was nice to hear it repeated at NATO  headquarters for those concerned that transatlantic ties were  loosening.    Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown welcomed NATO's  tougher  stand on Bosnia -- but said it was far too late.    He told BBC Radio: "Those of us who have been calling for  this kind of stronger action for 18 months have been constantly  ridiculed and told it was impossible.    "Now because the Americans say it is OK, the Government says  it is fine."    He warned: "Because this has been done so late the exercise  will be much more risky, much more dangerous, much more  difficult than it would have been 18 months ago chiefly because  our troops are embroiled and enmeshed in the operation."

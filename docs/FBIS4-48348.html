			<p>BFN     [Text] The Angolan peace talks which began in 1993 have a  happy end in sight. The National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Luanda government are  already discussing the dossier on national reconciliation.  UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Valentim, who is the  UNITA negotiating team's spokesman, said yesterday that they are  optimistic and will score positive results. Agreement has  already been reached on 12 of the 18 points under discussion,  and the two sides do not differ very much on the remaining six  points. Dr. Valentim said the present moment is crucial and he  favored a power-sharing pattern similar to the one in South  Africa recently adopted by President Nelson Mandela. Sources  close to the talks say the two sides will today discuss the  Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel's role in the national  reconciliation context, the role of UNITA deputies in the  Assembly of the Republic, the return of UNITA's property, and  the reinstatement of the state administration, besides other  collateral issues.</p>

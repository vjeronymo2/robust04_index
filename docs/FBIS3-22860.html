"The document envisages a joint sale of American and Russian  uranium products in the U.S., and at market prices, too,"  Russian Deputy Minister of Nuclear Power Nikolay Yegorov, who  signed the amendment for the Russian Government, told ITAR-TASS.    "According to preliminary estimates, Russia's revenue from  the sale of uranium on the U.S. market may run at 150 million  U.S. dollars annually. Of great importance is also the consent  of U.S. uranium producers, who earlier accused our country of a  desire to sell uranium products at dumping prices, to cooperate  with Russia," Yegorov said.    A press release circulated here by the Russian Embassy in  the  U.S. points out that the amendment, agreed upon by the  governments of the two countries, reflects the mutually  beneficial and innovatory approach to the solution of trade  problems and is a new specific example of partners' relations  being developed by Russia and the U.S.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today is the third and last day of the general  warning strike launched by the Gabonese Trade Union Federation  [COSYGA] on 16 February. Like yesterday, the COSYGA, its  affiliated unions, and sympathizers went on peaceful marches  throughout the country today followed by a sit-in in front of  the premises of Channel One of the radio and television  corporation. It was however reported that at Port Gentil, the  march ended with incidents leading to the arrest of COSYGA's  three provincial leaders. Albert Effam confirms this from the  economic capital.    [Begin recording] Paul Henri Yelo M'Boungana, COSYGA's  provincial secretary for Ogooue-Maritime Province, was arrested  today together with three other trade unionists following this  morning's peaceful march organized by the COSYGA. The four men  were detained in the early afternoon in the jails of the  Gendarmerie in central Port Gentil. No official reason was  given for these arrests. Questioned on these arrests by Radio  (Mountie), the local officers of Port Gentil gendarmerie simply  indicated that they were obeying orders and asked us as to  enquire from the offices of the state attorney. Another  explanation gleaned piecemeal from a source close to the  gendarmerie indicated that the arrest of Paul Henri Yelo  M'Boungana and his comrades could be the consequence of the  incidents that marred this morning's march, especially the  littering of the roadway with household garbage, the stopping of  buses transporting some workers, and the deflation of tyres of  stationary vehicles.    According to latest reports, the Ogooue-Maritime union  leader, Paul Henri Yelo M'boungana and his comrades were picked  from the Gendarmerie by the Army and taken away in a military  vehicle to an unknown destination. COSYGA's activists and  sympathizers went to the governorate to seek an explanation in  the late afternoon but Governor (Antoine Abia Gueyangoe) of  Ogooue-Maritime Province was in a meeting.

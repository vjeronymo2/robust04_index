			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO DECIDE CASES WHEN PLANNERS CAN'T VOTE  </P> <P> The Whittier City Council has approved an ordinance to handle cases in which  the Planning Commission is unable to vote because it lacks a quorum.  </P> <P> The ordinance came about after a recent Planning Commission meeting in which  three of five commissioners disqualified themselves because of a potential  conflict of interest. The disqualifications came when the commission was  scheduled to vote on a controversial proposal to limit apartment construction  north of the Uptown Village business district. The commissioners who  disqualified themselves own property in or near the area that would be affected  by the proposal.  </P> <P> Under the new ordinance, the planning director will report the lack of a quorum  to the city manager, who will then refer the matter to the City Council for a  vote. The City Council is scheduled to vote on the apartment construction issue  Tuesday.  </P></p>

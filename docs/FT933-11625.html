			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Bonds: ERM worries stimulate interest in Euroyen issues FOUR new Euroyen issues were launched yesterday as investors steered clear of European bond markets due to worries about the fate of the exchange rate mechanism. Three of the four issues were straight bond issues, bringing the volume of fixed-rate debt in the sector to Y110bn so far this week. Most of the paper was targeted at investors in Japan or south-east Asia, but some dealers noted a pick-up in interest among European investors. Mitsubishi Corporation Finance launched a Y20bn three-year deal which met demand in both Europe and Asia Pacific, according to lead manager Merrill Lynch. Tokyu Land issued Y30bn of four-year bonds via Yamaichi International, which were pre-placed in Asia Pacific, while Nikko's Y30bn offering for China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) was targeted at investors in south-east Asia, who understand the credit, according to the lead manager. The mandate for the deal was awarded several weeks ago, and sold out prior to its official launch. Elsewhere, the State Bank of South Australia launched an ADollars 100m issue of 6 3/4 per cent bonds due 1998 via Hambros Bank. Volume in the sector has been low recently, partly as a result of a fall in the number of maturing deals providing reinvestment flows, which will drop further next month. The deal was offered at a spread of 31 basis points over the comparable government bonds yield, but tightened to 29 basis points. The Mortgage Bank of Denmark launched a large Dkr750m five-year deal via Morgan Stanley. At the end of trading, the deal was quoted at 99.80, above its fixed re-offer price of 99.67. In the Swiss market, three Japanese companies launched equity-linked deals totalling Sfr350m. Nationwide Building Society and National &amp; Provincial Building Society have had their senior long-term debt ratings lowered by Moody's, the US credit rating agency. The UK's second and eighth largest building societies both had their senior debt ratings lowered to A1 from Aa3, while their subordinated debt ratings dropped to A3 from A2. Both had their Prime-1 commercial paper ratings confirmed. 'Nationwide continues to experience significant asset quality problems in its residential mortgage portfolio, reflecting its earlier lending practices as well as the society's exposure to southern England, where the decline in property values has been sharpest,' Moody's said.</p>

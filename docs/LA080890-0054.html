			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: WALKER ABLE TO PUT THE BRAKES ON IMMOBILITY  </P> <P> Canadian inventor Norman Rolston developed Able Walker for seniors and others  who need help to walk. He said he came up with the idea after watching an  elderly aunt struggle with a conventional walker.  </P> <P> Able Walker, made of chrome and weighing 15 pounds, is a grocery cart and a  seat that can hold an individual weighing up to 500 pounds. "My goal," Rolston  said, "is to get people on the road again. . . . Able Walker may not add years  to their lives, but it certainly adds life to their years."  </P> <P> The device is adjustable, so it can be used by someone who is 4-foot-10 or  6-foot-6. It is fitted with handlebars covered with foam grips, four wheels,  hand brakes and the shopping basket that converts to a seat. It also can be  turned into a luggage cart.  </P> <P> Able Walker costs $259, including shipping and handling. It comes in one piece  and requires only the attaching of its brakes, which is "easy to do," the  firm's California representative said.  </P> <P> To order, contact Able Walker Inc., Building C-2, 1122 Fir Ave., Blaine, Wash.  98230; (800) 663-1305.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spray Wax Puts Dent in Car-Care Chores  </P> <P> Carnauba Spray Wax -- introduced by Eagle One, a longtime California  manufacturer of car-care products -- helps cut down on the time car buffs spend  with liquid and paste waxes. The aerosol spray contains no fluorocarbons.  </P> <P> Eagle representatives said it is the first aerosol spray wax for vehicles. It  takes about 20 minutes to wax a regular-size car, wiping the spray with a soft,  dry cloth.  </P> <P> Carnauba Spray Wax costs $5.99 for a 14.5-ounce can that is good for five or  six waxings. It's available at Chief Auto Parts, Pep Boys, Kragen Auto Parts,  other automotive stores nationwide and Thrifty Drug Stores. If you can't find  it in your area, contact Eagle One, 2231 Faraday Ave., Suite 101, Carlsbad,  Calif. 92008; (619) 931-0784.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA SPIKES UCLA, INVITES USC;  </P> <P> COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL: BRUINS, LOSERS TO LONG BEACH IN WIVA CHAMPIONSHIP, ARE OUT  OF FINAL FOUR FOR SIXTH TIME IN 21 YEARS.  </P> <P> UCLA was stunned and USC pleasantly surprised when pairings were announced  Monday for the NCAA men's volleyball final four this weekend at George Mason  University in Fairfax, Va.  </P> <P> The Bruins expected to gain an at-large bid because they advanced to the final  of Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. tournament last Saturday, where  they lost to Cal State Long Beach in five games.  </P> <P> Long Beach, as the tournament champion, earned an automatic bid to the final  four.  </P> <P> USC was eliminated earlier by Long Beach, and Trojan Coach Jim McLaughlin  thought that all but ended his team's chances.  </P> <P> The Bruins, based on tournament precedent, figured they would get a bid.  </P> <P> "We had a team meeting to review the (WIVA championship) match at Northridge  and prepare for the finals next week," UCLA Coach Al Scates said.  </P> <P> Then he heard from Robert Newcomb, chairman of the NCAA men's volleyball  committee.  </P> <P> "He said, 'I have some bad news for you. You're not going, USC is.' "  </P> <P> The Bruins, winners of 13 national championships in 15 appearances in the final  four, will not go to the final four for only the sixth time in 21 years.  </P> <P> "They were stunned because, since 1970, the NCAA has always taken the team that  finished highest in our postseason competition, and have never gone back and  taken a team that was eliminated in an earlier round of the postseason  competition," Scates said. "And I had assumed going in that the team that made  the final round would make the NCAAs, as they had done in the previous 20  years."  </P> <P> Newcomb was not available to comment on the selection process.  </P> <P> Both USC and UCLA have 23-5 records, but USC defeated UCLA in both meetings  this season -- March 2 in a league match at UCLA and April 7 in the final of  the UCLA Invitational. The Trojans also finished the regular season ranked No.  2 in the coaches' poll. The Bruins were No. 3.  </P> <P> Still, McLaughlin said: "I was a little surprised. Right after we lost to Long  Beach, when we got back in the locker room I told the guys: 'Meet for team  meetings Monday. There's a small chance we can go, but as far as I'm concerned  right now, the season's over.' "  </P> <P> Long Beach (27-6), ranked No. 1 and competing in its first final four since  1973, will meet Rutgers Newark (27-14) in one of two matches Friday night. The  Trojans will play Ball State (27-10) in the other. The winners play for the  championship Saturday.  </P></p>

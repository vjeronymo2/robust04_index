			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Claim of rise in student drop-outs rejected Universities and students' unions have rejected claims in a survey published today that the number of students leaving university without completing their degree is increasing. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals said that 13 per cent of students had left without completing their degree during the academic year 1992-93 - exactly the same figure as the year before. They said this compared favourably with university drop-out rates on the continent. The National Union of Students agreed that the drop-out rate was remaining constant, but it predicted that it could rise - a survey of its members earlier this year found 20 per cent had 'considered' dropping out due to financial hardship. The PUSH Guide to Which University, which is published today in association with Lloyds Bank, also provides details on student debt. The survey's findings show that the average level of student indebtedness increased almost 50 per cent this year, from Pounds 614 to Pounds 916 per student. This varied regionally, with debt levels generally linked to living costs. The study found that the highest level of indebtedness was in Leeds, at Pounds 1,800 per year. Mr Jim Murphy, NUS president, attacked the government's decision to cut grants by 10 per cent and replace them with an increased subsidised loans facility. Describing the rise in debt as the 'inevitable' consequence of government policies, he said: 'Student grants have been frozen, and now cut. But living costs haven't' The PUSH Guide to Which University 95. PUSH, Freepost (WD 4627) London, SW1Y 4YT. Pounds 9.95. Observer, Page 15</p>

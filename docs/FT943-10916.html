			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: October start for French rapeseed futures Matif, the French futures exchange, has announced that it will begin trading in oilseed rape futures on October 28. The contract denominated in D-Marks but with continuous conversion into French francs and dollars, will be the first in Europe's dominant oilseed to be traded on a European exchange. The only other oilseed rape contract is traded on the Winnipeg exchange in Canada. The futures contract, developed in conjuction with the French oilseeds trade group Onidol, will enable oilseed professionals to deal with the rapeseed price volatility that has resulted from the reform of the European Union's agricultural policy. Matif expects that the main users of the contract will be French, German, Danish and British, the main producers of oilseed rape, and is hoping for daily turnover of 1,000 lots in the early stages.</p>

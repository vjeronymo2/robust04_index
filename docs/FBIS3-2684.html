			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Mar 11 (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] held its second  meeting here at the Great Hall of the People this morning and  heard the report on the implementation of the 1993 national  economic and social development plan and the draft plan for 1994  delivered by Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State  Planning Commission; and the report on the implementation of the  1993 state budget and the draft state budget for 1994 delivered  by Finance Minister Liu Zhongli.    In the report delivered at the request of the State Council,  Chen Jinhua said: Generally speaking, the 1993 plan for  national economic and social development was successfully  implemented. China's social production continued to increase  rapidly; its key projects construction and technological  transformation strengthened; its foreign trade and economic and  technological exchanges expanded further; business in its  domestic markets was brisk; its science and technology,  education, and other social undertakings developed vigorously;  and the livelihood of its urban and rural people continued to  improve.    He said: In 1993, we scored major successes in the national  economy. At the same time, there were still prominent  contradictions and problems in our economic life. These  problems, which occurred in the midst of progress, aroused the  serious concern of governments at all levels. Vigorous measures  have been taken or are being taken to resolve them.    Chen Jinhua put forward six major tasks for this year's  national economic and social development: 1) persistently  attaching prime importance to agriculture and developing the  rural economy in an all-around way; 2) running well large and  medium state-owned enterprises by vigorously readjusting their  structures, improving their management and operations, and  raising efficiency; 3) maintaining a reasonable amount of  investment in fixed assets and optimizing the investment  structure; 4) opening wider to the outside world and actively  and effectively using foreign capital, resources, technologies,  and markets; 5) earnestly shifting economic construction onto  the path that relies on scientific and technological progress,  and further developing educational undertakings; and 6)  improving the people's livelihood continuously and developing  various social undertakings.    Chen Jinhua stressed the need to strengthen and improve  macroeconomic regulation and control to fulfill the 1994  national economic and social development plan in an all-around  way. For this purpose, the report points out: The basic point  of departure in carrying out macroeconomic regulation and  control is to maintain balance and unity between reform,  development, and stability. The main task of macroeconomic  regulation and control is to maintain a rough balance between  the total demand and total supply in society. We must exert  efforts to control the size of the increase in the general level  of commodity prices. The macroeconomic regulation and control  system needs to be continuously improved in the course of  in-depth reform.    In the report delivered at the request of the State Council,  Liu Zhongli said: Total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482  billion yuan (including income of 69.384 billion yuan received  from domestic and foreign debts), covering 113.1 percent of the  budget and up 23.2 percent compared to the previous year. Total  state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan (including  33.735 billion yuan spent to pay for the principle and interest  of domestic and foreign debts), equalling 112.5 percent of the  budget and up 21.2 percent over the 1992 figure. This resulted  in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not in excess of  the budgeted figure.    Liu Zhongli said: In accordance with the provisions of the  original contract financial responsibility system, localities,  based on the principle of achieving a balance between revenues  and expenditures, were allowed to spend more from increased  revenues after fulfilling the contracted task under the system.  As a result, the large increase in local revenues brought about  a corresponding increase in expenditures. This was the primary  reason why total state spending considerably exceeded the  budgeted figure.    Liu Zhongli pointed out: Overall, the 1993 state budget  was well implemented. Under the unified leadership of party  committees and governments, fiscal and taxation departments at  all levels have done much work to ensure the continuous  deepening of reform as well as a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy. He then said: We are now  in an important period in which the economic structure is being  transformed and the economy is developing rapidly. Not only is  the contradiction between the supply of funds and the demand for  funds very sharp, but management in various sectors urgently  needs to be improved. To solve these problems once and for all,  we will comprehensively reform the fiscal and taxation systems  this year according to the decisions and unified arrangements of  the party Central Committee and the State Council. We will  seize this opportunity to further improve fiscal and taxation  management and gradually establish fiscal and taxation operating  mechanisms, meeting the requirements of the socialist market  economy so that fiscal and taxation management will be  standardized and legally institutionalized, and so the country's  financial situation will be improved as soon as possible.    Liu Zhongli stated: This year's state budget is again  drafted according to the principle of tightening control over  expenditures so as to maintain a basic balance between total  supply and total demand, and to alleviate inflationary  pressures. The guiding ideology is to implement in an all-round  manner the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third  plenary session of the party's 14th Central Committee; to ensure  the smooth progress of reform of the fiscal and taxation systems  as well as other major economic reforms; to continue to  strengthen and improve marcroeconomic regulation and control; to  actively develop financial sources, pay attention to improving  enterprise efficiency, and make the growth of financial revenue  commensurate with economic development; to persistently act  according to our capacity; to readjust the expenditure  structure; to appropriately increase investment in agriculture,  education, science and technology, infrastructure, and other  major projects; to maintain a necessary increase in expenditures  for national defense, judicial, procuratorial, and public  security departments; to strictly control investment in general  fixed assets and expenditures for consumption; and to promote a  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy as well as all-round social progress.    Liu Zhongli added: According to the general plans of the  party Central Committee and the State Council, this year we have  conducted a major reform of the fiscal and taxation systems and  the system of profit distribution in state-owned enterprises.  After reforming the fiscal and taxation systems, the size [kou  jing 0656 1777] of the budget has somewhat changed. According  to the guiding ideology for drafting the budget and its changed  size, we have made initial arrangements for the 1994 budget:  state revenues total 475.995 billion yuan (exclusive of income  from domestic and foreign debts), up 7.7 percent over last year  in terms of comparable items; expenditures amount to 542.914  billion yuan (exclusive of repayments for principal and interest  of domestic and foreign debts), an increase of 15 percent over  last year in terms of comparable items. This leaves a deficit of  66.919 billion yuan.    Liu Zhongli called on fiscal and taxation departments at all  levels to seize this opportune time, seek truth from facts,  change their work style, and work hard to ensure the success of  reform of the fiscal and taxation systems and implementation of  the budget. To this end, he pointed out: It is necessary to do  solid work to ensure the desired results will be achieved in the  reform of the fiscal and taxation systems. Efforts should be  made to improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and  control and to promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the economy. We should seize this opportune time  to reform the fiscal and taxation systems as well as to improve  and strengthen the levying and management of taxes. We should  improve the method of issuing treasury bonds to make it a  success. We should keep the total amount of expenditures under  control and make certain there are funds for key projects.

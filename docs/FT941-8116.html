			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Brambles in loss after US write-off A large write-off at its US incineration subsidiary caused Brambles, the Australian transport, equipment hire and waste disposal group, to post a ADollars 313.9m (USDollars 223.9m) loss after tax and outside equity interests in the six months to end-December. In the same period in 1992, it made an ADollars 88m profit. Even at the operating profit level, Brambles reported lower earnings, with pre-tax profits dropping to ADollars 120.9m from ADollars 141.8m. The equipment services division fell to ADollars 76m from ADollars 93.6m, while earnings from the waste treatment and disposal side dropped to ADollars 3.81m from ADollars 21.3m. A more cheerful performance was notched up by the transport services division, where earnings rose to ADollars 43.4m from ADollars 33.6m. Group sales were ADollars 1.33bn, against ADollars 1.37bn. Brambles blamed the 'severe economic downturn in Europe and the structural changes in the hazardous waste market in the US' for the poor trading results. The latter problem centres on Environmental Systems Co (Ensco), the US company that Brambles bought in 1992 after a prolonged acquisition process. Since then, Ensco, a high-temperature incinerator operator, has been struggling against competition from cheaper alternatives - notably cement kilns and industrial furnaces. Yesterday, Brambles admitted this situation was unlikely to go away. 'Despite representations by the incineration industry to the US Environmental Protection Agency, there is no evidence at this stage of pending changes to the regulations,' it said. These, Brambles claims, allow cement kilns to operate on more favourable terms. 'Although the high-temperature incineration industry might get some relief . . . in the long term, it is likely that cement kilns will continue to be a permanent feature of the US hazardous waste market.' Accordingly, Brambles is writing off the total value of the goodwill arising from the Ensco acquisition. This and a ADollars 19.6m provision for rationalisation costs in certain European operations led to a ADollars 377m abnormal charge. The company was more optimistic about its equipment rental and transport activities in continental Europe. These declined sharply in the first half, but 'there are signs that the worst may be over with the apparent bottoming of the German economy'. It also noted that, in contrast to the US and Europe, the Australian interests had generally performed well during the period. The company said it expected results to improve during 1994, assuming no further deterioration in Ensco's performance and continued recovery in Europe, Australia and the US. It said that it still expected to maintain dividends, despite the abnormal charges.</p>

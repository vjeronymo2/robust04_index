			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Advice only for more affluent reader Sir, Your 'Serious Money' article (January 29) suggested that 'fee-based advice may be the answer', but this must be a non-starter. Having sung the praises of fee-based independent financial advisers, you imply that other IFAs on commission cannot be trusted and point us to your article about Norton and Partners, headed eye-catchingly 'Bodyguard against sharks'. This is all verywell for your more affluent readers but someone like me, with less than Pounds 20,000 to invest, perhaps requiring modest pension arrangements to be set up, would not get a look in with these advisers - they will not touch me unless I earn more than Pounds 50,000 per annum and offer up an investment portfolio of around Pounds 80,000. Even if you feel that their Pounds 800 fee up front followed by similar amounts each year is a good deal, what about poor old me and many of your other less fortunate readers? Surely you do not think that the cut-price brokers who offer rebates will seriously look after me on an ongoing basis - they will not sit down with me for long to discuss my more modest investments. In the end it seems that there will only be financial advice for those who can afford to buy it. Madeleine Meloy, 8 Hayes Road, Bromley, Kent BR2 9AA</p>

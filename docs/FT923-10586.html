			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Amato's emergency package clears main hurdle THE ITALIAN government's L30,000bn (Pounds 13.8bn) emergency economic package yesterday cleared its main hurdle when the chamber of deputies approved the measures by an ample majority in a motion of confidence. But the troubled state of Italian party politics was underlined yesterday by the resignation of the Christian Democrat Mr Enzo Scotti as foreign minister. His resignation was prompted by a long-running feud within the Christian Democrat party over a controversial decision demanding that all cabinet members renounce their parliamentary seats. Mr Claudio Vitalone, the foreign trade minister, also under pressure, decided to give up his senate seat rather than his ministerial portfolio. Mr Scotti in particular was deeply unhappy about resigning his seat in Naples and yesterday parliament was due to decide on the position of the 10 Christian Democrats in the 24-strong cabinet who were meant to resign their seats. A former interior minister, he was never at ease in the foreign ministry. However, it was not clear whether his move yesterday was an attempt to persuade the party, which has yet to agree on a new secretary-general, to reverse its decision, or indeed whether he could be persuaded to change his mind. Now that the Chamber of Deputies has approved the economic package, which mixes revenue cuts with increased taxes and a one-off tax on bank deposits, ministers are confident it will also be passed by the Senate next week. That would clear the way for planning the 1993 budget. This is due in September and will seek to raise an extra L83,000bn next year in revenues and spending cuts to reduce Italy's huge public sector deficit, it was revealed yesterday. The 1992 deficit is likely to be L150,000bn against the original L128,000bn. The lira strengthened to 755.9 against the D-Mark yesterday in anticipation of a favourable outcome. This compared with close to 761 a week ago, not far off its 765 floor within the exchange rate mechanism. The month-old government, headed by Mr Giuliano Amato, imposed a confidence vote on the chamber of deputies in order to speed up implementation of the package. Opposition deputies had put forward 651 amendments, but these were ruled out by the main 318-246 vote. In the full 630-seat house, the government coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals has a 16-seat majority and a three-line whip was enforced by the government, with threats of expulsion from the coalition parties directed at any potential deserters. The comfortable margin was largely due to abstention by deputies of the breakaway communist grouping, Reconstructed Communism. Parliament must now turn its attention to discussion of special powers being sought by the government to address reforms of the health service, the civil service, pensions and local government finance. However, this debate will not be completed until early September, with both houses taking a summer break. In outlining plans for a tough austerity package for next year, the government said it hoped the bulk of the L83,000bn to be taken out of the economy would come from savings from structural reforms, with a further L15,000bn from privatisations.</p>

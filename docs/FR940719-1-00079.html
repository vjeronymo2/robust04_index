			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would require that the record be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. Comments are solicited on this approach and on an alternative approach wherein the Agency would develop, in coordination with the states, books specific for the required records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with other records required by this proposal, proposed paragraph (i) would require that these records be retained for at least 1 year at a surface location at the mine and be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners. Records of examinations, provide the operator and other interested parties with a history of the types of problems discovered and the types of corrective actions required. In the opinion of the Agency, a 1-year retention period is sufficient to satisfy this need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.383&blank;Escapeway Maps and Drills  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Existing paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) deal with the escapeway map and drill requirements in areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this standard was done appropriately, as with other provisions dealing with the installation and removal of mechanized mining equipment, they are being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. The Agency believes that for areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, providing escapeways and posting maps identifying these escapeways and conducting drills specified in the standard are essential to maintain safety. These requirements help to assure that miners are familiar with escape routes so that, should escape become necessary, they can reach the surface as quickly as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.384&blank;Longwall and Shortwall Travelways  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Existing &sect;75.384 addresses the requirements for a travelway on the tailgate side of a longwall or shortwall, the location and marking of the travelway, and procedures during a blockage of the travelway. While the Agency has received comments suggesting that additional involvement by the miners would be of benefit when a roof fall or other blockage occurs that prevents travel in the tailgate travelway, no changes are proposed to &sect;75.384 at the present time. The Agency believes that the existing procedures and regulations appropriately address the hazards and provide a sufficient opportunity for input and involvement for all interested parties. The following discussion reviews the appropriate procedures and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The general procedures to be followed when such a blockage occurs are specified in &sect;75.384(c). The standard requires that work on the face must cease, miners must be withdrawn, and MSHA must be notified. The standard also prohibits work on the face until the procedures set out in &sect;&sect;75.215 and 75.222 are implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 75.215 requires that the approved roof control plan specify the procedures that will be followed if a ground failure prevents travel out of the section through the tailgate side of the longwall. In this regard, &sect;75.222(g)(2), the roof control plan, would address notification of the miners, re-instruction of the miners regarding escapeways and escape procedures, re-instruction of the miners on the availability and use of self-contained self-rescue devices, monitoring and evaluation of air; location and effectiveness of communication, and a means of transportation from the section. All approved roof control and ventilation plans and revisions must be available to the miners according to current regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District managers historically have met with and will continue to meet with interested parties to discuss plans under review or previously approved. As plans are developed, reviewed, and approved, MSHA considers written comments from all interested parties. Additionally, the Act entitles a representative of the miners to accompany an MSHA representative conducting an inspection or investigation as a result of the &sect;75.384(c)(3) notification to MSHA of a blocked travelway. Finally, under &sect;103(g) of the Act, miners are entitled to request an inspection by MSHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.388&blank;Boreholes in Advance of Mining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing to revise &sect;75.388(c) to require rib holes to be drilled in one or both ribs of advancing working places described in &sect;75.388(a) ``as may be necessary for adequate protection of miners in such working places.'' The present standard requires that boreholes be drilled in at least one rib of advancing working places described in &sect;75.388(a). Although no change was intended by the Agency in promulgating the current language, comments indicate that the previous language was more specific and clearer to the mining community. The Agency is therefore proposing to adopt language similar to the previous regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.389&blank;Mining Into Inaccessible Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.389(c) addresses the special case where mining operations mine through into areas where hazards and potential hazards may be unknown. During the informational meetings and later discussions, it became apparent that differing interpretations of the application of this provision existed. To clarify the intent of the Agency, the proposal would revise existing &sect;75.389(c) by adding an exception for routine mining-through operations that are a part of a retreat mining system approved in the mine ventilation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some circumstances, the mining through occurs during routine mining into an area which is covered by an approved ventilation plan. In this case, the potential hazards have already been addressed in the ventilation plan. The Agency believes that the requirements set out in &sect;75.389(c) should not apply in this situation and proposes an exception to these requirements where the mining-through operations are part of a retreat mining system approved in the mine ventilation plan and are routine operations. Requiring the operator to submit duplicate plans does not result in any safety benefit; therefore, the level of safety provided by the existing standard is maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Natural states that it does not propose to abandon any facilities pursuant to this application. Natural requests an effective date of February 28, 1995, which would coincide with the proposed termination date of ANR Pipeline Company's (ANR) related transportation and storage agreement with Natural under ANR's Rate Schedule X&hyph;14, upon which Natural's Rate Schedule MS&hyph;2 storage service depends. Natural says that with the abandonment of the 124,648 Mcf/d, it will no longer have any services under Rate Schedule MS&hyph;2, and therefore, it additionally seeks authorization to terminate and cancel its Rate Schedule MS&hyph;2, effective February 28, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> December 29, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

Given the commonality of the facts and issues and the interrelationship of Transwestern's application and this petition, TGC requests that the application and petition be consolidated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> TGC states that the gathering facilities are located in Clark County, Kansas; Beaver, Comanche, Custer, Ellis, Harper, Roger Mills and Woodward Counties, Oklahoma; Cimmaron, Crane, Gray, Hansford, Hemphill, Hutchinson, Lipscomb, Loving, Ochiltree, Pecos, Reeves, Roberts, Sherman, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas, and Eddy, Lea, Roosevelt, and Chaves Counties, New Mexico. TGC states that the facilities to be transferred are contained in 51 Transwestern systems and are described in detail in Exhibit T of Transwestern's application, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGC states that it will offer gathering, dehydrating and compression services to producers and shippers seeking such services and will provide such services on a basis that is not unduly discriminatory. In addition, TGC contends that it will be enabled to compete with the numerous other non-jurisdictional gatherers and processors of gas in the States of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico upon granting of the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is stated that the gathering facilities TGC will acquire perform services in the production area prior to transportation in interstate commerce. TGC contends that these facilities and services are within the production and gathering exemption of the Natural Gas Act (NGA). As a result, they should be declared wholly exempt from the Commission's NGA jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGC states that the Commission has already disclaimed jurisdiction over gathering facilities which have been spun down to interstate pipeline companies' non-regulated affiliates in several cases. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  TGC seeks a disclaimer of jurisdiction as to the gathering facilities from the Commission similar to that in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mid-Louisiana  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Arkla Gathering Services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> TGC cites  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Mid-Louisiana Gas Company and Fairbanks Gathering Company,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 FERC &para; 61,225 (1994);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Arkla Gathering Services Company,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 FERC &para; 61,257 (1994),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> CNG Transmission Corporation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 FERC &para; 61,330 (1994) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> KN Energy, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> KN Interstate Gas Transmission Company,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 65 FERC &para; 61,168 (1994), where the Commission concluded that systems which qualify as gathering systems under the primary function test will be exempt from Commission jurisdiction after they are transferred to an interstate pipeline affiliate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to TGC, the Commission, in determining whether facilities are exempt production and gathering facilities, has relied upon the primary function test described in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Farmland Industries, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23 FERC &para; 61,063 (1983) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amerada Hess Corporation, et al.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 52 FERC &para; 61,268 (1990) and 67 FERC &para; 61,254 (1994). Under the primary function test, TGC states that the Commission considers the length and diameter of a facility, the extension of the facility beyond the central point in the field, the geographical configuration of the facility, the location of processing plants and compressors, the location of wells along all or part of the facility and the operating pressure of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGC argues that the Commission has also indicated that the criteria in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Farmland  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are not exclusive, and that other criteria, including the purpose, location and operation of the facility, the general business activity of the owner and whether the jurisdictional determination is consistent with the objectives of the NGA or Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), may well be considered. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Additionally, TGC contends that the Commission, in reaching its determination on the primary function of the facilities, has indicated that it will weigh all the relevant factors and a determination of gathering does not require a finding that all the criteria point in the same direction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amerada Hess Corporation, 52 FERC &para; 61,268 at 61,987, n.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amerada Hess Corporation, 52 FERC &para; 61,268 at 61,991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> TGC submits that, in general, there is an overall total of approximately 1,795.13 miles of pipeline segments which will be transferred to TGC with diameters ranging from 2 to 20 inches. It is stated that approximately 3.97 miles (0.002 percent) are 2 inches in diameter; 1.12 miles (0.001 percent) are 3 inches in diameter; 765.81 (43 percent) are 4 inches in diameter; 413 miles (23 percent) are 6 inches in diameter; 217 miles (12 percent) are 8 inches in diameter; 245 miles (14 percent) are 10 inches in diameter; 61 miles (3 percent) are 12 inches in diameter; 71 miles (4 percent) are 16 inches in diameter; and 17 miles (one percent) are 20 inches in diameter. TGC states that the lengths and diameters of the facilities are consistent with a gathering determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to TGC, the central point in the field test, in general, is not applicable to the facilities involved here. This is because, as a rule, the facilities exhibit characteristics which exempt them from the application of the test. However, even if the test were applied to the facilities, the central point would be the points where all gas collected along the facilities is delivered for transmission into one of Transwestern's transmission lines. TGC states that since the gathering facilities are all upstream of the central points on each of Transwestern's systems, application of the central point in the field test would support a finding that the primary function of the facilities is gathering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGC states that the Commission has indicated that gathering systems commonly fall into three types of configurations: (1) web-like; (2) short and small in diameter; and (3) backbone or spine-like. It is stated that the short, small diameter lines connect wells or fields directly to mainline transmission or other ``backbone'' gathering systems, and that the backbone structures are generally longer and larger in diameter with numerous feeder lines interconnected along their length. TGC contends that the facilities to be transferred by Transwestern all exhibit configurations which are typical of gathering systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGC submits that there are a total of 80 compressor units with a total of 60,696 horsepower (hp) located on the facilities. It is stated that 26 percent of the units have less than 300 hp; 14 percent have between 300 and 700 hp; 20 percent have between 700 and 999 hp; 30 percent have between 1,000 and 1,199 hp and 10 percent have more than 1,200 hp. TGC states that all of the compressor units being transferred by Transwestern are incidental to the gathering function because they are either compressors used to boost low pressure gas to pressures which enable the gas to be moved to the next compressor station or used to boost gas to pressures which enable the gas to enter one of Transwestern's transmission lines. Thus, TGC concludes that the primary function of compression on the facilities is consistent with a finding of gathering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to TGC, a total of eight treater plants, which treat gas prior to its transmission to ensure that the gas is pipeline quality, will be transferred by Transwestern. As such, TGC argues that the primary function of the plants is entirely consistent with a finding that the facilities are gathering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGC contends that there are approximately 2,979 wells located along the length of the facilities to be transferred by Transwestern. Of the 42 systems containing facilities to be transferred, TGC states that 3 have 200 or more wells connected to them; 6 have between 100 and 199 wells connected to them; 10 have between 50 and 99 wells; 13 have between 16 and 49 wells and 10 have fewer than 16 wells. It is stated that all the lines leading to the wells have very small diameters, usually consisting of 4-inch diameter pipe. TGC submits that application of this criterion supports the conclusion that the facilities in question perform a gathering function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

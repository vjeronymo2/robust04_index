			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Seoul sanctions plea is snubbed: China, N Korea 'interdependent' Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea's foreign minister, arrived last night in Beijing on a hastily-arranged mission to seek Chinese support for sanctions against North Korea, as China re-affirmed the closeness of relations with Pyongyang. China's President Jiang Zemin told North Korea's military chief of staff ties between their two countries were 'interdependent, like teeth and lips,' according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua. South Korea's President Kim Young-sam said sanctions were unavoidable if North Korea kept refusing full nuclear inspections. Mr Lee Hong-koo, South Korea's national unification minister, predicted it would take two to four weeks for the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution seeking sanctions. The US, Japan and South Korea are backing a resolution to impose immediate but gradually-escalating sanctions; China is opposing the plan and urging continued talks instead. 'Sanctions are not a sensible choice; they would only aggravate the crisis,' the China Daily newspaper quoted foreign minister Qian Qichen. Japan's foreign minister is to fly to Beijing over the weekend. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata remained hopeful Beijing would be able to convince North Korea to agree to inspections. 'China has tremendous influence over North Korea. It is making various kinds of efforts through dialogue which I hope continues.' On a visit to Kiev, Ukraine, North Korea's foreign minister, Mr Kim Yong-nam, urged the US to sit down 'for a third round of talks'. Nuclear inspections could then be allowed and nuclear fuel preserved and measured, he added. If direct North Korean-US dialogue was not resumed, 'not only won't the nuclear problem be solved, but it will seriously aggravate the situation.' Last night Mr Mike McCurry, US State Department spokesman, did not rule out the possibility of new talks but said Washington did not at present believe there was a basis for these. Another State Department official, deputy spokeswoman Christine Shelly, said North Korea had crossed a 'point of no return' by unloading virtually all 8,000 fuel rods from its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, thereby destroying evidence about its past use of plutonium. Pyongyang has threatened to quit the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if sanctions are imposed. 'The target of North Korea's nuclear weapons is us. We have to stop North Korea from developing them at any cost,' South Korea's President Kim told the National Security Council.</p>

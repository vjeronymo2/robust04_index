			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV PLAGIARISM CHARGE  </P> <P> It seems clear to me that once CNN reporter Gloria Hillard's material hits the  network, it's no longer personal property.  </P> <P> Since CNN allows its affiliates to use material from the network without  restriction, no ethical boundary has been crossed. It is not plagiarism to use  somebody's material with his or her full consent.  </P> <P> Hillard's indignation is something that should be worked out privately with her  employer.  </P> <P> W. MARK McKIBBEN  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P></p>

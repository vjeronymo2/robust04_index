			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 21 WILL VIE TO BE CITIES' FIRST COUNCIL MEMBERS  </P> <P> Twenty-one residents of El Toro and Laguna Hills have placed their names on the  March 5 ballot to become council members if voters approve separate cityhood  measures that day.  </P> <P> The candidates who filed with the Orange County registrar of voters before  Thursday's deadline include several who have campaigned for the creation of  Orange County's 30th and 31st cities.  </P> <P> With five council seats open in each city, there are 11 candidates in El Toro  and 10 in Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> And five of them have actually won council elections before, only to be denied  their positions when voters simultaneously rejected companion cityhood  measures: A referendum to create one large city for the Saddleback Valley was  defeated in 1988. A year later, Laguna Hills voters turned down by a slim  margin a smaller cityhood proposal.  </P> <P> But after numerous compromises that resulted in the current plan -- 58,000  citizens in El Toro and 23,000 citizens in Laguna Hills -- and the drawing of  city boundaries that are acceptable to neighboring communities, little  opposition to cityhood is expected in the March election.  </P> <P> Some of the previously victorious candidates said they are hoping that this  time, finally, they will be able to serve.  </P> <P> Most contenders said this week that they will campaign to keep local taxes at a  minimum, increase law enforcement, preserve neighborhoods, and improve parks  and recreational facilities.  </P> <P> According to records and interviews, the candidates for the El Toro council  include:  </P> <P> * Jim Berkey, whose age and occupation were unavailable Thursday.  </P> <P> * Philip Dean, 33, a medical-industry consultant.  </P> <P> * Dana L. Desrosier, 41, who retired last year from the U.S. Marine Corps.  </P> <P> * Richard T. Dixon, 42, owner of a health insurance brokerage.  </P> <P> * Bob Forsberg, whose age and occupation were unavailable.  </P> <P> * Tim Link, 35, an elementary-school teacher.  </P> <P> * Marcia Rudolph, 50, an elementary-school teacher.  </P> <P> * Jon Smith, 30, a television and video producer.  </P> <P> * Ann Van Haun, 56, a UC Irvine administrative employee.  </P> <P> * Ray Wallenthin, a businessman.  </P> <P> * Helen Wilson, 40, a community volunteer.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills candidates include:  </P> <P> * Randal Bressette, 54, a financial planner.  </P> <P> * Melody Carruth, 38, a community volunteer.  </P> <P> * Joel Lautenschleger, age and occupation unavailable.  </P> <P> * David Leland, 38, an accountant.  </P> <P> * Paul J. Mayjack, 22, a financial planner.  </P> <P> * Craig Scott, 37, an attorney.  </P> <P> * William Simmons, 46, a businessman.  </P> <P> * Leslie Allan Songstad Jr., 44, an attorney.  </P> <P> * David Stabbe, 51, an accountant.  </P> <P> * Gregory N. Weiler, age unavailable, an attorney.  </P></p>

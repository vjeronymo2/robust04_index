			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals and interest costs leave Waddington 22% lower HIGHER interest charges and restructuring costs knocked pre-tax profits at John Waddington, the packaging, printing and games company, back 22 per cent to Pounds 12.5m last year. The company, which yesterday announced the appointment of managing director Mr Martin Buckley as chief executive, revealed a better operating performance, however. Profits were just Pounds 340,000 down at Pounds 18.3m on sales slightly ahead to Pounds 231m (Pounds 228m). Interest charges rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.6m for the 12 months to April 4, although gearing by the year-end had fallen from 54 to 42 per cent. Net debt was down by Pounds 6m to Pounds 29m. The 140 redundancies, out of a total of 3,800 staff, and other cost-cutting measures had resulted in an exceptional Pounds 2.2m charge. However, they would save more than Pounds 2m on an annual basis, said Mr Geoffrey Gibson, finance director. Packaging showed the greatest improvement last year with a Pounds 2m increase in operating profits to Pounds 11.5m. The printing division suffered declining demand and severe competition in the UK business stationery market. Operating profits fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 2.5m. Games, for which Waddington is best known with names such as Cluedo and Monopoly, fell by Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 3.4m at the operating level. Mr David Perry, who was appointed deputy chairman yesterday, said the company would benefit from the Pounds 96m five-year capital expenditure programme: 'I believe the result of that investment will start to show regardless of any improvement in the economy.' Earnings per share dropped from 14.75p to 11.59p. The final dividend was held at 4.3p, for an unchanged total of 7.9p. COMMENT The only surprise in Waddington's results was its decision to take the Pounds 5.3m charge on the Pacplas plastics disposal below the line. But since this is in accordance with current law, there were few real quibbles. The capex programme has yet to prove that it can bring dramatic returns, but will ensure that operating profits are protected. The new Pounds 16m carton factory is a feather in Waddington's cap, but is getting lower prices than expected. Credit must go to management for holding operating profits and increasing the packaging return. Nevertheless, the jury appears to be out on whether it can provide significant earnings growth. Forecasts are for Pounds 17m this year, and the shares at 204p give a multiple of 13 times. A solid company, if unexciting at the moment. People, Page 18</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BRYAN MURRAY: TIES TO THE WASHINGTON CAPITALS STILL BIND  </P> <P> Now he watches the Washington Capitals on television. His wife goes to a  Capital game and he stays home. He's taken up light jogging. He works on his  car. He's thinking about painting his house. "I've got plenty of time," said  Bryan Murray, sipping morning coffee in his living room.  </P> <P> He'd rather be behind the bench where, of all people, his brother Terry now  stands -- a switch that surprised both brothers and confounded the large Murray  family and their friends in Shawville, Quebec, becoming the chief topic of  conversation in the little hockey hub.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Gambrills, Md., Bryan Murray wrestles with life on hold; between  phone calls from well-wishers, he misses the pressures, the joys, the action of  coaching the Capitals. He'd welcome it all -- even if the pressures were  greater than most had known.  </P> <P> "I don't have a two-year contract," Murray revealed, putting down his coffee.  He said he only had a one-year deal.  </P> <P> To ensure a second season of coaching, he added, the Capitals would have had to  advance beyond their division in this year's playoffs -- something they have  never done. His mission had been clear and ominous: Make the playoffs and win  at least the first round. Or else.  </P> <P> "I think if we lost in the first round, it was probably a foregone conclusion,"  he said.  </P> <P> "If we won the first round and went into the second round and played well and  got beaten, then there would be a time period where we would talk about what  was going on. It wasn't automatic that I was going to be out of here. But it  wasn't automatic that I'd roll into another year of my contract."  </P> <P> The second year was automatic only under one condition -- "if we got by the  first couple of rounds."  </P> <P> Murray said his contract had been worked out with David Poile, the Capitals'  general manager, who this week confirmed the coach's account. Poile also  confirmed Murray's explanation that a two-year coaching contract had been  announced by the team so as not to put added pressure on the players, or, as  Murray put it, "so the players wouldn't be under the impression I was at the  whim of them playing well or not playing well."  </P> <P> "That is something we mutually agreed would be in his best interest," said  Poile.  </P> <P> "When I signed the contract," said Murray, "it was very up front. 'Look, Bryan,  it's going to be: If you win in the playoffs, great, you'll be here. If you  don't win in the playoffs, in all likelihood we'll make a change.' "  </P> <P> As a result, Murray set a course that he believed could lead the Capitals to  unprecedented success -- as well as save the job he was fired from last week.  </P> <P> "My whole planning," said Murray, "was for the playoffs. Adjustments were made  for the playoffs knowing full well that when you go that route you're  sacrificing a little bit during the regular schedule."  </P> <P> Poile and Murray went to a much younger team this season. The shift, Murray  believed, would pay off in April -- and the elusive May that has always found  the Capitals golfing.  </P> <P> "This is what's frustrating to me, I guess," said Murray. "We made quite a  number of changes. We gave up veterans like Bobby Gould and Lou Franceschetti  and Peter Sundstrom. Bengt Gustafsson went back to Europe. We went with Rob  Murray, Yvon Corriveau, Steve Leach, Alan May, Billy Houlder -- the idea being  that they would grow from day one of the schedule to playoff time.  </P> <P> "In a couple cases, these are very different type players than we have had,  more able to withstand the grinding of playoff hockey. So the adjustment was  made on purpose, to have a different type of team come playoff time.  </P> <P> "The unfortunate part of it for us was that (Rod) Langway, (Scott) Stevens and  (Neil) Sheehy got hurt. As much as anything, they were the leadership on the  team, the stability in the room that we lost when we gave up Louie and a Bobby  Gould. Because you're not going to get a rookie to step up when you have a  couple of injuries to your veteran guys, to be the mainstays, the guiding  forces that Rod and Scott were.  </P> <P> "So when we started to fall a little bit, we had a tougher time getting to the  emotional level, getting the confidence level back to where it should be. It's  not their playing necesssarily that you miss; it's their leadership, what they  do for the team in the room."  </P> <P> Of course, over the years, there was the never-ending need for a goaltender.  Almost always, in Murray's tenure, the Capitals bowed in the playoffs to a  "hot" goaltender. And even now, Murray believes the Capitals still need another  goaltender -- one who can carry them a distance in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I think Don Beaupre has been fine," said Murray. "I was really very happy with  him. Beaupre can play a role on the team. Bob Mason to me never really came  back to the level he was at when he left here.  </P> <P> "I think -- and we've talked about it for a long time in the organization --  for the Capitals to be real successful this year I think they have to add one  more goaltender. It's got to be a good goaltender with the ability to win a  game.  </P> <P> "I think we've come up short in that category. To be successsful in our league  today, you have to have a top-notch guy in that net.  </P> <P> "You look at the goaltenders who played for the Capitals since I've been here  -- Dave Parro, Pat Riggin, Al Jensen, Pete Peeters -- none of them has stayed  in the National League or been successful in the National League after they  left the Capitals. Peeters is the only one who stayed any time at all this  year, in Philadelphia, and he can't win a game, it looks like."  </P> <P> Clint Malarchuk?  </P> <P> "Clint was a great regular-season goaltender, but we didn't think he was the  answer," said Murray.  </P> <P> "I agree with Bryan," Poile said, "we haven't had in our franchise history the  goaltender that made the difference."  </P> <P> Murray, 47, Capitals coach since 1981 and eighth in winning percentage in the  history of NHL coaches, said he hasn't been approached by another team. He  wouldn't be surprised if nothing happens for the rest of the season.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he has his memories: Coming here and helping to turn around the  franchise quickly; the Capitals making the playoffs the first time; a 107-point  season; a Patrick Division title; playoff wins, excruciating playoff losses. He  believes the "constant commentary" in the media that the playoffs are the  "only" thing that count "adds tremendous pressure to management."  </P> <P> But Murray is neither looking back nor resting on accomplishments. For the time  being, he roots hard for the Capitals. When he can't get the game on  television, he turns on radio. He finds that he has to know the score. "I still  feel it's part my team," he said with a smile. "I've been here so long and I  take such pride in the way some of the players have improved, and the way they  played for me. So I hope Terry lets me share a little bit of that for at least  the balance of this year."  </P> <P> But if the Capitals are paying Bryan Murray off for the season -- a reported  $175,000 annual salary -- he'd trade his forced inactivity to work behind some  NHL team's bench. Hockey always has been his love and the pro game his life  since he landed the coaching job with the Hershey Bears in 1980.  </P> <P> Ever since he left his hometown of Shawville to coach Regina in the Western  Hockey League and ever since the younger Terry left home as a teen-ager to play  junior hockey in Ottawa, the two brothers have been followed intently from a  distance by the Murray family.  </P> <P> Two of 10 children, they are the special pride of a town that for years has  applauded their every success. Nowhere was the news of the Capitals' coaching  change received with such deeply felt shock and mixed emotions as in  snow-covered Shawville.  </P> <P> It was a long road from Shawville for both Murrays. An English-speaking Quebec  town of 2,000, Shawville is nestled in farm country near the Ontario line 50  miles northwest of Ottawa. In winter it features endless banks of snow. Ice to  skate on lasts until spring.  </P> <P> Terry laced on skates at age 4, began playing games at 5.  </P> <P> "After school, that was the thing to do," Terry recalled recently, having  directed one of his first Capitals practices. "Just grab the hockey stick and  skates and go play."  </P> <P> One action spot was a neighbor's backyard rink that had boards and lights. The  kids kept it swept clean. Fifteen to a side sometimes.  </P> <P> They'd play in the street -- all ice, no traffic.  </P> <P> "Saturday was the big day," said Terry. "You'd go down to the arena and you'd  have your organized hockey."  </P> <P> On Victoria Street, which leads into the center of Shawville, is a store with  signs: "Murray's Automotive" and "Murray's Sports and Casual Wear." Two other  Murray brothers work here, Bill on the sporting goods side of the building,  Barrie in auto supplies. In this country, little is more important than having  hockey equipment and a car that works.  </P> <P> "Me retire from hockey?" said Bill, 42. "I haven't retired. I'm just not  playing this year. I'll be back next year."  </P> <P> A good defenseman who might have made the NHL himself had it not been for a  broken wrist, Bill has kept close to the game, playing annually in an  industrial league. The only reason he isn't playing this season is because on  Oct. 1, when training began, he was finishing building his new house. "If I'm  going to play, I want to be there full-time," he said. "We're a dedicated  bunch."  </P> <P> Clarence Murray, 81, instilled in his sons not so much the love of hockey as  the "work ethic" they all speak of. He commuted to his work at the power  company in Ottawa. With the snowstorms, the drives could be rugged -- but no  more so than the 150-mile round trip Bryan took daily to Rockland, Ont., for  two years when he coached the Rockland Nationals junior team.  </P> <P> Rhoda Murray raised the five boys and five girls. The Murrays lived first on a  farm, then in town. A rugged country woman, she never worried about the boys  playing a rough game such as hockey. "It was better," she said, "than having  them get into mischief, don't you think?"  </P> <P> Clarence and Rhoda, Bill and Barrie and their five sisters express the feelings  Bryan said they held: "They're very happy for Terry and they're disappointed  for me. They're prejudiced in the fact they felt the team acted a little quick.  In turn, they know Terry's ambition was to coach and they're very happy for  him."  </P> <P> They're warm-hearted people in cold country. Every summer Murray returns to a  cottage on a lake outside of town. His Gambrills home, in the woods, simulates  his Canadian cottage. Another reminder of his roots is a painting of  Shawville's narrow main street as it looked a few years ago, with one stoplight  and the town hall with a flag on top and old signs along the block -- Dodge,  Shell, Coca-Cola.  </P> <P> Clarence Murray gets out almost every day, stopping at the coffee shop downtown  where the conversation turns to his sons when he walks in -- unless the subject  already is the Murray boys. The elder Murray always made as many of Terry's  junior games in Ottawa as he could; he watches as many Capitals games as he can  pull in. Most nights, he'll watch any hockey game. "It doesn't matter," said  Rhoda, "who's playing." In this instance, the sons led the father to hockey.  </P> <P> If Terry and Bryan never were pushed in any specific direction, they made the  most of opportunities. In 1979, Bryan got his coaching break with Regina when  it looked as if he would turn out to be a Shawville businessman with his  brothers. "One year when I was playing at Pembroke Junior A," said Bill, "I  brought Terry along for the experience. And he made the team." Terry was 14.  </P> <P> Being eight years younger, Terry wasn't particularly close to Bryan when they  were growing up. "When I'm 14 years old, I'm sure as heck not hanging around  with a guy who's 22," said Terry. In fact, he had his brother for a teacher at  Shawville High. Bryan taught physical education. "He organized everything,"  said Terry. "He left a big impression on me."  </P> <P> By then, Bryan knew that his thoughts of a career in the NHL were daydreams.  He'd watched the old six-team league on TV on Saturday nights. Even if he were  a good enough skater, which he doubted, there weren't jobs. Before graduating  from McGill University, he did the most practical thing: He went to work in a  mine.  </P> <P> Terry was 19 and in his third year of junior play in Ottawa, living in a  boarding house with hockey players and still thinking of joining the Royal  Canadian Mounted Police, when it was pointed out to him by his coach that he  might have a chance to play in the recently expanded NHL. At a St. Louis Blues  training camp in Ottawa, he saw players he played against. Terry knew it was no  idle dream that he could make this league.  </P> <P> As the two brothers progressed along different routes in hockey, they grew  closer. In 1982, they were reunited when Terry finished up 12 NHL season with  the Capitals under his brother. Then he became Bryan's assistant coach for six  years. They live near each other; their daughters are friends; they car pool.  "We really grew together," said Terry. "We had a lot of conversations. A lot of  dinners."  </P> <P> Terry was in his second season as head coach of the Capitals' Baltimore farm  team when Poile one day recently placed his almost daily phone call to him.  What a jolt. Poile wanted him to replace his brother. Later, when Terry called  Bryan he said: "First thing I said was: 'Bryan, I'm really sorry the way things  have turned out for you. I just hope that everything works out real well and  you land on your two feet.' He said, 'Hey, I had a good run at it and now it's  your time.' "  </P></p>

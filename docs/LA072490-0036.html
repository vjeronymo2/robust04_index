			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINT/COUNTERPOINT;  </P> <P> TWO MORE APPROACHES TO SOOTHING COLICKY BABIES  </P> <P> Infant colic affects about one in 10 babies, usually beginning by the age of  four weeks. The baby cries or screams excessively, may draw up its legs and  grow red in the face.  </P> <P> Doctors believe colic may be caused by intestinal spasms.  </P> <P> Historically, there has been no shortage of suggestions for frantic parents:  Rock the baby. Offer a pacifier. Feed the baby. Give prescribed antispasmodic  drugs.  </P> <P> Here are two more ideas:  </P> <P> </P> <P> MOVEMENT AND DIET CHANGES: Dr. Kenneth L. Saul, Thousand Oaks pediatrician and  chief of pediatrics at Los Robles Regional Medical Center, Thousand Oaks  </P> <P>  "Put the baby on a swing. Take her for a ride in the car. If that doesn't  work, change the diet. If a baby is formula-fed, change formulas. If the  formula is milk-based, switch to soy-based. If a baby is breast-fed, I advise  the mother to avoid chocolate, caffeine, cabbage and spicy foods. If that  doesn't work, I tell her to avoid dairy products entirely. This usually gives  good results."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PREVENTIVE FEEDING: Dr. Janet McCormick, Long Beach pediatrician and staff  pediatrician at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center  </P> <P>  "Colic has to do with air swallowing. Minimize the air the baby swallows and  burp out the air that does get swallowed. Here's how. Concentrate on more  appropriate feeding techniques. Elevate the baby during the feeding so he or  she is not horizontal. Hold the baby so his head and shoulders are at a 20- or  30-degree angle. The air the baby swallows will rise to the top of the stomach  and be burped out. Burp the baby three or four times during a single feeding.  Throw away old nipples or enlarge the hole in the nipple so it is big enough to  allow a slow, free flow of milk."  </P></p>

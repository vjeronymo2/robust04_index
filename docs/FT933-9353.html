			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Westminster Health beats forecast with rise to Pounds 4.3m WESTMINSTER Health Care, the nursing home group, has beaten the profit forecast made at its flotation in April. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-May were Pounds 4.28m compared to a forecast Pounds 3.85m and Pounds 1.67m in 1991-92. The shares, floated at 260p, rose 3p to 307p. Mr Pat Carter, chief executive, said the Community Care Act, which came into effect on April 1, had boosted admissions in March, but caused a drop in April. The rate of admissions had improved since then and was back to the pre-March level. The change to local authority - rather than central government - funding for patients in nursing homes, had led to some rise in prices, he said. The proportion of WHC's patients fully publicly funded had fallen from 58 to 48 per cent over the year, as WHC shifted the balance towards private patients, who are charged more, and contracted beds. Mr Carter said the reforms were on balance beneficial, with local authority purchasers linking price to quality and paying a wider range of prices according to needs, for instance paying more for dementia sufferers. Also rates were varying geographically, allowing prices to rise in London and the south-east which had been poorly served in the past. Falling land prices in these areas meant WHC was increasing the proportion of its homes in the south. Group turnover rose 58 per cent, from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 36.9m, partly through a 35 per cent increase in beds from 2,400 to 3,234 with 11 homes opening during the year, and through average price rises of 5 per cent. Operating profits were Pounds 9.16m (Pounds 5.35m) and the net interest charge was Pounds 4.74m (Pounds 3.59m). The group received the Pounds 64m net proceeds of the float late in the financial year. Mr Kent Phippen, finance director, said borrowings were Pounds 52.5m at the start of the financial year, and rose by Pounds 26.8m as capital expenditure totalled Pounds 25.9m, but fell to Pounds 15m at the year end, thanks to the float proceeds. Debt was 17.8 per cent of shareholders funds. Mr Phippen said this was projected to rise to over 30 per cent in the current year and to about 45 per cent in 1994-95. Capital spending in the current year was forecast at some Pounds 24m with another 716 beds due to open. A further 700 beds were planned in each of the next two financial years. After a 15 per cent tax charge, earnings per share were 12.8p (5.3p) compared to the flotation forecast of 11.7p. On a pro-forma basis, if the group had had the float proceeds for the full year, earnings per share were 16p against a forecast of 15.6p. A 0.5p dividend is proposed, as forecast. COMMENT WHC has confirmed its position as one of the quality operators in the fast expanding long-term care sector with these results. The float coincided with a far-reaching shake-up in the industry, as the community care reforms came into effect, which has had a dampening effect on occupancy rates in the short term. However, WHC's homes are at the top end of the quality range and it should benefit from the long term trends in the market. The shift towards more private patients should help margins. Conservative forecasts for the current year are about Pounds 10.5m pre-tax, though some go to Pounds 11.3m. With a prospective p/e of 17, the shares are not cheap but still good value.</p>

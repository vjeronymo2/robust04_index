			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: BELL;  </P> <P> ARSON BELIEVED CAUSE OF BLAZE AT CORONA SCHOOL  </P> <P> Fire officials confirmed Wednesday that an early-morning fire that destroyed a  kindergarten classroom at Corona Elementary School in Bell was deliberately  set.  </P> <P> The blaze, which was reported at 1:29 a.m. Tuesday, caused about $250,000 in  damage, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Bill Franklin said.  </P> <P> "It's of an incendiary origin," Franklin said, when asked if arson was  considered the cause of the fire. "It's definitely that."  </P> <P> Investigators have not identified any suspects in the fire, Franklin said.  </P> <P> The fire appeared to have started on a bookshelf a few feet from a doorway, and  destroyed virtually all of the classroom, which was separated from the rest of  the elementary school by a breezeway. There was no other damage to the school  at 3825 Bell Ave., Franklin said.  </P> <P> Franklin said investigators are not sure how the fire was started. "There is no  evidence of a booster," such as gasoline, to ignite the blaze, he said.  </P> <P> The 27 kindergarten students displaced by the fire are attending class in the  school's main building.  </P></p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / M&amp;S offers graduates 1-year jobs MARKS and Spencer, the clothes and food retailing chain, is to employ 100 graduates on one-year contracts because of 'concern about graduate unemployment'. The temporary contract jobs are in addition to the company's normal graduate intake. M and S said the scheme was being sponsored by Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of the company. Sir Richard said the special programme 'will enable an additional 100 graduates to benefit from our one-year training programme even though we are unable to guarantee a full career'. The move follows a recent report from members of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, of which M and S is a leading member, which said employers were forecasting a fall of 6.5 per cent in vacancies for graduates this year, compared with last year. Since the forecast there have been reports of a late surge in interest by employers in taking on extra graduate recruits. Details of the M and S scheme were disclosed yesterday by Personnel Today magazine. The temporary recruits will take part in the training programme for permanent graduate recruits and will be paid the same annual salary of Pounds 14,000. They will receive career counselling to help them find alternative employment at the end of their year with the company. Ms Michelle Mendelsson, M and S recruitment manager, said that if the company saw outstanding performers among the 100 temporary recruits it would make permanent jobs available. The scheme was 'absolutely not' a way of identifying high-flyers and eliminating less able trainees without any further commitment, she said. M and S said it believed it was the first company to provide a temporary work scheme of this nature to graduates. Those who took part in it would 'have the benefit of being able to list work experience with M and S on their CV,' it said. The company announced recently that it would be taking an extra 100 graduates into permanent employment. It originally decided to take 150 graduates. It said one of the reasons for raising its graduate intake to 250 was because of the declining number of A-level entrants. More sixth-formers have been continuing their education rather than seeking jobs. In 1991 M and S froze graduate appointments after having offered jobs to 100 candidates - 70 went on to join the company last year.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (1): Tougher days ahead - As Portugal faces increasing political and economic change, the time of easy successes for the financial community is over, reports Patrick Blum. The sector is experiencing stronger competition from abroad and further restructuring is needed Lisbon waterfront, the Finance Ministry, Stock Exchange and several government departments are located in this area of the city. Lisbon is also Portugal's chief port and lies on the right bamk of the Tagua River, 13 kms from the river's entry into the Atlantic Ocean, at the westernmost fringe of the European continent. Portugal's main towns and cities include Oporto, Setubal, Colombra and Brage. Pictured below, Lisbon's main square, the Praca do Comercio. THIS YEAR is likely to go by unusually quickly for Portugal. First, it is having to speed up the pace of reform to meet next year's European Community deadlines for the internal market. It must prepare also for its first EC presidency starting on January 1 - exactly six years after it joined the Community. Before that, a general election, due by October at the latest, will decide whether Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister and leader of the ruling Social Democratic party, remains in power for a third term of government. At stake will be a particular model and style of government whose achievements and shortcomings are likely to come under close scrutiny in the run-up to the election. The result of the vote cannot be forecast, but the tenant at the Sao Bento prime ministerial residence will have his work cut out. Economic pressures are building up in spite of some striking successes. In the years that followed its accession to the Community, Portugal benefited from propitious domestic circumstances, a favourable international environment and considerable goodwill and assistance to help it modernise and catch up with its European partners. But it is still a relatively poor country, and after five years of rapid growth and development, new problems have emerged and some old ones are re-asserting themselves with a vengeance. The good news is that Portugal continued to grow at a faster rate than any of its European partners last year with the gross domestic product rising by 4.4 per cent. Investment, up by more than 8 per cent, remained sturdy, and foreign investment rising by over 60 per cent was buoyant. Official unemployment was negligible and industrial activity high. The current account was almost balanced. The bad news is that inflation at 13.4 per cent - more than twice the EC average - resisted official efforts to bring it down. The budget deficit at close to 7 per cent of GDP is proving equally difficult to reduce, and it is keeping interest rates at punishingly high levels squeezing industry. Traditional sectors from agriculture to textiles are inefficient and facing their most serious crisis yet. In the past few years, the government has carried out or began several important reforms. A land reform has opened the way for privatising the large collective farms, the gradual privatisation of companies nationalised in 1975 and 1976 has started to reduce the weight of the public sector in the economy, new labour laws have relaxed some of the rigidities of the labour market and eased conditions for dismissals, a tax reform has made tax collection more efficient, and the financial sector has seen the most extensive liberalisation and deregulation of all, spurred along by the need to meet the approaching 1992 deadline for an EC-wide internal market in financial services. But there is still much to be done. Mr Rui Machete, past minister in several governments, former president of the Social Democratic party and the chairman of the parliament's budget, finance and planning committee, identifies four areas in need of fundamental structural change: agriculture, industry, social welfare and education. Portuguese agriculture employs about 19 per cent of the active population but accounts for only six per cent of gross domestic product. Fewer than 15 years ago, Portugal's population was predominantly rural, yet it cannot feed itself and depends for more than half of its food on imports. Part of the problem is due to an excessive division of the land into a plethora of tiny unviable plots, mainly in the north, and inefficient huge co-operative farms created after the revolution, mainly in the south. Productivity is among the lowest in the EC and most farmers survive thanks to generous subsidies. Mr Machete says the land structure and the system of agricultural price subsidies will have to change, though he expects it will take several years of transition. Industry also faces the challenge of the internal market. Most Portuguese companies remain unprepared for the inevitable increase in competition after 1992, and continue to rely on old production methods, low wages, and outdated management methods. There are exceptions, and larger companies, many of them foreign or with international links or partners, find they can achieve productivity levels comparable to those in other European countries. In contrast to the growing apprehension of some Portuguese business groups, foreign investors exude optimism, seeing in Portugal's relative backwardness the springboard for sustained and dynamic development. In the long run, foreign investment can have a ripple effect throughout the economy, encouraging the development of local suppliers and helping to raise quality standards, but the adaptation will be difficult. A large number of small and medium-size companies will face a straightforward choice: modernise or close - many will probably have to close. Industrial restructuring will inevitably lead to job losses which will have to be alleviated through a more efficient and expanded social security system since it will not be possible to retrain all displaced workers. Education is in a sorry state. Teachers are underpaid, career conditions unattractive and schools and colleges plagued with recurring strikes. Illiteracy at anything between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the population, depending on the statistics, is still widespread and educational standards are generally low. As old industries give way to new ones or modernise, training and retraining have become more important. The EC is helping through its social fund to finance training in private industry. But as Portugal prepares for the future, education will need greater resources with more emphasis placed on quality. Reducing the weight of the state in the economy is another huge task. In economic terms, the state accounts for nearly 40 per cent of GDP, but its weight in particular sectors is overwhelming. In the financial sector, it still controls about 80 per cent of the market. Once the privatisation programme is completed, the two big financial groups remaining in state hands together will have between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the market. Privatisations are a key element in the government's strategy to reduce the weight of the state and open the economy to market forces, but the process has been slow and prone to delays. Conditions are less favourable now than they were 18 months or a year ago, investors have become more wary especially since share prices of privatised companies have tended to fall below their original, often high, selling price. This may not matter too much for big domestic or foreign groups whose objective is to win market positions, but it has shaken the confidence of smaller investors. Diminishing the size of the state is only part of a wider need to reduce bureaucracy and bureaucratic interference. 'There is an enormous bureaucracy run by incompetent people who interfere in too many areas and in excessive detail,' says a senior businessman airing a common complaint. Political parties and trade unions which should counter-balance the state, often operate as if they were state institutions, making it difficult at times to dissociate administrative from political decisions. 'We've progressed and reached a higher stage of problems and issues to deal with,' Mr Machete says. Some of the government's critics are less charitable and argue it has wasted a unique opportunity since it had a free hand with an absolute majority in parliament. The truth probably lies somewhere in between: quite a lot has been achieved but a lot more could have been done. Given the scale of the challenge, the task of restructuring the economy and the state may have only barely began, but the process will have to be accelerated if Portugal is to develop into a modern and competitive economy.</p>

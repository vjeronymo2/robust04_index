			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> BAIL IS RAISED FOR 'BABY THAO' SUSPECT  </P> <P> Debra Marie Lucas, accused of kidnaping newborn "Baby Thao" from a Sacramento  hospital maternity ward, appeared in court Friday where her bail was raised to  $100,000. Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Scully, arguing for the bail increase from  $15,000, said Lucas might flee because she faces a possible prison term and has  strong ties to the Oakland area. "Her flight risk, we think, is substantial,"  Scully said. Lucas, 36, is being held in the Sacramento County Jail. If  convicted of kidnaping, she could be sentenced to 16 years in prison. Lucas is  charged with kidnaping Baby Thao from his mother, a Hmong immigrant from Laos,  at Mercy General Hospital.  </P></p>

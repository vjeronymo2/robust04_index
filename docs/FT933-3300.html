			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Wall St talks of rival bid for Paramount VIACOM International, which made an Dollars 8.2bn agreed bid on Sunday for Paramount Communications, yesterday brushed aside speculation that the deal might flush out a rival bid for Paramount from companies associated with Mr John Malone, one of the most powerful figures in the US cable television industry. Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom chairman, said: 'You may be anticipating a war that doesn't exist.' Viacom, a fast-growing cable television company best known for its MTV pop music video channel, agreed to pay Dollars 69.14 a share in cash and stock for each share in Paramount, the film production and publishing company, based on Friday night's stock market closing quotes. The offer consists of Dollars 9.10 in cash, 0.1 of a share of class A Viacom voting stock and 0.9 of a share of class B non-voting stock. Viacom's A shares fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 64 3/4 in morning trading yesterday and its B shares were down Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 56 5/8, reducing the offer to Dollars 66.53 dollars a share and the value of the bid to Dollars 7.9bn. Paramount rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 64 3/8. There has been speculation on Wall Street that the deal could prompt a rival bid from Mr Malone, who heads both Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the largest US cable TV service company, and Liberty Media, which has a large interest in QVC Network, the home shopping cable channel. QVC is headed by Mr Barry Diller, a highly regarded film industry figure, who has ambitious expansion plans. Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, said he had not received, and did not anticipate, any offers from QVC. Mr Redstone said he doubted Mr Malone would consider going to war. 'I respect him but I do not fear him,' he said. Both men praised their deal as a 'marriage made in heaven'. Mr Redstone said that 'a few dollars (from a rival bid) could never match the potential rewards in the future of this combination'. He also praised Mr Robert Greenhill, president of investment banking group Smith Barney Shearson, who advised Viacom and played an important role in bringing the two sides together. Paramount was advised by Lazard Freres. The deal is a coup for Mr Greenhill, who after being pushed out earlier this year as president of investment bank Morgan Stanley, joined Smith Barney Shearson with a mandate to build up its deal-making business.

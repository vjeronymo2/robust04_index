			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- President Kim Il-song  of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today arranged a  banquet in honor of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk of  Cambodia on an official goodwill visit to Korea and made a  speech there.    He said:    Although you are unwell, receiving treatment, you have not  forgotten my birthday and have come to congratulate me. This  moves me deeply. From this I feel warmly again how sincere and  cordial our friendship and fraternity are.    In spring, in April, every year we have met and shared our  inmost feelings, but this year's reunion is more significant  than ever. This is the first historic visit you are paying to my  country since you came to the throne of the Kingdom of Cambodia.  It is an eventful visit on which you have brought with you the  fresh news of Cambodia which has greeted the spring of her  revival.    Today, in support of esteemed Your Majesty's noble patriotic  cause, the Cambodian people are working hard to promote national  reconciliation and unity, rebuild their country and create a new  life. The Kingdom of Cambodia has already established state  relations with many countries, and her international position is  daily rising.    The changes and great successes being made in Cambodia are  unthinkable apart from the leadership of Your Majesty esteemed  King Norodom Sihanouk, the outstanding patriot and pre-eminent  statesman of Cambodia and the father of the Khmer nation.    With an intense love for your country and an unbreakable  will  in spite of many tortuous events and storms since the early days  of your political career, you have devoted everything to the  struggle to shape a bright future of your nation. Since your  accession to the throne of the Kingdom of Cambodia, held in high  respect and trust by your people, you have been working harder  to build a prosperous country and promote her peace. Even on a  sick-bed now you administer state affairs optimistically and  unremittingly. We admire you for your patriotic devotion.    I sincerely wish your majesty, my most intimate friend and  brother, to be in good health and live long to give continued  leadership to the Cambodian people in their effort to build a  new society. As in the past, so in the future, the Korean  people will render an active support to your majesty's  independent policies and peace-loving proposals and extend firm  solidarity with the just cause of the Cambodian people.    Even under the difficult circumstances created by ceaseless  challenges and obstructive manoeuvres of the imperialists and  reactionaries, our people are stepping up the building of  socialism and making every effort to denuclearize the Korean  peninsula and reunify their country.    Your Majesty and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia  are extending active support to the just cause of our people.  This is a great encouragement to our people.    Nearly 30 years have passed since we first met in Jakarta.  In these years we have deepened our friendship and trust,  sharing joy and sorrow. I consider it a great pleasure to have  my most intimate brother in Your Majesty who treasure our  friendship and loyalty invariably even in the storms of  chequered history.    The relations of friendship and cooperation between the  peoples of our two countries are now developing fully in all  fields of politics, the economy and culture. Your present visit  will be another important event in further deepening our  intimate relations and strengthening the friendly ties between  the peoples of Korea and Cambodia.    I hope from the bottom of my heart that you will spend happy  and pleasant days during your stay in our country by taking rest  and recuperating your health.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The speaker of the Qatari parliament arrived in  Tehran today at the head of a parliamentary delegation. He was  welcomed at the airport by Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, the Majles  speaker.    Mr. 'Ali bin-Khalifa al-Hatm said in an interview with our  reporter that the purpose of his visit to Iran was to expand  relations even further and said the visit was of importance to  his country's officials.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri, for his part, spoke in an interview with our  reporter about issues that will be discussed in talks between  the two countries' officials.    [Begin Nateq-Nuri recording] We will discuss economic  issues,  such as the issue of the transfer of potable water to Qatar,  which is a very huge project; the exploitation of a joint gas  field; and regional issues and issues relating to the world of  Islam and Islamic countries, such as the issue of Palestine and  so on. Our relations with Qatar are very sincere, warm, and  long-standing. Qatar has consistently adopted very good stances  in international organizations -- during the imposed Iran-Iraq  war for example -- and this kind of thing means our relations  with Qatar are on a special footing and of importance to us.  God willing, we hope that, with this visit by these gentlemen,  these relations will expand even further. [end recording]</p>

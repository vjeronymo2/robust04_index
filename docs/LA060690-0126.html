			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GATES, BOARD AGREE ON DRUG LOOT  </P> <P> An anxiously anticipated showdown between county supervisors and Sheriff Brad  Gates fizzled Tuesday as board members and the sheriff tentatively buried the  hatchet and agreed to press ahead with the county's program for distributing  money and property seized in drug raids.  </P> <P> Gates, who has long objected to most attempts to use those proceeds for  anything other than drug enforcement, attended Tuesday's board meeting, during  which the supervisors received a report from the county staff recommending that  the money be spread among a wide variety of law enforcement activities. Some  supervisors had learned late Monday that Gates intended to be at the meeting,  and they had braced for a confrontational session.  </P> <P> Rather than object to that plan, however, Gates endorsed it, calling the report  "well thought out and sound."  </P> <P> The supervisors were equally deferential, going out of their way to praise the  sheriff and his department. "There is no question in my mind that you are the  best, and will continue to be the best," Board Chairman Don R. Roth told Gates  as the sheriff stood at the lectern.  </P> <P> Those sentiments were in marked contrast to the rancor that has characterized  relations between Gates and the board for months. Board members have become  openly suspicious of the sheriff, accusing him of cultivating the impression  that the drug-forfeiture funds could be used only for narcotics-enforcement  activities.  </P> <P> It was confusion over that point -- confusion that supervisors say Gates was  responsible for -- that led to the exhaustive report presented to the board  Tuesday. The report, written by officials in the county's management and budget  division, found that other cities and counties use the funds for an array of  purposes beyond narcotics enforcement.  </P> <P> But on Tuesday, Gates denied that he had ever led board members astray and said  that he could not imagine how the supervisors could accuse him of it. "I don't  know where they could come up with that," he said.  </P> <P> During the meeting, there was only one glimpse of the earlier disputes, as Roth  gently attempted to pin Gates down on his position regarding the legal and  appropriate use of the funds. When Gates protested he had never suggested that  funds be limited to drug enforcement, Roth backed away.  </P> <P> "I don't want to open up the previous disagreement of opinion," Roth said. "I'm  just glad you and I are now communicating."  </P> <P> Still, despite the veneer of good feeling that accompanied Tuesday's session,  some supervisors remained wary of Gates' pledges to cooperate.  </P> <P> "The real test will come when there is an actual test of these funds and how  they should be spent," Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said.  </P> <P> The sheriff's Regional Narcotics Suppression Program, one of two funds that he  administers with seized drug assets, has accumulated $10.9 million so far this  fiscal year, which ends this month. The supervisors have been eager to spend  that money on any of several one-time capital expenditures, including possibly  using some for a new county jail.  </P> <P> Orange County is under a court order to relieve overcrowding at its central  jail.  </P> <P> Gates has previously said that he had concerns about using the forfeiture funds  for jail construction, but on Tuesday he was noncommittal. "We will look at  each individual topic as it comes up," he said after the board meeting.  </P></p>

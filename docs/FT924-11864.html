			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Talks failure highlights rift in commission THE latest frustrating episode in the effort to get a world trade deal has highlighted a bitter rift inside the European Commission between its president, Mr Jacques Delors, and agriculture commissioner, Mr Ray MacSharry. According to senior officials in Brussels, Mr Delors and Mr MacSharry have clashed over how far the commission should go in granting concessions to the US. Mr Delors is understood to feel that Mr MacSharry has already yielded too much. On the eve of last week's EC summit in Birmingham, Mr Delors, who is said to nurse ambitions to succeed President Francois Mitterrand when he steps down from the Elysee, said 'the adolescent (European) community should be able to say no to its big brother (the US), provided it has a sound argument to do so.' Mr Delors' words left the impression in Brussels that he was taking his native country's side. Last week, Mr Delors acknowledged there were rumours to this effect but he vigorously dismissed this as 'pure slander'. However, it is clear Mr Delors faces the dilemma of reconciling his duties to the community as a whole with his emotional commitment to French farmers. Mr Delors denied that he had been sitting on the fence during Gatt talks led by Mr MacSharry and Mr Frans Andriessen, external affairs commissioner. But both EC negotiators are understood to be privately disappointed that Mr Delors has not come out unequivocally behind efforts which only last week appeared on the brink of success. Mr Delors said last week that the subsidised farm trade dispute was 'not just a French problem,' arguing that 'there must be an equitable arrangement' in any Gatt deal. His criticisms of the food production restraints required by Gatt nevertheless centred largely on tighter limits already put in place in May within the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Mr Delors' remarks came shortly after senior French officials had made clear in Brussels that they did not believe the CAP reform would work or be adhered to. Senior commission officials interpreted this as a French retreat from its commitments under the new CAP. 'It is clear now that France never really intended to comply with CAP reform,' one said. Nevertheless, Mr Delors, in his seven-and-a-half year stewardship of the commission, has given it the strongest leadership it has had for 25 years. Mr MacSharry and Mr Andriessen, along with other commission colleagues, are looking to him to display the same political courage now.</p>

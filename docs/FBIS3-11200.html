			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mariela Leon] </F>   [Excerpts] Puerto Ordaz, 3 February--Despite the  substantial increase in world consumption of aluminum, which is  estimated at 3 percent for 1994 and 1995, and the production  adjustments agreed upon by the main producers on the  international level, there are no prospects for the  reestablishment of a balance between supply and demand in a  period of less than two years.    In her opening address at the First National Aluminum Sector  Seminar on Potential and Opportunity, held in this city,  Marielena Posada, the president of CVG [Venezuelan Corporation  of Guayana]-Bauxilum (the result of the merger of Bauxiven and  Interalumina), outlined the local and international situation of  the sector.    On the world level, the aluminum industry is facing a  difficult situation. It is the result of the continued price  decline that began in 1989 and the great increase in the  inventory levels resulting from reduced consumption in America  and Europe, which was accompanied by substantial increases in  production in the Western world during the same period."    Posada said that the situation in the Eastern part of the  world is no different, since while a decrease can indeed be seen  in production, it is not by any means as great as the decline in  consumption. This situation has had an even greater impact on  the industry because of the inclusion of the metal from the  Community of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) on the  international markets, to a great extent reflecting the changes  that have come about in the war-materiel industry on the  international level as a result of the political events of  recent years. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Reducing Costs: The Goal </H5>   The president of Bauxilum commented that in addition to the  effects of low prices, this Venezuelan industry has been  affected in recent years by low levels of productivity, high  production costs, a high level of indebtedness, and a critical  cash situation.    A review of the situation of the aluminum sector of CVG in  1993, she said, makes a realistic view of the situation possible  on the level of the basic sector of the industry.    The results of such a review reveal an industry in crisis,  in  which an encouraging recovery process began in the second half  of the year. This was evident from the very major reduction in  total production costs, which declined from $1,460 per ton in  the month of July to $1,120 per ton at the end of the year,  clearly revealing the potential this business enjoys, she noted.    "The existence of an integrated complex for the production  of  aluminum, which was consolidated with the incorporation of  Bauxiven as a processor of bauxite on entirely competitive  terms, and with excellent results in the Interalumina operation;  the undeniable energy advantages that are available in Guayana;  and the capacity for response that has been evidenced by the  aluminum people, leading to a change in the trend in the  development of the business to which we referred previously,  constitute a firm foundation for the future consolidation of the  Venezuelan aluminum industry.    Posada maintained that we will reach the goal of producing  at  a total cost of less than $1,000 per ton in 1994. Our forecasts  show that we will have reduced the cost to less than $900 per  ton by 1996.    "This will make us one of the most competitive complexes in  the world. Our goal, therefore, is to achieve world leadership  in the production of aluminum."  <H5>  Second Phase </H5>   On being asked about the future of ALCASA [Caroni Aluminum,  Inc.] in the short run, this official explained that at that  aluminum enterprise, "advances are being made in the  privatization process. The alternative that is gaining support  involves the massive and immediate incorporation of the private  capital obtained in the first phase, through the negotiation of  the Guacara reducing plant, by means of affiliation with the  national bank.    "The second phase, involving the reduction plant in Puerto  Ordaz, is still pending. Work is being done in the CVG on the  problem of saving ALCASA, and privatization is one of the  solutions being considered." [passage omitted]</p>

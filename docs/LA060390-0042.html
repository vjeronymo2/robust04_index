			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Madame Sousatzka (Showtime Sunday at 10 a.m., again at 11:30 p.m., Thursday at  noon; TMC Wednesday at noon): With this engaging 1988 film, Shirley MacLaine  made her big move into grande dame territory as an imperious but lonely and  frustrated London piano teacher. (2:01)  </P> <P> Gallipoli (Channel 13 Monday at 10 a.m.): In Peter Weir's sweeping 1981  production the bloody, treacherous World War I battle on Turkey's Gallipoli  Peninsula represents an appointment with destiny, an end of innocence for his  young heroes (Mark Lee, Mel Gibson) and for Australia as well. Edited (2:00)  </P> <P> The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (Bravo Monday at 8 p.m., again at 1 a.m.):  This splendid 1971 film, a poignant, ill-fated romance illuminating the tragic  plight of Italy's Jews under Mussolini, returned director Vittorio De Sicacq to  top form after a decade of dismal pictures. With Dominique Sanda. (1:35)  </P> <P> The Diary of Anne Frank (AMC Tuesday at 10:30 p.m.): George Stevens' 1959 film  stands the test of time magnificently. It is the story of an exceptional  individual (beautifully played by Millie Perkins) coming of age and the study  of eight people forced into hiding but determined to hold on to their dignity.  (2:36)  </P></p>

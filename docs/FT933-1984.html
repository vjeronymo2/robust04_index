			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Toshiba to merge two loss-making operations TOSHIBA, the Japanese electrical group, is merging two members of its keiretsu, or industrial operations, amid deteriorating economic conditions and an appreciating yen. Tokyo Electric and TEC Electronics, a sales affiliate, are to be merged in October next year. Toshiba owns 51.3 per cent of Tokyo Electric, which in turns owns 51.2 per cent of TEC. The move reflects the increasing pressure on companies that supply Japan's big exporters of consumer durables, notably high-technology groups and the carmakers. It is a further step by Toshiba to improve profits following a string of recent disposals. The company sold Toshiba Steel Tube in March, and Onkyo, an unlisted audio visual production subsidiary, in May. The two companies, both listed on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange, aim to improve earnings by integrating production and marketing operations. One TEC share will be converted into one Tokyo Electric share. The enlarged company will have a staff of some 7,300. Both companies posted losses for the year to last March, and yesterday projected heavier loss estimates for the half year to September. Tokyo Electric, which made a pre-tax loss of Y4.1bn (Dollars 39.3m) last year, is projecting a mid-term pre-tax loss of Y5.4bn. TEC, which suffered a pre-tax loss of Y5.4bn last year, is expecting a six-month deficit of Y3.5bn. The new company is expected to post sales of Y185bn in the year ending March 1995, and Y210bn in the following year. Toshiba also plans to reorganise its operations into four main business groups. The revamp is the most far-reaching by the company since 1988, when Toshiba's computer and control systems divisions were merged. Toshiba said the decision, which puts multi-media operations at the core of its operations, will enable the company to react to the rapid changes in the business environment.</p>

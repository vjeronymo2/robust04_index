			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tories revive tax message FUTURE TAX cuts would be directed primarily at middle-income and lower-income earners, Mr John Major signalled yesterday, as he said he did not expect to change the 40 per cent top rate of income tax. The prime minister also reinforced the message that the widening of the Pounds 2,000 20 per cent tax band was the most likely way for a future Tory government to seek to reach its target of a standard tax rate of 20 per cent. Though stressing that this route to tax cuts was intended to help those on the lowest incomes, the prime minister conceded that those on low pay would lose some of the advantage from lower taxes in reduced income-related benefits, such as family credit. Speaking at a press conference in Southampton, Mr Major said: 'I don't anticipate at the moment changing the 40p tax rate. The tax priorities I have are for the basic rate of 25p to come down to 20p. 'I believe that after the structural changes we have seen in tax, that is the right way to proceed in the years ahead. You don't always have Pounds 2.3bn, but there is usually a smaller sum that can now be used in tax cuts by widening that 20p band.' He acknowledged the high marginal deduction rates faced by those on income-related benefits, saying that the problem of withdrawing benefit as income increased was 'statistically unavoidable'. He added: 'I looked at it very carefully when I was a social security minister. What you can do is alleviate the problem, as we have done in changes to the social security system.' His comments came as the Tories again hammered home their message that Labour would stop the recovery. Mr David Mellor, Treasury chief secretary, warned that a Labour victory on Thursday would necessitate an immediate rise in interest rates of 2 or 2.5 percentage points to prevent sterling being devalued. Mr Mellor argued that Labour's policies would cause an immediate reduction in consumer demand and add about Pounds 10bn to costs for industry. While the Tories are emphasising the extent to which the proceeds of growth can be directed towards spending on public services, they are also keen to maintain the sharp difference between themselves and Labour over tax. Mr Mellor estimated that Labour's shadow Budget would raise taxation by Pounds 1.89bn in the first year. The initial impact, he said, would be all the more damaging because increases in tax and National Insurance contributions were likely to apply from July 1 whereas increased pensions and child benefit were unlikely to be introduced before October. Earlier, Mr Major had shrugged off a cut on the face caused by an egg thrown while he was on a walkabout on the outskirts of Southampton. Though slightly shaken by the incident, he pointed to the generally warm and enthusiastic response of the crowd. 'I do not think it's right for politicians to operate a sanitised campaign, cut off from the people they're asking to represent,' he said. He insisted his campaign was 'gaining momentum'.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Minorco targets on alert CONSTRUCTION company Tarmac jumped to the top of the market's perceived list of bid targets after Minorco, the mining group, sold its 36 per cent stake in Charter Consolidated for Pounds 235m. However, some analysts suggested that Minorco might use the cash to bid for Union Miniere. Tarmac shares moved against the market trend, adding 6 at 135p in trade of 2.1m as talk that Minorco may use the proceeds of the sale to launch a bid for the UK housebuilder did the rounds. However, such suggestions were thought wide of the mark by Mr Emil Morfatt at Smith New Court. He said: 'Minorco has looked at Tarmac but it is only interested in the quarrying assets, not the rest of the business. My guess is that Minorco is likely to go for Union Miniere (the Belgian group) which is a world class European mining group. It may also be interested in using some other funds to increase its stake in a large Chilean copper development.' English China Clays was another of the names mentioned as a possible target for Minorco and the stock advanced 11 to 456p. The repurchase of the Minorco stake helped shares in Charter Consolidated itself, taking the group up 14 to 648p, with sentiment aided by final results at the top end of market expectations and a broker's recommendation. One analyst said: 'It is a relief that Charter has been able to buy the stake. What is more it renders immediate enhancement of earnings.'</p>

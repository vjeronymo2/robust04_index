			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by ANC President Nelson Mandela at the ANC media </F> center, Johannesburg, on the "Election 94" program -- live]    [Text] [Mandela] Fellow South Africans, on Tuesday [26  April] and yesterday you turned up in hundreds of thousands to  bring out the vote that we have struggled and waited for so  long. Unfortunately, many of you had to wait in queues for a  long time, and some were unable to vote. We salute you for your  patience and fortitude. The ANC is in constant contact with the  IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], and problems at polling  stations are being addressed.    We appeal to you not to be discouraged. Where there are  still problems, please be patient. No one will be denied the  right to vote. Today is a public holiday. I appeal to all of  you who have not yet voted to use this opportunity to go to the  voting stations and exercise your right to vote. Where workers  have come to work today, I appeal to employers to give them  whatever time they need to vote. Your vote is sacrosanct. Do  not allow anyone to take it away from you.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Mandela, do you think that  there's still a large number of people who haven't cast their  votes?    [Mandela] Undoubtedly, because in many areas where blacks  are  to be found -- that is, Africans are to be found -- ballot  papers were either not delivered [one-second break in  transmission] regrettable if that situation is allowed to  continue, and a solution must be found to ensure that everybody  who wanted to vote and was qualified to vote, exercises his vote.    I spent a lot of time yesterday discussing with the  Transitional Executive Council, Mr. de Klerk, as well as the  Independent Electoral Commission, addressing this problem,  because it is clear to me that there has been a massive  sabotage. It is striking that in areas occupied by whites,  coloreds, and Indians, voting went smoothly. Ballot papers  arrived on time, although there are one or two cases like  Alberton and so on, where white areas had problems, but these  are few and far between. The problem has occurred in African  areas. It is a situation which is totally unacceptable. We  have to address it.    But I can tell you that I am not alarmed. Apart from the  fact that it is quite clear that there is this massive sabotage,  nevertheless we are addressing it, and I think we are going to  resolve it. And South Africans of all racial groups can look  forward with hope and joy because we have men and women from all  sections of our population who are prepared and ready to address  such shortcomings.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Mandela, would you be in favor  of  an extension till tomorrow, perhaps, as a practical solution to  the problem?    [Mandela] Absolutely. I think that if we come out today and  make a statement that in the light of what has happened  today.... [pauses] Because many people may not be aware that  today was a public holiday, I think that is a problem, because  the situation in areas where Africans live is totally different  from the situation in the cities, where people are literate,  where they have facilities like television and the radio.  That's not the position in the African areas. I think that if  we come out today and announce that tomorrow will be a public  holiday people, will turn out in large numbers, and we will have  addressed the question.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Trade News: Nissan will bear brunt of cuts in car sales to US NISSAN, Japan's second largest car maker, appears set to bear the brunt of the self-imposed 'voluntary' cut in direct car exports to the US agreed last month by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). The company's import quota for this year will fall by at least 44 per cent to below 300,000, from a quota of 532,276 and actual exports of 324,132 last year, according to Japanese industry sources quoted by Reuter. The cut compares with an overall reduction of 28.2 per cent, to 1.65m from 2.3m vehicles, set as an informal imports ceiling by Miti in March because of growing friction with Washington. Exports to the US from Japan last year are estimated at only 1.73m vehicles, against 1.85m in 1990. But Miti's lower ceiling has been derided by the US motor industry, with Ford's chairman and chief executive, Mr Harold Poling, saying Japan has 'learned nothing' about the need to balance its trade with the US. According to Japanese motor industry insiders, Toyota's quota will be just above 480,000, down 21.2 per cent from 1991 and just 6 per cent in terms of actual 1991 exports of 510,489. Honda's quota is under 320,000, down 24.5 per cent from its 1991 quota and 6 per cent from its actual exports Mitsubishi's quota will be above 150,000, down from 193,658 and actual exports of 165,284, and Mazda below 200,000, down from 226,116 and exports of 210,208 Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru) will be above 70,000, down from 106,805 and exports of 51,158. Isuzu will be above 100,000, down from 124,210 and up from actual exports of 93,100 last year. Suzuki will be above 30,000, down from 64,552, and actual exports of 30,236. Daihatsu, with a 20,000 quota last year, is pulling out.</p>

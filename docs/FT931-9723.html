			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Dealers scare the D-Mark's Belgian shadow: What has brought one of the ERM's hard-core currencies under pressure in the markets DURING the repeated attacks on the European exchange rate mechanism in recent months, at least the system's 'hard core' seemed reasonably safe from assault. This week, however, it was the turn of the Belgian franc - which along with the Dutch guilder has remained closest to the D-Mark in the last few years - to feel the heat of currency strife. Remarkably, the Belgian franc has sometimes been seen as a surrogate for the D-Mark. In 1990 Belgium decided to tie its currency to the D-Mark at much narrower fluctuation bands than the 2.25 per cent margin generally ruling in the ERM. This has enabled the Belgian state to borrow at interest rates close to those on German government bonds - despite overall Belgian public sector debt which, at more than 130 per cent of gross national product, is the highest in the EC. This week, however, confidence in the Belgian franc was undermined as doubts about the country's political stability sparked concern among international investors about its public finances. One reason for the volatility was the Belgian National Bank's haste in following last week's cut in the Bundesbank's discount and Lombard rates. When the Bundesbank reduced its interest rates on February 4, the Belgian central bank lowered its special advances rate - used in money market operations - from 8.40 per cent to 8.30 per cent. On Wednesday, the Belgian central bank was forced to reverse the effort to cheapen credit. After a sharp rise in short-term interest rates and government bond yields at the beginning of the week, the central bank increased its end-of-day rate from 8.80 per cent to 9.30 per cent. The difference between yields on 10-year Belgian government bonds and those on ten-year German government bonds narrowed from 1.24 percentage points on August 31 1992 to 0.40 of a point on January 8 this year. But during the last few days the gap has widened to as much as 0.90 of a point. 'International investors simply decided the time had come to take profits, as they couldn't see the yield spread narrowing any further,' says one bond dealer. The political worries relate to the constitutional reforms narrowly approved by Belgium's parliament last Saturday. Belgian deputies approved the fundamental part of a far-reaching reform programme which will turn Belgium into a federal state and devolve further powers to its regions. Belgian economic analysts believe that foreign worries that this could weaken the authority of central government are overdone. They point out the success of Belgium's fragile centre-left coalition in winning a two-thirds majority in parliament over the issue. However, international investors took a different view. Bond dealers in London admit that hardly any foreign market operators have a detailed understanding of the nature of the constitutional reforms. But the general uncertainty has forced them to re-examine their Belgian government bond holdings. In particular, their attention was drawn to the link between slack Belgian growth and its rising public deficit, which last year reached BFr485bn, (Pounds 9.8bn), 6.9 per cent of GNP. This is a particular handicap because of the stipulation in the Maastricht treaty that EC members should reduce their deficit to 3 per cent of GNP as a condition for joining economic and monetary union. The Belgian government is trying to freeze public spending in real terms, increase revenues through fiscal measures and modest privatisation, and stabilise the generous social security budget. Belgian economists seem puzzled by the new con-cerns about this old economic phenomenon, and blame non-Belgian bond and currency traders. 'Of course the government debt is very large,' said Mr Lieven Noppe of Kredietbank yesterday, 'but it's been that way for almost 10 years and despite that the franc has managed to become a strong currency and interest rate differentials (with Germany) have narrowed.' Yesterday, Belgian analysts and the central bank seemed confident that the attack had been seen off, with the franc returning to near-parity with the D-Mark. But the Belgian government's policy of linking the franc to the D-Mark has been sorely tested. Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the central bank governor, said last week that the bank would be prepared to allow the franc to fall as much as 0.30 per cent below its ERM central rate again the D-Mark. Mr Verplaetse underlined on Wednesday that he would take all possible measures to support the franc. Aided by this pledge and the interest rate increase, the currency steadied yesterday. But investors' confidence about the Belgian franc's stability may take longer to return.</p>

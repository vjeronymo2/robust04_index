			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Technology: Cellular working reassessed Cellular manufacturing was one of the most important tools used by manufacturers in the 1980s to improve their competitiveness, but users are now re-evaluating its benefits, according to a report by Ingersoll Engineers. It is not that employers have gone off the idea of cells - mini-business units that operate semi- autonomously, handling manufacturing or assembly - says the UK-based management consultancy. Indeed, a phenomenon that Ingersoll dubbed 'the quiet revolution' has gained momentum, with penetration up by 40 per cent in three years. Six out of 10 UK engineering companies have switched to cell manufacturing since 1985 and, according to one, 'if we hadn't gone to cells, we wouldn't be in business'. What is shifting, according to Ingersoll's report, is the rationale for introducing cells. Three years ago, it says, the principal objectives were defined in terms of 'hard' factors such as better on-time delivery, improved response and reduced stocks. 'Soft' or people-oriented factors such as commitment, training and clearly defined responsibilities were seen as important 'inputs' for the success of the cells. However, three years later soft factors are being perceived as 'outputs' or benefits. The result is a much more balanced view of the benefits of hard and soft issues. Team working and empowerment are seen as equally important as quicker throughput and reduced work-in-progress. The survey found that some 73 per cent of companies use cells, compared with 51 per cent in the previous study, and that a further 7 per cent plan to do so. Significantly, only one company in the sample of 51 had used, and then abandoned, cell techniques. According to Brian Small, Ingersoll's managing director, cells are creating 'a much greater commercial awareness at every level - with significant paybacks for organisations as a whole and with everyone getting closer to the customer'.

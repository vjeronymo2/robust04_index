			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Books: Blood-stained trail to Tiananmen - Four years after the massacre, Susan Whitfield looks at the continuing battle for democracy in China BLACK HANDS OF BEIJING by George Black and Robin Munro John Wiley Pounds 15.95, 400 pages QUELLING THE PEOPLE by Timothy Brook Oxford Pounds 17.95, 265 pages IN 1979, Deng Xiaoping remarked that 'the world did nothing' when Wei Jingsheng, having demanded democracy in China, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. A decade later, international opinion was again put to the test as the tanks rolled into Beijing in June 1989 and thousands were killed, imprisoned and executed. The intellectuals who received the longest sentences, 13 years each, were Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao. As students in 1979, they had stood alongside Wei Jingsheng at Democracy Wall. They condemned his sentence but did not agree with his demands, calling instead for reform within the Communist party. Later, as a self-professed elite, they formed a think-tank which proffered advice throughout Deng Xiaoping's decade of economic reform. 'To win the minds of the people,' they argued, 'the government must first win the minds of we intellectuals.' Democracy was not part of their plans: 'the people are at too low a level.' After the massacre in 1989, they were convenient scapegoats for a government concerned to blame the events on the machinations of a few 'black hands.' Unlike others, they had not managed to escape following the massacre - and they were veteran dissidents. But George Black and Robin Munro in their informative book show that, in spite of Chen and Wang's own sense of importance, they were peripheral both to the students' occupation of Tiananmen Square and to the government's response. Workers, largely shunned by the students who refused them access to the square proper, played a vital role. After the massacre they received the harshest treatment and, while most students have now been released, numerous workers are still trapped within the vast Chinese gulag and prison system. Perhaps this is because - like Wei Jingsheng in 1979 - they have consistently had the clearer vision about the lack of legitimacy of their government. Students, the future generation of leaders, have largely followed Wang and Chen in calling for reform rather than the end of the party dictatorship. Black Hands also follows Han Dongfang, a worker charged with 'counter-revolutionary incitement' but released last year and now in the US. Unfortunately, the authors fail in their attempt to set up Chen and Wang as China's Sakharovs and Han as a Lech Walesa: it is the figures on the periphery of the story who arouse the most interest. Moreover, the book prompts many unasked questions. Why, in spite of their keen sense of history, did few of the intellectuals remember Wei Jingsheng? Why did they believe that Deng - 'the needle wrapped in cotton wool' - would not resort to violence? Maybe the students were like 'the newborn calf who does not fear the tiger,' but the older intellectuals' continued faith in Deng needs exploring. In Quelling The People, Timothy Brook argues that China's leaders intended to use force from an early stage in the demonstrations should intimidation fail. Brook follows the deployment of troops from mid-May before the declaration of martial law, the first abortive attempt to move soldiers into Beijing, and the massacre of June 3 and 4 when the army encountered resistance on its second attempt. This is an admirably well-researched book, based mainly on interviews and suitably wary about the evidence - 'no one lies like an eye-witness.' It is also timely: Brook observes that unremitting propaganda has forced some in China to accept the government's version of events, notably the low casualty figures and the argument that the soldiers were provoked. Dismayingly, this view also has its adherents in the West. The media aided this propaganda unwittingly by concentrating on the students and on Tiananmen Square. It is uncertain whether any students were killed in the square itself on June 4. There is no doubt however, as Brook shows, that more than 1,000 people - and probably nearer 3,000 - were killed by the army on the approaches to the square. Several years after the events, there are still gaps in our knowledge. Claims in a recent book that the shooting was ordered without the knowledge of Deng, or that the CIA masterminded the escape route, are not addressed in these works. The courage and commitment of Chen Ziming, Wang Juntao and the many others now spending their fourth year in prison is not in doubt. Whether they have the charisma to concentrate the chameleon sympathies of the west on the plight of China is less certain.</p>

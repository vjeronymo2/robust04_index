			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Lessons in economics for private schools: The uncertainties behind an apparently thriving independent sector ACCORDING to Mr David Woodhead, director of the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis), 'The independent school sector is thriving.' Such confidence masks an uncertain time for the sector after its prosperity in the 1980s. The number of pupils at independent schools is up again (to 7.5 per cent of the school-age population), but the national total masks a marked decline in boarding numbers. Behind the figures, the breeze of competition is blowing harder than it ever did in the 1980s, fanned by the declining numbers of school-age children. The sector remains strongest at the post-16 level: a fifth of all sixth formers attend private schools. Recent growth has been particularly marked at the lower end of the spectrum, with the number of pupils aged three to six up by some 5 per cent on last year. Many independent city and suburban day schools are flourishing. The leading London day schools have some five suitable applicants for each place. For boarding schools, however, the halcyon days are over, their numbers down another 3 per cent on last year. Mr Woodhead blames 'antique stereotypes' and 'changes in social custom', and Isis plans an autumn campaign to raise the profile of the boarding sector. Weekly and fortnightly boarding has helped to slow the trend. 'It is an attractive formula,' says Mr Anthony Hart, headmaster of Cranleigh in Surrey. 'You get all the advantages of a boarding life, but the children don't lose contact with their families.' Even so, weekly boarding accounts for barely one in ten of all boarders. It is not only boarding schools that look to the future with some anxiety. The recession is a pressing concern for them all. With annual fees averaging Pounds 3,600 (Pounds 6,700 for boarders), up 12.5 per cent on last year, many existing parents are hard pressed to keep up with the cost. If the leading day schools are largely unscathed, their lesser brethren are struggling to fill places. Introduction of co-education and on-site prep schools are common responses among secondary schools. The headmaster of Colfe's school in south London, which has done both, comments: 'We need to get people at seven, 11 and 16; and there is no doubt that times are hard for many of our parents.' Competition between such schools is getting tougher. In a recent survey of independent heads, four out of five anticipated greater competition, while two thirds expected to spend more time and money promoting themselves. They may even need to compete seriously with state schools again, if opting-out and the national curriculum live up to ministerial hopes. 'Whereas in the 1980s independent schools were in competition with each other,' Mr Woodhead says, 'they will have to start competing with a maintained sector offering increasing choice and variety, and able to market itself effectively.' The assisted-places scheme now pays part or all of the fees of 30,151 pupils (6.4 per cent), yet it is far from being a source of relief for the less successful schools. Most assisted places are to be found in the big city day schools, and the likes of Haberdashers' Aske's, Dulwich College, and Stockport and Newcastle Grammars, all significant beneficiaries of the scheme, could comfortably fill their places without it. The independent sector is making efforts to bridge the state/private divide. Mr Arthur Hearnden, general secretary of the Independent School Joint Council, is pioneering work-experience and teacher-training schemes spanning the two sectors and has had a warm reception from the Department of Education. Finances apart, curriculum reform is a prime concern. Most independent heads are suspicious of A-level reform. 'People talk about the gold standard,' Mr Martin Rogers, headmaster of King Edward's Birmingham says, 'but A-levels have long come off gold. We need a new exam that really stretches the most able pupils.' Yet for most independent heads, keeping the school full is the main preoccupation. With good reason: more than half of all 'private' pupils are located in the south-east. Independent schools no longer have the region's traditional immunity from recession to help them, or even the left-wing Inner London Education Authority as an unwitting accomplice.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["g-n"-signed editorial: "Formal Address"] </F>   [Text] Russia, President Yeltsin said at the Moscow  celebrations marking the anniversary of Germany's surrender in  1945, wants to be addressed in a formal manner. It demands  respect. Russia is extremely sensitive to what it calls its  dignity. Moscow's new tone does not go very well with Yeltsin's  wish to expand the partnership with the West.    Since signing the Two-Plus-Four Treaty in 1990, no other  country has given more economic aid to Gorbachev's Soviet Union  and Yeltsin's Russia than Germany. By refusing to support the  Honecker regime, Soviet policy in the Gorbachev era admittedly  contributed to Germany's peaceful reunification. But with  Russian diplomats talking like that, one must not forget that  Soviet policy alone forced the SED [Socialist Unity Party of  Germany] regime upon East Germans, established the division, and  maintained it for four decades, not to mention Stalin's pact  with Hitler, which opened the door to war for the German  dictator. Thus, the two days of Hitler's surrender are also  two-sided: 8 May was the end of a totalitarian dictatorship for  the Germans in the West, and 9 May was the beginning of another  one for the Germans in the East.    But how should the withdrawal of the Russian troops be  celebrated? The Western allies are only withdrawing from  Berlin; they will stay in the country as friends. The Russian  Army will withdraw, and this enables voluntary cooperation. The  Russian soldiers have a right to a polite farewell with all the  usual military ceremonies. To demand more, such as a joint  ceremony in Berlin together with the Americans, British, and  French would invite a comparison of their roles in Germany, an  exercise in which Russia cannot win. To insist on something  special would turn out to be a self-made trap, from which the  Russian leadership could hardly withdraw without hurting its  sensitive need for dignity. This way it risks losing the very  thing it wants to have: a polite farewell, formal, respectful,  addressed in a formal manner.</p>

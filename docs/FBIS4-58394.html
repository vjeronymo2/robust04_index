			<p>BFN     [Text] The investigations into the bombing of the Sayyidat  al-Najat Church and the assassination of Engineer Dany Sham'un  are continuing. Lebanese Forces leader Dr. Samir Ja'ja' was  interrogated by the judicial investigating judge for the third  time yesterday in the case on the assassination of Eng. Sham'un  and his family.    However, the investigating judge could not proceed with the  interrogation due to the health and psychological condition of  Dr. Ja'ja'. Judicial sources said that defense lawyer As'ad  Abu-Ra'd protested against interrogating Dr. Ja'ja' in view of  his poor health. The investigating judge agreed to postpone the  interrogation until the health of Dr. Ja'ja' improves.    Meanwhile, forensic doctor Subhi Germanus examined Dr.  Ja'ja'  yesterday. The report confirms that the health of Dr. Ja'ja' is  good. A copy of the report will be conveyed to the defense  lawyer today.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: Independent advice would aid credibility of economic policy Sir, Your leader, 'Wise words on Germany' (November 17), reviews the economic report of Germany's 'five wise men' and quite rightly commends this as 'a good case for independent economic advice'. In previous editorials you have strongly advocated an independent Bank of England, with constitutional responsibility for monetary/price stability. There is surely an equally strong case for an independent UK institution or authority, akin to Germany's wise men or the US president's Council of Economic Advisers, to pronounce on macroeconomic trends and policy implications. Such a body would be independent of the Treasury or any other ministry and, as in Germany, influence the agenda for debate and policy formulation. It has been obvious for a long time that the Bank of England, responsible for monetary policy, and the Treasury, responsible for fiscal policy (and both subject to political control), are not able to provide the kind of authoritative independent commentary and advice on economic trends and policy options which are needed, not only to establish a more rational framework for debate but also (as you have argued with respect to an independent Bank) to restore some credibility to UK macroeconomic policy.

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Surrey Group cuts deficit Losses at Surrey Group, the USM-traded bookmaker, were cut from Pounds 632,000 to Pounds 57,000 pre-tax for the half year ended September 30. Turnover of Pounds 20.9m compared with Pounds 28.2m. During the period the group completed the sale of 28 betting shops in Scotland to Stanley Leisure for Pounds 3.08m, leaving it 49 shops. The group was trading profitably in August but a 'disappointing' September resulted in the mid-year deficit. A programme of further cost savings is being implemented.

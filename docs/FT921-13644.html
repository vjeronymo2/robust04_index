			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (6): Drain age comes to Cairo - A look at one of the world's biggest sewerage projects A SEWAGE pumping station may seem an unlikely spot for a big official celebration. But glasses will today be raised at Ameria in north eastern Cairo to mark the inauguration of probably the world's biggest new sewer building operation. The somewhat coyly named Greater Cairo Wastewater Project is behind schedule and some way from full completion. Nevertheless, the opening of the first phase of the scheme to provide a proper sewage disposal system for one of the globe's most notoriously overpopulated and insanitary cities is a significant moment which promises a cleaner and healthier future for the Egyptian capital. When the eight huge centrifugal pumps sunk in the cylindrical Ameria station are switched on, they will suck 650,000 cubic meters of sewage a day out of a newly constructed main tunnel and its branch feeders collecting waste from Cairo's east bank of the Nile for conveyance by culvert and drain out of the city. When all the systems encompassed by the Cairo wastewater project are up and running, perhaps in 1995, they are designed to cope with a total sewage flow from the city's 12m-plus population of more than 2m cubic meters a day - and be expanded to meet the capital's wastewater output well into the next century. This huge civil engineering task, the centre piece of an extensive Government programme to modernise Egypt's creaking infrastructure, was first conceived in the late 1970s. By then it was odorously clear that the existing city sewage system, designed by British engineer J. Carkeet James in 1910 for a projected population of just 1m, was woefully inadequate, despite two improvement projects undertaken down the years. Infant mortality rates in Cairo of twice the average in developing countries gave statistical backing to the all too visible evidence in the streets of an overflowing system. What transpired was an EL5bn project which has been planned and executed jointly by the Egyptian Government and British and US contractors, with heavy US and British financial backing. The Government set up the Cairo Wastewater Organisation (CWO) to oversee the scheme which has been managed by a joint American-British consultant group - called Ambric  - made up of the US companies Camp, Dresser &amp; McKee and Black &amp; Veatch, and the British companies John Taylor (now Acer/John Taylor) and Binnie and Partners. An initial Dollars 130m emergency scheme, including Dollars 100m in US aid, was set up to rehabilitate the existing system, mainly by refurbishing more than 100 pumping stations around the city. Completed in 1987, this was responsible for a marked reduction in street sewage floods still proudly shown off by Egyptian officials in dramatic 'before and after' photographs. But the real work was to be on a much greater scale. As it evolved, Cairo was divided into its two natural geographic halves, the east and west banks of the Nile. On the east bank, backed by Pounds 65m in British government grants and Pounds 185m in loans from Samuel Montagu underwritten by the Export Credit Guarantee Department, British contractors and their Egyptian partners would bore a new 12-km long main tunnel and an extended closed culvert to collect and carry sewage to Gabal el-Asfar north east of the city. There a wastewater treatment plant, initially capable of processing 1m cubic meters of flow a day, would be built. Once complete, more than 140 old pumping stations could be decommissioned. On the west bank, a similar scheme was designed for the American-led effort. Culverts, not tunnels, were required to carry effluent westwards to a treatment plant at Abu Rawash. But extensive work to install sewers in previously unsewered areas, including the Pyramids, was needed. Initiated by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1985, the east bank scheme was the biggest overseas construction project ever undertaken by UK companies. The main tunnelling contracts went to two consortia, one comprising Tarmac, Balfour Beatty, Cementation, Edmund Nuttall and Arab Contractors of Egypt, the other Lilley International and Misr Engineering. Other companies to get a share of the work were Kier, Christiani and Nielsen, GEC, Laing and Fairclough. Not all was plain sailing. There were technical delays, including an 18-month hold-up in sinking the Ameria pumping station caisson and delays in acquiring the 36m acid-resistant bricks needed from local producers for the lining of the 5m-diameter main tunnel. There were also financing problems. Some Pounds 150m to finance outstanding branch tunnelling work is not secured. More seriously, the commissioning of the Dollars 160m Gabal el-Asfar treatment plant was seriously delayed by disputes between the Egyptian and British sides over financing. Eventually the Italian government stepped in. But the plant is five years behind schedule, meaning east bank sewage will flow untreated to the Mediterranean Sea at least until 1994. The much bigger commitment of the US government - Dollars 816m has been pledged to the Cairo Wastewater Project by the US Agency for International Development - has meant smoother progress on the west bank. Completion there is set for September 1994. Meanwhile, the EC has put up funds to back a sewage scheme in Helwan in south Cairo to complete the picture over the 875 sq km Greater Cairo area. Mr Selama A. Salem, the chairman of the CWO, is understandably enthused by the transformation he has presided over. But he acknowledges that completion of the project raises new issues to be overcome. The government has not yet decided what it will do with the treated wastewater - or the hundreds of tonnes of sludge that will be left over. More difficult is deciding how to structure the operation and maintenance of the system which Mr Salem estimates will cost EL120m a year at present prices. Joint venture companies with the foreign contractors will operate the systems for the first few years. After that, the Government is contemplating merging the now separate fresh water and waste water authorities and possibly breaking up and privatising the resulting structure along the lines of the British water privatisation.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Russian foreign minister denies existence of Korean nuclear bomb Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, claimed at the weekend that North Korea did not yet have a nuclear bomb and quoted 'experts' as saying it would take the former Soviet ally three to seven years to develop one, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow. Mr Kozyrev seemed to hint his information came from Russian intelligence when he cited 'all the sources of information reaching Moscow and not just the Foreign Ministry'. While reiterating criticism of the US for failing to consult Moscow on its proposals for phased sanctions of increasing severity against Pyongyang, he said there was no point in rushing ahead with them because China would veto them in the Security Coun cil. However he warned that sanctions against the hardline Communist state were 'inevitable' if it persisted in keeping the International Atomic Energy Agency in the dark about its nuclear programme. He also criticised what he called the Russian parliament's 'North Korean lobby'.</p>

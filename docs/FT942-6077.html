			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: US buy-out firms adopt more modest guise - Clayton Dubilier's Richard Braddock tells Richard Waters about the sector's recovery Things have changed in the US buy-out industry. Just two years ago, Citicorp, under pressure from regulators, backed away from highly-leveraged lending. Today Mr Richard Braddock, the banking group's president and chief operating officer until 1992, begins work at Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, one of the handful of US buy-out firms to have come through the 1980s unscathed. The move is symptomatic of the re-emergence of buy-outs in the US. Starved of finance as the banks withdrew and the junk bond market dried up, the industry virtually died. But the market for sub-investment grade bonds roared back to life last year, and lending to companies considered high risk is one of the few opportunities banks now have to put their plentiful capital to work. Also, a number of buy-out funds have spent the last year raising equity. 'Pile bank and subordinated debt on top of that, and there's an enormous amount of money (available to do transactions),' says Mr Joseph Rice, one of Clayton Dubilier's principals. The industry that has re-emerged differs in several respects from the 1980s version. Much of the new equity behind the buy-out funds has been provided by pension funds, rather than the banks and insurance companies who invested in funds in the 1980s, says Mr Leonard Green, a Los Angeles-based deal maker who himself recently raised more than Dollars 300m for a new buy-out fund. Pension funds, seeking higher yields, have been attracted by the investment returns of the more successful funds. Clayton Dubilier, for instance, claims an annualised rate of return on its investments of around 100 per cent (investors get 80 per cent, while the buy-out firm's partners keep 20 per cent). Another difference in the 1990s buy-out industry is the lower level of leverage (or gearing) at which deals are being struck. One part equity to nine parts debt used to be the rule of thumb of the 1980s; now, says Mr Don Gogel, a Clayton Dubilier partner who was once co-head of Kidder Peabody's mergers and acquisitions department, 'we look at anything from 25-35 per cent equity'. Lower gearing means lower investment returns in the years ahead. The 80 per cent return paid to Clayton Dubilier investors will not be matched in future, the firm warns - though it is still confident of beating its target return of 40 per cent a year. In this new era, it is the funds that can show a steady flow of successful transactions - rather than those which scored big profits from single, blockbuster leveraged deals - which are likely to be most successful. Clayton Dubilier, one of the small group of funds to re-emerge strongly in the 1990s, typifies the more modest ambitions of the new breed. In nearly 20 deals over the past 15 years, only one - the Dollars 960m purchase of healthcare products maker Kendall from Colgate-Palmolive in 1988  -has proved a disaster. Clayton Dubilier was forced into a refinancing, the ultimate success of which remains unclear. But the firm's partners are adamant that they did not walk away from the company. 'We fixed the problem and no one lost money,' says Mr Gogel. Meanwhile, the firm has developed a style which enables it to benefit from more than just the financial structuring of its buy-outs. Its partners have included some powerful business managers - among them Mr Braddock, Mr Chuck Ames, a former boss of Reliant Electric, and, until he left to run Westinghouse Electric last year, Mr Michael Jordan. These operating managers take a more direct involvement in bought-out firms than is typical in the industry. 'We're not buying short-term to flip businesses, or to take advantage of a business's trajectory - we're looking to influence the trajectory,' says Mr Braddock. The result has been the purchase recently of a number of underperforming subsidiaries of large companies, each of which Clayton managers are actively engaged in turning around: Allison from General Motors, Wesco from Westinghouse and Remington from DuPont. With these three transactions, between them valued at more than Dollars 1bn, the firm established itself as one of the most active buy-out firms in the second half of last year. Clayton Dubilier is now preparing to raise cash for its next investment fund  -likely to be launched later this year - and, once again, is eyeing Europe. Four years ago, the firm established a London office; no deals have resulted. Over time, says Braddock now, Europe could still be a rich source of deals for the US buy-out funds. Reminded of previous talk of an active European buy-out industry, he insists: 'It's more than an idle comment.'</p>

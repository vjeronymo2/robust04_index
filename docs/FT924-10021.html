			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / ICI blames closures on cost of power ICI YESTERDAY blamed the cost of electricity for the closure of two chlorine plants at Hillhouse, near Fleetwood, Lancashire, with the loss of about 100 jobs. Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymers, warned of a long-term threat to more jobs if electricity prices were not brought down to German levels at least. He said UK electricity cost ICI Pounds 31 a megawatt hour now, against Pounds 25 for similar supplies in Germany. US manufacturers of chlorine-based chemicals pay less than Pounds 20  - the price ICI was charged before privatisation. Electricity accounts for about 70 per cent of variable costs, compared with about 60 per cent before privatisation. The company says it has lost Pounds 30m in sales and Pounds 20m in profits this year because it cannot afford to run chlorine plants for long enough to meet export demand. Chlorine production will now be concentrated on ICI's three plants at Runcorn, one at Wilton, Teesside, and one at Northwich, Cheshire. Most of the British plastics industry depends on ICI's chlorine production, but ICI says managers have less than 24 hours' notice of the next day's electricity price, making sensible planning and budgeting impossible. Mr Brogden said that ICI had approached the generators, the supply companies, the regulator, the Department of Trade and Industry, and ministers including the prime minister. 'We have had tea and sympathy, but that's all. 'For all of us in manufacturing, the transition of the electricity industry into a duopoly simply was not adequate to achieve the government's intention of moving to a true market-based electricity industry in the UK.' ICI has to buy its electricity at pool prices. Suppliers will not negotiate long-term contracts at lower levels than can be achieved through the pool. Electricity for Runcorn's operations, which consume 1 per cent of national electricity supplies, cost Pounds 26 a megawatt hour last year and rose to an average Pounds 29 in the first nine months of this year. As prices rise, ICI will cut production further, eventually creating a shortage of home-made chlor-chemicals in the UK, which foreign competitors are likely to fill. Meanwhile, Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, called on the government to 'kick out' the props supporting expensive power if it wants a more competitive energy market with better prospects for coal. Mr Wallis made clear that he was referring mainly to state-owned Nuclear Electric, which operates the nuclear power stations in England and Wales and receives more than Pounds 1bn a year from the nuclear levy. He told the Coal Industry Society: 'Nuclear Electric would be insolvent without the nuclear levy. But with the levy at its present level, Nuclear Electric is, on paper, the country's most profitable generating company.' By the middle of this decade, he said, Nuclear Electric would displace the equivalent of 25m tonnes of coal a year. 'It is able to pre-empt the market by selling its product at whatever price it likes, and with its new-found riches it is continuing to run beyond their design life, at considerable expense, plant which the Central Electricity Generat-ing Board had written off as uneconomic five years ago.' Nuclear Electric has decided not to go ahead with a planning application for the Sizewell C power station in Suffolk before the government carries out its energy review in the wake of the colliery closure programme. The company had been intending to submit the application early this month.</p>

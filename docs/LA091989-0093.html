			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> BOITO'S 'MEFISTOFELE' GOES TRENDY  </P> <P> What's a poor opera company to do? What's a poor critic to do?  </P> <P> On Friday, the San Francisco Opera presented Alban Berg's "Lulu" in a lavish,  thoughtful new production by Lotfi Mansouri. For the most part, it respected  the composer's wishes. Your faithful scribe admired the tasteful result but  complained, sotto voce, that it seemed just a bit too timid.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the same company introduced a new production of Boito's  "Mefistofele." No one could accuse it of timidity. Robert Carsen, the latest  Wunderkind director on the trendy international circuit, had second-guessed the  composer in just about every area except the harmonic progressions. Your  faithful scribe found the tasteless result a bit too daring.  </P> <P> There must be a useful middle ground between rigid respect for convention and  reckless insensitivity. San Francisco hasn't found it this season.  </P> <P> Carsen and his designing accomplice, Michael Levine, haven't just staged  "Mefistofele." They have raped the old romantic opera.  </P> <P> They have done so with wild flights of imagination, with skill and guts. They  have concocted a terrific show. It offers non-stop titillation, smothered with  glitz. It takes pride in jolting perspectives and shocking sensibilities.  Still, rape is rape.  </P> <P> Boito, you may recall, wrote his lush, somewhat sentimental, ultimately  poignant version of the Faust legend in 1868. It is Italianate in its primitive  passions, sweeping in its grandeur, and far closer to Goethe's epic than the  perfumed version of Charles Gounod.  </P> <P> Boito thought big. He did not shrink from the philosophical confrontation  between the elemental forces of good and evil. He created a serious portrait of  a heroic devil who dares shake a cynical fist at a lofty deity.  </P> <P> Carsen trivializes all that, makes fun of it, and introduces stylized comic  distractions. He plays the entire drama on a ersatz-baroque stage within the  stage. All the world's a theater. Life is make-believe. Get it?  </P> <P> We got that message a long time ago. What else is new?  </P> <P> Mefistofele, in this context, becomes a two-bit hocus-pocus villain. He climbs  out of the orchestra pit on a ladder. He toys with a lot of magic props,  changes costumes constantly, favors anything red, conjures up puffs of smoke,  smiles and cackles. He hitches the unfortunate Faust to a flying contraption  that would have been rejected by a bus-and-truck company Peter Pan. He looks  like some suave imitation bad guy who wandered in from an Offenbach operetta.  </P> <P> That's just the beginning. The phony boxes in the phony opera house behind the  proscenium are haunted by mysterious masked figures in white shrouds and gold  crowns. We think they represent a Greek chorus masquerading as a saintly  presence.  </P> <P> Then there is Faust himself, a quizzical fellow in symbolic white tie and white  tails. And his Margherita, a pleasant peasant bride who inhabits a not-so-merry  merry-go-round that is decked with apple trees and cranked into rotation by a  convenient crone. Helen of Troy becomes a statuesque diva and her court is  turned into an audience of tuxedoed sugar daddies bearing floral tributes.  </P> <P> Oops. Almost forgot the mock raunch.  </P> <P> The motley crowd -- a very, very motley crowd -- at the kermesse includes a  nearly naked Adam and Eve, plus a non-biblical pair of conspicuously copulating  revelers. Many of the costumes reveal flesh in surprising places. The vision of  Margherita is totally, literally, and not all that idealistically, denuded. The  Walpurgisnacht choristers sport modern underwear, and less. The anachronistic  outfits come equipped with prop genitalia.  </P> <P> And so it goes, quickly and lustily. Sight overpowers sound. Cutesy gags  trample lyricism. Clever gimmicks distort honest emotion. It is fine, if one  doesn't happen to care about the music.  </P> <P> Ironically, the San Francisco forces do care. Maurizio Arena conducts with  splendid breadth and, where possible, with canny point. The overburdened  chorus, trained by Ian Robertson, pays equal attention to Arena's stick and  Carsen's shtick. The cast is strong, for the most part, and it plays gamely  with the directorial conceits.  </P> <P> The center of attention must be Samuel Ramey. He sings the title role very  well, in his somewhat monotonous way, and he makes a mighty noise -- mightier  at the top, actually, than at the bottom. He seems to enjoy the hammy charades.  He exudes obvious matinee-idol allure. He takes his shirt off -- a personal  trademark, whatever the role -- with proud aplomb. It isn't his fault that he  cannot make some of us forget Norman Treigle.  </P> <P> As Faust, Dennis O'Neill sings with as much ardor and flexibility as his rather  small and dry tenor allows, and he is good sport. It is worth pondering how  Luciano Pavarotti might have reacted -- and looked -- if a director wanted to  twirl him above the set on a wire.  </P> <P> Gabriela Benakova, lirico spinto par excellence, mustered an eloquent  Margherita and a sultry Elena, the hint of vocal indisposition notwithstanding.  </P> <P> The excellent supporting ensemble included Judith Christin as a giddy Marta,  Emily Manhart as a mellifluous Pantalis, Daniel Harper as a befuddled Wagner  and Douglas Wusnch as a staunch Nereo. The ballet provided a graceful Grecian  divertissement under the direction of Alphonse Poulin, though the dancers  didn't seem to appreciate the pervasive parody.  </P> <P> The production, incidentally, came from Geneva and will end up in Chicago. The  opening-night audience hailed it with generally hearty applause.  </P> <P> Some boos greeted the director and designer, however, at their curtain call.  Most of the disapproval seemed to emanate from the standing room. That area has  always accommodated the most discerning patrons.  </P></p>

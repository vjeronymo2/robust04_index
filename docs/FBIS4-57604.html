			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 22 May (AFP) -- Leaders of the  Nationalist Union [UN], a group linked to President Joaquin  Balaguer, have accused U.S. Ambassador Roberto Pastorino of  "meddling" in the country's domestic affiars.    The charge was voiced this Sunday by UN leader Delfin  Vasquez, who accused Ambassador Pastorino of favoring opposition  presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez in the middle  of a postelectoral crisis following the controversial elections  last Monday.    According to the UN, Pastorino spearheads a plan to  destabilize the Dominican Republic and begin an "intervention"  that would culminate with a plan to "merge" this nation and  Haiti into a single nation.    Velasquez said a UN delegation will travel to the United  States soon to protest Pastorino's actions before the Department  of State, and to tell the people of the United States about the  plan to merge the two nations. These two countries share the  island known as Hispanola during colonial times.    A radio and television campaign intensified over the weekend  reporting that France and the United States intend to solve the  Haitian crisis by unifying it with the Dominican Republic. The  opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), however, said  the UN seeks to distract the people's attention from the  "outrageous fraud" reportedly perpetrated during the 16 May  general elections. The PRD links the UN with President Joaquin  Balaguer.    As of Sunday 22 May, the Central Electoral Board had not yet  announced the winner of the election, whose main contenders were  Balaguer and Pena Gomez.</p>

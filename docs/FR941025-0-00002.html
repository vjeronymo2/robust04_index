The first change standardizes packaging for certain volume filled containers packed by weight. For the 1994/95 season only, volume filled containers packed by weight will be required to be 22- or 23-pounds net weight if more than 10 pounds and less than 35 pounds. Thereafter, a 22-pound volume filled standard will be effective. The second change streamlines information collection requirements under the program by deleting a requirement that handlers file a Beginning Inventory Data form and adding reporting requirements for a Kiwifruit Inventory Shipment System (KISS) form. Since the KISS form is already in use by handlers, this requirement merely formalizes existing industry use of the KISS form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule becomes effective October 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rose Aguayo, California Marketing Field Office, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102B, Fresno, California 93721; telephone (209) 487&hyph;5901; or Mark Hessel, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2526&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, telephone (202) 720&hyph;5127.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 920 [7 CFR Part 920], as amended, regulating the handling of kiwifruit grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principle place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 65 handlers of California kiwifruit subject to regulation under the order and approximately 600 kiwifruit producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. A majority of handlers and producers of California kiwifruit may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the terms of the order, fresh market shipments of California kiwifruit are required to be inspected and are subject to grade, size, maturity, pack, and container requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Kiwifruit Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, met on February 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended the following changes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Pack Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The committee recommended standardizing the weight of certain volume filled containers by requiring such containers to be marked by weight at either 22-pounds or 23-pounds net weight through July 31, 1995. For subsequent seasons, volume filled containers will be standardized at 22 pounds. Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;920.52 specifies that the Secretary may fix the weight of containers used in the handling of kiwifruit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

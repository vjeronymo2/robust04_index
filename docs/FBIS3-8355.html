			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Regular Tuesday interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav </F> Klaus by correspondent Lucie Weissova in Great Britain; date not  given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Weissova] Our interview is taking place in  Great Britain. You are halfway through your visit and many  meetings are still ahead of you. However, I would like to ask  you to tell us something about the significance of your visit  and to assess the talks you have held so far, above all your  talks with Prime Minister John Major.    [Klaus] [passage omitted] So far we have not had many  official contacts at the highest state level with Great Britain.  [passage omitted] Thus our visit is filling this vacuum. It is  necessary to leave a mark here. [passage omitted]    Simply, it is necessary to represent the Czech Republic  here.  I think that this is a never-ending process that is important  because it is continuing and never-ending, rather than because  of one specific result of one specific action. This is the  purpose of such visits.    Our talks with John Major concentrated, of course, more on  international political phenomena than on bilateral relations.  There is no significant political, economic, or any other  problem in relations between the Czech Republic and Great  Britain that we should put an end to, resolve, or put right. I  think the fundamental things, fundamental necessary agreements,  are in existence. We have formed the legislative basis for our  relations. Thus, the Cabinets have done what they should have  done and might have done, and now it is the turn of micro  subjects--i.e., citizens, entrepreneurs--to make use of the  created space.    We spoke about external issues, about foreign policy. As far  as John Major is concerned, the subject of Bosnia dominated [our  talks], without doubt. This is so because Great Britain, as we  are well aware, was a bit less vocal when those strong  ultimatums were being issued by NATO, laying stress on the land  forces rather than an air attack. However, it has seized the  initiative now and is strongly emphasizing the land forces,  strengthening its contingent there, seeking support for this  kind of activity. It was not by chance that John Major opened  our talks by speaking about this.    [Weissova] Prime Minister, Hungary announced last week that  it would submit an application to join the European Union by the  end of April. You reacted by saying that the Czech Republic  would do the same when it was ready. When do you think we are  going to be ready? I am not asking about the time but about the  conditions that we will have to fulfill.    [Klaus] We all know that the question of our entry to the  European Union or NATO is not about how quickly we file our  application. We hope no one is deluding himself into thinking  along these lines. [passage omitted]    [Weissova] Do you think we might wait for such a long time,  for 20 or 30 years?    [Klaus] Certainly not. Norway's experience was specific.  [passage omitted] This is not our case. Time runs faster now.  [passage omitted] I would say we have already succeeded in one  go to overcome all world records. In 1990, when I was finance  minister, I organized the readmittance into the International  Monetary Fund. [passage omitted]</p>

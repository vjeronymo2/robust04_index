			<p>BFN     [Text] In the opinion of Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary  general, conditions for deploying UN forces in Abkhazia are not  available, but the Security Council could discuss the issue of  putting Russian peace-keeping forces there to secure the return  of refugees and carry out sowing work. Regulating the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict is possible only by means of resolving  three issues which are closely linked with each other: a  political settlement, the return of refugees, and creating  forces for securing peace.    The UN secretary general stressed success in the political  sphere will only be possible if refugees start to return to  their homes, which, in itself, is connected with carrying out  peace-keeping operations.    The sowing season is about to start and if it is missed, by  the end of the year, the situation will be even harder. However,  noted Butrus-Ghali, it has become clear that a wide-scale return  of refugees and the forcibly displaced cannot take place until  the international military presence in Abkhazia's rayons, where  refugees and the displaced will be returning, is secured.  Without this international presence, they are not ready to  trust in the readiness and the ability of the Abkhaz authorities  to secure their safety. That is why, stated Butrus-Ghali, the  issue of deployment of international forces is a very urgent one.    "The Russian Federation has reported its readiness to deploy  an advanced contingent of the United Nations, if the Security  Council adopts the decision on creating it. I am proceeding  from the fact that this contingent of several hundreds of  military servicemen could be put in the rayon during several  days after the Security Council adopts the resolution on its  deployment," stated Butrus Ghali.</p>

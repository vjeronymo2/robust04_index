			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Britain's voice in Europe Britain's performance in standing up for the country's economic policy interests in the European Union has been at best patchy during recent years. The government's successes in European bargaining have generally been negative, shown by its 'opt-outs' over economic and monetary union (Emu) and social policy at Maastricht in 1991. The UK's tactical position has been weakened by setbacks such as sterling's exit from the ERM and, more recently, the fruitless tussle over prospective changes in majority voting rules. The government likes to declare that the 'tide of argument' in Europe has been moving in Britain's favour. Yet such pronouncements are less than convincing as long as the UK remains impeded - partly because of the Tory Eurosceptic minority in the House of Commons - from proposing firm policies to set the EU agenda. Britain undoubtedly made a significant contribution to agreement on the single market, but it has had less effect in assuring that the programme's precepts are properly enforced. In another field of special interest, the UK has been unable to prod its partners into forging a consensus on necessary cuts in subsidies in areas like steel. In view of this less-than-impressive track record, today's letter in the FT from leading UK industrialists is a timely reminder of the important areas where Britain ought to be able to muster strong EU support. Important passages of this mini-manifesto would find as much assent from industrialists in Germany, France or the Netherlands as from those in the UK. Labour deregulation On policies aimed at promoting further integration and improving prosperity and employment, there is more agreement than often imagined between the UK and its EU partners. This was underlined by yesterday's report from Franco-German experts proposing far-reaching labour market deregulation - even though the text was pointedly described as 'provisional' by the Paris government. Some of this common ground, admittedly, is often obscured by sharp differences over Europe's long-term goals. Last week, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was certain a single currency would one day be realised, while Mr John Major restated his scepticism. German opinion polls and shifts in Mr Kohl's own statements since 1991 make clear, however, that establishing a single currency has slipped well down the Germans' list of priorities. On social policy, the UK business community says, with justification, that full enactment of European employment legislation would damage the outlook for jobs. In spite of 11 EU countries' support for the social chapter, it is difficult, however, to detect enthusiasm among member governments for further action in this field. Policy realism Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, has expressed disquiet about deregulation throughout the EU. Yet far from signalling a new wave of legislation, Mr Delors is demonstrating that countries which sign the social chapter are in no way barred from improving labour market flexibility. The apparent agreement, reported today, between the UK and its EU partners on flexible application of labour legislation to contracting-out is another sign of new social policy realism. Across the EU, electorates' desire to promote a Europe a la Maastricht has fallen during the last three years, partly as a consequence of recession. As a result of a series of elections, European policies in many EU capitals are likely to take on a less federalist hue during the next 18 months, more in keeping with British instincts. In 1989-90, the UK government was concerned by changes in the post-cold war balance of power in Europe. Since then, it has not been able to give Britain a leading role in assuring a sound EU balance of policies. As the time approaches for the 1996 review of the Maastricht treaty, the UK has a good chance of increasing its weight in the councils and congresses of Europe. First, however, it will have to do more to convince its partners that it wants to make a positive rather than simply a spoiling contribution.</p>

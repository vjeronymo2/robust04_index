			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Observer: Long faces of the law Watch out, Mr Justice Harman. The judge, who gained brief notoriety outside legal circles in 1991 when he kicked a taxi driver in the belief that he was a press photographer, is facing a stiff challenge for the title of Britain's worst judge. For the second time, Legal Business magazine has voted him England's worst High Court judge. However, he's being pushed hard by Mr Justice Cresswell. In the three years since his appointment to the Bench, Sir Peter Cresswell has been transformed from a brilliant banking QC into a wimp so incapable of making up his mind that it's said 'if his wife puts out two bowls of cereal for him, he never gets to work'. Not too wimpish, however, to demand a right of reply: he notes 'the comments you rely on seem to be in conflict with the favourable comments in your last survey'. A cautionary tale perhaps for Legal Business's 'highly-rated 'Brat Pack'': Mr Justice Mance, Mrs Justice Arden and Mr Justice Longmore.</p>

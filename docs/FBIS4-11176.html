			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First of three-part article by "the people's lawyer" from </F> the "Fricasse" column: "Zedillo's Men"]    [Text] Before beginning, my dear readers, I would like to  make a suggestion. I want you to clip and save the three  articles that will appear in this space because they could serve  as reference material in the future.    Well, if pity and votes favor him (as they most probably  will), Dr. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will become president  of Mexico. Those who ponder this possibility also wonder: What  team of men will Zedillo choose to govern this country?    The team selected by the candidate will be very important  because the profile, personality, and level that the government  will attain depends on its members and their characteristics and  will determine the solutions they will seek for the numerous  problems afflicting our country.    It is for the purpose of satisfying this curiosity that this  country lawyer of yours will reveal in the following three  articles the names of those who will make up the government team.    They are divided into three groups. We also divided our work  into three installments in keeping with the belief that there  are -- or will be -- three types of collaborators in the Zedillo  administration:    1. Salinists who are fond of (and friends with) Zedillo.    2. Colosists who are close to Zedillo.    3. Zedillists by origin, from the north [los zedillistas  de origen, de hueso colorado].    Let us begin our work with the chapter on the Salinists who  are fond of Zedillo. But before we do that, to help you get the  picture, let us have a little history on Dr. Zedillo's  background and the people with whom he has worked.    The former secretary of public education graduated as an  economist from the Instituto Politecnico Nacional, IPN, and  earned master's and doctoral degrees in economics from Yale  University. He taught at IPN and the Colegio de Mexico  (1978-80), as did Jaime Serra Puche, Manuel Camacho Solis, and  Jose Cordoba Montayo.    In terms of work experience, Zedillo played a prominent role  at Banco de Mexico as head of Ficorca [expansion unknown], where  he established strong ties with Miguel Mancera. Carlos Mancera  Corcuera, who serves as coordinator of Zedillo's advisers, is  Miguel Mancera's son. From there, Zedillo moved to the  Secretariat of Programming and Budget as deputy secretary under  Pedro Aspe, and in 1988 he move up to secretary when Salinas  assumed the presidency.    In all these posts Zedillo developed important  relationships,  but perhaps the most important was with "Kingmaker" [previous  word in English] Jose Maria Cordoba Montoya, adviser to  President Salinas, who had Colosio nominated first, then his  favorite, Ernesto Zedillo.    Zedillo is also a close friend of Emilio Antonio Gamboa  Patron, current secretary of communications and transport, (to  give you an idea of their relationship) with whom he spent the  end of the year in Acapulco along with Governor (and friend)  Ruben Figueroa Alcocer.    Commerce Secretary Jaime Jose Serra Puche is also close to  Dr. Zedillo. The two share economic outlooks and international  links created by NAFTA. The recent appointment of Ignacio  Pichardo Pagaza as secretary general of the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] and campaign coordinator shows that Dr.  Zedillo trusts this man.    Another group of Salinists fond of Zedillo has its origins  at  Banco de Mexico. You should know that Zedillo owes everything to  Governor Miguel Mancera for granting him a scholarship and for  employing him. Zedillo belongs to the Grupo Banco de Mexico, the  cradle of a number of important friendships.    The other group of Zedillo friends is at IPN and branches  out  into the Secretariat of Communications, because the links  between the IPN and this secretariat are no secret.    Most prominent among Zedillo's friends at Grupo Banco de  Mexico (to which Miguel de la Madrid and his pupil, Carlos  Salinas, also belong) is Guillermo "Memo" Ortiz Martinez, our  companero at the military school and current deputy secretary of  finance.    Francisco Gil Diaz, the implacable right hand of Dr. Pedro  Aspe at the Finance Secretariat, is also a friend of Zedillo.  Two governors are among this group of Zedillo friends: Patricio  Chirinos of Veracruz and Otto Granados of Aguascalientes. It is  obvious that Salinists who are now in office have a good chance  of keeping their jobs or moving to other offices at the same  level.    Tomorrow we will give you a list of the Colosists who  support  Zedillo, as well as an idea of their possible destination. As  Hitchcock would say: "Do not miss it!"</p>

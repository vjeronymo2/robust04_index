			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Tuesday [28 June] the deregulation package unveiled by the  government the same day will change the nature of Japan's  economy and show the direction in which the country should be  heading.    Speaking at the administrative reform promotion  headquarters,  Hata said the package will be approved by the succeeding cabinet  as soon as possible.    The current political scene remains mired in confusion in  the  wake of the Hata cabinet's resignation announcement on Saturday.    The scheme, compiled by the headquarters, contains 279  deregulatory measures in the fields of real estate, financial  services, information and telecommunications.    The plan was prepared in line with the government's  market-access program announced in March to boost imports and  spur domestic demand.</p>

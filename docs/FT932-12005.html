			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Flowers give slight cheer for the hard-pressed ECONOMIC indicators are levelling out or turning cautiously upwards, and ministers and City economists talk about the recovery, but the small businesses which rely on customers paying cash - especially for things they can do without - are not convinced. People selling taxi-rides, haircuts, flowers and takeaway food say there may be a spring in people's step, but there is still a tight clamp on their purses. Mr Joe Cuddy, a taxi owner-driver, summed up the mood on Manchester's city-centre taxi ranks: 'If there is a recovery it's not filtered down to us. We need business travellers to and from and about the city and there just aren't enough around. 'Things were busy for a couple of months after the last election, then everything went flat again. The only bright thing is that when I talk to my passengers they do seem a bit more confident.' Mr Geoff Barlow, a few cabs down the queue, was glum. 'I'm going backwards financially,' he said. 'Nobody is talking about recovery. If they've heard about it, it isn't happening to them. The recession has certainly not bottomed out as far as I am concerned. We talk among ourselves that it can't get any worse, then it does.' Lack of city-centre trade has also hit wine bars, those 1980s symbols of optional spending. Many have gone out of business and the survivors do not yet see the end of their troubles. Mr Rod Creswick, of Cellar Vie in Manchester, said: 'Perhaps things are picking up a little, but the evidence is not consistent. I think they are not getting worse.' Suburban wine bars have been hit less than city-centre sites. Mrs Ruth Fletcher, co-owner of Jasper's Wine Bar in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said: 'We have had seasonal dips but our evening trade has held up well. People think twice about going into the city and we have benefitted.' For even cheaper ways of eating, such as Chinese takeaways, trading conditions continue to be difficult. Mr Shi Leung, proprietor of The Farmhouse Chinese Takeaway in Darlington, County Durham, said: 'People who used to buy meals are now buying chips, and people who used to buy chips don't buy anything.' He hears from others in his field that business is quiet. At the family-run Ming Dynasty Takeaway in Kenton, a residential area of Newcastle upon Tyne, Mr Marcus Ling believes the recession is still hitting spending. He does not believe it will end yet. 'Maybe in three to four years. Confidence isn't easy to build up.' One unexpected glimmer of hope may be coming from sellers of the ultimate in optional spending - flowers. According to Ms Diane Lawson, who has two shops in Harborne and Moseley, Birmingham. customers are saying: 'Damn it, let's go out and buy a few flowers to cheer ourselves up.' She added: 'Christmas wasn't brilliant. Valentine's Day got better. Mother's Day was very good. Since then it's been very steady.' Since Mothering Sunday on March 21, stocks have been doubled at the Birmingham city-centre stall owned by Sue and Bob Foster. Mrs Foster did not attach too much importance to that. 'If you don't have a good show, people won't look at it anyway.' For her, recession and mooted recovery are seamless. 'I don't think it's changed,' she said. 'You're up on one thing and down on another.' Ms Patricia Page, owner of Hair By Patricia Page in Edgbaston, Birmingham, sees her business in the same light. Nursing a 32.5 per cent rent increase and not daring to put up prices by more than 5 per cent, she has seen no sign of an upturn. 'You have three good days and then two bad ones and you're back where you started.' Ms Page added: 'People used to come every six weeks for a cut and blow. They're letting it go now for eight weeks.' But Mr Ray Seymour, general secretary of the National Hairdressing Federation, was cautiously optimistic. 'No one is saying we are out of the woods yet, but I am beginning to get reports from members pointing towards recovery.' Mr Seymour said that when economic circumstances started to improve people tended to go to the hairdresser more often because it made them feel better. But Mr Philip Rogers, managing director of Vidal Sassoon, which has 10 salons in the UK, was concerned that people might not 'return to their previous cycle' of hairdressing when the recession ended. Like a haircut, a coat of paint for the house is an expense that can be put off. Mr Stanley Broughton, chief executive of the British Decorators Association, said there seemed to be some slight improvement for his members, but it was impossible to generalise. Traditionally at this time of year painters would be planning the order in which they would do jobs booked in for three to four months ahead. Mr George Clasper, the association's northern region president, from Forest Hall, North Tyneside, said: 'At the moment they have work to do, but not much future work. You need the general public to have confidence before they're prepared to decorate.' Mr Grenville Weltch, director of of the National Federation of Painters and Decorating Contractors, said: 'It is going to be a slow process of recovery. Prices are still far too low and it will be some time before people have enough confidence to spend much money.' Even people who say they are doing well are cautious about the reasons. Mr Leo Gillen, the largest independent newsagent in Hartlepool, Cleveland, said takings were up but 'that doesn't mean things are getting better. If people have less money they come and shop locally'. Mr Mahbood Hussein, whose family runs two shops, in Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, and in nearby Thornaby, said: 'People won't go without their newspapers, though they might get one instead of two or three.' Mr Gillen doubts an end to recession would much affect newsagents. 'When the recession starts to move away our type of business doesn't benefit much. People start to buy three-piece suites and houses. You don't buy 10 bars of chocolate.' He believed people were still 'very wary' about their prospects. After the usual quiet January, business has picked up in recent weeks, but he believes spring and a mood of greater optimism may be responsible, not an end to recession.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Flying start for Russia's satellite-launch industry: The vast former Soviet space facilities have turned to commerce - fiercely undercutting western operators RUSSIA has launched itself into the world's commercial space industry. With it, the promise of cut-price space services took off, bringing the promise of cheaper telephone links, satellite broadcasting, navigation and weather forecasting. Russia's first western client is Inmarsat, a London-based consortium of 64 national telephone companies that operates satellites for mobile telecommunications. Inmarsat placed two contracts last week: a launch on Russia's Proton rocket for Dollars 36m, and another for an identical satellite on Europe's Ariane rocket for Dollars 62m. The price advantage of the Russian launch, which proved so attractive for Inmarsat, threatens the established market leaders in Europe and the US. It is already fuelling demands for protection from low cost rivals in the Dollars 2bn-a-year space launch industry. A second Russian contract could follow within weeks. Washington-based Intelsat, which operates satellites for ordinary telephone links and has more than 120 members, will decide early next month whether to buy from Russia. This would be the best possible start for Russian space commerce. It would create the formidable partnership of the world's largest space industry - Russia launches about 70 rockets a year - and the world's biggest independent international satellite owners: Intelsat and Inmarsat have 30 satellites in orbit and plan to launch 14 more by mid-1996. By comparison, Arianespace, the current market leader, offers about 10 launches a year. Satellite operators which buy Russian change the economics of the business. A communications satellite costs up to Dollars 140m and a western launch between Dollars 50m and Dollars 100m. Insurance adds another 15-20 per cent and then there are networks of dishes on the ground. A typical satellite has a working life of just 10 years. Even China is said to be concerned about Russian competition. It made its first two cut-price western launches in the last few weeks but would be no match for the vast Russian space machine. The three western companies that dominate the industry, General Dynamics and McDonnell-Douglas of the US and market leader Arianespace, are already fighting back. Mr Charles Bigot, chairman of Arianespace, argues that no level-headed company would buy launch services from Russia. 'Russian and Chinese launches are for gamblers or those under political pressure,' asserts Mr Bigot. Gamblers because Moscow has no track record in commercial satellite launches. Insurance rates will be high, as they have been with China, and the lack of experience may leave a satellite in an inaccurate orbit, shortening its lifespan. The political pressure, he argues, has come from Washington, which controls large minority stakes in Inmarsat and Intelsat through a statutory body called Comsat. Mr Charlie Lloyd, managing director of commercial launch services at General Dynamics, agrees. 'The Bush administration showed a desire to use the launch vehicle industry as a tool of foreign policy without regard to the effects on on the industry and its workers.' Industry sources point to the US decision to allow the export of the first US-built Intelsat satellite for launch in China. Permission was given within days of the US sale of F-16 fighters to Taiwan, to which China had objected. Intelsat denies that it is under pressure to work with China or Russia. 'As an international organisation we have an obligation to consider international bids,' it says. The political dimension to who launches satellites has encouraged US politicians to join the fray. Mr Al Gore, the new vice president, said in a speech last month: 'The emergence of (space industry) competitors from non-market economies increases the opportunities for predatory pricing - the very same economic weapon that foreign countries employed in the 1980s to target and destroy the American manufacturing base.' With simple mechanisms of control, through Comsat and the granting of satellite export licences, President Bill Clinton may not be able to resist calls to save US jobs. The calls are likely to grow in volume because another new competitor could be about to make its mark. Japan is also bidding for the next Intelsat launch contract. The country has only a small aerospace industry and no working rocket. But it has emerged from obscurity in many other industries.</p>

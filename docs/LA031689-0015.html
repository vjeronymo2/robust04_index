			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  LET'S EAT OUT: AT GRANDIA, DINNER IS WORTH THE WAIT  </P> <P> I know, I know. You've already heard about Grandia Palace from me. But that was  long ago; things have changed.  </P> <P> The Grandia Palace in Hollywood was a bargain the moment it opened its doors,  with its good fish dishes at prices that would make you happy all the way to  the bank.  </P> <P> But now that it's been around some -- one, two years? -- a sort of seasoning  and curing has turned it into an even greater bargain.  </P> <P> What you have now is a restaurant not only with good, clean food (chiefly fish  with strong Greek overtones) and ridiculously low prices, but an ambiance that  is more cheerful than Aunt Jenny's kitchen and entertainment that is clearly a  big, big bonus to any restaurant trying to survive these days.  </P> <P> You get singing-dancing waiters and waitresses, an accomplished guitarist  strumming in place (not roving), a proprietor who makes you feel at home, a  cook in the kitchen who can do Greek cooking as well as he does his native  Majorcan cooking (the paella was a striking example of good Spanish home  cooking), and Apollo, Diane and Socrates (statues) peering at you from behind  blooming azalea plants wherever in the room you may be. On weekends, customers  join in the entertainment, much as they do at the Japanese bars.  </P> <P> And, yes, the giant-size replica of Apollo standing like an X-rated  advertisement for a bathhouse smack inside the dining room, where you can't  miss him, is still around, but with an anatomical alteration that pains me in  more than one way.  </P> <P> And, no, the crummy door jambs were never fixed, even though new splendid doors  have replaced the old boards that passed for doors in the past. "Acropolis was  never finished, either," said Peter Sargologos, the owner. He has a point.  </P> <P> The food has changed somewhat, too, now that Sargologos decided to beef up the  Greek portion of the menu by popular demand. "I never intended it to be a Greek  restaurant, just seafood, but people want it," he said.  </P> <P> And why not? You have some truly fine Greek tiropita and spanokopita (savory  filo pastries). The avgolemono (lemon-flavored chicken noodle soup) would be  great anytime, particularly on a day when you're feeling the need for a lift.  There is no Greek salad anywhere else in the city that I know of that is better  than the one Sargologos serves. It's a meal, brimming with the freshest of  fresh vegetables, good ripe tomatoes, superb Greek cheese from Epirus and  calamata olives that are plump and juicy. If you want chicken added to the dish  for a main-course meal, you get it without further ado.  </P> <P> The Greek dishes are listed separately, but some, such as meze (appetizers),  also appear with other non-Greek appetizers. Keftedakia (meat balls), saganaki  (fried cheese) taramosalata (red roe caviar dip) and Greek eggplant salad are  among them.  </P> <P> If you want to stick to Greek food, try any of the lamb dishes served,  especially if they've been freshly made. The lamb youvetsi, fricassee, leg of  lamb and lamb with eggplant are good most of the time. I've had somewhat  dried-out leg of lamb at times, but not often. The moussaka and pastichio are  wonderful when freshly made, too, so ask first. The Greek makaronada (macaroni  with meat) is a double meal. Be prepared for toting as you leave.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mixed Styles  </P> <P> The remaining menu is a mixed bag of seafood, Continental, vegetarian,  south-of-the-border and European dishes. A little too much of everything is  bothersome, but Sargologos refuses to narrow things down. "People like them,"  he said.  </P> <P> So you'll find vegetarian fettuccine Alfredo, pizza (with dried tomatoes, pine  nuts, cashews, caseri cheese, almonds, artichokes and Alfredo sauce), passion  fruit with cottage cheese, stuffed pepper a la Greque among the vegetarian  dishes. There are burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos and fajitas from south  of the border, and from Europe, pepperoni pizza, Spanish paella for two,  ravioli with sauce Bolognese and fettuccine with seafood.  </P> <P> Among continental dishes, you can have grilled chops, chicken, veal, New York  steak, shish kebab (beef, chicken and fish) plus ground steak. Combination  plates are also available, if you want to mix and match.  </P> <P> In fact, you can virtually order any food anyway you desire it cooked.  Sargologos will comply. The seafood section, for instance, simply lists the  type of fish available (a giant lobster tail at $35 for a whole and $16.85 for  a half included). The fish, by the way, comes from Sargologos' fish store  across the street, which also contains a seafood cafe. Dirt cheap.  </P> <P> Just tell the waiter how you want the fish cooked -- grilled, broiled or  poached. All entrees come with soup or salad. At prices ranging from $6.95 for  seafood plaki or $12.95 for steak and shrimp combo plate and $11.95 for a huge  main course salad, you can't possibly go wrong. The most expensive item on the  menu sans lobster and fresh crab is $16.95 for bouillabaisse for two.  </P> <P> And we haven't even gotten to the piece de resistence -- the singing-dancing  help -- who vary from time to time, depending on who lasts the grueling pace.  After all, your waiter is balancing plates one moment and is suddenly out on  the dance floor doing a hopa Greek dance with Nureyev proficiency, if not  grace. The next time you look up, he's at the microphone wailing "I want you, I  need you, I love you," with the kind of feeling that would make Elvis seem like  Whistler's mother. Hokey, never serious, but just the right kind of silliness  that makes an evening out fun.  </P> <P> Which bring us to one major flaw of the restaurant. The wait. Service, while  charming and bright, willing and able, is still slow and somewhat forgetful.  Who can blame the overqualified waiters? Besides, who cares, if your intention  is to be entertained.  </P> <P> And, yes, the noise level has not diminished. It's even bolder and more bouncy  now that there is music and dance to reverberate against the marble and glass.  If you consider noisiness a flaw, forget Grandia.  </P> <P> Don't forget to try the rice pudding if it's fresh. Don't bother, if it's not.  The pudding is the typical Greek version that is slightly more creamy and runny  than firm, baked American rice pudding. The custard flan is good, too. There is  baklava (nut-filled filo pastry) and galactobureko (Greek baked custard filled  pastry). Excellent.  </P> <P> So what else do you want? An early-bird menu? You've got it, at prices several  dollars less than the regular menu. Instead of $6.95 for Greek salad you pay  $4.95. New York steak is $8.95 and roast lamb $7.95. All with soup or salad,  bread and butter. What you don't get with the early-hour menu is the  entertainment. But who cares if all you want to do is eat?  </P> <P>  Grandia Palace, 5657 Melrose Ave. (213) 462-8628. Open daily from 11 a.m. to 3  p.m. for lunch; 5 to 11 p.m. for dinner.

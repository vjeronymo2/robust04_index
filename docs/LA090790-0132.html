			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> DEBATE DELAYS PLAN FOR SENIOR CENTER  </P> <P> A plan to expand the city's senior citizen center hit a snag this week, as it  became the latest focus of a City Council political debate.  </P> <P> The council on Tuesday delayed a plan to add a building to the Rodgers Seniors  Center because of concerns that the expansion would be nixed if voters approve  a Nov. 6 ballot initiative limiting beach and park development.  </P> <P> City officials say the new building is needed to expand recreational and  outreach services for the city's growing senior citizen population.  </P> <P> The otherwise routine proposal was tossed into the political arena after  Councilman Don MacAllister questioned whether the ballot measure, if approved,  would hinder the center's expansion.  </P> <P> Measure C, a citywide initiative sponsored by Save Our Parks, a citizens  activist group, is a proposed City Charter amendment that would forbid the city  from selling or leasing any park or beach land without voter approval. The  measure would apply to new developments larger than 3,000 square feet or  costing at least $100,000.  </P> <P> MacAllister, who opposes the initiative, said he believes the measure would  force a citywide vote on the senior center expansion, because the proposed  $150,000 building addition is planned for the city-owned site at Orange Avenue  and 17th Street.  </P> <P> After a lengthy debate, council members directed City Atty. Gail C. Hutton to  issue a legal opinion on the measure's potential effect on the expansion.  Hutton's report is scheduled to be released at the council's next meeting,  Sept. 17.

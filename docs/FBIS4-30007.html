			<p>BFN     [Text] In his lecture to students of the MAINICHI SHIMBUN  Businessmen's College at a hotel in Makubari, Chiba city, Isao  Ishizuka, Air Self-Defense Force chief of staff, touched on the  issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons  and said it is necessary to bring North Korea's past nuclear  developments to light. Commenting on the U.S. Government's tilt  toward freezing the DPRK's current nuclear program, he said:  "My personal view is that freezing North Korea's nuclear  program alone is not enough. As a neighboring nation of the  DPRK, Japan will not be satisfied with freezing North Korea's  nuclear program without verifying that country's past nuclear  developments."</p>

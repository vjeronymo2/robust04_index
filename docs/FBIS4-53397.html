			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "You and the Law" column by Raul J. Palabrica: </F> "Inconsistency in Joma Sison's Position"]    [Text] Internal problems continue to wrack the ranks of the  Leftist movement in the country. More than a year after  President Ramos initiated peace talks with its umbrella  organization, the National Democratic Front, the question of who  between the leaders in the field and the officials based abroad  has the moral authority to represent the movement in the  negotiations remains unsolved.    The difference in opinion on how to approach this issue has  led to the breakup of the once monolithic Communist Party of the  Philippines (CPP) and its affiliate organizations. Three  factions, all claiming to represent the legitimate aspirations  of the oppressed masses, have emerged from the conflict. The  intense ideological dispute is believed to have gone beyond the  level of debate and claimed its first victim in the person of  former NPA [New People's Army] Banahaw Command leader Leopoldo  Mabilangan. A faction identified with Jose Ma. Sison, CPP  founding chair, claimed responsibility for the death of  Mabilangan.    The bloodletting is expected to continue in the wake of  reports coming from Sison's camp that a "people's court" has  found former CPP stalwarts Felimon Lagman, Arturo Tabara, Romulo  Kintanar, and Ricardo Reyes guilty of serious crimes against the  people and sentenced them to death. The verdict will be carried  out by a group specially organized for that purpose. The  announcement served to confirm Sison's earlier statements that  his four rivals would be facing trial for their alleged crimes.    The news came shortly after reputed CPP Secretary General  Wilma Tiamzon was arrested by elements of the Philippine  National Police. When demands for the release of Tiamzon were  not heeded by the government, Sison, speaking from The  Netherlands, bewailed the arrest and detention as illegal  (because the basis for the arrest, illegal possession of  firearms, was dismissed by the prosecutor) and inhuman (because  she is suffering from serious health problems). He threatened to  pull the National Democratic Front out of the peace talks if  Tiamzon would not be freed.    It is amazing how Sison can change from one ideological  posture to another without batting an eyelash. A day after  Tiamzon's arrest, he spoke on several radio talk shows to  condemn the violation of Tiamzon's human rights. Without being  forthright about it, he acknowledged that Tiamzon was entitled  to all the rights and privileges that the Constitution  guarantees to Filipino citizens suspected of having committed a  crime. The same Constitution he refuses to accept as the  framework within which the peace talks shall be conducted.    However, for former CPP leaders who dared question his  handling of the affairs of the Leftist movement in the country,  that adherence to democratic processes is non-existent. His  critics are not in the same league as the run-of-the-mill  politicians who criticize for the sheer joy of it or to attract  attention. They are men who braved the guns of the military and  bore the rigors of life in the mountains to keep the flame of  the movement burning while Sison enjoyed the comforts of  self-exile in Europe. Their past achievements, notwithstanding  refusal to toe the line of the party chair, was considered a  serious offense against the movement which deserved disciplinary  action after hearing by a "people's court."    The word is out that a "people's court" has convened and  decided that Sison's four erstwhile comrades should die for  their crime. How the verdict was arrived at was never explained.  Whether or not Lagman, Tabara, Kintanar, and Reyes were given  the opportunity to defend themselves is a big question mark. As  there are no transcripts of the proceedings, third parties can  only speculate on what transpired in the trial assuming it was  really held. One thing though is sure: the subject of the  trial kept away from the places where Sison's faction holds fort  in the wake of reports that his followers are after their head.    Noticeably, Sison has not expressed any concern for the  human  rights of the four "convicts" as he did for Tiamzon. Neither  has he shown equivalent compassion for them and their families  who now have to suffer the anguish of anticipating death  whenever they sense the presence of unidentified or  suspicious-looking persons in their midst. In Sison's book,  those opposed to his rule enjoy less rights and privileges than  the faithful who accept his doctrinaire teachings as gospel  truth. The principle of equality of all social classes which is  a cornerstone of the CPP's war for national liberation appears  to have lost its meaning in the current strife within the  Leftist movement.    It's time Sison accepted the reality that more than 30 years  have passed since he started his struggle. The world's  political climate has changed. The principal source of  financial support for the movement, the Soviet Union, no longer  exists. The dictator he fought so strongly against is already  dead. A more democratic system of government is in place. The  Marxist-Leninist doctrine on seizure of political power is no  longer in tune with the times. A change in approach is  necessary if Sison sincerely wants to play a significant role in  the political development of our country.    Unless corrective measures are taken by its leadership, the  "people's court" verdict on the four former CPP stalwarts may  turn out to be the spark that would trigger the incineration of  the Leftist movement in the country.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / People: Finance moves The turnover of top staff at Lazard Investors continued yesterday with the announcement of the departure of Jimmy West as chief executive. West was said to have felt that he had completed his task; it is understood that the separation was mutually agreed and his next move has not been made public. This move follows a succession of changes at Lazard Investors - which the parent company now hopes will cease. 'It is a world in which there are a lot of changes,' says David Verey, chairman of Lazard Brothers. 'We've had more changes than frankly I would wish. But that's life.' Tom Cross Brown, a director in corporate finance, takes over from West. Says Verey: 'We are an international house and Tom is very much an internationalist'; he was head of Lazard Brothers' Hong Kong office from 1982 to 1986.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (19): Will your pension be enough? - Retirement planning A PENSION fund is a person's most important asset, generally exceeding the value of the family home. Despite this fact, few understand fully how their pensions are calculated; yet without this knowledge it is impossible to plan future contributions and make good any shortfall in provision. There are three main sources of pension: state, occupational and personal. Most people will have pensions from at least two of these sources, and often all three. The state pension is split in two: the basic 'old age' pension and the earnings-related element, known as Serps (State Earnings-related Pension Scheme). The right to a benefit under both of these will depend on an person's National Insurance Contribution (NIC) record. National Insurance for most people is levied at 9 per cent on 'band earnings' - earnings between Pounds 52 and Pounds 390 per week for the current tax year. Provided employees pay the full rate of NIC for most of their working lives, they should be entitled to the full basic state pension, currently Pounds 52 per week; while, at the other end of the scale, a minimum of 10 complete years of NICs provides a weekly pension of just Pounds 13. Women, in particular, often have a poor record of NICs if they have spent years at home looking after young children or elderly relatives. Wives can claim a Category B pension, currently worth Pounds 31.25 a week, through their husbands' contributions, but this is not paid until their husband is 65 and may be lost if a woman changes her marital status. Entitlement to Serps builds up from day one. The scheme was introduced by a Labour government in 1978, to provide employees with 25 per cent of average band earnings over the best 20 years of their working lives. But the value of this benefit was reduced by the present government in 1988, to 20 per cent of earnings over the whole working career. The Department of Social Security (DSS) would be the first to admit that calculation of state pensions is complex, but it now offers a pensions forecast service. If you are interested in this service, complete form BR19 available from any DSS office. Occupational schemes are the second main source of pensions. They represent arguably the most tax-efficient form of retirement saving. Since employee and employer contributions attract full tax relief, the fund grows free of all UK taxes and the employee can take a lump sum tax-free on retirement. Occupational schemes also provide the employee with valuable death and disability benefits. More than half the 23m employees in the UK are in occupational schemes, with the majority, including public sector employees, in what are known as 'final-salary' schemes. Under a final-salary scheme, the employee pays contributions, usually around 6 per cent of earnings, and builds up a pension benefit typically worth 1/60th of final salary for each year of service. The maximum pension permitted by the Inland Revenue is two-thirds of final salary, which can be achieved after 40 years in the type of scheme described above. But a growing number of schemes are set up on a 'money-purchase' basis. Under this type of arrangement, employee and employer contributions are invested to provide a fund at retirement which is used to buy an annuity plus the tax-free lump sum. Annuities (see letter A), which are purchased from life offices, offer an income for life in return for a lump-sum investment. Under a money-purchase scheme, the final pension is dependent on the level of contributions and the performance of the fund. Most occupational schemes in the UK are 'contracted out' of Serps - that is, they agree to provide an equivalent or better benefit than Serps in return for a reduced rate of NICs. Where there is no company scheme, or the scheme is not contracted out, the employee is automatically in Serps. Few employees achieve a full two-thirds pension under the main scheme, but it is possible to top up by paying into the company's additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme. AVCs are individual money-purchase plans that build up a fund, rather like a group money-purchase scheme, which the individual takes in the form of extra pension at retirement. The maximum annual contributions an employee can pay to an occupational pension scheme is 15 per cent of salary. Given that most employees contribute about 6 per cent to the main scheme, this leaves plenty of scope for AVCs. While AVCs provide the most cost-effective form of top-up provision, employees looking for wider investment choice might consider free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs), available mainly from the life offices. For employees who intend to remain with one employer for many years, final-salary occupational schemes represent good value and a secure retirement income, because the pension is linked to a known quantity, namely the employee's salary at retirement. But problems often arise for employees who change jobs. If an employee leaves within two years of joining a scheme, he or she is entitled to a rebate of contributions less certain taxes and back payments into Serps. After two years, leavers are entitled to a 'transfer value" which can be invested in an individual personal pension plan or transferred into the new employer's schemes. Due to the way transfers are calculated, they can give a poor return on contributions, especially for young people. Until recently, membership of occupational schemes was a condition of joining a company, but since 1988 these schemes have been voluntary. At the same time, the government introduced 'appropriate' personal pension plans, which allowed employees to opt out of Serps on an individual basis for the first time in return for a rebate of NICs. Over 4.5m employees have taken advantage of the generous rebate terms offered by the government worth almost Pounds 1,500 this year to those earning over Pounds 20,300. This rebate of NICs is sent by the DSS direct to the personal pension provider. Personal pensions, which replaced the old-style self-employed retirement annuity contracts, are available from life offices, banks, building societies, unit trust groups and friendly societies. The choice of pension provider should be made with the help of an independent adviser, who can select the most competitive product and advise on the most suitable type of fund. In addition to the rebate plan, holders can contribute up to 17.5 per cent of relevant earnings each year (more for older age groups) and get full tax relief on these payments. Like group money-purchase schemes, personal pensions provide a fund at retirement, used to buy an annuity, and a tax-free cash sum of up to 25 per cent of the total fund value. Finally, since the 1989 Budget, there has been a cap on the maximum earnings to which pension contributions relate. The pensions cap, which applies to all personal pensions as well as certain occupational pensions, is Pounds 71,400 for the current tax year. In the case of occupational schemes, the cap affects employees who joined an existing company scheme after June 1, 1989, or a new scheme set up after March 14, 1989.</p>

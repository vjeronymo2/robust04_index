			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In implementing the provisions of section 1920 that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify that presumptive eligibility determinations must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on family income, we would require the qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider in all cases to apply to the woman's gross family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income the highest, most advantageous income criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to the pregnant woman under the approved plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``applicable'' level would usually be the higher of either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the poverty level standard or the medically needy income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level (without spenddown). This means that income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disregards are not considered, and in the case of blind or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled individuals in section 1902(f) States, or in States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that have a medically needy program, the cost of incurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical expenses could not be deducted in order to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income to the allowed income level (spending down).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consideration of disregards and incurred medical expenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would allow some women to have income above the ``applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level'' specified in section 1920(b)(1)(A). We believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress intended by the use of the term ``applicable level''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require qualified providers only to make simple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations and not complicated adjustments of income such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as those involved in applying spenddown rules or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disregarding certain types of income. To impose detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations and complicated adjustments on providers would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be administratively burdensome and contrary to efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration because of the short-term nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumptive eligibility status and because no other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility requirements (not even resources) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered. We believe that we are not imposing an undue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hardship on a pregnant woman by not allowing spenddown or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not disregarding certain income. If the provider makes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision that the woman does not ``appear'' to meet the income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria, the pregnant woman still has the right to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for regular Medicaid within a reasonable period of time and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a formal eligibility determination made. Under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formal eligibility determination, the agency may find that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pregnant woman is retroactively eligible for regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid during the presumptive period under the authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of section 1902(a)(34) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1920(b)(2) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended by section 411(k)(16) of MCCA, specifies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifications that a provider must meet in order to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed to make presumptive eligibility determinations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider must_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Be eligible to receive payments under Medicaid;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Be an entity that provides services of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following type: outpatient hospital services as specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 1905(a)(2)(A) of the Act or rural health clinic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services and any other ambulatory services offered by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rural health clinic and otherwise included in the plan as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section 1905(a)(2)(B); or be an entity that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides clinic services by or under the direction of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician described in section 1905(a)(9) of the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

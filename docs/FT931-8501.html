			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Bangemann gives priority to telecoms MR Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, yesterday signalled that an active telecommunications policy would spearhead Commission attempts to boost industrial growth in the Community. The commissioner said priority during the Commission's two-year term should be given to strengthening the competitiveness of EC industry. Outlining his work programme for 1993, Mr Bangemann said telecoms was one sector in which 'we can move very quickly to create new demand immediately'. Mr Bangemann added responsibility for telecommunications to his industry portfolio in the Commission reshuffle last December. The change has given him control over Commission policy on information technology, high-definition television (HDTV) and telecoms liberalisation, as well as more than 40 per cent of the funds available to business through the EC's research and development programmes. Mr Bangemann intends to concentrate on improving cross-border telecoms networks linking national administrations, and developing a compatible Community-wide integrated services digital network (ISDN), which should lead to clearer, faster, cheaper and more reliable telecommunications. The Commission is also close to finishing consultations with industry and consumers on how to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of ordinary telephone calls in the Community. Mr Bangemann said yesterday he was opposed to national telecoms monopolies if they hampered the introduction of modern technology, but favoured the maintenance of an efficient public service. However, the commissioner said it would be imprudent to use special Commission powers to challenge those national monopolies.</p>

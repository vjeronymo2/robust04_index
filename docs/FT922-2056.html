			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Italian bonds fluctuate wildly on devaluation fears ITALIAN government bonds plunged on rumours of a devaluation of the lira yesterday, but later recovered their losses to close slightly higher on the day after a volatile trading session. Dealers said the market opened on a relatively bullish note and prices rose initially on reports that Italy's President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could be close to appointing a prime minister after a two-month political deadlock. However, traders said the early gains were completely wiped out in the afternoon by a market report forecasting that the lira would be devalued by 5 per cent. The report led to a weakening of the lira, forcing the Bank of Italy to intervene in the foreign exchange markets. The news prompted heavy futures-driven selling from foreign bond houses. A Bank of Italy official was quoted dismissing the devaluation rumours as untrue. The futures contract, which had opened at 95.45, fell from its high of 95.93 to a low of 95.26, but later traded up to end the day at 95.48. Elsewhere in Europe, dealers noted some switching out of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands into Danish government bonds in anticipation of an easing in short-term interest rates. Following the results of the Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, the Danish central bank allowed short-term rates to move up to protect the currency, but dealers said the rates are expected to edge lower soon. The rest of the European bond markets saw dull activity ahead of today's Irish referendum on Maastricht and the public holiday in parts of Europe. UK government bonds ended the day barely changed with many market participants waiting on the sidelines ahead of the Irish referendum. The Liffe gilt futures contract traded in a range of 97.22-98.01 and ended the day around 97.30, slightly up on its opening level of 97.29. The May retail sales figures and April industrial production data released yesterday had no perceptable impact on the gilt market, dealers said. The Bank of England supplied some of its index-linked stock - the 4 1/8 per cent gilt due 2030 - to the market yesterday at a price of 98 7/8 . Dealers estimate that approximately Pounds 300m of the Pounds 500m tranche has been sold so far. US Treasury prices firmed slightly across the maturity spectrum in exceptionally quiet trading. The benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 102 3/16 , yielding 7.838 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 5/16 , yielding 4.937 per cent. Although the absence of fresh economic news left the market adrift during the morning, there was sporadic retail and institutional buying. This, combined with overnight gains on foreign markets, kept the long end of the market in positive territory. The day's only news was the release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book', a compilation of reports on business conditions in the 12 Fed districts. The report had little effect on sentiment, however, confirming that economic recovery was continuing, but steadily. Later in the session, the Fed announced that next week it would sell a record Dollars 15bn in two-year notes and Dollars 10.5bn in five-year notes, another record. JAPANESE government bonds closed at the highs of the day, lifted by hopes of an easing in interest rates and helped by the US Treasury market's firmness overnight. Yesterday's sharp drop in the Tokyo stock market led to speculation that the Bank of Japan may allow an easing in short-term interest rates soon. The Nikkei average fell 507.73 points to 16,445.80, its lowest close since October 1986. In the futures market, the September contract, which opened at 102.00, breached an important resistance level and ended the day at 102.33. The next key resistance level is 103.12. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.47 per cent and moved to 5.405 per cent at the close of trading in Tokyo. AUSTRIA'S OTOB futures and options exchange is to launch a new Austrian Traded Index (ATX) contract on August 7, Reuter reports. ATX futures and options contracts - a weighted index based on the 18 continuously traded Austrian shares - will supplement the existing options contracts on six shares listed since OTOB was launched last year.</p>

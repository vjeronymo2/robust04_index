			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: LAYING HAROLD &amp; BELLE'S RUMORS TO REST  </P> <P> Denise Le Gaux isn't sure what's going on, but she wishes it would stop. Denise  is co-owner, with her husband Harold and their friends Alvin and Susan Honor,  of Harold &amp; Belle's, a popular 20-year-old Creole-style restaurant on W.  Jefferson Boulevard in Los Angeles. (Belle was Harold's mother.) The restaurant  has done well enough over the years, and in fact has recently undergone its  third expansion since its founding. But a couple of months ago, says Le Gaux,  people started calling up and asking if it was true that they were going to  close.  </P> <P> "It's become so much of an annoyance," she says. "Almost every day somebody  asks us when we're going out of business or where we're moving too. Just a few  hours ago, somebody called to make a reservation for later in the week, but  first wanted to know if we were definitely still going to be open by then."  Even more annoying, she adds, there are apparently rumors going around that  Harold is seriously ill, and even that he has been shot. "Somebody called up  and asked where they could send flowers, and when the funeral was going to be,"  she says. "I just don't know how all this got started."  </P> <P> Let the rumors themselves be buried, then. Harold &amp; Belle's is open and  plans to remain open, in its original location -- and Harold (and Denise, and  Alvin and Susan) are all feeling just fine, thank you. "About the only thing  that's changed lately other than our expansion," Denise adds, "is that we've  added fried chicken to the menu. It isn't Creole, but it's good."  </P> <P> And speaking of chicken, if you haven't found enough excuses to throw parties  already this holiday season, you might consider celebrating the fact that the  Buffalo chicken wing is 25 years old. This strange, curiously appealing  all-American specialty -- deep-fried chicken wings served with hot dipping  sauce, celery and blue cheese dressing -- was invented by the late Therese  Bellissimo of Frank &amp; Theresa's Anchor Bar in Buffalo in late 1964. The  story of its creation is the usual sort of thing -- left-over ingredients,  last-minute guests, culinary ingenuity, and so forth -- but the Buffalo chicken  wing has definitely taken off in the recent years. The Anchor Bar alone sells  36,000 pounds of them a month. And that ain't chicken feed.  </P> <P> RESTAURANT TIDBITS: Steven Mettle is the new chef at Gordon's in Aspen,  replacing the co-founder of the restaurant, Gordon Naccarato. Naccarato retains  an interest in Gordon's, as does his wife Rebecca, who remains at the  establishment. Naccarato himself, meanwhile, is in Los Angeles at least  temporarily, where he is helping out old friend Mark Peel in the kitchen of  Campanile. . . . Patrick Healy of Champagne in West L.A., is headed for  Honolulu next month to help former L.A. chef Roy Yamaguchi (Le Gourmet, 385  North) celebrate the first anniversary of his Diamond Head restaurant, Roy's.  Healy is the only mainlander to have been invited to join the festivities,  though three other Hawaii-based chefs will also participate. . . . A lot of New  York restaurateurs must be shaking these days, and not because they're spending  too much time in their walk-in coolers, either. City officials have announced a  crackdown on alleged cash rake-offs at area eating places. While not  identifying suspected wrongdoers, a New York City spokesman claimed recently  that as much as $6 billion might be due in taxes, interest and penalties on  unreported restaurant income. The city also apparently plans to offer rewards  to restaurant employees who finger their cash-grabbing bosses.  </P> <P> SPELLING CHECK: After I noted in this column some months ago that Bruno's  Chartreuse had reopened in Santa Monica on the site of the defunct Tosh,  several readers contacted me to say that they were unable to get a phone number  for the place from information operators. The problem, it turns out, is that  the restaurant is now called simply Chartreuse. And the number, for your  reference, is (213) 453-3333 . . . Paris-Brest in Woodland Hills was also the  subject of many calls to this column. The problem, it turns out, is that the  restaurant is listed as Le Paris- Brest. The number is (818) 888-9277.  </P></p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Gearing surprise as Laporte drops 10% LAPORTE, the speciality chemicals group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down 10 per cent, from Pounds 96.4m to Pounds 86.6m, for the year to January 3. The shares fell 9p to 676p, as analysts were surprised by the group's gearing. Although debt at the year end had been Pounds 125.6m, Mr Ken Minton, chief executive, said during a presentation to analysts that it had deteriorated since January to about Pounds 190m. Most of the deterioration - about Pounds 25m - had been caused by adverse currencies and in particular the rise of the dollar. Debt at Evode, a recent acquisition, had been higher than expected (Pounds 10m) and the group had bought about Pounds 8m of Evode's shares during the takeover. A further acquisition (Pounds 5m) and seasonal changes (Pounds 6m) had added to debt. Mr Minton said the group would be cash-positive during 1993. Mr Minton said the results had been in line with predictions and that he felt pretty good about the prospects for Evode and the group generally. The results were achieved on turnover down from Pounds 616m to Pounds 608m. The pre-tax profits included Pounds 9.6m from the Interox business which was sold on May 21. Sales of Interox until that date were Pounds 74m. The organic speciality division's operating profits were Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 4.9m) on turnover up from Pounds 33.6m to Pounds 81.7m thanks to the acquisition of the peroxy speciality business at Interox. The existing business increased from Pounds 33.6m to Pounds 41m. The peroxy business added Pounds 9.4m to the profits. Sales at the absorbents division increased 12 per cent from Pounds 81m to Pounds 90.8m, while trading profits rose from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 12.1m. Mr Minton said the figures masked a distinct improvement in margins during the second half of the year from 10.7 per cent to 15.9 per cent. The improvement was due to significant investment and rationalisation. The construction chemicals division reported operating profits up 69 per cent from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 17.9m on sales of Pounds 141.1m (Pounds 105.9m). Rockwood, a recent acquisition, generated Pounds 25.7m of the Pounds 35.2m increase in turnover. The hygiene and process chemicals division posted trading profits up 14 per cent from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 16.1m on sales of Pounds 96.3m (Pounds 89.3m). The metals and electronic chemicals division's turnover was up 3 per cent from Pounds 94.4m to Pounds 97.5m. Operating profits fell 7 per cent from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 14.2m. Capital expenditure, which the company described as heavy, was Pounds 74m. Earnings per share fell 2 per cent from 40p to 39.2p. The board proposed a final dividend of 12.5p, making a total for the year of 19.5p (18.9p), a rise of 3 per cent.</p>

The Plan is a defined contribution 401(k) plan which provides for individual participant accounts (the Accounts) and participant-directed investment of the Accounts. The Plan is sponsored by American Express Company (the Employer), a New York public corporation engaged in diversified travel and financial services. The trustee of the Plan is the IDS Trust Company (the Trustee), a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDS Financial Corporation, which is wholly owned by the Employer. The Accounts are invested at the directions of individual Plan participants among nine investment funds, one of which is the ISP Income Fund (the Income Fund), which invests in, among other things, guaranteed investment contracts issued by insurance companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Among the assets in the Income Fund are two guaranteed investment contracts (the GICs) issued by Confederation Life Insurance Company (Confederation), a Canadian corporation doing business in the United States through branches in Michigan and Georgia. Contract  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 62516 was issued to the Plan by Confederation effective June 28, 1991, upon an initial principal deposit of $10 million, and it provides for simple annual interest at the rate of 8.72 percent, with a maturity date of June 27, 1996. Contract  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 62764 was issued effective June 1, 1993 upon an initial principal deposit of $5 million and it provides for simple annual interest at the rate of 6.06 percent, with a maturity date of June 30, 1998. Both GICs are single-deposit non-participating contracts which allow the Plan to make benefit-responsive withdrawals (the Withdrawals) to fund benefit payments, investment fund transfers, hardship withdrawals and participant loans (collectively, the Withdrawal Events). The terms of the GICs provide that interest at the interest rates guaranteed by each GIC (the Contract Rates) will be credited to the Plan daily, and if the amount of interest earned exceeds the amount of Withdrawals, the difference will be paid annually (the Interest Payments) on the anniversary of a date specified by each GIC for such Interest Payments. Conversely, if the amount of Withdrawals exceeds the amount of interest earned during the year, no anniversary Interest Payment is made. Upon each GIC's maturity date, Confederation is obligated to make a final cash payment to the Plan (the Maturity Payment) in the amount of the GIC's principal plus interest at the Contract Rate, less previous Withdrawals (the Maturity Value).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Employer represents that on August 11, 1994, the Canadian insurance regulatory authorities placed Confederation into a liquidation and winding-up process, and on August 12, 1994, the insurance authorities of the State of Michigan commenced legal action to place the U.S. operations of Confederation into a rehabilitation proceeding. As a result of these actions, the Withdrawals and Interest Payments with respect to the GICs have been suspended. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Employer represents that it cannot be determined accurately whether, to what extent, or at what time the Withdrawals and Interest Payments will be resumed. The Employer desires to alleviate the Plan's participants of the risks associated with continued investment in the GICs, to prevent any losses of the Income Fund's investments in the GIC, and to provide the Plan with the cash which otherwise would have been provided by the Withdrawals and Interest Payments. Accordingly, the Employer proposes to make the Loans to the Plan from time to time in the amounts due the Plan under the GICs as Withdrawals and Interest Payments. Upon the stated maturity date of each GIC, the Employer intends either (1) to purchase each GIC from the Plan (the Sale), or, alternatively, (2) to make a Loan to the Plan in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value, depending upon the circumstances prevailing at such time. The Employer is requesting an exemption to permit these transactions under the terms and conditions described herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GICs are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this proposed exemption, the Department is not proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GICs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Loans and their repayment, and any potential sale of the GICs to the Employer will be made pursuant to a written agreement (the Agreement) between the Trustee and the Employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Loans: Under the Agreement, the Employer agrees to make the Loans over the remaining terms of the GICs at such times and in such amounts as required to enable the Income Fund to fully fund the Withdrawal Events and to fully realize the Interest Payments, in lieu of the same amounts which otherwise would be paid to the Plan by Confederation as Withdrawals and Interest Payments. Accordingly, the amount of each Loan will be determined on the basis of the GIC's principal plus interest at the Contract Rate, less previous Withdrawals, as of the date of the Loan. Each Loan will also be reduced by any amounts actually received by the Plan, with respect to the particular Withdrawal Event or Interest Payment due, from Confederation or any other party making payment with respect to Confederation's obligations under the GICs. In addition to the Loans in lieu of Withdrawals and Interest Payments, the Agreement authorizes the Employer, as an alternative to purchasing the GICs (as described below in section 4) to make a final Loan with respect to each GIC upon the GIC's Maturity Date in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value. Any final Loan upon the maturity of each GIC will be made within thirty days of the Maturity Date in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value plus post-maturity interest as described in section 4 below. The Employer will receive no interest or fees for any of the Loans, and the Plan will incur no expenses related to the Loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Repayments: The Agreement provides that the repayments of the Loans (the Repayments) with respect to each GIC are restricted to the cash amounts, if any, which the Plan receives with respect to the GIC from Confederation, any state insurance guaranty funds, any successor to Confederation, or any other third party making payments with respect to Confederation's obligations under the GICs (collectively, the GIC Proceeds). The GIC Proceeds available to make the Repayments also include, in the event of any purchase of either GIC, as described below, the purchase price of the GIC (the Purchase Price). In this regard, in the event of any such sale of a GIC, Repayments of Loans with respect to that GIC will be accomplished by crediting the total amount of outstanding Loans against the Purchase Price. In any event, to the extent the Loans exceed total GIC Proceeds, the Repayments will be waived.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

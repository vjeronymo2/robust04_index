			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Gold The rise in gold during the second quarter of the year had a stagey - if not stage-managed - feel about it. Clearly the central character was Sir James Goldsmith, who successfully cut his involvement in Newmont Mining back to 5 per cent, helped by the fact that gold has floated up towards Dollars 400 an ounce. His other interests in bullion or gold options are, naturally enough, now a lot more difficult to fathom. While he has publicised his gold-buying sprees, there has been a notable silence over any profits which might have been taken. The opacity of Goldsmith's trading activities is just one reason why speculators are wary of jumping in at this level. Hedge funds and bullion unit trusts which have been buying as they have moved up the performance tables would quickly turn sellers if the price starts to slide. There are also persistent rumours that central banks are writing options against bullion holdings at about Dollars 400, which would certainly slow any rise. Yet the run is not entirely speculative. Fabrication and other end uses for gold will consume more than total mined output this year. The oddest element of the recent rise is that it has happened against a background of strong deflationary forces worldwide. Either the Jeremiahs of economic doom sense something distantly over the horizon, or this is the start of a classic speculative fit. The latter seems more likely, but the difficulty then is calling the turn. There may well be a pull back, but bullion does not yet feel to have run its course.</p>

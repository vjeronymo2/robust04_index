			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALLER RESERVES CALL-UP NOW LIKELY  </P> <P> Far fewer U.S. military reserves are likely to be called to active duty to  support the Persian Gulf buildup than the nearly 50,000 that have been  authorized, Pentagon sources said Monday.  </P> <P> In its latest public accounting of reserve call-ups, the Pentagon said Thursday  that 21,653 members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard reserve forces  have been placed on active duty since President Bush authorized use of the  reserves Aug. 22.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told a House committee last week that he expects  nearly 50,000 reserves to be on active duty by Sept. 30, but a military source  said Monday that the total is unlikely to exceed 40,000 and that it will take  several more weeks to reach even that total. The source spoke on condition he  not be identified.  </P></p>

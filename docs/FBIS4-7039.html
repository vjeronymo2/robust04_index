			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Papers Observe 62nd Birthday of KPA" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Papers today dedicate  editorials to the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the heroic  Korean People's Army [KPA].    NODONG SINMUN in an editorial titled "Invincible Is the  Korean People's Army Advancing Under the Party's Leadership"  says:    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded the Korean  People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) on April 25, 1932, 62 years  ago. It was a historic event which gave birth to the  revolutionary Armed Forces of the Workers' Party of Korea, true  revolutionary Armed Forces of chuche type. The founding of the  KPRA meant the brilliant realisation of the ages-long desire of  the Korean people to have their own strong army and the  beginning of the proud history of the heroic Korean People's  Army (KPA).    Our revolutionary Armed Forces which were founded and have  covered a glorious course of victory under the guidance of the  respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song are now on a new, higher  stage of development with general Kim Chong-il, a great  iron-willed brilliant commander, as their supreme commander.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said:    "Comrade Kim Chong-il has an indomitable will and grit,  outstanding wisdom and commanding art as befits the supreme  commander of the revolutionary Armed Forces. This guarantees a  constant strengthening and development of our revolutionary  Armed Forces and their invincibility."    The immortal exploits performed by our Supreme Commander  General Kim Chong-il in the cause of building our revolutionary  Armed Forces are, first of all, that he propounded the most  correct and unique military idea and theory, clearly indicating  the road ahead of our People's Army.    His military idea and theory cover all theoretical and  practical matters arising in the building of revolutionary Armed  Forces in our time, ranging from the mission of the Army of the  working class to the principle and way of Army building and the  unreserved demonstration of the Armed Forces. With this  chuche-oriented military idea and theory, our revolutionary  Armed Forces will firmly maintain their revolutionary character  as the Army of the leader, the party and the people and reliably  defend our cause of socialism without the slightest vacillation  under whatever conditions.    His exploits are also that he strengthened our revolutionary  Armed Forces with his outstanding and tested leadership into a  matchless Army firmly prepared politically and ideologically and  in military technique.    The entire officers and men of the People's Army are  upholding the leadership of the respected comrade supreme  commander and performing heroic feats and working miracles in  military service with the revolutionary will to defend him with  their lives as rifles and bombs.    Our People's Army is displaying its proud looks as  invincible  revolutionary Armed Forces with powerful means of attack and  defence and unique tactics of chuche.    His exploits are also that he consolidated the ideological  unity between the Army and the people through a thorough  application of the idea of Army-people unity.    The officers and men of our People's Army always love the  people and devote everything for their interests. Our people  actively support and encourage the People's Army both materially  and morally.    Thanks to the singlehearted unity of the Army and the people  around the respected comrade supreme commander, we can defeat  any formidable enemy.    The leadership of comrade supreme commander is the life and  soul of the People's Army and a decisive factor for victory in  army building and military activities.    The entire people and the KPA officers and men must uphold  the leadership of the respected supreme commander General Kim  Chong-il with loyalty and filial piety with the conviction that  they will certainly win because he is leading them, and defend  the party and the leader with their lives in singlehearted unity.    An editorial of MINJU CHOSON stresses that the KPA and the  Korean people will as ever demonstrate its ever-victorious might  under the leadership of the great General Kim Chong-il.</p>

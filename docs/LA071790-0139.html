			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> USERS OVERWHELM TOXIC WASTE CENTER  </P> <P> A new drop-off site for household hazardous materials -- the first of its kind  in the county -- has attracted so many people since opening on July 5 that it  has had to close early and turn residents away.  </P> <P> County officials, ready to open the site again this morning, are asking  residents not to storm the place and to observe state law that allows  individuals to carry a maximum of five gallons or 50 pounds of toxics at a  time.  </P> <P> "People have been holding materials for so long they're bringing truckloads,"  said Jaimy Gentry, assistant coordinator for the Orange County Fire  Department's Household Hazardous Materials Collection Project. "But they've had  it in their garage for 10 years -- two more weeks isn't going to hurt."  </P> <P> Hours of the center are 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. today through Thursday and 9 a.m. to 3  p.m. Saturday. But the doors have been closed at least one hour early every day  since the site opened.  </P> <P> More than 100 cars daily have passed through the center, delivering household  toxics such as paint, insecticides and motor oil. Most people were carrying  more than the limit, causing a number of cars to be turned away.  </P> <P> Gentry noted that on Saturday lines were especially long -- some residents  waiting up to an hour -- and encouraged people to wait until the rush dies down  to bring in their toxic trash.  </P> <P> Until the center opened, county residents had no permanent site for legally  disposing of household toxics.  </P> <P> The county, which funds the Anaheim operation, plans to set up five other  permanent sites by the end of the year, in Huntington Beach, Stanton, San Juan  Capistrano, Brea and Irvine.  </P> <P> The Anaheim center, at 2761 E. White Star Ave., accepts only household toxics.  The waste is trucked out of the county to be either recycled, treated or taken  to landfills. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

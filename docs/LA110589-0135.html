			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS LEARN THE THREE RS: RESTRAINT,  RESPONSIBILITY AND RESPECT.  </P> <P> Anti-drug crusader Montel Williams joked and laughed with 550 San Pedro  students last week -- and gave them a new set of the three Rs while imploring  them to stay away from drugs.  </P> <P> In addition to reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic, Williams told the ninth-graders  at Dodson Junior High School to learn restraint, responsibility and respect.  </P> <P> "You better learn respect right now for yourself," Williams exhorted the  students. "If you start respecting yourself -- guess what -- maybe other people  will respect you."  </P> <P> Williams, who came to the school under the sponsorship of Pepsi-Cola to spread  an anti-drug, improve-yourself message, immediately grabbed the students'  attention when he walked down the center aisle, and he never let their  attention stray.  </P> <P> Dressed in black, his head shaved, Williams used sarcasm and street talk from a  persuasive bag of speaking tricks. He pranced all around the auditorium. He  mugged, pleaded and screamed.  </P> <P> Williams told the boys they were not men just because "God gifted you with the  equipment to make a baby," and he urged the girls to have self-esteem: Don't be  fooled into spending time with a man "for a piece of plastic, a meal and a  ride."  </P> <P> Williams, 33, also told the students not to become high school dropouts.  </P> <P> Without an education, he said, their job future would be bleak. "Hi, welcome to  McDonald's," Williams mimicked. "Can I take your order?"  </P> <P> Pepsi-Cola Co. Los Angeles paid $3,000 for Williams' 90-minute visit. The money  will go to his Denver-based nonprofit organization called Reach the American  Dream, which he founded in 1988 to motivate youngsters to stay in school and  avoid drugs. Williams, who said he receives 12% of the honorariums for his  appearances, has talked to an estimated 1.5 million students across the country  since January, 1988.  </P> <P> In an interview, Williams said he used drugs "at a time when everyone was doing  drugs" but realized their danger when he saw what 11 years of heroin did to his  cousin.  </P> <P> Williams, a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve, was invited to speak at Dodson by  Ralph Mays, coordinator of the Long Beach Naval Station's Personal Excellence  Program. It adopted Dodson in 1988 as part of a nationwide outreach effort,  which involves the Navy with local community and youth organizations and  emphasizes academics, health and fitness.  </P> <P> In his presentation, Williams frequently shouted, "Mountain, get out of my  way," a reference to the biblical declaration that faith can move mountains.  </P> <P> "What that means to me," Williams told the students, "is it doesn't matter if  you think you have some little obstacle. . . . If that obstacle seems to be as  big as a mountaintop, all you have to do is" move it with education and  knowledge.  </P> <P> "To prove to you all that education and knowledge pay . . . who can tell me  what event got this country into World War II and what event ended the war?"  </P> <P> "The bombing of Pearl Harbor," answered Oscar Short. "The bombing of Japan,"  answered Randy Coryell.  </P> <P> Their rewards? A $10 bill each.  </P> <P> "They got $1 per second for just what they know," Williams told their  classmates.  </P> <P> Williams also staged a skit to illustrate the seriousness of the nation's drug  problem.  </P> <P> Four Dodson ninth-graders -- Christina Wade, Ginger Anderson, William Fell and  Glenn Angeles, pretended to buy $55.15 worth of drugs from a drug dealer named  Dr. Feelgood, played by Williams.  </P> <P> "I got something for your $55 that I keep in my pocket," Williams suddenly  declared as he fired a cap gun, pretending to kill the youngsters.  </P> <P> The gunfire seemed to startle the audience.  </P> <P> "I didn't do this because I wanted you guys to get a big kick out of this pop  gun," Williams admonished the crowd. "This is happening all over L.A. . . . It  isn't so funny, and it won't be so funny when you wind up like this."  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles Unified School District, 27% of 760 expulsions last year  were drug-related, said Ruth Rich, health education specialist for the  district.  </P> <P> Rich said the district received $2.5 million last year to fund its anti-drug  programs, including DARE, in elementary schools and Project Impact for older  students.  </P> <P> Williams' presentation had some effect.  </P> <P> "I learned the three Rs: restraint, responsibility and respect," Jason (Spud)  Kayen said in an interview.  </P> <P> Marc Zamudio added: "I learned to say no to drugs."

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Observer: Servicing Liam Strong, chief executive of Sears, tells a story illustrating the business of building customer loyalty. A friend of his wanted to buy a car and looked at Toyota's Lexus. But he bought a BMW. The Lexus sales manager called by and asked how the BMW was. 'Fine,' said the friend, 'except for the oddest thing; it came without an ash-tray and I'm having the devil of a job finding one.' Two days later a Lexus rep delivered a BMW ash-tray to the friend's house, with a compliments slip from the sales manager.</p>

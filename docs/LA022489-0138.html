			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> TIMES TO PAY $5,000 FINE AFTER ACCIDENTAL SPILL  </P> <P> Without admitting guilt, The Times Orange County Edition has agreed to pay a  $5,000 fine in connection with an Oct. 27, 1988, chemical spill at the  newspaper's Costa Mesa plant, a company spokeswoman said Thursday.  </P> <P> "There was a chemical spill, a discharge of chromium, that was contained in the  water in the computer room cooling system in Orange County," said Laura Morgan,  Times spokeswoman. "We began a cleanup procedure and contacted the fire  department."  </P> <P> The chromium was accidentally discharged with 300 gallons of waste water at the  Times, 1375 Sunflower Ave., into a storm drain that flowed into the  Greenville-Banning Flood Control Channel, Times attorney Rhonda Heth said.  </P> <P> The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Santa Ana Region, filed a  complaint against The Times seeking a fine of $5,000 and alleging that a report  had not been filed prior to the spill, Heth said. Companies that plan to  discharge waste are required to file a report before they do so. But in this  case, The Times said, the discharge was accidental.  </P> <P> The Times has reached a tentative agreement with the water quality agency in  which the newspaper will pay $5,000 and the Regional Water Quality Control  Board will drop the term negligent from the complaint, Morgan said.  </P> <P> "By agreeing to pay the $5,000, we are not acknowledging wrongdoing or  violation of the law," Morgan said. "We are merely trying to resolve this in  the most expeditious way possible."  </P> <P> Heth said the Regional Water Quality Control Board is expected to approve the  agreement at its March 10 regular meeting.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Regional Water Quality Control Board could not be reached  for comment Thursday.  </P></p>

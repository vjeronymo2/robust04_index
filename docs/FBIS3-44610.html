Currently, China's notary service covers economic, civil and  business affairs, and helps prevent disputes and stabilize  social, civil and commercial relations.    Deputy Justice Minister Zhang Geng told CHINA DAILY in an  interview that the planned measures include enlarging the  service scope and speeding up reforms in notary management.    He added that his ministry has finished a draft Notarization  Law and is expected to submit it to the country's legislature  for examination this year.    He said these measures were mapped out to keep pace with the  growing role of notarial services in China.    Since 1980, when notary work started up again, the number of  notary institutions has increased from 1,150 to the current  3,049. More than 16,170 notary public are providing notarization  for common items, such as contracts, establishment of  corporations, birth dates, marriage status, education,  inheritance rights and wills.    Both Chinese and foreigners can use the service by paying a  service fee. Foreigners pay a higher fee.    Adjustment of the service fees charged to foreigners are  still to be decided in line with the newly-adopted single  floating exchange rate.    Last year these institutions handled more than 9 million  cases of notarization, among which 800,000 were concerned with  real estate and 600,000 with bank loans.    Every year, 98 percent of the notary items show legal  effect.    But, he added, foreigners still are not allowed to conduct  notary service in China, even though branch law offices have  been set by foreigners in the country.    According to the deputy minister, to strengthen the legal  status of notary work, the State is to require important  economic, civil and commercial activities to undergo  notarization.    In helping establish the modern enterprise system in China,  important notary work must be done involving the charters and  establishment of corporations transfer of property rights, the  auction and leasing of enterprises and the qualification of  representatives of legal persons.    Notary service will be provided in the transfer of bills,  the  development of real estate, the transfer and mortgage of loans  and also foreign-oriented economic activities, he added.    Zhang also emphasized the need to speed up reforms in  managing notary institutions.    All of these institutions will be gradually changed from  administrative organs to self-funded institutions without  governmental interference.    And to meet international norms, notary institutions will be  upgraded to "notary offices," he concluded.</p>

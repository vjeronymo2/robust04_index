			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Bush spells out vision of 'new world order' PRESIDENT George Bush at the weekend defended his administration against criticism of failing to support Kurdish rebels and sought to refocus public attention on his vision of a world united against aggression and injustice. In the first of four speeches to define the 'new world order' at Maxwell Air Force base War College, he promised to provide 'food, shelter and safety' to Iraqi refugees and condemned Iraq's President Saddam Hussein for a 'savagery' which would make Iraq 'a pariah nation'. Internal conflicts have raged in Iraq for years, he said. 'I do not want one single soldier or airman shoved into a civil war in Iraq.' This speech followed days of Democratic criticism during which the administration has appeared inept and confused about its post-war policy. The New Republic magazine, in an editorial entitled Desert Shame, said: 'Can it really be that the big global order Americans went to war for is designed to protect only the kingdoms of emirs, regardless of the consequences to millions of people?' Meanwhile, the television reports which once generated enthusiasm for the war have been focusing on the ordeal of the refugees. The president's stunning popularity, although still high, has begun to ebb. Mr Bush cast the war as the 'first real test' of the new world order. Its four tenets would be: peaceful settlement of disputes, solidarity against aggression, reduced and controlled arsenals, and just treatment of all people. He noted that the Warsaw Pact had disbanded earlier this month but that Americans would remain in Europe in support of Nato. 'America's commitment is the best guarantee of a secure Europe, and a secure Europe is vital to American interests and vital to world peace.' He said reforms must continue in the Soviet Union if it is to share in 'the new opportunities.' He will meet leaders of Soviet republics and 'all elements active in Soviet political life' as well as the central government in Moscow.</p>

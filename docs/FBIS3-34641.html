The sources noted that the Palestinian side demands that  this  force be made up of 9,000 troops, while the Israeli side demands  that it consist of 6,000 troops, including the civil defense  force as well as the intelligence and public security services.    The sources added that the Civilian Affairs Committee, which  is led by Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi on the Palestinian side, and  by Gadi Zohar, head of the West Bank's Civil Administration, on  the Israeli side, will resume its discussions concerning the  transfer of powers to the Palestinians in the fields of water,  civil planning, antiquities, electricity, communications, and  land registration.    The Palestinian sources said that the Confidence-Building  Committee, which stemmed from the Taba negotiations, will  discuss the amnesty plan, which will include the release of all  the Palestinian detainees in Israel at a date not later than  July. The sources said that the number of Palestinian detainees  is 9,000, following the Israeli authorities' recent freeing of  some 2,000 Palestinian detainees.

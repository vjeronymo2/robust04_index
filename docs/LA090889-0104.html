			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOTTOM LINE;  </P> <P> NO REST FOR WEARY WHEN IT'S SHOWTIME  </P> <P> Here was Boris Becker's schedule in the U.S Open this week:  </P> <P> 1. Play a fourth-round match Sunday.  </P> <P> 2. Take two days days off.  </P> <P> 3. Play a quarterfinal match Wednesday.  </P> <P> 4. Take two days off.  </P> <P> 5. Play a semifinal match Saturday.  </P> <P> 6. Play the final Sunday, assuming he wins in the semifinals.  </P> <P> If you noticed a lack of days off between No. 5 and No. 6, so did he.  </P> <P> "To be honest, I think it's a joke," Becker said. "It's obviously for TV  reasons, you know, for the bottom line -- money. They don't really care too  much for the players."  </P> <P> CBS has owned the television rights to the U.S. Open for 22 years and believes  it is good programming to show both the men's semifinals and the women's final  Saturday.  </P> <P> The three other Grand Slam events -- the Australian Open, the French Open and  Wimbledon -- have the women's semifinals on Thursday, the men's semifinals on  Friday, the women's final on Saturday and the men's final on Sunday.  </P> <P> Becker said: "People should think about it a little bit. We are here to play  great tennis and not for the money."  </P> <P> The champion wins $300,000. THOMAS BONK  </P></p>

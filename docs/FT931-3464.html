			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Mr Major's talking head When Mr Norman Lamont rises to de-liver the Budget this afternoon, watch Mr John Major. You should be attentive to what will be one of the remarkable phenomena of the week. Observe: words will come out of the chancellor's mouth, but you will not see the prime minister's lips move. Mr Lamont's jaw will waggle up and down, but there will be no indication that Mr Major's hand is up the back of his jacket. You may be forgiven for thinking that your eyes are deceiving you. The Budget will be read out as if by Charlie McCarthy, America's most famous wooden effigy; the ventriloquist will be Mr Edgar Bergen, aka John Major. Some chancellors - Lord Lawson springs to mind - never sat on their prime ministers' knees, although even in the latter's case there was always something he wanted in the Budget that Lady Thatcher didn't, and vice-versa. Some rely for their jobs, their reputations, their very political existence, on the whims of their immediate boss. In the present instance the dependence is two-way: Edgar Bergen desperately needs Charlie McCarthy to perform well; Charlie cannot perform without him. Old hands will protest that 'it was ever thus'. Chancellors meet prime ministers once a week or so for 'bilaterals'. It is always important that the prime minister of the day concurs with the strategy for managing the economy put to her or him by the chancellor. It is therefore unfair to Mr Lamont to argue that he is mouthing Mr Major's policies. Possibly. The truth is that there is something more important at stake this afternoon than whether this particular chancellor remains in office until this summer, next summer, or the one thereafter. Today's Budget is regarded by Downing Street as a part of the slow and necessarily painful process of putting Britain's administration back together again. It is intended to help reconstruct the authority that was shattered on Black Wednesday. For Mr Major and his chancellor have yet to rebuild the nation's confidence in their ability to do the jobs they are paid to do. If their remuneration was performance-related, and assessed according to public esteem, they would be living on social security. The pair of them are in the same boat, up the same creek, searching for the same paddle. If, as many believe, the chancellor irretrievably lost his honour when he failed to resign on that fateful Wednesday, what of the prime minister? Both had defended Bri-tain's position in the exchange rate mechanism with equal fervour, Mr Major because he believed in it, Mr Lamont because he had to. Both had spoken of the irresponsibility of abandoning the fixed exchange rate, right up to the moment that sterling was ejected from the mechanism. Some of their ministerial colleagues believe that the chancellor should have offered himself as a sacrifice, thus deflecting criticism from Mr Major. We do not live in such heroic times. The prime minister does of course have the authority to replace Mr Lamont, but he remains to be convinced that it would be politically profitable for him to do so. It is probable that the success or failure of the chancellor's current energetic efforts to win a sympathetic hearing will weigh at least as heavily for or against him as the actual contents of today's Budget. The prime minister can influence or control the fiscal stance. He can pull the strings on that. Image is another matter. Only the chancellor can turn himself into an effective persuader. It is becoming fashionable for politicians to recognise that that is what they need to do. President Clinton, learning the lesson taught with such brilliance by President Reagan, is showing that he understands that direct communication with the electorate, always a necessary part of democratic government, is indispensable in the age of television. Mr Douglas Hurd, one of the British government's few skilled practitioners of electronic persuasion, spoke last Friday about a growing ten-sion between 'achievers and critics'. The burden of the foreign secretary's remarks was that the critics, especially when they 'hunt as a pack', create 'stereotypes which can lead us astray from reality'. Mr Hurd is right. Britain's media gather as baying hounds upon this prey or that, nearly always collectively. The foreign secretary's remarks also suggest that doers are of greater importance than those who merely carp. As a former doer, but now one of the latter breed, I bow my head in acknowledgement - adding only that when achievers make a mess of things, we critics get inordinate enjoyment out of feeding on their flesh. That is what has happened to the government. Its more sanguine ministers believe - hope - that the pack will start baying a different tune when economic recovery is seen to be under way. The little matter of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty must also be over and done with. As to that, the government's chief whip, Mr Richard Ryder, accepts that he cannot cobble together a majority unless Labour abstains. Procedural motions, and amendments for which Labour proposes to vote in favour, will be lost. But Labour needs to abstain on the big issues, in order to maintain its own unity. You will see from this summary of its position to date that the government has positioned itself on a ladder of achievement, upon which it aims to climb away from the critics' jaws. The first step was last autumn's public spending statement. The second is this afternoon's Budget, the third the passage of the Maastricht bill. Economic recovery is the final leap. It will not be so easy as that sounds. The autumn spending controls were relatively painless; it is the current search for long-term cuts that is truly difficult. The economic recovery will have to run long and strong before the fear of unemployment is eliminated from Conservative voters' minds. The Maastricht bill remains a gamble. Tomorrow's verdict on the Budget, almost certainly favourable, will be premature. As the late Iain MacLeod used to say, you should not judge a Budget until the finance bill is published. That is about a month away. Meanwhile, to save himself, and his mentor, Charlie McCarthy will have to keep talking, swivelling his head round to whoever will catch his eye.</p>

The branch will be promoted from a representative office,  set  up in August 1992, under the Korea-China financial agreement  that was concluded last year. The Korea Exchange Bank already  opened a branch in Tianjin in late December.    Capitalized at 12 billion won (about 15 million U.S.  dollars), the bank of China's Seoul branch is expected to focus  its banking services on companies dealing with China.    It will also provide counseling services to businesses  planning to invest in China.    Capitalized at 5.2 billion dollars, the Bank of China has  6,183 branches in China and 448 overseas.    Two other Chinese banks -- the Industrial and Commercial  Bank  of China and the People's Construction Bank of China -- now  maintain a representative office each in Seoul.</p>

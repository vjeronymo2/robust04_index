			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: Full text of statement to the Stock Exchange The following is the text of the statement by Wace Group made to the Stock Exchange yesterday: 'The directors of Wace announce that John Clegg today tendered his resignation as managing director of the company. This has been accepted with great regret by the board, who acknowledge the outstanding contribution made by Mr Clegg to the growth of the group over the past eight years. 'Notwithstanding the announcement made by Wace on 27 January following press speculation over the weekend, rumours have continued and Mr Clegg has decided that the interests of Wace would be best served by his resignation from the board. The directors wish to reiterate that they are not aware that the company, its investors or its directors (including Mr Clegg) have ever had any links of any sort with the IRA or any other terrorist organisation. Nor are they aware of any suggestion of any impropriety in the way in which the group is managed, or in the constitution of Wace's shareholding list. 'The directors' objective remains to maximise the group's potential to the benefit of Wace, its shareholders, customers and employees. 'A strong new management structure has recently been put in place for Wace UK, Wace Europe and Wace USA, which is well equipped to take full advantage of the opportunities open to Wace. In the short term, Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman of Wace, will assume Mr Clegg's executive responsibilities.'</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - The Chancellor's Speech: Strategy aims for sustainable long-term growth Delivering the Autumn Economic Statement yesterday, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said: 'With permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make my Autumn Statement. As usual, the main public expenditure figures and the full text of the Industry Act Forecast will be available from the Vote Office as soon as I sit down. The printed Autumn Statement will be published next Wednesday, after which there will be a full debate in this House. Economic background Madam Speaker, following the announcement I made in my Budget, next year the Autumn Statement will be brought together with our proposals for taxation in one annual Budget statement. This is a long overdue reform. For one final year, however, I shall bow to tradition and leave my Budget proposals until the spring. But this Autumn Statement will also be the first occasion on which the Treasury's economic forecast will be presented alongside others. Two weeks ago, I announced my intention to establish a new panel of independent forecasters. That will be in operation for next year's Budget. But in the meantime, the forecast I am publishing today will include some details of how the government's own economic forecast compares with the view that other organisations have taken. I am sure this change will be widely welcomed. Madam Speaker, this year's Autumn Statement has been drawn up against a background of continuing recession at home and renewed weakness abroad. Despite exceptionally low interest rates, confidence in the United States remains depressed. Industrial production has fallen sharply in Japan. And the countries of continental Europe face the prospect of continuing high interest rates and a marked slowdown in Germany. It is not surprising, therefore, that here in Britain, the recovery that nearly all forecasters expected at the time of the Budget has still not become established. There has been an encouraging increase in retail sales. But the housing market remains depressed and confidence has taken a severe blow from the turmoil in the foreign exchange markets that led to sterling's suspension from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Economic strategy Madam Speaker, against this difficult background, a strategy that brings renewed confidence and a return to growth is more essential than ever. But the government has no intention of engineering a short-lived boom that would lead swiftly to higher inflation and higher interest rates. Our objective is sustainable, long-term growth. And our strategy to achieve that is based on three principles. First, with the pound floating, a completely new framework is required for monetary policy. Interest rates are now set according to British monetary conditions  -to meet the target I have established for inflation. Underlying inflation will be kept within the range of 1-4 per cent and our aim is to get it down to the lower half of that range by the end of this parliament. Low inflation is the key to sustainable growth and a lasting reduction in unemployment. I have set out clearly the indicators that will guide my assessment of how far we are on track to meet our inflation objectives. The exchange rate, asset prices and the growth of M0 are all taken into account. And today, I can announce the monitoring range I intend to use for the broad measure of money, M4. For the second half of this financial year that range will be 4-8 per cent. Madam Speaker, as I have explained to the House before, in the last few months of our ERM membership, monetary policy was tighter than was needed to deliver our inflation objective. It is crucial that monetary policy should not be so lax that the private sector faces higher inflation. But, nor should it be so tight that money demand is inadequate. Outside the ERM, I have been able to rebalance policy by cutting two percentage points off interest rates. This, in itself, will provide a significant boost to the economy, without re-igniting inflation. Despite the fall in the exchange rate, I expect underlying inflation to be below 4 per cent by the end of next year. And in common with most economic forecasters, I expect GDP to rise next year, by about 1 per cent, following a fall of a similar magnitude in 1992. My second principle is that there must be an appropriate balance between fiscal and monetary policy. Above all, public spending must be kept under firm control. The government therefore put in place last July a clear medium-term strategy for the control of public spending, designed to ensure that public expenditure declines as a share of GDP over time. The new system is based on a top-down approach. Clear and affordable limits are set for the total level of public expenditure and the government can then settle its priorities through a process of collective discussion - involving first a new cabinet committee, and then the full cabinet itself. And the third key principle of the government's strategy is that the best way to increase the long run growth rate in the economy is to make markets work better. So we will be pressing ahead with our policies on privatisation, deregulation, cutting out waste and keeping the tax burden on companies and individuals as low as we can. We must also fight for the interests of British business in world markets and provide them with the best environment in which they can compete and succeed. And in the short-term, that means securing a successful outcome to the Gatt round. Madam Speaker, low inflation, tight control of public spending, open markets, competition, and a vigorous supply side policy - these are the principles of the government's strategy and they provide the right framework for economic growth. I do not believe that governments can spend their way out of recession. It is individuals and companies in the private sector that are the engine of economic growth. But, that does not mean that once the right economic framework is in place, the government's task is complete. The government too is investing for the future, in the nation's infrastructure and the development of human capital. And, as I said in my Mansion House speech, the government has also been looking at specific policies to ease the path to recovery. I shall be announcing later in my Statement, a series of measures to rebuild confidence, to help industry and strengthen the economy. Taking account of these measures, I expect the PSBR in the current year to rise to around Pounds 37bn. Of course that is high, but borrowing is bound to rise in a recession; and it would be damaging to seek to prevent it from doing so. As the economy recovers it is absolutely vital that borrowing is brought back towards balance. We have made an excellent start today with a tight overall settlement for public spending. National Insurance contributions Much of the recent increase in the PSBR reflects the rapid growth in expenditure on social security benefits, and this has also damaged the financial position of the National Insurance Fund. In normal circumstances, it would have been necessary to raise National Insurance contributions, to reduce that shortfall. But, given the current weakness of the economy, I do not believe this would have been appropriate. Accordingly, while the upper and lower earnings limits and the thresholds of the bands for the employers' contribution will be indexed as usual, the rates for National Insurance contributions will remain unchanged. And I have agreed with the Secretary of State for Social Security that the fund should receive a Treasury grant to make up the shortfall. Public spending Madam Speaker, let me now turn to the government's public spending plans. In this Survey, the priority was clear. It was vital to put the needs of the economy first. So within a tight overall settlement, we have sought, wherever possible, to protect programmes, especially capital programmes, that will promote recovery and Britain's longer term prospects. At current levels of borrowing, the amount we have to pay in debt interest is rising rapidly, diverting billions of pounds a year away from spending on services. Against that background, the cabinet decided in July to set a remit for the public spending round which would keep expenditure under firm control. That remit had two elements. For next year, we set ourselves the objective of sticking to existing cash plans. And, for the three survey years as a whole, our aim was to hold the growth of the New Control Total down to 1 1/2 per cent or less, to keep the overall growth in public spending to a rate below that of the economy as a whole. Although our target for next year of Pounds 244.5bn allowed a real increase of 4 1/2 per cent, the pressures for more spending have been intense. And we have had to consider carefully whether the original targets were achievable. But I can now announce to the House that we have indeed hit our target. The planning total for next year will be Pounds 244.5bn. As a result of certain definitional changes I should warn the House that the number which actually appears in the printed document will be slightly different. It will, in fact, be Pounds 2bn lower. I can also announce that the new totals for 1994-95 and 1995-96 are fully consistent with the remit agreed in July. Despite the pressures that have emerged since the summer, the real growth in the NCT over the next three years will average just under 1 1/2 per cent a year, half the rate of growth over the last three years. I am sure that Hon and Rt Hon Members on this side of the House will welcome the meeting of the remit; and let me at once pay tribute to my Rt Hon Friend the Chief Secretary for his skill, perseverance and hard work in making this possible. Madam Speaker, to meet our objectives we have had to look very carefully at every single programme and particularly at current spending. The biggest single budget is of course social security. Indexing the social security benefits in the coming year would cost Pounds 2 1/2 bn. And if we are to protect capital spending it is to areas of current spending such as social security that we must look first. But, I can now tell the House that despite the many claims on the available resources the government has been able to meet in full its commitment to index pensions and other benefits. The other major claim on current public spending is public sector pay. The earnings of public sector staff have risen on average by 20 per cent over the last two years - compared with just 13 per cent in the private sector. But if the gains in competitiveness from the recent fall in the exchange rate are not to be lost it is vital that all employers keep tight control over their paybills. The public sector cannot be sheltered from the difficulties faced by the private sector, where pay awards are now the lowest in a generation. I have therefore decided that in the coming year pay settlements in the public sector should be restricted to a maximum of 1 1/2 per cent. This is of course consistent with a lower growth in paybills. The aim must be to keep the growth in paybills in each area of the public sector as low as possible. The restriction will apply to the whole of the public sector and related bodies without exception, regardless of whether pay is negotiated, recommended by the Review Bodies or subject to formula calculations. It will apply to all offers made from today, though formal offers already made will be honoured. The government will in due course bring forward a resolution on MPs' pay, consistent with this policy. Ministers will receive no increase at all. Other programmes Given the overall objective of restraining the growth in public spending, this Survey has involved some difficult decisions. If some items are to be increased, it means that others must be cut back. Our tough decisions about public sector pay will lead to savings of Pounds 1.5bn a year. That will permit higher levels of service to the public and higher capital programmes. Nonetheless, in some programmes we have made reductions in the baselines set out last year. But in many cases, expenditure still remains on a rising trend. What is more, the progress we have made on inflation will help to ensure that reductions in baselines are consistent with continuing improvements in public services. Even so, individual programmes have faced searching scrutiny and hard choices have been made. Over the next few years, defence expenditure will continue to fall in real terms. The benefits of the Options for Change Review will be secured and some further savings, consistent with the policies which underlie it, will be made. The Legal Aid budget is a demand-led programme that has been putting immense pressure on the public finances. The Lord Chancellor is announcing changes to restrict its growth, and they are fully reflected in the Survey. And at a time when tight control over public expenditure is needed at the national level, the same discipline should be applied locally. Central government support for local authority revenue expenditure in England will therefore rise by 3.7 per cent next year, and total standard spending by 3.1 per cent. In addition, there will be a special grant of Pounds 539 million in England to help local authorities meet their new responsibilities for community care. This settlement should be fully adequate to meet local authorities' requirements. The proposals assume that local authorities implement in full our policy of pay restraint. Provided that they do this, the savings made will enable them to ensure proper provision of services without exerting upward pressure on the council tax. The government will not hesitate to use its capping powers as necessary. My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment will be making a full announcement later this month. Full details of the new plans for local authorities in Scotland and Wales and for other programmes are being made available separately. The population-related formulae which largely determine changes to expenditure provision more generally in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been updated. Expenditure plans for the territories will be announced by their respective Secretaries of State at a later date. Madam Speaker, at the time of the general election, the government made clear that education and health would be amongst its key priorities for the longer-term. Rising spending in these areas is fully justified, not just in terms of immediate needs, but as a contribution to the country's human capital. The education programme is therefore planned to rise to a level Pounds 1 1/2 bn higher in 1995-96 than the equivalent spending this year. There will be some important changes over this period. The proportion of children staying on at school beyond 16 is expected to go on rising. The government is providing for a higher proportion of school leavers to take up YT places. And we shall finance a sharp increase in the number of students attending further education or sixth form colleges - 25 per cent up over the Survey period. At the same time we have earmarked enough finance to maintain the present record level of participation of young people in higher education. All this is an important investment in our young people which will improve the quality of the country's human capital and benefit the economy in the longer term. There will also be increases in the level of real resources provided to the National Health Service in each of the next three years. Spending in the NHS will rise by nearly 3 per cent in real terms next year compared with this year's plans. That means an increase of over Pounds 1.9bn. Capital Madam Speaker, this is a very tight settlement overall. And at the beginning of the spending round, there was widespread speculation that the Government would take the easy way out, by letting current spending rise and cutting capital spending instead. But what we have done is take the tough, but necessary decisions to put the needs of the British economy first. Restraint on current expenditure has made it feasible to provide more protection to capital. And we have done so across a whole range of programmes: Next year there will be a significant increase in the volume of road building. We have maintained the national roads programme at a time when construction prices have fallen; Our new plans will ensure that in real terms, compared with 1979, we will have a doubling next year of the combined capital spending of British Rail and London Transport; Next year health capital spending in England alone will be at the record level of nearly Pounds 2.1bn; And the new plans should more than deliver our election commitment to provide through the Housing Corporation 153,000 homes over three years. One major project for which we have expressly reserved provision is the Jubilee Line extension. Subject to satisfactory completion of negotiations, the line will be able to go ahead. This will create many thousands of jobs and give an important boost to the construction industry. Private finance Madam Speaker, the government has taken seriously its pledge to do what it can for capital projects. But there is yet more that can be done. I said in my Mansion House speech that I was examining ways to increase the scope for private financing of capital projects. Obviously, we have to protect the taxpayer. But I also want to ensure that sensible investment decisions are taken whenever the opportunity arises. I am now able to announce three significant developments. In the past, the government has only been prepared to give the go-ahead to private projects after comparing them with a similar project in the public sector. This has applied whether or not there was any prospect of the project ever being carried out in the public sector. I have decided to scrap this rule. In future, any privately financed project which can be operated profitably will be allowed to proceed. This should be widely welcomed, particularly by the construction industry. Secondly, the government has too often in the past treated proposed projects as either wholly private or wholly public. In future, the government will actively encourage joint ventures with the private sector, where these involve a sensible transfer of risk to the private sector. We may be prepared to consider such an approach, when the time arises, for projects such as the East West Crossrail, the Central Scotland Fastlink, the Birmingham western orbital road and perhaps also the Channel tunnel rail link. Thirdly, we will allow greater use of leasing where it offers good value for money. As long as it can be shown that the risk stays with the private sector, public organisations will be able to enter into operating lease agreements, with only the leasing payments counting as expenditure and without their capital budgets being cut. In addition, British Rail will be allowed to lease some Pounds 150m of new rolling stock in the next three years. The new leases will be undertaken with a view to developing the leasing market for rolling stock which will facilitate privatisation. In addition, my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Transport will publish a Green Paper early next year on the scope for motorway charging. If, in the light of consultation, the government decided to proceed with charges for inter-urban roads, this would create significant new opportunities for private finance. And as a possible transitional step, private contractors might be invited to design, build and operate roads for which they would receive payments from government relating to the use of their roads. Money contributed by the private sector under these arrangements will not contribute towards public spending - it will represent additional resources in the area concerned. And these changes are only a beginning. I have asked my Hon Friend the Financial Secretary to carry forward and develop our policy in this area, encouraging the private sector to bring forward proposals, and to help us identify any obstacles which frustrate its success. Supplementary Package Madam Speaker, many of the measures I have announced so far today will take time to have their full effect. I therefore propose to introduce a supplementary package of time-limited fiscal measures. These will be aimed at sectors of the economy which have been hardest hit by the recession, helping to rebuild confidence and so foster recovery. Housing Housing and construction have faced particular difficulties in the last two years. But home-buyers now have some of the lowest mortgage rates since 1978. And the government has responded in a number of other ways, most recently with measures to help those with negative equity who wish to move. Today, I propose to go further. The overhang of empty properties in the owner-occupied sector is holding back activity in the housing market. I therefore propose to make available an extra Pounds 750m to be used before the end of this financial year to buy up some of these properties. I hope that the Housing Corporation will be able to achieve a substantial contribution on top of this from private sector lenders. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will introduce parallel measures. This measure should reduce the overhang of empty properties by over 20,000 over the next few months, so providing a helpful stimulus to activity. It will also increase the available stock of subsidised housing by a similar amount and make a real contribution towards housing families in need. Local Authority Capital Receipts Many Hon Members will be aware of the representations by many local authorities to persuade the government to relax the rules on local authority capital receipts. Many local authorities have accumulated a stock of these receipts, rather than use them to pay off debt as the government advised. That remains the government's view, and I do not intend to reward those who have ignored it. I propose instead to allow a time-limited relaxation of the rules governing local authorities' use of their future capital receipts. The existing rules allow them to spend only 25 per cent of housing receipts and 50 per cent of other receipts. With certain exceptions, local authorities will now be entitled to spend all the capital receipts they realise between tomorrow and the end of December 1993. This measure is expected to stimulate extra capital spending by local authorities, of over Pounds 1 3/4 bn in the next three and a half years. The government hopes that local authorities will make early and effective use of the additional spending power before the end of this financial year across the range of local authority capital programmes, including housing, education, schools and roads. Any receipts not spent this year or next will provide an on-going stimulus to house-building and construction in 1994-95 and 1995-96 as well. The availability of these extra receipts will be taken into account in distributing credit approvals between local authorities. In this way, virtually all local authorities should receive some benefit. There will be separate measures for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Exports Madam Speaker, the reduction in the exchange rate has offered immense opportunities to exporters. But our exporters of project equipment and other supplies requiring medium or long term finance rely heavily on the guarantees provided by the Export Credits Guarantees Department. And I now intend to make available a further Pounds 700m of ECGD cover and to ease some of the constraints on cover for individual countries. This will enable these exporters to compete more effectively in the increasingly difficult situation they now face. I have also considered the position on capital allowances. It remains my view that the reform of business tax by Lord Lawson in his 1984 Budget was the right one. Low tax rates and a broad tax base provide the best framework for the medium-term. However, in present circumstances, I am prepared to allow some changes which should help to bring forward private sector investment. Accordingly, for a limited period of twelve months, I propose to raise from 25 to 40 per cent the allowances available in the first year for investment in plant and machinery, excluding cars. I also propose to introduce an initial allowance of 20 per cent for expenditure on new industrial and agricultural buildings for which contracts are placed before 31 October 1993 and which are brought into use before the end of 1994. I propose to legislate for these changes, with retrospective effect to 1 November, in the next Finance Bill. Car tax I have one final measure to announce. The motor industry lies at the heart of British manufacturing. In recent years, it has seen a renaissance, with large increases in inward investment. However, the recession has brought a more difficult climate. I have considered what might best be done to help. Any action in this area will, of course, have to be paid for in my next Budget by higher motoring taxes after 1992-93. I have decided nevertheless to continue with the tax reform begun in my last Budget and to abolish car tax altogether from midnight tonight. This will mean a saving of about Pounds 400 on a typical family car. This measure will require a simple Bill, which I shall bring forward shortly. It will provide a direct boost to the motor industry and will, of course, benefit business more widely. I am sure it will be warmly welcomed. Madam Speaker, the measures I have announced today should provide an immediate boost to confidence and welcome relief for some of the most hard-pressed sectors of the economy. Taken together they will add some Pounds 4bn to borrowing over the next three years, but with no increase in the PSBR over the medium-term. And these measures come on top of the Government's new spending plans for the next three years and the proposals I have announced to liberalise the rules on private finance. Finally, Madam Speaker, there is the significant relaxation in monetary policy since Britain left the ERM just two months ago. Britain already has the lowest interest rates in the European Community; and the pound is trading at a level that gives British industry a sharp competitive edge in foreign markets. That relaxation of policy has been possible because of the dramatic progress we have made in getting inflation down; and it is precisely because our inflationary prospects remain excellent that today, Madam Speaker, I can go further. Alongside the tight public expenditure plans I have announced I believe it is appropriate now to make a further reduction in interest rates. The Governor and I have agreed that the Bank will tomorrow set the Minimum Lending Rate at 7 per cent. That reduction is, in my judgment, fully consistent with the government's inflationary objectives. Today's reduction takes British interest rates down to their lowest level for nearly 15 years; it means that our interest rates have been cut by fully 8 per cent over the last two years; it takes a further Pounds 1bn off industry's costs on top of the Pounds 9bn fall in interest payments we have already seen; and it will provide further help to all those with mortgages. Madam Speaker, British business now has the opportunity it has been looking for - to bring the country out of recession; to increase sales, expand production and invest for the future. And industry can now seize the new opportunities, safe in the knowledge that the Government will play its full part. We have a new monetary framework that will deliver low inflation over the medium-term. We have a new system for controlling public expenditure that will deliver annual spending increases which the country can afford. We have new spending plans, which protect the poorest in society and offer hope, help and opportunity by switching resources to programmes that support the long-term prosperity of the country. We have the lowest interest rates in the European Community. And we have a carefully targeted set of measures designed to lift confidence and get the country back to work. This, Madam Speaker, is a clear and comprehensive strategy. It is a strategy for growth. I commend it to the House.</p>

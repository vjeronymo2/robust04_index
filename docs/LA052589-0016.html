			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUS SAFETY  </P> <P> Shame on the members of the federal committee who "rejected the idea of  requiring seat belts on the nation's . . . school buses, concluding that it  would cost $40 million and save an average of just one life a year . . ." if  used by only half the students on each bus (Part I, May 9)! How can anyone put  a price tag on the life of a child? Incidentally, that same issue of The Times  carried a story of a school bus accident in which 8 children were injured.  </P> <P> These same folks who rejected the school bus seat belt idea would undoubtedly  think nothing of spending $40 million on a weapon for the Defense Department,  but heaven forbid using it to protect our kids! Anyone who cares for our  youngsters should contact his or her representative and suggest we purchase one  less bomber and use the money to buy seat belts for our school buses!  </P> <P> JOANNE S. McBIRNEY  </P> <P> La Crescenta  </P></p>

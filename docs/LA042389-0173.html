			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A COORDINATED BATTLE  </P> <P> In Santa Ana and Anaheim, church and state are not as separate as they used to  be, and the result, without compromising any bedrock Constitutional concepts,  promises to produce a healthier, more livable and crime-free community.  </P> <P> In a coordinated effort prompted by a mutual concern over the growing drug  problem and local government's failure to adequately address the issue, members  of 15 churches in Santa Ana and Anaheim have successfully banded together to  secure a commitment from the Anaheim and Santa Ana city councils that they  would launch a coordinated effort to help eradicate drugs. That effort will  include police, prosecutors, judges and city and school officials, among  others.  </P> <P> The approach is not new. It was used more than 10 years ago when priests from  Northern California came into Santa Ana to teach barrio residents how to  organize and get action rather than lip service from government officials.  </P> <P> But this is the most widespread use of the church-oriented program in the  county thus far, involving hundreds of members of 15 churches and synagogues in  an ecumenical approach that seeks to prompt local government to use its powers  and resources to adequately address the community concerns raised by the  congregations.  </P> <P> It is a tool that has proven effective. And it has drawn the interest of U.S.  Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who is scheduled to meet this week with the  group that has adopted the formal name of Orange County Congregation-Community  Organizations. The interfaith group, after deciding to zero in on the "drug  epidemic," studied the problem for 6 months and concluded that local agencies  are not coordinating effective programs, that too few police officers and  prosecutors are assigned to the problem, that there are too few detoxification  beds and jail cells, and that not enough money is being spent on anti-drug  programs in the schools.  </P> <P> The approach taken by the 15 congregations in Anaheim and Santa Ana in  targeting a specific issue, starting at the grass-roots level where it has the  best chance of success, and concentrating on nonsectarian stands that solely  seek to improve community life, is a realistic and effective way for  congregations to get involved.  </P></p>

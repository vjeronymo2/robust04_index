			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Sweden launches aggressively-priced Dollars 1.5bn FRN THE KINGDOM of Sweden provided the talking point of the Eurobond market yesterday with the launch of an aggressively-priced Dollars 1.5bn floating-rate note. Dealers were quick to point out that the market is badly in need of a liquid FRN issue, adding that Sweden's deal helps to create a new benchmark note in the five-year area. 'The concept is right - there is a technical shortage of liquid sovereign paper,' said one syndicate head. However, the deal's pricing - at 99.70 to give a yield of 6.4 basis points over Libor - was seen as being very tight. Participating banks admitted that the deal was going slowly, and one banker estimated that no more than a third of the bonds had been placed. 'The pricing is tight, but not outrageous - it is going to be a slow slog but it will get done,' was one US banker's verdict. Another syndicate head said he had hoped to see a yield of at least 10 basis points over Libor, which he felt would have helped the deal to go more quickly. However, UBS, the joint lead manager, justified the pricing by citing other sovereign FRNs, many of which are trading through (rather than over) Libor. Belgium (AA1) has two FRNs trading at 3 - 4 basis points below Libor, but Ireland (AA3/AA - ) has an FRN trading at 8 basis points over Libor. Sweden itself has a credit rating of AA2/AA+. The lead managers expect traditional FRN investors - such as central banks, money market funds and bond funds - to buy the issue, which is due to break syndicate today. Land Securities launched a Pounds 150m convertible bond due 2008 on the back of strong resultsbut dealers said firm demand from continental European investors was inspired as much by the 7 per cent coupon as the deal's equity component. The conversion price was set at 640p, a premium of 15.94 per cent, about the same level as for other recent sterling convertible issues. Strong demand from continental Europe has allowed UK companies to set higher premiums on recent convertible offerings than would be acceptable solely with a UK investor base. 'European investors came back into the market because they are bullish on sterling, now it is out of the ERM and they like the high coupon with an equity kicker,' said one trader. The deal, arranged by J. Henry Schroder Wagg, was quoted at 100 3/8 , above its reoffer price of 100. It is callable after five years. Elsewhere, the Eurobond market saw activity in a range of currencies. Australian Broadcasting Corporation made its debut with an ADollars 100m, five-year issue. The borrower is state-owned and has a triple-A rating. The bonds were priced to yield 10 basis points over the relevant government bond at full fees. It was offered at 7 basis points above, and traded at 5 basis points over by late afternoon. Hambros Bank, the lead manager, said the bonds were bought by 'a good spread of investors' in Germany and Benelux. In the dollar sector, General Electric Capital Corporation launched a Dollars 200m three-year deal via Merrill Lynch aimed mainly at European retail investors.</p>

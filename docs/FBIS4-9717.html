			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 30 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- President Carlos  Roberto Reina's government, which came to power last January,  has announced new gasoline, diesel, and kerosene prices will go  into effect beginning today. Super gasoline, which cost 8.66  lempiras per gallon ($1.10), increased to 10.10 lempiras (a $.20  increase), and regular gasoline went from 7.44 lempiras ($.98)  per gallon to 9.49 lempiras, a $.35 increase. Diesel prices rose  $.70. Kerosene, used by the poor, 70 percent of the Honduran  people, increased from 2.97 lempiras ($.40) to 5.28 lempiras  ($.75). Prices for cooking gas also increased.    According to the Economy Ministry's official communique, the  new price structure "does not seek to adversely affect the  low-income sector." The communique stated it is "impossible" for  the government to continue subsidizing fuel prices because in  February it represented losses of 20 million lempiras, some $2.5  million.    Adolfo Facusse, president of the Honduran Council for  Private  Enterprise, said if fuel prices decrease internationally, a fuel  price increase in the entire country cannot be justified. "This  will lead to an increase in the inflation rate we are  experiencing, which is regrettable," Facusse has said. Luis  Salgado, vice president of the National Transportation Council,  has said the fuel price increase announced today will also lead  to an increase in bus fares.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Moscow to condemn nationalism The Russian foreign minister is expected to ask the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to adopt a resolution condemning 'aggressive nationalism' at the one-time cold war negotiating body's annual meeting in Rome next week. The Russian diplomatic initiative, unveiled in Moscow this week by Foreign Ministry officials, is the latest move by the Kremlin to establish a more muscular Russian presence in the 'near abroad', as Russians describe the other former Soviet republics. In the same vein, Russian resistance to an extension of membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to eastern Europe hardened yesterday when a presidential spokesman said that Mr Yeltsin agreed with the harsh attack on the notion of an expanded Nato delivered by Mr Yevgeny Primakov, the head of the Russian intelligence agency, earlier in the week. By proposing that the CSCE adopt a resolution on 'aggressive nationalism' Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, is seeking international legitimacy for his pledge this month to take tough action to defend the rights of ethnic Russians everywhere in the former Soviet Union. The new, tougher Russian stance could first be put to the test by Latvia, which yesterday passed the first reading of a restrictive law on citizenship. The controversial legislation establishes quotas on the number of new citizens the country will naturalise every year. Currently only 66 per cent of Latvia's 2.7m inhabitants are citizens. To qualify for citizenship the rest of the population, mainly Russians brought in to the republic after the second world war and their descendants, must demonstrate a conversational knowledge of Latvian and fulfil a 10-year residence requirement. Mr Guntis Ulmanis, the Latvian president, justifies this restrictive legislation on the grounds that 'we could have a demographic explosion. The threat of our extinction forces us to take this step.' The new hard line in Russian foreign policy was also in evidence yesterday when Moscow raised the stakes in its struggle with Kiev over the nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian soil. The Russian cabinet threatened to stop servicing the nuclear weapons in Ukraine in retaliation for the Ukrainian parliament's decision this month to surrender only a part of its nuclear arsenal. The missiles could become unstable.</p>

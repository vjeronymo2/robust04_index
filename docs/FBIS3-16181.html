			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 12, BNS -- The Latvian Economics Ministry  has prepared a draft resolution to speed up the payment of debts  to the Latvijas Gaze (Latvian Gas) state-stock company.    The debt of gas consumers presently totals 40 million lats.    Under the draft resolution, industrial consumers may face a  50-percent cut in gas supplies if they fail to release or reduce  the debt in two weeks.    In case the repayment is delayed, the debtor is warned and  if  that does not work, the gas supply is suspended.    The ministry also plans to ask the Finance Ministry grant  sales tax waivers to heating enterprises which provide heating  for apartment houses.    The resolution is coordinated with the Finance Ministry and  the Justice Ministry. The State Reforms Ministry has not  revealed its viewpoint yet.</p>

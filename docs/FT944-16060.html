			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finland's EU vote will pave way for others The European Union's move to expand from 12 to 16 members next year will be put to a vital test tomorrow when Finns decide in a referendum whether to join the Union. Recent polls suggest the result will be a clear approval of membership, despite the vocal opposition of the influential farmers' lobby. An opinion poll yesterday showed 50 per cent of voters supporting membership, 28 per cent against and 22 per cent undecided. With Austria having already voted to join, a strong Finnish Yes would reinforce the Yes campaigns in neighbouring Sweden and Norway, where opposition to joining is much stronger. Referendums are due in Sweden on November 13 and in Norway on November 28. Opinion in Sweden is finely divided. Although Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the new Social Democratic prime minister, is strongly pro-EU, two members of his cabinet are prominent No campaigners, leaving the government unable to present a united front. In Norway, polls show Yes votes in Finland and Sweden are vital if opinion is to be swung in favour of membership. The Yes camp in Finland is also anxious for a clear majority to ensure there is no last-minute move to block membership in parliament, which has the final say. EU membership requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority. A decisive issue in neutral Finland is likely to be a widespread desire to move the country under the political umbrella of the EU following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, yesterday said Russia had signalled its approval of Finland joining the EU. Finnish membership would make the 1,240km Finnish-Russian border the EU's first direct frontier with Russia. Mr Aho said Russian leaders saw trade and commercial advantages in having Finland in the EU.</p>

Qian said this at a meeting with visiting Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.    Qian said that China, the most populous country in the  world,  is a big developing country with a vigorous economy, while  Russia is a country with a vast territory, rich industrial  technology and natural resources.    He said that it is important for China and Russia, neighbors  and both permanent members of the Security Council of the United  Nations, to strengthen mutual friendship and cooperation.    Kozyrev said that another Sino-Russian summit should take  place this year so as to push bilateral relations to a new stage.    Just as President Boris Yeltsin stressed during his China  visit in December 1992, Kozyrev said, further development of  Russian-Chinese ties enjoys priority in Russia's foreign  policies and it would not be affected by domestic political  changes in Russia.    Qian said that China attaches importance to the dialogue and  contacts between leaders of the two countries, which he believed  were significant to promoting mutual understanding and trust and  enhancing the good-neighborly relations between the two sides.    Qian expressed his satisfaction over the recent development  of the Sino-Russian ties.    He noted that high-level contacts between the two sides also  maintained momentum and the bilateral economic and trade  relations have been further developed. The trade volume between  China and Russia hit over seven billion U.S. dollars.    Qian said that Yeltsin's China visit in 1992 gave a big push  to the development of Sino-Russian ties.    Briefing the guests on China's stand of banning nuclear  tests  and non-use of nuclear arms, Qian said that the provisions  concerning the mutual non-use of nuclear weapons in the  Sino-Russian joint communique is very important.    Kozyrev told Qian about the new theories on national defense  of Russia, saying that they are of totally defensive.    The Russian foreign minister said that the Russian side is  willing to participate in China's construction of large  projects, such as the Three Gorges Project.    Following the meeting, the two foreign ministers signed two  documents: an agreement between the two governments on ports in  border areas and a protocol on consultations between the foreign  ministries of the two countries.</p>

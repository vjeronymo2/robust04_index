			<p>BFN     [Summary] "Today the deputies continued their debate at  the conference hall on the draft law on the organization of  people's councils and people's committees." The session was  held under the direction of National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc  Manh.    In the morning, "the deputies passed chapter 1 of this draft  law, which contains generalities. They also debated chapter 2  which deals with people's councils."    In the afternoon, Comrade Nguyen Van Yeu, member of the  session Secretariat, re-read the articles already revised in  chapter 2 of the draft law. Several deputies called for adding  a nationalities and religious affairs committee to each people's  council. "The National Assembly later decided to temporarily  postpone the debate on chapter 2 so the secretariat can make  some changes."    Afterward, Mr. Phan Ngoc Tuong, minister of state in charge  of the government committee for cadre organization, solicited  the views of the deputies on chapter 3 which deals with people's  committees; on Chapter 4 which provides stipulations for changes  in the level of control or in territorial limits of  administrative units; and on chapter 5 which provides a clause  for enforcement.    "Tomorrow, the National Assembly deputies will continue  their  debate at the conference hall on this draft law."</p>

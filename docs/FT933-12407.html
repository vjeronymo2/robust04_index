			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Kenyan central bank head sacked THE KENYAN government, under pressure to clean up its financial system, said yesterday it had replaced the embattled central bank governor, Mr Eric Cheruiyot Kotut, Reuter reports from Nairobi. A statement from state house, the office of President Daniel arap Moi, said Mr Kotut had resigned and was being replaced by a little-known accountant, Mr Micah Cheserem. Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister, said he had launched 'intensive investigations' into the operations of the central bank, which has been accused by opposition politicians of gross mismanagement of the economy. The resignation is the latest in a series of developments in the troubled banking system. Mr Mudavadi closed down the Exchange Bank, one of several banks which are under investigation by the authorities, this week after ordering an external audit into its operations. Mr Mudavadi issued a statement saying he had found evidence of malpractice and speculative activities. Exchange Bank has filed a court injunction appealing against the closure. 'Its records are not in order and not kept up to date. Moreover, there is evidence of malpractice,' Mr Mudavadi's statement said. 'Its management has tended to engage in speculative activities which are not only inconsistent with established banking practices but are prejudicial to the interests of depositors and the general public.' Four other financial institutions, dubbed 'political banks' because of the patronage they enjoy from high-ranking members of government, are also being subjected to external audits at the request of the International Monetary Fund.</p>

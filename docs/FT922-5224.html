			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Finmeccanica float closer FINMECCANICA, the company controlling the engineering and aerospace activities of Italy's state-owned IRI group, has moved closer to flotation, writes Haig Simonian. It now has approval for its merger with SIFA, a quoted holding company owned by IRI. Under the transaction, which involves a two-stage capital increase and a bond issue, Finmeccanica should raise around L2,400bn (Dollars 1.9bn) and be quoted by November. Shareholders in SIFA will be offered 9 shares in Finmeccanica for every 4 shares held, based on evaluation by Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank. The deal is part of Italy's partial privatisation programme.</p>

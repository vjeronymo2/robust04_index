			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Writing on page 17 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT  AHARONOT in Hebrew on 7 April, Mikhal Goldberg reports on the  testimonies of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Barukh  Goldstein's widow Miryam before the Shamgar commission of  inquiry on 6 April.    "At the outset of his testimony, the prime minister reviewed  the situation in the territories, specifically referring to the  conditions in Hebron and in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Among  other things, he commented on the worship arrangements at the  site and on the permit given to settlers to enter the cave with  their weapons.    "Another central issue featuring in his testimony was the  Shin Bet's warnings about actions by Jewish extremists, in view  of Army officers' contentions during the commission's hearings  that they had not been forewarned about Jewish terror and the  Shin Bet's arguments that it had issued hundreds of such  warnings.    "An hour into Rabin's testimony, a phone call was received  at  the Supreme Court building: `Beware, all of you leftists. The  building will blow up within the hour.' Security personnel and  policemen stationed in the building were put on the alert, and a  police bomb disposal expert was summoned to the scene. They  began searching the building and the cars parked in the adjacent  parking lot. Nevertheless, the building was not evacuated, and  Rabin proceeded with his testimony. Eventually, it proved to be  a false alarm."    Goldberg goes on to write that Miryam Goldstein gave her  testimony in camera. "She was smuggled into the building  through the entrance reserved for the judges," and "the entire  building was closed to the public in order to preserve the  utmost secrecy." Goldstein was supposed to testify before the  commission on 3 April, but she did not show up. "It is not  clear why she changed her mind," Goldberg writes.</p>

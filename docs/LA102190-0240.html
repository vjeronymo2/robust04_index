			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARBOR IN GARDEN WITHOUT STICKER SHOCK;  </P> <P> PROJECT: BASING THE DESIGN ON A $2,000 MODEL, ONE CAN BE BUILT FOR JUST THE  COST OF MATERIALS.  </P> <P> I built a climbing rose arbor (shown in this week's sketch) out of desperation.  My wife had just purchased a pair of Blaze climbing roses, and she needed  something for them to climb on. She looked in lumberyards, garden centers and  mail order gardening catalogues. Anything under $200 looked like a product of a  sixth-grade shop class.  </P> <P> Finally she discovered an arbor she liked, but the asking price -- $2,000  installed -- gave new meaning to the term sticker shock. The only solution was  to build one myself. It's based on the $2,000 design, but it cost about 1/20th  of that to build.  </P> <P> To build it, all you do is make a pair of stretcher-shaped frames. Into each  frame you insert a piece of ready-made lattice.  </P> <P> Join the two frames with a pair of arches sawed from ordinary pine, and "plant"  the whole thing in four holes in your garden.  </P> <P> To make the frames, you'll need five 8-foot, pressure-treated 2-by-4s. I bought  one 4-by-8 foot piece of lattice and cut it to size, but some lumber yards sell  it in 2-foot widths. If you can find the 2-foot wide lattice, it will simplify  your cutting.  </P> <P> For the arches you'll need about 40 feet of 1-by-8 pine, plus 12 feet of round  closet pole. Everything goes together with waterproof glue and nails. For the  glue, use construction adhesive, sold in caulking gun cartridges. For screws,  use plated Phillips flat heads. You'll need about 30 of these 1 1/4 inches  long, and another 30 at 3 inches long.  </P> <P> The frames. Use four of your 2-by-4s for the posts, and cut the fifth one into  2-foot lengths for the crosspieces. At the top of each post, cut a notch or  "rabbet" three-quarter inch deep and 6 inches long. These rabbets will match up  with four stubs on the arch forming a lap joint (see sketch).  </P> <P> Fasten the main frame parts together as shown with adhesive and a pair of  3-inch screws at each joint. Then cut your lattice into two pieces measuring 25  by 60 inches. Use a circular saw with a cheap blade for this. You will probably  hit a few staples as you cut, and there's no point in ruining a good blade. Be  sure to wear eye protection.  </P> <P> Set the lattice into the frames and secure it with three-quarter-inch strips of  wood ripped off the edges of your pine boards. You could also use  three-quarter-inch quarter-round molding for this job.  </P> <P> The arches. These are made by cutting arced segments out of your pine and  laminating them together in two layers. The best way to do this is to cut a  semicircular pattern out of heavy cardboard or scrap plywood. I made a simple  compass for this purpose out of a thin strip of wood about 26 inches long. To  do this, drill a small hole about an inch from one end of the stick. Measure up  20 inches from this hole and drill another hole. Then drill a third hole 23 1/2  inches from the first.  </P> <P> You now have a simple beam compass that will draw the inside and outside curves  of your arch. Place the compass on your cardboard or plywood and tap a nail  through the solitary hole. This will be the center pivot. Now slip a pencil  into the 20-inch hole and draw the inside curve of your arch. Slip the pencil  into the 23 1/2-inch hole and repeat to draw the outside curve. Cut it out and  your pattern is complete.  </P> <P> Use this pattern to lay out arched segments from your pine stock. Cut these out  and laminate them together using adhesive and your 1 1/4-inch screws. Stagger  the joints between segments so they don't overlay. And extend the ends of the  inside layer of each arch 6 inches to create the stubs that will mate up with  the 6-inch rabbets in the tops of the arbor frames.  </P> <P> Next, join the two arches together with five equally spaced lengths of closet  pole. You can either simply cut these 24 inches long and fasten with screws,  or, drill three-quarter-inch deep sockets for them in the inner faces of the  arches. Then glue and screw them in place. If you take this route, don't forget  to cut the poles 25 1/2 inches long.  </P> <P> Final assembly. This is easiest with the arbor on its side. Place the two  frames on edge, 40 inches apart. To hold the frames in position, tack a couple  of strips of wood from one frame to the other. Apply adhesive to all four  rabbets, then set the arch in position and secure with one screw at each joint.  </P> <P> Check to make sure everything is square and parallel. Then drive three more  screws into each joint to lock things up solid. Let the glue set for a few  hours before putting any strain on the joints. The arbor will be a bit floppy  until set in the ground, so handle it carefully from here on. It's not a bad  idea to tack on a pair of temporary diagonal braces about 6 feet long to  reinforce the arbor until it is safely in the ground.  </P> <P> I tried an unusual trick for setting my arbor in the ground and it worked  perfectly. Carry the arbor into position in the garden, and set it in place on  the ground. Carefully mark the position of each leg, then pick the arbor up and  set it aside. Next, punch four post holes 16 inches into the ground using a  heavy sledge hammer and a 3-foot length of 4-by-4. Just pound the 4-by-4 into  the ground, wiggle it around to loosen it and enlarge the hole, then pull it  out.  </P> <P> Finally, set the arbor legs into these holes and pour them full of pea gravel.  Once the legs are safely set in the ground, the arbor becomes quite rigid and  you can remove the temporary braces. I finished my arbor with a white exterior  stain. This looks a lot like paint, but won't chip or peel, so it's easier to  maintain.  </P> <P> 1990, Los Angeles Times Syndicate  </P> <P> </P></p>

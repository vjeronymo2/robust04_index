			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Torday &amp; Carlisle loses Pounds 0.35m and omits pay-out TORDAY &amp; CARLISLE, the Newcastle-based engineer, yesterday passed its interim dividend for the first time in almost a decade as it announced a deficit of Pounds 353,000 pre-tax for the six months to June 30. Turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds 20.1m, and losses per share were reduced from 6.3p to 3.1p. The outcome compared with last time's losses of Pounds 90,000 before exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds 544,000. Then, an interim dividend of 1.5p was paid. Mr Paul Torday, chief executive, hinted that payment of the full-year dividend could depend on the sale of Oldham, the loss-making sign subsidiary. 'If Oldham is not there, the remaining two businesses are . . . cash generative and gearing will have come down. That is a completely different scenario.' Oldham, which maintains the neon signs in London's Piccadilly Circus, was purchased just four years ago for Pounds 9m. In the period, the business incurred losses of Pounds 972,000 (Pounds 869,000). A main plank of Torday's successful defence last year against the hostile Pounds 18.8m bid from rival engineer Dowding &amp; Mills had been its defence of Oldham Signs. However, the 'gentle economic recovery' expected for 1992 had not materialised, Mr Torday said. Therefore the company, under the relatively new chairmanship of Mr Peter Ryan, former deputy chairman of Davies &amp; Newman, had decided to sell Oldham. Diesel Marine International, the engine repair business, suffered a 30 per cent drop in operating profits to Pounds 902,000. Mr Torday said the shipping industry had been severely depressed in the first half, with freight rates down by some 30 per cent in January. However, the division has expanded into the automotive market. Mr Torday said he expected this to be an increasingly important business. Elfab-Hughes - which makes pressure relief and safety equipment - improved operating profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 380,000 on steady sales.</p>

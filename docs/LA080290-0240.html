			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE POLITICS OF OIL  </P> <P> Iraq and Kuwait produce one-fifth of the total oil output of the Organization  of Petroleum Exporting Countries  </P> <P> Their oil accounts for an estimated 5% of daily U.S. consumption: the United  States buys about 200,000 barrels of oil daily from Kuwait and 500,000 to  600,000 barrels from Iraq.  </P> <P> In the first half of 1990, OPEC produced about 23.5 million barrels of crude  oil per day; world production outside the Soviet Union and its former  satellites was about 52 million barrels daily.  </P> <P> Iraq is one of the major producers of the 13-member cartel, with a daily  production quota of 3.14 million barrels. That equals Iran's quota and is  second only to Saudi Arabia's 5.1 million barrels.  </P> <P> Kuwait's quota is 1.5 million barrels per day out of an estimated production  capacity of 2.2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day.  </P> <P> In the first six months of 1990, the United States imported 49.9% of its oil.  It produced 7.3 million barrels a day, the lowest in 29 years.  </P> <P> Kuwait's huge oil reserves are backed by one of the largest financial reserves  in the world. It has more than $100 billion in surplus petrodollars, mostly  invested in the United States, Britain, West Germany, France and other  industrialized countries.  </P></p>

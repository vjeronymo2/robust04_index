			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 6 (CTK) -- Czech courts have settled  218,000 requests for legal rehabilitation and compensated 70,000  individuals for injustices committed by the communist regime,  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told journalists today after the  government session.    The total sum paid out in compensation exceeds 2.7 billion  korunas ($90 million), he said. Over a billion of this sum was  paid in cash, the remainder in the form of government bonds.    The "overwhelming majority" of applications have been  processed now, he said, with only cases complicated by the  destruction of archive material still remaining. These  outstanding 4,800 requests should be solved by the end of the  year, he said.    Klaus said the cabinet and Justice Minister Jiri Novak in  particular had often in the past been criticized for the slow  pace of the rehabilitation process. He said he would welcome it  if critics took a look at the "figure of 218,000 solved  rehabilitations." Novak's approach had, on the contrary,  considerably speeded up the whole process, he said, adding that  on completing the process the courts would be relieved of a  great burden and would be able to devote themselves to usual  matters.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Financial stamp of disapproval - Charles Batchelor describes one woman's struggle for registration with a self-regulatory body Susan Reed wants to advise east European governments on how to fund their privatisation programmes. She thought that the best way of going about it was to register with the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), which regulates this type of activity. But one year later and after wasting more than Pounds 5,000 in fees Reed has decided that she no longer needs or wants their official approval. If Reed's experience of trying to register with the SFA, one of four self-regulatory bodies set up to improve investor protection under the Financial Services Act, is typical, it reveals a system which places a very heavy burden of red tape on the smaller business. Her story suggests that the government's concern to protect investors has led to the neglect of its stated objective of reducing the bureaucracy which hampers business. The small firm pays a heavy penalty in complying with a regulatory system which has, in recent months, signally failed to prevent some very large-scale frauds. Reed decided to set up in business on her own after 19 years working in international capital markets with companies such as Samuel Montagu and Citicorp. After being made redundant she spent two years training herself to use a computer and run her own business. She decided to set up an investment banking consultancy advising governments in eastern Europe on how to finance their privatisation programmes. It was not her intention to handle client's money and she would not be dealing with the general public. The diary of Reed's dealings with the SFA makes sobering reading: February 1991. Reed enquires with The Securities Association (which two months later becomes the SFA) whether she needs to register her consultancy, Susan Reed &amp; Co. The TSA says it cannot advise and she must ask her own lawyers. April 1991. Her lawyers say she must register. May 20. After Reed's accountants have spent a month reviewing the documentation, Reed submits her application form. May 23. Reed is given the impression by the SFA that her application appears to be straightforward and it should only take 'a few weeks' before being presented to the membership committee. She is asked to submit financial projections. Reed pays standard Pounds 2,000 application fee. The fee is the same whether an applicant employs one or 1,000 people. It also is just Pounds 80 less than the financial support Reed has received under the government's Enterprise Allowance Scheme, designed to help unemployed people start up in business. June. Reed is sent a copy of the TSA rule book with a wad of amendments as thick as the original volume. She spends four days reading and updating the rule book. July. After further work with her accountants, she submits financial documents. August 9. She attends a meeting of the SFA's enforcement department at which her financial statements are reviewed. August 23. The SFA informs Reed that her accountants are not registered with the SFA to audit member firms. She must persuade them to register or find another accountant. Reed's accountants, themselves a small firm, agree to register but only because they have another client in a similar position. October 24. SFA membership committee approves her application but - five months after her initial approach - asks her to change the name of her business. The SFA does not like a one-person business calling itself '&amp; Co', she says. She suggests Susan Reed Securities but this is not acceptable either. October 21. An SFA official telephones to ask if Reed will send written confirmation she has no debts. October 25. The membership department agrees to put forward her application under the original name. November 7. Her application is approved. But when Reed receives written confirmation she is horrified to discover she is listed only under the section: 'to provide corporate finance advice'. She had applied for a broader range of categories, including providing advice and acting as an agent for debentures. She understands corporate finance to involve advice on matters such as mergers and acquisitions. November-December. The SFA sends a form which allows Reed to request a change in her business profile. The form indicates that a revised profile is valid from the date it is received by the SFA but a note attached to the form says the SFA will send Reed a copy of the amended print-out of her business profile. January 31, 1992. Reed receives a bill from her accountant for work on her SFA application. This prompts her to chase up the SFA. Reed, who has been living off savings and money received under an insurance claim, says she has not carried out any business in the meantime. She has become involved in preparing other projects. March 11. Reed loses patience and writes to the SFA, effectively renouncing membership and asking for a refund of her application fee and legal and accountant's fees. She also asks for compensation for the Pounds 50,000 in lost earnings which she had projected for her first 10 months in business. March 13. John Young, SFA chief executive, replies to Reed's letter saying he can see no reason to make the refund. Reed says his letter does not address the issue of the length of time taken to process the application. The SFA says it cannot comment on a specific application but it does reply to Reed in detail on March 30. Its record of events tallies in most respects with Reed's but it points out that Reed or her accountants took a long time to respond to requests for information. Once information was received it was acted upon speedily, according to the SFA. Reed would have been told at the initial meeting that applications took 12 weeks on average to process though some straightforward ones might take less time, the SFA states. It also finds it 'implausible' that Reed would wait so long after submitting a revised business profile without checking to see whether it had been received and whether she could start up in business. But, leaving aside the time which passed after Reed submitted her revised business profile, is a six-month wait unduly lengthy? After all, businesses which attempt to raise venture capital finance may have to devote between six and 12 months to the process. And is Pounds 5,000 too much to ask a small business to pay to register? The SFA registration process does appear onerous for the smaller business. As Reed points out, much of the information involved financial projections, the relevance of which, for registration purposes, seemed remote. Suggesting, as the SFA does, that Reed delayed in responding to requests for information seems to ignore the fact that it might take time to prepare. And even if one set of procedures does not seem a heavy burden, businesses have to deal with many different organisations each setting its own rules and timetable. Turning to the costs involved: City executives may earn more than their counterparts in industry but, until recently, few earned the level of salary which would allow them to write off Pounds 5,000 of start-up costs without blinking. Reed says she has now decided that she does not need the approval of the SFA. 'If investors need to be protected this is not the way to do it,' she says. 'I feel it is an abuse of power. Lots of people have been made redundant in the City. The bureaucracy prevents them from applying their skills.'</p>

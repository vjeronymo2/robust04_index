			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> LINEN TO HEAD SHEARSON BROKERAGE UNIT  </P> <P> Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. has named Jonathan Linen, an executive from parent  American Express Co., to head Shearson's brokerage and money management  businesses.  </P> <P> The move appears to confirm American Express' plan to split Shearson in two as  part of a restructuring of the troubled financial services company.  </P> <P> New York-based Shearson, the nation's second-largest securities firm after  Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said Linen will become president and chief executive  of its Private Client Group, which is its brokerage unit, and asset management  business.  </P> <P> Linen was most recently head of the travelers checks and direct marketing group  of American Express. He has been with the firm for 21 years.  </P> <P> "The move reaffirms American Express' commitment to developing the tremendous  potential of Shearson's retail franchise," said James Robinson III, chairman  and chief executive of American Express.  </P> <P> Hardwick Simmons, who was president of the brokerage group, has resigned,  Shearson said.  </P> <P> As part of the reorganization, American Express plans to buy the Shearson stock  that it does not already own, about 39% of its shares.  </P> <P> It has already installed new senior management. In January, Shearson Chairman  Peter Cohen was ousted and replaced by Howard Clark Jr., who was American  Express' chief financial officer.  </P> <P> Clark has since announced that the firm would overhaul its business, resulting  in about 2,000 layoffs. The cost of these and other changes contributed to the  firm's first-quarter loss of $915 million.  </P> <P> Sources at Shearson and on Wall Street have indicated for weeks that the firm  was planning to split itself into two businesses, combining the brokerage and  money management areas and forming a separate unit from investment banking and  capital markets.  </P> <P> In its brokerage business, Shearson has 10,000 brokers at 450 offices around  the country managing about $90 billion for pension funds and other institutions  and $180 billion for private clients.  </P> <P> Shearson said Joseph Plumeri Jr., who heads the domestic branches, and Henry  Gottmann, head of sales and marketing for individual retail accounts, will  continue in their current roles. In addition, Jerome Miller will continue to  direct the asset management business, it said.  </P> <P> Linen, 46, joined American Express in 1969 as assistant to the chairman. After  holding several domestic and overseas posts, he was named a senior vice  president in 1978.  </P> <P> From 1980 through 1986, he served as president of the domestic Travel Services  division and then became president of direct marketing in the United States.  </P></p>

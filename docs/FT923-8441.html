			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Letter: Welcome given to graduates Sir, Perhaps I can help dispel any unwarranted gloom felt by accounting graduates after reading Sunjay Kakar's article, 'Graduates who fail the credibility test in the real world' (August 6). This institution's student-entry statistics show that the percentage of accounting graduates in each year's intake has remained steady at 19 or 20 per cent for the last seven years. I believe that this is evidence that, despite the economic climate, firms of chartered accountants welcome applications from graduates with good degrees, whatever the subject.

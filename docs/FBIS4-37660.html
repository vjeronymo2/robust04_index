			<p>BFN     [Text] The number of patients who called at popular medical  clinics in 1993 complaining of different diseases was more than  8 million, while the number of patients who called at these  clinics in 1992 was not more than 6 million.    Dr. 'Imad Jassam [not further identified] has said the  increase in the number of patients is due to malnutrition  suffered by children, mothers, and old people and to the  scarcity of essential drugs for them. He pointed out that the  number of patients suffering from chronic diseases has exceeded  328,000.    Dr. Jassam added that popular clinics in all governorates  employ a total of 88 specialist doctors, 540 general  practitioners, 92 dentists, and more than 630 members of the  health care and nursing professions.</p>

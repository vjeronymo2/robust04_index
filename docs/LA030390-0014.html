			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : A QUICK-CHANGE ARTIST  </P> <P> The next time you're stuck on the Ventura Freeway during rush hour and the  driver behind you with a 5 o'clock shadow looks a little impatient, be  understanding. It could be actor Mike Michaud, trying to get to work.  </P> <P> Since late January, Michaud has managed to beat the Thursday through Saturday  traffic as he rushes from his day job at the Universal Studios Tour to arrive  at the Colony Studio Theatre for the curtain of John Banach's play, "Naked  Dancing."  </P> <P> The challenge isn't simply being a speedy commuter. Michaud has to pull off a  mind-bending role reversal: at Universal, he plays Kohbad-Shah, the evil  double-swordsman in "Conan the Barbarian"; in "Naked Dancing," he plays Frank,  an outwardly chummy but emotionally damaged man who befriends a woman gripped  by fear of the outside world.  </P> <P> "It's actually more difficult doing the play when I don't do 'Conan'  beforehand," the Chicago-born actor says. "They're so different that they feed  each other. When it's not summer, we do three or four 'Conan' shows a day. My  character comes back from the dead and emerges out of laser light to battle  Conan. It gets my adrenaline going. Since I barely make the play in time, I'm  really buzzing."  </P> <P> Michaud, who reckons that he has been in one play or another for three  consecutive years (including the Colony's "Guys and Dolls" revival and Rafael  Lima's "El Salvador"), has none of Frank's innocence. Not after his years in  Chicago. "I grew up in the projects, worked for the phone company after  Catholic high school, and then did some male stripping. A pal took me to see  the Steppenwolf theater company, and I saw what real acting was."  </P> <P> Michaud knew his future was either in New York or Los Angeles, "so I flipped a  coin. Heads was L.A., tails was New York.  </P> <P> "Boy, am I glad it landed heads." ROBERT KOEHLER  </P></p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / TUC may seek wider rights for employees: Proposal for works councils Next month's Trades Union Congress will debate proposals that all employees  -not just union members - should be given new legal rights of workplace representation. The proposals, drawn up by the TUC secretariat, led by Mr John Monks, the general secretary, reflect a radical shift in TUC policymakers' thinking on future employment law. Among the ideas to be discussed is the legal right to a German-style works council in any company in Britain with more than 20 employees, whether or not they are union members. The suggestions, in an interim paper, will please Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour party leader, who opposes special legal privileges for trade unions but backs workplace rights for workers. The discussion document cautions, however, that the proposals 'should be seen as one contribution to the debate' and adds they are not yet being put forward for adoption as TUC policy. A final decision on the shape of the proposed new labour laws will come at the 1995 congress. Britain's trade unions have traditionally favoured workplace representation only for their own members. But now the TUC staff believes workers in plants without recognised unions should have 'the legal right to trigger the formation of statutory employee representation committees which would have a range of specific information and consultation rights'. Unions would have rights to recruit, organise and claim recognition 'with appropriate levels of support', it adds. 'In practice, the new legal rights for individuals would provide an opportunity for unions to demonstrate the value of membership.' The TUC believes the new 'employee representation committees' based on German works councils should have a legal right to information covering a company's corporate strategy; its financial affairs; production, sales and employment projections and restructuring plans. The committees would also enjoy consultation rights covering grievance and disciplinary procedures, pensions, equal opportunities, training, working hours, child care arrangements, new working or production methods and impending redundancies, closures and business transfers. The proposed statutory workplace bodies would not deal with collective bargaining issues such as pay and benefits negotiations. The TUC secretariat believes trade unions would come to dominate the proposed committees even if they lack legally exclusive representation, so there would be 'an institutionalised union presence at the workplace'. The document also calls for legal rights for collective bargaining. It proposes an employee representation commission to deal with union recognition claims where they could not be settled by agreement with employers. Unions stand up for non-members, Page 4</p>

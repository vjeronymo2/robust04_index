			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Agneta Engqvist report: "Chinese Currency Chaos Affects </F> Swedish Exports"]    [Text] Many Swedish companies are not being paid for their  exports to China. The current financial squeeze in this country  has put them in a difficult position. Swedish exporters have  been taken by surprise. Their old dependable Chinese customers,  including those who used to pay in advance, are no longer able  to settle their payments.  <H5>  No Currency </H5>   "What is happening now is not due to any inability or  reluctance to pay on the part of the Chinese companies. The  reason is that the banks refuse to grant them foreign currency.  That is why they cannot pay for what they import," Bo  Backstrom, new head of the Export Council's representation in  China, said. His advice to Swedish exporters is: "Do not  export anything before you have established a letter of credit.  And do this before the goods are shipped from Sweden."  <H5>  Only Local Currency </H5>   Today all Chinese importers have to go to one of the 10  state-designated banks in obtain to get foreign currency.  Previously they could go to so-called trade centers to obtain  Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC), the special "foreigners'  currency," but this was abolished at the beginning of the year.  Today, there is only the local currency, renminbi [as  published], and hard currencies are scarce at the remaining  exchange centers.    The overheated Chinese economy and the tight financial  policy  have left the banks with only a strict control function. They  have to ensure that the products imported are really essential  and belong to priority categories. "It is only when the Chinese  company requests a letter of credit that the bank reviews its  chances of obtaining foreign currency for imports," Bo Backstrom  said.  <H5>  Free Exchange Rate </H5>   Sweden's exports to China almost doubled in 1993, reaching a  value of nearly 4.9 billion Kronor. China is the 16th largest  importer of Swedish goods.    The abolition of the "foreigners' currency" is a first step  toward a convertible currency and, gradually, a free exchange  rate in China.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report compiled in Nicosia and Paris by Riyad 'Alam-al-Din </F> and Na'il Mukhaybar]    [Excerpts] As Tehran Radio was arguing that the "only  solution for the Middle East issue is to wipe Israel off the  map," Iranian intelligence personnel were engaged in secret  negotiations in a European capital with Israeli Mosad officers.  That was not the first meeting of its kind. Iranian Minister  of Intelligence and Security 'Ali Fallahian-Khuzestani had  visited Germany three months before. This investigative report  by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI looks at what went on in secret contacts  between Tehran and Tel Aviv and how they touched on Iran's  nuclear program, Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon, and the  peace process, as well as charges likely to be brought against  Iran in court cases in Germany, France, and Switzerland.  Investigations into the assassination of Iranian opposition  figures in Europe have, for the first time, turned up clues  pointing to a direct involvement by top Iranian officials in  international terror. This carries the potential of Iran facing  an international siege, and possibly a military strike, plus a  stifling isolation that has increased following the  Clinton-al-Asad summit. The ayatollahs have, as a consequence,  gone on full alert and used their Israeli cards to save the  regime. Does the new Iranian carrot and stick drive signify a  true desire for openness or is it just a blackmailing effort?    On 7 November, 1993, Iran's Intelligence and Security  Minister Fallahian arrived in Bonn leading a delegation on a top  secret visit. Hours after his arrival, he began contacts with  top German security officers under Brandt Schmidt Paur [name as  published], Helmut Kohl's security adviser. Concurrently, only  a few steps away from the conference room, Israeli Government  officials and Mosad officers were impatiently awaiting the  outcome of the secret German-Iranian session, before they  themselves held an even more discreet session with Fallahian and  his aides. The Iranian intelligence team's visit to Germany was  designed not only to step up security cooperation between Iran  and Germany: Already, their cooperation in this area was at an  advanced stage. German experts had been to Tehran to oversee  the training of Iranian personnel in the latest intelligence  techniques. According to the German news magazine DER SPIEGEL,  the German Intelligence services presented its Iranian  counterpart with sensitive and sophisticated spying equipment.    This time the subject of the secret talks had an Israeli  connection. Fallahian came to Bonn for negotiations with Israel  under German auspices with the advance knowledge and blessing of  Iran's President 'Ali Hashemi-Rafsanjani and the Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The aim was for Iran to help Israel get  a satisfactory resolution for the issue of seven Israeli  soldiers who went missing in Lebanon, including Ron Arad. The  Germans are still puzzled over why Tehran disclosed the presence  of Fallahian in Germany, despite its request that the news of  the visit be kept a secret. [passage omitted]    Israeli relations with the Iranian "Islamic revolution" have  never been as hostile as Iran depicts them. Everybody remembers  the role played by the Israelis in the Irangate affair and their  contribution to Israeli arms sales to Iran. A report by the  U.S. judicial authorities has recently revealed important  information about the role of Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres in  concluding these deals between 1985 and 1986 to secure the  release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon. After that, the Israelis  have maintained close, secret ties with the Iranians, especially  via David Kimche [former Israeli Foreign Ministry director  general]. The Jewish community in Iran, especially those people  who occupy important posts in the bazaar and in the trade firms,  also contributed to these contacts.    Information confirms that Tehran chose to hold secret  negotiations with the Israelis, just like al-Qadhdhafi sent  Libyan pilgrims to Jerusalem and opened up to the Jewish lobby  to persuade the Americans to stop hounding him by using the  Lockerbie affair.    Iran, however, knows how important the missing Israeli  soldiers are to Israel. It is also aware of the importance of  the Israeli key in Washington and the West. Thus, it sought to  come out of these secret negotiations with as much as possible.  Iran asked for a very high price. It wanted to exchange the  missing soldiers for Israeli mediation with Germany to resume  the building of the Bushahr nuclear reactor. The German company  Seimens had started building the reactor in the days of the  shah. After some discussions, Israel convinced Germany to  accept a compromise: The Czech company Skoda Belsin [name as  published], whose shares are mostly owned by Siemens, will  provide Iran with sophisticated technology. Israel put pressure  on Czech authorities to accept this, especially since this  country, which needs money, will receive millions of dollars  from this project. The Israelis, indeed, organized a trip to  Iran by the director of the Skoda Lobomer Sodik [name as  published] between 23 November and 3 December 1993. He met with  Rida Amir al- Lahi [name as published], the top official  supervising the Iranian nuclear program.    Observers have recently noticed that Israel has toned down  its anti-Iran rhetoric and is no longer warning Europe of the  nuclear danger and of Iranian missiles that can hit Tel Aviv.  Moreover, General Uri Sagoy [name as published], chief of the  Israeli Military Intelligence, a few days ago belittled the  dangers to Israel of the missiles manufactured by Iran. Sagoy  strongly criticized the assertions of his counterpart in the  Israeli Air Force, who affirmed that a year from now, Iran will  have the North Korean Nodong missiles, which can reach Israel.  No doubt, the chief of the Military Intelligence was fully  aware of the secret negotiations held a few days prior to his  statement in an Eastern European capital between officials from  Israeli intelligence and Iranian intelligence.</p>

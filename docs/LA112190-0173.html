			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL TALK  </P> <P> "How Do You Cook Turkey?"  </P> <P> Francisco Ramos  </P> <P> First grade  </P> <P> 6 years old  </P> <P> "We don't know where the turkeys are so we use ham. You put it in the oven,  then cook it. We don't use nothing on it, we just put pineapple on the side."  </P> <P> Donna Gomez  </P> <P> First grade  </P> <P> 6 years old  </P> <P> "You put it in the oven for 10 minutes. The oven should be kind of hot."  </P> <P> Ashley Ryken  </P> <P> First grade  </P> <P> 6 years old  </P> <P> "You cook it in the oven for 15 minutes at 15 degrees. You put garlic salt on  it, butter too. That's something that makes it taste great."  </P> <P> Carlos Diaz De Leon  </P> <P> First grade  </P> <P> 6 years old  </P> <P> "You put it in the oven and microwave it for 19 minutes. Then you cut it out  and put fruits in it. That's how my mom makes it. It's a big Sara Lee turkey."  </P> <P> Emmanuel Larsuel  </P> <P> First grade  </P> <P> 6 years old  </P> <P> "You cook it in an oven. When it gets a little, little brown you take it out.  Then your friends come over, then you eat it."  </P> <P> Sarah Lavender  </P> <P> First grade  </P> <P> 6 years old  </P> <P> "Well, you put it on a tray, put some of that stuffing in it, then you put the  tray in the oven. You turn the timer like for 40 minutes or 50 minutes. When  the bell goes 'diiiiing,' then it's done and then you have turkey."  </P> <P> Liann Quintana  </P> <P> First grade  </P> <P> 6 years old  </P> <P> "You take out the buds and all the stuff that's inside it, clean it and you put  in a pot and put it in the oven. Then you check on it, and use the squeezer to  put all that juice on it. Then you put it back in the oven. Then you check it  again and do the same thing until it's done. Then you take it out."  </P></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Nordic markets hit by financial turmoil in Europe EUROPEAN financial turbulence swept northwards yesterday as Finland allowed the markka to be devalued and Sweden raised interest rates by 8 percentage points to 24 per cent to support the krona. Both moves were forced by lack of confidence on the foreign exchanges over economic policies in Sweden and Finland. The Finnish central bank's decision to end the markka's link to the European currency unit and allow it to float freely led to an effective devaluation of the markka by 13 per cent. The Bank of Sweden's action to raise its key short-term lending rate to a record level was an effort to forestall a further flight of speculative capital out of the krona. 'Finland's decision does not alter Swedish exchange rate policy,' said Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the Bank of Sweden. The bank would use every means at its disposal to defend the krona's exchange rate, he said. The Swedish minority coalition government also reaffirmed its policy of seeking further unpopular cuts in budget spending later this year. 'We are standing firm behind our existing economic policies,' said Mrs Anne Wibble, finance minister. She said that there were 'not any limits for how high the interest rate should go to defend the krona. What needs to be done will be done'. The moves, the latest sign of international currency unrest sparked by the weakness of the dollar and a surge of funds into the D-Mark, sparked opposite reactions on the Swedish and Finnish stock markets. The Helsinki stock exchange rose more than 5 per cent, buoyed by the relief the lower markka will bring to hard-pressed exporters. In Stockholm, the stock market fell 3 per cent as economists forecast that 1993 could bring a third successive year of falling economic output. Yesterday's action was accompanied by a sharp rise in interest rates in Norway where the central bank stressed that the krone would stay tied to the Ecu. Norway's short-term interest rates leapt to a near four-year high, with one-month rates up to 17.02 per cent from 13.44 per cent on Monday. Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, announced a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates on commercial loans and deposits from September 23. Yesterday's move by Finland seems likely to complicate its application to join the European Community later in the 1990s. The European Commission in Brussels said it 'regretted' the Finnish decision, noting that any candidate to join the EC's planned economic and monetary union had to stick to membership rules agreed at the Maastricht summit. Finland admitted that its commitment to align its economy more closely with the EC required it to restore a fixed exchange rate with other European currencies when the economic situation permitted. Mrs Sirkka Hamalainen, the Finnish central bank's governor, said she could not say how long the markka would be allowed to float. 'We will take a position on this issue when the financial markets have stabilised. It is clear, however, that this will not be a matter of days or weeks.'

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 7TH DISTRICT CANDIDATE DROPS OUT  </P> <P> A social worker pulled out of the race against Councilman Ernani Bernardi today  and endorsed the councilman's leading challenger, firefighter and community  activist Lyle Hall.  </P> <P> Richard Yanez, 28, a county psychiatric social worker who lives in Sylmar, said  he dropped his challenge to Bernardi because it became obvious "that Lyle Hall  is going to be the next councilman of the 7th District."  </P> <P> Yanez said he endorsed Hall because he was more responsive to community needs.  Bernardi has neglected some neighborhoods and has not helped residents campaign  against development, Yanez told a City Hall news conference. Bernardi was  attending a City Council meeting and was not immediately available for comment.  </P> <P> Yanez said he believed that Hall can beat Bernardi.  </P> <P> "I thought I had a chance, but I think his chance is better," Yanez said of  Hall.  </P></p>

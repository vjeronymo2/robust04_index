			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> 20 DIE IN KABUL SHELLING  </P> <P> Muslim guerrillas rained more than 50 rockets on Kabul, killing at least 20  people and wounding 51 in what appeared to be the most savage shelling of the  Afghan capital this year, according to government officials and hospital  workers. Among the facilities hit was an ammunition depot near Kabul's airport,  where witnesses had reported explosions and fire. Afghanistan's Supreme Defense  Council held emergency meetings to evaluate the attacks on Kabul, which has  come under increased shelling in the last week from the Muslim rebels fighting  to overthrow the pro-Soviet Afghan government.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Muhammad Kurayshan report from Tunis] </F>   [Text] The PLO Executive Committee is expected to resume  meetings in Tunis tomorrow. The Executive committee began its  meetings today under Yasir 'Arafat and in the presence of nine  of its members. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Bishop Iliya Khuri will  join them tomorrow.    Immediately after his return from Amman, 'Arafat submitted a  report on the atmosphere that prevailed over the signing of the  Cairo agreement on 4 May, particularly on the points of  differences that are still pending with the Israelis. 'Arafat  said these differences will be discussed within the next three  months.    According to informed sources here, 'Arafat denied at the  meeting that he had asked Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  to postpone the transfer of power in Gaza and Jericho until the  Palestinian side finds itself ready to do so.    The PLO Executive Committee discussed the configuration of  the Palestinian authority that will take charge of the autonomy  rule, which is expected to be equally divided between the  Palestinians inside and outside the [territories] under Yasir  'Arafat.    The formation of this authority is expected to be announced  here in Tunis in the next two days, at the end of the current  meetings. It seems that there is no dispute about the figures  from the territories, while viewpoints continue to be exchanged  concerning the figures from the diaspora [word indistinct] from  the PLO Executive Committee and Fatah Central Committee.    Ahmad Quray', Abu-'Ala', head of the PLO Economic  Department, will leave for Amman soon to inform the Jordanian  Government about the details of the economic agreement with  Israel and the scope of Jordanian-Palestinian coordination in  this field.</p>

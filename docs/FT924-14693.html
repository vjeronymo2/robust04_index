			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PLATINUM was fixed at its lowest level for nearly a month in London in the afternoon at Dollars 356.75 a troy ounce, before recovering ground to the Dollars 358 area in late trading. The market declined early on bearish technicals, but the fall gathered pace after sales by a US investment bank as traders focused on a deteriorating economic background. Dealers believe platinum now might be reflecting the falls in base metal markets, where prices have been depressed by fading hopes of global economic recovery. GOLD closed just ahead at Dollars 350.75 a troy ounce. The recent decline in LME BASE METALS showed some sign of petering out, which encouraged some modest buying to emerge, and prices closed mixed. But the trend mostly reflected short covering and technical buying, with consumer interests unwilling to chase the markets higher. COPPER finished steady, building on Tuesday's bounce off three-month lows, but showed little inclination to move significantly above Dollars 2,300 a tonne for three-month metal. Three-month ZINC moved back above Dollars 1,200 a tonne in the afternoon after briefly equalling Tuesday's seven-month low of Dollars 1,195 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Some reputable sources contacted by Angola Radio  Nacional here in Lusaka, who asked to remain anonymous, feel  that the latest offer made by the government, which has already  been presented to the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola [UNITA], reflects -- as has always been expressed by  Angolan authorities -- the personal commitment of engineer Jose  Eduardo dos Santos, president of the Republic, to reconciliation  and national unity.    These sources also say that the government offer should not  in any way be viewed as a weakness. On the contrary, they add,  it should be viewed by UNITA and its leader Jonas Savimbi, who  have claimed to be champions of peace and democracy, as a  realistic and beneficial stand for the nation. The figures  contacted by Angola Radio Nacional have called on the  international community to pressure UNITA to end the bloody war  that will have unforeseen consequences for the country.    Meanwhile, it is already known that, within the framework of  the national sensitization campaign and pacification of hearts,  the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel will continue to  broadcast in short wave, as an exception, for about 260 days  once a peace agreement is reached in Lusaka. After that date  and in accordance with the legislation in force, the UNITA radio  will become a depoliticized radio station, broadcasting in  adequate frequencies to be accorded to it.</p>

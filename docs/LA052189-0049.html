			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SECOND TIME AROUND  </P> <P> With his "Ghostbusters II" sidekicks -- Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Harold Ramis  -- getting the Stay-Puft share of glory, fourth Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson  insists: "I don't feel like an outsider."  </P> <P> The black graduate of Yale Drama School acknowledges that he's often overlooked  in media coverage, but adds, "There are a lot of reasons for that. They were  and are in different places in their careers. They've had more success than I  have. And in the first movie, the script established them as a unit before I  was brought in, as their employee."  </P> <P> Still, it took Hudson two-and-a-half years to find more movie work after  "Ghostbusters."  </P> <P> "You expect that when you do a film that's a major blockbuster, it will move  your career to another place, but that's not necessarily true." He did TV shows  and voice-overs before landing a role in "Weeds" with Nick Nolte, and has since  worked on "Leviathan" and other features.  </P> <P> Director Ivan Reitman was still doing re-shoots on "II" just two weeks ago,  Hudson said, and the four stars are still looping in dialogue.  </P> <P> "The movie will definitely be released June 16," Hudson added, "but I know Ivan  will be working on it up to the last minute."

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Ethics on the bottom line - Diary of a Private Investor WHAT is ethical? The difference between right and wrong. But what constitutes being wrong? Despite the ending of apartheid, some people still refuse to invest in companies with South African interests. But would it not be better to invest in South African companies which display an enlightened attitude towards black employees so that other companies may learn from their example? Do those people who still boycott South Africa also refuse to invest in other societies which have experienced racial conflicts? Should investment be made only in countries that are democratic? In that case, investment in Hong Kong should be avoided - although if Hong Kong had been run along democratic lines, perhaps it might not have prospered so quickly and dramatically and I would not have profited from my investments there. Indeed, a case could be made for investing (or not investing) in almost every country: there is probably something objectionable in all of them. As a private investor, I have no moral qualms about investing anywhere in the world - so long as the companies in which I invest are run on ethical lines and there are opportunities to make a profit. For some years, I refused to invest in companies which produced cigarettes, partly because I dislike people puffing smoke in my face and partly because I felt that, eventually, much tougher legislation or changes in social habits would cause a decline in such companies' profits (although, as yet, it has not happened). When I mentioned this to a friend she commented that, to be logical and consistent, I should also refrain from investing in supermarket groups that sold cigarettes and transport companies that helped to distribute them. And why, she asked, did I not also refrain from investing in companies dealing with alcoholic drinks? Perhaps I should reassess my investment criteria. I have avoided putting money into various 'ethical' unit trusts because some of their restrictions are not to my taste. A number of them refuse to invest in companies involved in the gambling industry. Yet, surely the stock market itself is a gamble. Should they also avoid investing in companies where the chairman or chief executive has a mistress on the basis that, if he lies to his wife, he might lie about the true state of the company? Personally, I ignore people's sexual peccadillos when making investment decisions. I am much more interested in their overall basic honesty. I can accept that bribes are necessary in some countries in order to do business and ought really to be regarded as 'advance commissions.' But if a UK company made such payments to someone for business in Britain, I would not invest in that company. People who are liars and cheats are usually poor at creating or running long-lasting businesses. That is why I avoided investing in companies run by Robert Maxwell. I keep a list of names of other people whose companies I avoid and have made sure that the executors of my will cannot invest with them. The laws of libel prevent me from disclosing this list. Companies that are slow to pay their bills are hardly encouraging their suppliers to provide the best quality and service. With such an attitude, might they not be equally 'tough' towards their customers? All this seems to me to be morally reprehensible and bad for long-term business, so I try to avoid making investments in such companies. I also dislike companies that have a discriminatory recruiting policy. People should be employed for their ability, not because of their age, sex, race, religion or who they know. Is a company that advertises for a financial analysis manager paying up to Pounds 50,000 plus benefits, but restricting applicants to those 'aged 28 to 33' (as did the Prudential in a recent advertisement), really doing its best to find the most capable person? Too many UK companies are stipulating ridiculous age ranges for job applicants. In the US, the American Age Discrimination Act allows people to sue for compensation for age discrimination. What is even worse is that Lautro (the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation) advertised recently for assistant enforcement officers, while the Securities and Investments Board wanted a senior policy assistant. Each regulatory board specified an age range of '25 to 35.' How can you have any confidence in the integrity and ethics of such organisations if they are prepared to practise such blatant discrimination? And will they really find the best candidates? Surely people with years of experience of City crooks might have something to offer. Dixons, the stores group, has agreed to fund a Pounds 1m chair in business ethics at the London Business School. I hope this will lead to further investigation of the morality of discrimination and its effects on company performance. Meanwhile, I will continue to refrain from investing in companies with discriminatory policies.</p>

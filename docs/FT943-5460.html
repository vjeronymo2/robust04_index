			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Balladur pledge on Renault sell-off as profits rise 125% Renault, the French car group, yesterday reported a 125 per cent rise in first half profits to FFr1.7bn (Pounds 200m). Though the increase was largely due to financial gains, it was well-timed to encourage the government to sell part of the state's stake in the group. At the same time, prime minister Edouard Balladur confirmed in a press interview that the state would retain a majority stake in the vehicle group after any privatisation. Indicating his desire to bring back under French control some or all of the 20 per cent stake held in Renault by Volvo of Sweden, he said: 'We will proceed progressively to make Renault French again, with the state retaining the majority.' The Renault group's turnover in the first half of this year was virtually unchanged at FFr89.9bn on the same period last year. This masked a 9 per cent increase in car sales in Europe, outstripping the general market rise of 6.8 per cent in registrations. Renault also enjoyed an 11.4 per cent increase in the turnover of its trucks in Europe and by its north American subsidiary. However, many of the cars sold in France and Spain were small ones, helped by special government incentives. These brought relatively little profit. In addition, the first half saw a 40 per cent collapse in sales in Turkey, which last year was Renault's third largest market worldwide. Renault dealers also reduced their stocks to an historic low by the end of June. Operating profit, therefore, amounted to FFr668m, compared with FFr774m in the first half of 1993. But net financial income rose to FFr640m in the first half as against only FFr160m a year earlier, chiefly from a FFr302m profit made on the partial sale of a Renault operation in Argentina and from a FFr488m profit made on last February's sale of some of Renault's shares in AB Volvo, the French car company's erstwhile partner. The Balladur government is due by mid-September to decide whether to put Renault or the Assurances Generales de France insurance group up for sale first. The government has already approved a specific privatisation decree for AGF, but has yet to do this for Renault. This week AGF announced an inopportune drop in first half net profits. See Lex</p>

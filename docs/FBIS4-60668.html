			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sharon Sade] </F>   [Text] The Defense Ministry is starting to implement a  plan to evacuate some 25 IDF [Israel Defense Forces] camps and  bases built on some 3,768 dunams. The land belongs to the  Israel Lands Administration, and half of it is located in urban  areas.    The defense establishment believes that the relocation will  cost over 500 million shekels and it wants the Treasury to fund  the move. At this stage, the defense establishment is focusing  on the evacuation of nine bases inside urban areas or close to  them in order to permit the Construction and Housing Ministry to  build apartments there. These bases are in 'Atlit, Nesher,  Jerusalem, Yoqne'am, and Haifa. The relocation of the  antiaircraft school from Herzliyya to the Negev was completed  several weeks ago and the Defense Ministry was paid 18 million  shekels for the move. The ministry also received 16 million  shekels to fund the transfer of warehouses from Yafo to Petah  Tiqva. The camps will be relocated by private firms.    Planning work will start soon on the evacuation of Army's  headquarters at Haqirya in Tel Aviv after it was agreed that the  Treasury would transfer some $1.5 million for the planning  stage. Defense Ministry sources believe that the cost of  evacuating the southern part of Haqirya, which is spread over  some 70 dunams, as well as the new construction work, will cost  some $100 million, and the process will last seven years. The  new construction will be on the land freed by the relocation of  the women's hospital at the Haqirya site.</p>

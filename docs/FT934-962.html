			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Housing 'set for further recovery' The housing market has been subdued over recent weeks but is poised for further recovery next year, a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors of more than 120 estate agents has found, Andrew Taylor writes. The institution said: 'Buyers were nervous in the run up to last month's Budget and the market - in spite of some flurries of activity - remains quiet in the approach to Christmas.' Although the market had improved in 1993 it was still being held back by too many sellers asking high prices. Almost 85 per cent of agents reported that prices had remained static in the past three months. Another 10 per cent reported price falls with just over 5 per cent reporting price increases.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pauline Green, leader of the UK Labour group at </F> the European Parliament: "Parliament Must Play to Its  Strengths"]    [Text] The votes have been counted. The new parliament  starts work on July 19. Can it make the most of its new powers?  Or will it sink into oblivion for the next five years?    The parliament has strengths and weaknesses, some not of its  own making. It must play to its strengths and try to eliminate  those handicaps that can be eliminated.    Some weaknesses are inherent. The need to work in nine (soon  12) languages means that debates will never have the cut and  thrust of the House of Commons.    Where the parliament does well, however, is in influencing  legislation and carrying out the nitty-gritty of parliamentary  scrutiny, shaping the budget and monitoring and questioning  civil servants' actions.    Every year the parliament adopts thousands of amendments to  draft legislation reshaping the laws that affect us in important  areas such as consumer protection, environmental standards,  social legislation, equal opportunities and banking. Through  its budgetary powers it redirects spending to priority areas.    Even before Maastricht reinforced its powers, most  parliamentary amendments ended up on the statute book in  directives and regulations adopted by the Council of Ministers.  Under Maastricht, important areas of legislation fall under the  "co-decision" procedure and are adopted jointly by parliament  and the Council. Parliament's influence on legislation can only  grow.    In particular, the right to say "no" -- to veto draft  legislation, to blow the whistle on behalf of our constituents -  will be crucial for the parliament's public perception.    Some national parliaments act virtually as a rubber stamp in  adopting legislation proposed by governments. In this respect,  the European Parliament does better than many national  parliaments.    National governments want parliament to continue with the  ludicrous system of spreading its activities over three  countries. Most parliamentary work is carried out in Brussels  but once a month the whole show moves to Strasbourg for plenary  sittings, and a large proportion of the secretariat is based in  Luxembourg.    Brussels should be the single site of parliament's  activities, close to the other institutions it has to  scrutinise, and in the same town as the European press corps,  representatives of interest groups and member states' embassies.    Another problem is that the treaties negotiated and ratified  by national governments now include far too many complex  procedures for involving parliament in European legislation.    The 1996 conference should seek to simplify and standardise  these rules by applying a streamlined co-decision procedure to  all areas where Council adopts legislation by a qualified  majority.    The press, too, having frequently pointed to parliament's  increased importance, must follow this up by increased coverage.    The parliament should also put its own house in order. A  good start was made last year with a complete overhaul of the  rules of procedure, allowing parliament to concentrate its time  on more important matters where it has power, to limit  possibilities for filibustering by small groups, and to improve  management.    In the new parliament, the centre-right will be far more  divided and fragmented, with an extreme right contingent  introducing instability and even conflict. Handling this will  present a challenge. Even more than in the past, the Socialist  group will have to lead the parliament despite the absence of an  overall majority for any group.    All in all, the new parliament has a good chance of using  its  new powers effectively. The big question is how national  governments will handle the 1996 constitutional revision. We  look forward to seeing how they face up to their  responsibilities.</p>

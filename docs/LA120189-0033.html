			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MALA NOCHE': FIRST FLUSH OF A LOVE FOR FILM  </P> <P> In "Mala Noche," screenwriter-director Gus Van Sant has made a movie about  passion that's actually passionate. Ardor is built right into the imagery.  </P> <P> Made in 1985 for $25,000, shot in black-and-white 16-millimeter film, this was  Van Sant's first feature (his second is the current critical hit "Drugstore  Cowboy") and it has the rapturous quality that debut films by highly talented  directors often have.  </P> <P> The ardor in this film (at the Nuart through Tuesday) isn't only in its love  story; it's also in Van Sant's experimental, poetic use of the medium. Maybe  that's why the doomed, unrequited romantic passion at its core nevertheless  seems weirdly, vibrantly hopeful. Van Sant can't pretend true nihilism because  he's too enraptured by the possibilities of his new-found art.  </P> <P> The unrequited passion is between Walt (Tim Streeter), who runs a Skid Row  convenience store in Portland, and Johnny (Doug Cooeyate), a Mexican boy in his  late teens. The down-and-outers who frequent Walt's store are a passing parade  of winos and derelicts, and yet he feels at home here. He walks the littered  streets like the neighborhood's self-appointed mayor.  </P> <P> Since Portland is also a faraway gathering place for young men who have crossed  the Mexican border illegally, Walt has a more than academic interest in  cruising its byways. The sullen unreachability of these drifters touches off in  him an obsessional quest for true love. Johnny, who taunts Walt's passion  without satisfying it, becomes Walt's fantasy dreamboat.  </P> <P> Adapting a semi-autobiographical novella by the Portland poet Walt Curtis, Van  Sant makes Walt's tantalization believable, but he also has the wit to show us  Johnny for what he really is -- that is, as less than a carnal deity. The film  is caught up in Walt's avid, half-mad pursuit without endorsing it.  </P> <P> Van Sant is also canny in the way he sets up the racial caste system between  Walt and Johnny and his friends. Low on the social ladder as he is, Walt  realizes he's still in a privileged position compared to the Mexican drifters,  who covet his conveniences. They covet them, and want to destroy them, too.  Joyriding in Walt's car, Johnny gleefully bangs it up. The Mexicans' contempt  for the gringo is mixed with cold calculation. At least one of the boys,  Roberto (Ray Monge), is willing to have sex with Walt in return for money and a  place to shack up. Johnny and Roberto's illusionless outlawry is their way of  both surviving the streets and one-upping the gringos, whose homosexuality they  abhor.  </P> <P> Tim Streeter, the only professional actor in the cast, is the ideal performer  for Van Sant. He embodies the film's intuitive shifts of mood -- you're never  quite sure what he's up to -- but he's also a recognizably grounded character.  A poetic shimmer may surround him, but he's for real. When he mouths broken  Spanish to his inamorata, his halting speech is meant to convey the genuineness  of his love. We can see how Walt survives his lustful obsession by delighting  in it. He's tickled by the sheer force of his own folly. His self-amazement is  implicitly narcissistic -- it's the source of his eroticized view of life.  </P> <P> It may be the source of Van Sant's view as well. In "Mala Noche," as in  "Drugstore Cowboy," Van Sant is working out of an exalted, self-reflective  mindscape. Everything he looks at -- a waterfall, clouds, the white line on the  highway reflected in a character's sunglasses -- has a mysterious, impacted  force, as if they were pieces in a dream mosaic.  </P> <P> At the same time, the characters are caught in a pop continuum not unlike  Godard's or Warhol's: restaurant neon signs, cigarette packs, product displays  all have talismanic import. There's something primitive yet deeply  sophisticated and modern about Van Sant's approach: He recognizes the emptiness  of the pop landscape but also understands how that emptiness validates people's  lives. In "Mala Noche" (Times-rated Mature for brief nudity and strong  language), emptiness is a kind of solace, a turn-on. In these lower depths, to  experience it is at least to know you're still kicking.  </P> <P> 'MALA NOCHE'  </P> <P> A Northern Film Co. production. Produced, written and directed by Gus Van Sant,  from the novella by Walt Curtis. Music Creighton Lindsay. Cinematography John  Campbell. Editor Van Sant. With Tim Streeter, Doug Cooeyate, Ray Monge.  </P> <P> Running time: 75 minutes.  </P> <P> Times-rated: Mature.  </P></p>

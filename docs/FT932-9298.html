			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / People: Smooth run at St Ives There will be plenty of corporate financiers in the City who will cast an envious glance at the ease with which 43-year-old Miles Emley has switched careers and landed the chairmanship of St Ives, one of the biggest and most successful companies in the international printing industry. It is less than a year since Emley, then head of corporate finance at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, was offered the job as deputy chairman of St Ives by the firm's founder, Bob Gavron. Emley didn't start until October, but yesterday he was promoted to chairman with immediate effect. Emley has spent most of his career as a merchant banker with N M Rothschild and it was whilst he was there that he helped bring St Ives to the stock market in 1985. Gavron says that Emley has been closely associated with the company ever since and has been consulted on all strategic decisions. Gavron says that he saw no reason to delay the handover once Emley had proved that he could fit in. Although Gavron insists that 'there is only room for one leader' at the top of St Ives, the new executive chairman will not be short of experienced boardroom colleagues to bounce ideas off. Gavron will remain on the board until he reaches normal retirement age in September 1995 and Brian Edwards, the group's 43-year-old managing director, has been with the group since 1978. Gavron admits that 'it will be very difficult to let go' of a company that he founded nearly 30 years ago, but is looking forward to spending more time on some of his other interests. He owns The Folio Society and Carcanet Press and is chairman of the Open College of the Arts. He has marked his decision to step down as chairman by cutting his family's stake in the business by nearly half. However, after the sale of 6.7m shares, the Gavron interests will retain 8.4 m shares, representing 8.5 per cent of the company. Gavron himself will remain the biggest shareholder and intends to hold his remaining 7m shares as a long term investment.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Vukovar's reluctant grave-digger: Melanie McDonagh visits the front line in Croatia and hears about the horrors of war PETER MAJIC is the nearest I have come to a Helot, the class of slaves the ancient Spartans made from the people they conquered. He is a Croat who was forced by the Serbs of Vukovar to become a grave-digger to dispose of the corpses produced in abundance by the siege of the city. His ordeal lasted 3 1/2 months. I met him in Osiek, just on the Croatian side of the front from Serb-occupied Vukovar. He lives with his wife at his brother-in-law's farm and helps with the work. The family all were there as he explained what had happened in an emphatic, although unemotional, voice. It began last year when Vukovar was being bombarded by the Yugoslav army. 'At that time,' Majic said, 'my family was staying in the cellar of our house. One day, three armed Serbs came to the door. 'Ustasha, Ustasha (the name of the Croatian fascists in the second world war), come out,' they said. So we came out. My son was the first. He stood on the steps of the house. We came out after him and one of the Serbs came up to him and shot him in the head. His brains went over his mother's arms.' I looked over at his wife. She had started to cry and she drew her hand down her sleeve, to show the place. 'Then they sent us back into the cellar. A few minutes later, they called us out again. When we came out, the house caught fire: they'd doused it with petrol.' 'Were they neighbours?' I asked. 'Yes,' he replied. Then he continued: 'We were taken to a cellar in another house before we were separated. She (his wife) was removed to Sremaska Mitrovica, a Serbian refugee camp. I was taken with two other Croats to another house. I was quite certain that I was going to be shot. But we were kept there, in a cellar that was always under a few centimetres of water. 'Every morning, we were taken out by armed men and brought to places where bodies lay. We had to dig graves: for men, women, children, pigs and cows. Some days, there would be 20 or 30 human bodies. But there were hundreds that were never buried: lying in the fields and in the woods. Some of the corpses were fresh, others a few days old. Most had been shot but many had had their throats cut. Some had been mutilated. I knew many of them. 'We worked every day, during rain or snow, even on our Christmas day. We had a glass of water to wash with, every day. I couldn't shave or wash my body. And I had only one shirt and trousers all those months. In my house, I used to have 80 shirts. 'When we began work, there were just four of us; by the end, there were 24. We didn't talk to each other much: we didn't trust each other. I owe my life to keeping my mouth shut. All the time, we were supervised by Serbs, some of them with Kalashnikovs. Once, when we had to shift coal from trucks - with our hands - we were guarded by women as well as men, with machine guns. 'A doctor came to Vukovar from Belgrade. He examined the corpses that we brought in and set down the causes of death in a big book. After a few weeks, he gave me leave to visit my sister in Belgrade.' He pulled out a plastic bag of papers and showed me his exit permit. 'I got to my sister by train and I think it was the happiest day of her life when she saw me. She is married to an Hungarian and her son and daughters are married to Serbs. They were all good to me.' While he was staying there, his wife wrote to say she had been freed in an exchange of prisoners and was in Zagreb, intending to go to her brother's house near Osiek. Majic decided to go there, too. 'I have bad dreams at night now,' he says. 'But I'd be mad by now if I hadn't had such good relations. Of course I want to go back to Vukovar. But not while the Serbs are there who have killed people. If we ever go back, only a few Serbs can stay in Vukovar, and even them I wouldn't look at.' After leaving Osiek, I went to Herzegovina to visit a refugee camp in the village of Posusje. The school had been taken over to house Moslem refugees from northern Bosnia. There were mattresses lined up in front of the blackboards, women in Turkish dress carrying laundry through the playground, people queueing in the caretaker's office to ask for tea or lavatory paper. The first woman I talked with came from the village of Korovac in Prijedor, northern Bosnia. Her son, a serious-looking 21, came over to join us. The village, he said, had been bombarded with grenades 24 hours a day before it was taken. It had housed a mixed population: 60 per cent Moslem, 15 per cent Croat, the rest Serb. The local Serbs had left to join the militia on the hills outside to help with the attack. When the Serbs finally entered the town, they were joined by 2,500 militia. First, they took the public buildings: the school, the town hall, the police station. The local Serbs went from house to house to those they knew would be armed and made them surrender the weapons. 'Why did the Serbs act that way?' I asked. The woman shrugged. 'They were normal people before,' she said. 'All of a sudden, they were abnormal.' During that time, the people got food from the Red Cross. 'But,' said the son, 'the humanitarian help went to the churches, and they were in the hands of the Chetniks (the universal, derogatory term for the Serbs). And they sold the food to the rest of us; only Serbs got it for nothing. I don't suppose the International Red Cross knew what was going on.' The only information they got was from the Serbian-controlled local radio. From this, they learnt about three villages where massacres of Moslems had taken place: Hrustovo, Vrhpolje and Mahala. 'We were afraid,' said the mother. Her son added: 'The Serbs went from house to house and they made people sign papers giving up their house or their business. We had to pay to sign the papers. All these people had been our neighbours. There was one man, he'd been my best friend at school.' The son was then taken away to a camp. He said: 'It was terrible. They took wet sand in stockings and hit people, or they used iron bars. I was beaten. There was nothing to eat. In two days, I got a slice of bread and a glass of water. We were kept in hangars, or an empty company warehouse. There were always 200-300 of us, but the people kept changing. Some were taken to a bigger camp, some were deported or killed. It was anyone the Serbs had a grudge against. 'The UN came once to see the camp. But the Serbs knew they were coming and we were shifted to another warehouse until they left. The UN doesn't see anything and it doesn't want to see anything.' 'Would you go back home?' I asked. He nodded. 'But only with a weapon in my hand. First I need a doctor, then a gun.' 'You couldn't live with those neighbours again, could you?' I asked. He looked at me. 'When I go back, there won't be any neighbours. My hands are going to be red with blood to the elbow.' In a nearby classroom, I found a small group of women; one was holding a baby. They had come from the same village: Biscani, in Prijedor. The most articulate of them was Emina Mrkalj, a remarkably resilient woman of 38. Her story was familiar: the village had been bombarded before being occupied and the local Serbs had collaborated with militia outside. But, on the local radio, they announced a 'cleansing.' Only suspected people would be taken away but everyone must stay in their houses and all Moslems must put a white flag on their roofs. Whenever they left their houses, they had to carry a white cloth. Emina said: 'The Serbs went from house to house and called the men out. Nearly all of them were taken 150 metres from the houses to the market place. The women followed - some lived close enough to watch from their windows. We saw everything. We saw them falling, one after the other. It was a massacre. Their eyes were gouged out. We saw the dead bodies on top of each other, beside each other. Each of us looked for her own husband.' Emina went on: 'After they were finished shooting, the children started to cry for their fathers. The Chetniks came back and said we'd all be killed if the children didn't stop, if we didn't bring them everything we had. The children had dreadful fear of the Chetniks. They threatened them and said awful things. 'We weren't allowed to take the bodies away. The bodies were there for five days, and on the fifth day they brought a lorry and they took them to the rubbish dump. But one night I went out and wrapped my husband's body in a sheet, and my neighbour's husband's body. During those five days they raped women, and beat them. Often, when they raped a woman they would kill her.' The Serbs from outside came from two corps: from Banja Luka and Knin. The worst of them were the Red Berets, soldiers with red headbands or emblems. 'They said they had orders to kill us,' Emina said. 'They called it, always, cleansing.' Later, she was made to join a convoy. 'We were taken to the Dead Zone the mined area between the opposing fronts) and we and the rest of the convoy had to walk across on foot. Many people had to. On the edge of the Dead Zone, the men with us were taken to one side and shot, the fittest-looking ones. Our luggage was taken from us and strewn everywhere. On the Dead Zone, you see many dead bodies. We had to walk three kilometres to the other front, where the Bosnian Guard looked after us. From there, we walked another 22 kilometres to safety.' Emina's narrative was not concise but her story was borne out by the others. (One woman said that when she crossed the Dead Zone, she had seen a mother and child killed after stepping on a mine). Emina was astonishingly unemotive as she told the story: probably, she had been through it many times before. Her mother wasn't so composed, though. I went over to shake the old lady by the hand and she cried and cried.</p>

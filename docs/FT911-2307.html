			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Walesa signals change of heart on economy POLAND'S president, Mr Lech Walesa, yesterday postponed a meeting of economists organised by his advisory council in a move which indicates his backing for the government's economic policies. The meeting, due to take place on May 6, was widely seen as an attempt to force a change in the government's anti-inflation economic policies engineered by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the deputy prime minister. Mr Walesa made the decision after holding talks yesterday morning with met Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the prime minister. His decision followed a report issued last week by the government's Central Planning Office. It warned that Poland's gross domestic product could fall this year by up to 5 per cent, the rate of inflation would exceed 80 per cent, the trade deficit would reach Dollars 2.1bn and unemployment would edge towards 2m.</p>

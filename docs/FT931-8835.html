			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Money Markets: European futures rise EUROPEAN futures markets were buoyed by yesterday's news that German civil servants are to receive a lower than expected wage increase next year. Mr Hermann Otto Solms, parliamentary leader of the Liberal Free Democrats, said civil servants would get a pay rise of 3 per cent to take effect from May 1. This was less than the market had expected and prompted an 8 basis-point gain in the March Euromark contract as dealers weighed up the possibility that the Bundesbank might cut rates earlier than expected. The December French franc contract rose by about 6 basis points. The small rally was given an extra boost by a market rumour that the Bundesbank would surprise everyone by announcing a rate reduction at its council meeting tomorrow, and that the next set of money supply figures would be towards the bottom end of the central bank's target range. German call money rates were tighter, however, as strong outflows of funds for tax payments continued to drain liquidity from the country's money market. In the UK, short sterling futures stood on the sidelines, trading in a very narrow range, while longer dated interbank rates were virt-ually unchanged on the day. However, this inactivity masked some stickiness in Bank of England operations, where the failure to remove a large liquidity shortage pushed overnight rates to above 6 per cent. In the morning the Bank announced a Pounds 950m forecast liquidity shortage, but did not operate in the early round. A squeeze on rates at the short end continued when the Bank revised the shortage upwards to Pounds 1.05bn but removed only Pounds 50m. Tensions were eased in the afternoon when the Bank more than removed the shortage by purchasing Pounds 1.01bn of bills. The overnight rate then dropped back to below 6 per cent. Some dealers speculated that the Bank was underlining its desire to support sterling at current levels by deliberately keeping liquidity tight, but others said the failure to remove the shortage in the morning reflected reluctance among money market practitioners to part with paper. The March short sterling contract stood at around 94.05 at the close. Mr Nick Parsons, economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said he expected to see the contract drift lower to around 93.82 over the next few weeks as prospects for a pre-Budget rate cut receded.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: USAir warns of return to red in third quarter USAIR yesterday warned of further cost-cutting and 2,500 more job losses. The carrier said weak revenues over the summer had reversed its fragile return to profitability of the second quarter. The company said that, after a one-off charge of Dollars 75m, it would report a pre-tax loss of Dollars 180m for the third quarter. This compares with a pre-tax profit of Dollars 5.8m (and net loss of Dollars 12.6m) in the second three months of the year. It also repeated a warning that it would report a net loss for 1993 as a whole, and an operating loss for the year. The projected losses had prompted the airline, in which British Airways has a minority stake, to take steps to cut Dollars 200m from its costs next year, said Mr Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive. 'Consumers are becoming increasingly price-sensitive, and we are witnessing a resurgence of low-fare competition from airlines whose cost structures enable them to offer the lower prices that consumers demand,' he said. The airline said it planned to cut 2,500 full-time jobs by the middle of next year, and that the costs of this would be reflected in its third-quarter results. A retroactive accounting change for post-retirement benefits would result in a charge of Dollars 44m for the year, the company added. The renewed cost-cutting efforts failed to lift USAir's share price yesterday. After falling by Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 12 3/8 in early trade, they closed unchanged at Dollars 12 5/8.</p>

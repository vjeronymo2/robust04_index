			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cluff Resources cuts losses Cluff Resources, the mining group which yesterday reported a reduced loss of Pounds 218,000 for 1993, expects to join the world's top 50 gold groups in 1995-96 by producing more than 130,000 troy ounces a year. Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said: 'I am confident that we are at the threshold of a substantial improvement in our group's fortunes.' There were losses of Pounds 2.54m in 1992, re-stated to take account of its recent acquisition of Aberfoyle, which has agricultural and industrial interests in Zimbabwe. Cluff produced 59,860 ounces of gold last year, down from 72,238 in 1992, primarily because of a mill breakdown at the Freda Rebecca mine in Zimbabwe. Mr Cluff said output would bounce back to between 70,000 and 76,000 ounces this year. Full production at the recently-acquired Ayanfuri mine in Ghana should start at an annual rate of 30,000 ounces in 1995. Cluff's new gold loan - Zimbabwe's first - carrying interest at 5.6 per cent would cut interest payments substantially this year after a jump from Pounds 631,000 to Pounds 1.41m last year. Net losses were Pounds 762,000 (Pounds 3.94m) or 1p (5.4p) a share. The company is not paying a dividend for the third successive year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 11 Jan -- Anatoliy Shybiko, deputy chairman of  the Ukrainian Republican Party, noted in an interview with a  UNIAR correspondent that without having in front of him the  agreement on liquidating Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and without  understanding its point, it would be premature to give a  preliminary assessment of this agreement. In his opinion, a  final assessment of the agreement should be given only after a  text of the agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and the United  States becomes available. Mr. Shybiko is deeply convinced that  Ukraine should remain a nuclear state for the near future and  should accede to the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons as a nuclear state.</p>

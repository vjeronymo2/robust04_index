			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of information and culture, Professor  Jerry Gana, has urged Nigerians not to heed the stay at home  call by a group of democracy campaigners over the present fuel  scarcity. He told newsmen in Minna, Niger State, today that  such a call was illegal and unpatriotic.    Prof. Gana stated that there would be chaos if people obeyed  calls by any group to stay away from work, stressing that it was  a sign of indiscipline. The minister also pointed out that if  the call was adhered to it would worsen the fuel scarcity as  those in that sector would stay at home.    Prof. Gana appealed to the group to give the government a  chance to put things right.</p>

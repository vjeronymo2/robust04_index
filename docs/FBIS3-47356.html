For any bonds the government might float to pay for a tax  cut, "a firm guarantee of repayment that everyone can  understand" is necessary, Fujii told a regular press conference.    The timing must be concrete and dealt with in the same  legislation as the income tax cut, he said.    Fujii seemed to leave open the possibility that the debt  from  an income tax cut could be covered by funding means other than a  consumption tax hike, which socialists in the ruling coalition  oppose.    "I have never used the term `consumption tax,'" he said, but  he praised a report by the government's Tax Commission, which  calls for reducing the income tax burden and increasing direct  taxation, which includes the consumption tax.    He said government and ruling coalition party leaders have  not discussed specifics of funding an income tax cut.</p>

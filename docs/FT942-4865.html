			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Cheap flowers grow out of the long recession: Japanese are increasingly price conscious On any typical Sunday, a strip along Route 246 just south of the Tama river is lined with cars blocking the traffic heading out of Tokyo to the countryside. The congestion is caused by shoppers who come to World Flower, a discount flower shop, in search of potted lilies, roses and orchids which are sold at 50-80 per cent discounts on retail prices seen in the countless, independent flower shops throughout the country. Back north across the river, a men's apparel shop advertises T-shirts for Y490 (Pounds 3.12), one-tenth the price at a posh Tokyo department store. Gone are the days when high prices were assumed to equate with better quality and stores competed to flaunt extravagance. Instead, value-for-money is what today's consumers look for; bargain-hunting has become acceptable. 'Consumers have become very sensitive to prices, there is no doubt about that,' says Mr Hideaki Yajima at Jusco, a leading supermarket operator. The Japanese media is calling it a revolution in values, as consumers discover for the first time that the high prices of goods, many of which have long been fixed across the nation, can actually fall as a result of market forces. While the greater price-consciousness has its roots in the country's long recession, it has been sanctioned by recent government pronouncements on the need to bring down Japan's high consumer prices. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata pointed to the huge differentials between prices in Japan and other industrialised countries, and called for government action to reduce the disparity by half, mainly by deregulating markets and improving access to imports. His stance echoes Japanese government policy in the mid-1980s when foreign pressure on Japan to reduce its current-account surplus by stimulating the domestic economy led to similar railing against Japan's high prices and calls for deregulation and market-opening steps. But this time, developments in the market place and social changes are making it likely the trend towards lower prices will run deeper and wider than before. Apart from the large number of discounters sprouting throughout Japan, supermarkets are going all out to cut prices to remain competitive. They are developing their own-brands and relying more on imports, often cheaper than domestic products. The spread of low-priced imported goods has hit the prices of domestic goods. The popularity of low-priced imported beer has been a factor behind a recent price-war involving domestic beer, formerly sold at the same price everywhere in the country. Aggressive price-cutting by retailers has more than wiped out a recent rise in the beer tax and Jusco says beer sales went up 30-50 per cent last month as a result. A survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry shows the prices of many goods are actually lower than conventional retail price figures would suggest, as a result of widespread price cuts and the growing availability of low-priced goods. At the same time, consumer perceptions about what constitutes a reasonable price for products have changed dramatically since the bubble years when people thought nothing of paying Y1,000 for a 100-gramme steak or a bouquet of three roses. Spreading awareness among the Japanese public that cheaper imported goods are just as good as those made at home has helped change views of how much certain goods should cost. With a record number of Japanese travelling abroad, there is also a wider familiarity with overseas prices and a greater reluctance to pay more for the same goods at home. Another development likely to ensure the trend for lower prices sticks is the change seen among Japanese manufacturers. Japanese brewers are tying up with foreign partners in a bid to lower their costs. Hitachi, the electronics company, is considering launching a range of low-price consumer electronics with simpler functions, allowing the company to reduce costs. Car makers such as Toyota are also launching value-for-money cars which have trimmed the fancy gadgets to reduce costs. 'Lower prices are no longer just a passing trend,' asserts Mr Yajima. 'They are common sense.'</p>

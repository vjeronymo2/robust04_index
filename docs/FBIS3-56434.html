			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sergey Shatunov, including recorded excerpts of </F> resignation announcement by First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor  Gaydar to journalists in Moscow today; from the "Novosti"  newscast]    [Excerpt] [Shatunov] [passage omitted] It was precisely the  wish to concentrate fully on parliamentary work and  dissatisfaction with recent government decisions and the way the  council of ministers was functioning in general that prompted  Yegor Gaydar to make a sensational announcement today.    [Gaydar] The government has of late and with increasing  frequency been adopting decisions with which I was either not  acquainted or against which I categorically objected. I shall  cite just two typical examples -- I could cite more.    [Shatunov] The first was the decision to expand the ruble  zone and have a joint monetary system with the Republic of  Belarus. The second, the decision to build a new parliamentary  center in the center of the capital.    [Gaydar] Accordingly, I have decided to decline the offer  made to me and not accept the post of first deputy chairman of  the government in its reorganized form.    I know that Social Welfare Minister Ella Aleksandrovna  Pamfilova has said that in this situation she cannot accept  responsibility for the social policy being implemented, just as  I cannot answer for the economic policy being implemented.    Today we discussed the issue at the board of our  parliamentary faction. The board backed our decision and  expressed its readiness for constructive dialogue and  cooperation with the government. We are ready to support the  government in all its constructive initiatives and endeavors.  We shall continue to support the reform policy pursued by the  president, but at the same time we must make clear our position  regarding decisions, the political decisions, which we cannot  support or adopt.</p>

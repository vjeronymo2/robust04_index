			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SUNDAY SILENCE IS FAVORED IN TODAY'S $1-MILLION SUPER DERBY  </P> <P> Trainer Charlie Whittingham leads Sunday Silence back to the races today in the  $1-million Super Derby, intent on ending Easy Goer's unopposed dash to the  horse-of-the-year award.  </P> <P> "The only chance we have to get horse of the year would be win this race and  the Breeders' Cup," Whittingham said.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence, who lost two straight after beating Easy Goer in the Kentucky  Derby and Preakness, is expected to be an odds-on favorite in the field of  eight for the Super Derby over 1 1/4 miles at Louisiana Downs in Bossier City,  La.  </P> <P> The second favorite is expected to be another Phipps colt, Awe Inspiring. Also  in the field will be Le Voyageur, Big Earl, Dale's Shotgun, Bruho and Harmony  Creek.  </P> <P> Open Mind, winner of 10 consecutive stakes for 3-year-olds, will race against  older horses for the first time in the Ruffian Handicap over 1 1/8 miles today  at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y.  </P> <P> The field of six will include two 5-year-old mares, Bayakoa and Miss Brio.  Bayakoa has won four Grade I stakes this year; Miss Brio won the Maskette on  Sept. 9 at Belmont and has beaten Bayakoa twice.  </P> <P> Saturday, Yankee Affair swung wide to gain the lead after entering the stretch  and won the $470,400 Man O'War Stakes for 3-year-olds and up at Belmont. Yankee  Affair returned $8.20, $4.60 and $3.80.  </P> <P> One Drink came from far back and then drew away to win the $53,300 Derby Trial  Stakes for 3-olds by 3 3/4 lengths at Fairplex Park in Pomona. One Drink  covered the 1 1/16 miles in 1:43.  </P> <P> One Drink paid $10.80, $5.60 and $3.20.  </P></p>

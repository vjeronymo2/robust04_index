			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Text] A large shipment of the synthetic drug known as  "crystal," worth nearly $1 million on the drug black market in  the United States, was seized by Federal Judicial Police [PJF]  personnel assigned to Baja California State [BCS]. The PGR's  [Attorney General's Office] branch agency in the state reported  that, during the operation, three presumed drug traffickers were  captured with the drug while attempting to reach the city of San  Jose, in the state of California.    Information provided by the Federal Judicial Police General  Directorate, headed by Commander Adrian Carrera Fuentes, reveals  that members of the force succeeded in arresting three subjects  identified as Xavier Madriz Hernandez and the sisters Maria and  Veronica Rios Chacon. They were leaving the ferry Azteca,  arriving from the port of Mazatlan, Sinaloa, at the Pichilingue  marine terminal in La Paz.    Personnel under orders from the PJF deputy commissioner in  the state, Manuel Ramirez Cardoso, began a routine inspection of  the vehicle being driven by those now indicted: a 1987 Mazda  pickup truck with Washington, D.C., plates No. 8574J1. Upon  opening the vehicle's hood, they discovered a special  compartment, especially designed to carry drugs and narcotics,  in its lower part, directly below the windshield wiper area.    Inside the compartment the PJF agents found 13 packages of  various sizes containing the narcotic, with a gross weight of 13  kg and 700 grams. It was identified as "crystal," a drug known  as one of the laboratory type, and highly toxic.    According to the statements made to the public prosecutor by  the accused, entered in preliminary investigation 99/02/94, the  presumed drug traffickers purchased the narcotic in the town of  Tacapaltepec, Michoacan. They later moved it to the port of  Mazatlan, where they boarded the ferry taking them to La Paz,  Baja California Sur. They told the Federal Public Prosecutor's  Office that they intended to travel by land from that area to  the border at Tijuana, subsequently entering the town of San  Jose, California.    In this connection, the PGR's representative in the state,  Irma Garcia de Cuevas, stressed that "crystal," owing to its  chemical composition per se, is a drug creating physical and  psychological addiction from the first time that it is consumed.  It also causes lack of appetite, hallucinations, and toxic  psychosis. She concluded by noting that, had it reached its  destination, it would have commanded a price of nearly $1  million. Meanwhile, those now indicted will be placed at the  disposal of the pertinent district judge of criminal  proceedings. They will be tried based on their presumed guilt of  committing crimes against health in the form of drug  transportation and possession.</p>

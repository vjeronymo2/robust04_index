			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Revival of CrossRail moves a step closer The revival of a bill promoting the Pounds 2bn London CrossRail project moved a step closer last night when a motion backed by more than 250 MPs was tabled by a Conservative backbencher. The motion - tabled by Mr David Lidington, MP for Aylesbury - called for the bill to be recommitted to the four-strong private bill committee, which last month dealt the project a surprise blow by turning it down. The motion, also urging that the committee be instructed to reconsider its decision, is expected to be called in the Commons early next week. By this time it may have gained the support of even more MPs. The unusually heavy cross-party backing for the motion appears to give it a reasonable chance of success. Conservative whips gave permission for parliamentary private secretaries, who as part of the government 'payroll vote' normally do not get involved, to sign it. Liberal Democrat MPs are also among the signatories, as are Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, and Mr John Prescott, the Labour leadership candidate and employment spokesman. The CrossRail proposal, which has the backing of British Rail and London Underground, calls for an east-west underground rail link to be built in the capital.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Criticism of Sunday trade rules is rejected MR PETER Lilley, trade and industry secretary, yesterday rejected suggestions that restrictions on Sunday trading in England and Wales had been made unenforceable by a Court of Appeal decision on Tuesday. Mr Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP for Southend East and an opponent of the subordination of UK law to edicts from the European Community, complained in the Commons that the Appeal Court's ruling had created fresh uncertainty. The court lifted injunctions banning B&amp;Q, the do-it-yourself chain, and Wickes Building Supplies from opening stores in West Yorkshire and Somerset on Sundays. After the ruling, a lawyer for Kirklees Borough Council in West Yorkshire, one of the councils involved, said the ruling made the Sunday trading laws 'virtually unenforceable'. Mr Taylor yesterday called on the government to advise shopkeepers whether or not they were entitled to open on Sundays, and to inform local authorities whether they were able to implement the law approved by parliament. Mr Lilley said he understood that the decision concerned only the question of whether local authorities should give undertakings to the court to back injunctions sought to prohibit Sunday trading. 'If that is right the decision would not appear to cast doubt on Justice Hoffman's decision last year that the 1950 Shops Act was not incompatible with the Treaty of Rome', he said. He concluded that the Appeal Court's decision represented no change 'in the underlying law' in England and Wales.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Drucker ideas not such a rosy prospect Sir, Perhaps Samuel Brittan has read something in Peter Drucker's latest venture, Post Capitalist Society, which I missed - as the conclusions which he draws from the work seem very optimistic ('Aim at the climate, not the weather', September 5). If Drucker is read in conjunction with Beyond the Limits, by Meadows and Meadows - inspired by the Club of Rome - the idea of market forces prevailing in a world where global communications has produced ungovernable and perhaps, despite what Drucker suggests, unmanageable superstates is not such a rosy prospect.

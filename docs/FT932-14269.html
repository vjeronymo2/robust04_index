			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Ulster terrorism plans attacked THE GOVERNMENT has become embroiled in a row with its main statutory advisory body on human rights in Northern Ireland over proposals aimed at combating terrorist-linked racketeering in the construction industry. A document by the Northern Ireland Office proposes a package of measures including the issuing of identity cards for building workers, a special licensing scheme for construction companies, new powers for customs officers and Inland Revenue inspectors, and a widening of emergency anti-terrorist legislation. The NIO estimates that the IRA raises more than Pounds 2m a year through construction industry-related tax fraud and extortion. It emerged yesterday that the proposals have been the subject of heated correspondence between the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights and the NIO after the government bypassed the commission in an initial consultation exercise at the beginning of February. The commission learned about the proposals last month from Mr Kevin McNamara, the Labour spokesman on Northern Ireland, only after the plans had in turn been leaked to him through a third party unconnected with the government. The NIO said: 'The consultative exercise has gone well, and when it is concluded ministers will be informed of its outcome and invited to consider the way forward.' This was disputed yesterday by members of the commission, who indicated that the consultation had strained relations with the NIO. The government is also facing opposition not to the principle of combating terrorist funding but the way it is proposing to deal with the problem from bodies which were initially consulted on both sides of industry. Mr Nigel Smyth, the CBI's Northern Ireland director, said the working paper implied excessive regulation which could unfairly discriminate against small and medium-sized companies. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions said the proposals had civil liberty implications and were in part impractical. The high cost of fighting terrorism has left the Royal Ulster Constabulary short of cash and diverting funds from reserves set aside for buying vital computer equipment, senior police sources in the province said yesterday. The overtime bill for the last financial year was nearly Pounds 70m.</p>

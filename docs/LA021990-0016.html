			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEWS;  </P> <P> VALEDICTORIES OF VERDI AND PUCCINI;  </P> <P> 'TURANDOT': AFTER A DECADE'S TRAVEL, ALLEN CHARLES KLEIN'S CONTROVERSIAL  VERSION OF PUCCINI'S CHINESE TALE ARRIVES IN ORANGE COUNTY.  </P> <P> Reviled and controversial when it first appeared in the early 1980s (San  Francisco Opera first saw it in the summer of 1982, after it had already  visited Dallas, Houston and Miami), Allen Charles Klein's Disneyesque  production of Puccini's "Turandot" has traveled much, to a mixed reception,  ever since.  </P> <P> Over the weekend, it arrived in Costa Mesa, just a few miles from the real  Fantasyland in Anaheim, where it would surely fit right in. The decade-old  production, more cartoony than legendary, still evokes more the ambience of  mid-20th-Century Hollywood than ancient Peking, more Terry and the Pirates than  Old China.  </P> <P> In the welcoming atmosphere of Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing  Arts Center, however, it looks like an unimaginative opera-lover's dream  version of Puccini's final opera. And, as such, it was cheered enthusiastically  by the dressed-to-kill, opening-night crowd on Friday.  </P> <P> Around this sometimes overwrought production, softened in some of its details  -- at one time, the Emperor's beard was reportedly 12 feet long, for instance  -- Opera Pacific has gathered respectable musical forces to essay Puccini's  demanding score. Those forces have been given effective and canny stage  direction by Matthew Lata. At the first performance, the large cast gave a more  than adequate representation -- using the abridged Act III finale written by  Franco Alfano.  </P> <P> Looking genial and relaxed, Louis Salemno also conducted Act I without  particular urgency; he was seconded rather half-heartedly by everyone on the  packed Segerstrom stage.  </P> <P> Salemno &amp; Co. seemed to come to life as the action of the opera progressed;  by the time the controversial Alfano music arrived, genuine energy had gripped  all hands. Even earlier, after it had warmed up, the orchestra, whose roster  lists a number of familiar names, gave Salemno full value for his urgings.  </P> <P> Trained by Michael Carson, the large chorus -- twice as large as the "Traviata"  chorus heard last month -- sang lustily and with healthy sounds, but seemed  underpowered, not only in the first act, where everyone was tentative, but  later as well.  </P> <P> The principals also bloomed late. Johanna Meier's supremely vulnerable Princess  -- she seemed to melt before our eyes in Act III -- began badly, with an "In  questa reggia" so effortful and wobbly it put the remainder of the opera in  question.  </P> <P> Immediately after, Meier appeared to recover, and from then on she integrated  text and tone beautifully, giving all the while an object lesson in operatic  acting. Meier is a valuable Turandot.  </P> <P> Lando Bartolini, remembered from some mediocre New York City Opera performances  at our Music Center a decade ago, proved this time around a worthy and  admirable Calaf, one of reliable and ringing high notes, a manly, reassuring  presence and utter stage-confidence. Rank pretty, vocally ordinary Maria  Spacagna among the standard wimpy and unfaceted Lius of the world; she moves  nicely, sings well and is eminently forgettable.  </P> <P> For all his vocal roundness, Herbert Perry impersonated a stock and  undistinctive Timur. But Ping, Pang and Pong, in the bright and resourceful  trio of Ron Baker, Darren Keith Woods and Jonathan Green, made Act II, for  once, a treat instead of a snore. Among the others, there were no standouts.  </P></p>

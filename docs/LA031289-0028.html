			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV VIEWERS RISE UP TO DEFEND THE 'MARRIED' LIFE  </P> <P> Rakolta is concerned about my family. And I am concerned about hers. When a TV  show (or record or book for that matter) can disrupt family relationships, that  demonstrates a shortcoming in the family, not in the TV show.  </P> <P> Rakolta and her partners in spirit (Jerry Falwell, Tipper Gore, etc.), must be  very insecure in their values if they fear that a TV show is going to turn  their children into social liabilities.  </P> <P> I am sick of right-wing fundamentalists trying to deny me my choice of  entertainment.  </P> <P> PETE GRELLA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

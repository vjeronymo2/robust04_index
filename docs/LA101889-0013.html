			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICARE SURTAX  </P> <P> An ugly chapter in history is continuing to unfold in our country. Our  congressional "leaders" jumped again onto the greed bandwagon.  </P> <P> In acceding again to special interests they decided to give big tax breaks to  the mainly wealthy and to put more of our elderly into financial and emotional  turmoil by cutting back catastrophic care benefits.  </P> <P> Albeit our senators appear to be less inclined to jump on the greed wagon, they  are certainly pushing it firmly. Leadership is failing our country as  politicians continually bend to dollar-dictated ideas rather than humanistic  ideals.  </P> <P> SANFORD DuROFF  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Property: So nice to be beside the seaside - Water views remain a big selling point MARINE Drive at Barton-on-Sea, Hampshire, is the typical seaside address on the south coast of England. It began in the 1930s as ribbon development along the clifftop road between Lymington and Bournemouth, filling the gap between Old Milton and New Milton with houses and bungalows enjoying views across Christchurch Bay and the Solent to the Needles in the east and Old Harry rocks in the west. There are always houses for sale here at the best of times, but these days there are more than usual, often placed with more than one agent in the hope of attracting more interest. One such is 7 Marine Drive, built recently in what the owner calls the 'English Riviera style,' with white stuccoed walls, round-headed windows and red-tiled roofs. This five-bedroom home is on offer at Pounds 295,000 through Lane Fox's Bournemouth office (tel: 0202-557 766) and the New Milton office of Murray &amp; Morris (0425-638 656). A few doors away, at 12 Marine Drive, is one of the original 1930s' properties. Mullion Cottage is a four-bedroom, tile-hung house for which Murray &amp; Morris is asking Pounds 299,000. The same agent has several other houses on its books in Marine Drive and its extensions east and west, including one five-bedroom property in Marine Drive West that has just been repossessed for the second time in 18 months. At Pounds 175,000, it is clearly the bargain of Barton. 'The second-home market dried up in 1988, but the cachet of a sea view has held good right through the recession,' says M&amp;M's James Murray. 'The greater supply means that a purchaser can pick up a good buy when it comes round. At Marine Prospect, a new development on the site of the Red House Hotel, two-bedroom flats start at Pounds 65,000.' Stephen Noble, of Lane Fox, agrees about the importance of sea views, but adds: 'Many flats and houses in Bournemouth are now changing hands at figures that are, in some cases, half what they were at the peak.' Some of the best houses in Bournemouth were built on the Cooper-Dean estate on the West Cliff. Many of these have been converted into flats but one of the original houses, built in 1910, survives: Strath Avon, in West Overcliff Drive, now a comfortable four-bedroom house with two self-contained flats for staff, family or visitors. Offers of Pounds 595,000 are being invited by Lane Fox and the Wimborne office of Savills (0202-887 331). Poole is to Bournemouth what Hove is to Brighton - the quieter resort. One of the best addresses in Poole is Sandbanks, a peninsula dividing the harbour from Poole bay where the Bournemouth office of Savills (0202-298 585) has what it calls 'marine residences' at prices up to Pounds 1m. Another good address is Canford Cliffs, where Savills has a three-bedroom bungalow at Pounds 395,000. Lane Fox and Savills also are agents for Saltings, a new development on the clifftop in Cliff Drive, where three- bedroom flats are for sale from Pounds 235,000-285,000. In the Lymington area, some of the most expensive properties are being offered by Paul Jackson (0590-674 411). He is asking Pounds 595,000 for the five-bedroom Lea House, in seven acres, which was on the market at Pounds 900,000 in 1991 and has views across the Solent to the Isle of Wight. At Old Bosham, in West Sussex, unsuspecting motorists who park on the front and return to find the water lapping around their car soon discover that this is where King Canute failed to command the waves. One of the four-bedroom modernised fishermen's cottages in Mariners Terrace is for sale at Pounds 180,000 through Henry Adams &amp; Partners, of Chichester (0243-533 377). Richard Etherington, an unconventional agent at Petworth (07985-222), publishes a chatty newsletter called The Nibbler in which he detects 'some small sign of recovery in the market' with buyers competing against each other again. If this is so, can gazumping be far away? He is offering a four-bedroom house at the end of a cul-de-sac close to the beach on the private Middleton estate at Middleton-on-Sea, near King George V's recuperative Bognor Regis. Built in the 1920s, but extended and modernised by the owners, Etherington says it is 'priced to sell' at Pounds 245,000. There are seaside properties for sale all over Britain. A computer search by Bedrock International (071-351 2625), an up-market new agency in Chelsea that acts for buyers, produced 46 coastal properties at prices from Pounds 195,000 to Pounds 4m. The cheapest was Highbury, a four-bedroom Victorian house at Northam, north Devon, with views across Bideford Bay, for which the joint agents are Strutt &amp; Parker at Exeter (03892-215 631) and Kevin Bright of Bideford (0237-473 241). The most expensive is the 2,090-acre Burnley Hall estate on the Norfolk coast at Somerton, where William H. Brown is agent (0603-610 281). Also on Bedrock's search list is Sheringham Hall, in Norfolk, a National Trust house designed in 1812 by Humphry Repton who also laid out the 700-acre park and woods that run to the sea. As the trust's agent, the Norwich office of Savills (0603-612 211) is seeking Pounds 1m for a 90-year lease of this well-restored house with six acres of gardens. The trust also wants a buyer for Signal House, a former Lloyd's signal station on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall which has been converted into a four-bedroom house. Offers over Pounds 85,000 for a 99-year lease are invited by the trust's regional land agent, Peter Mansfield (0208-74 281). Marine Villa, built in the 18th century as a dower house on the Duke of Hamilton's Archerfield estate at Dirleton, close to Muirfield, Scotland, inspired Robert Louis Stevenson to write The Pavilion on the Links. Offers over Pounds 800,000 are being sought by Hamptons in Edinburgh (031-220 6665). Regency Cottage, on the Esplanade at Sandgate, Kent, is a six-bedroom house, listed for its architectural and historic interest and said to have been built in 1822 for the army officer responsible for building the south coast's martello towers and other Napoleonic defences. It is priced at Pounds 295,000 from the Folkestone office of Cluttons (0303-850 422). North End House at Rottingdean, Sussex, is where the late Enid Bagnold, author of National Velvet and other books, lived with her husband, Sir Roderick Jones, who was chairman of Reuters, the news agency. Their five-bedroom house opposite Rudyard Kipling's is for sale at Pounds 525,000 through Humberts at Lewes (0273-478 828). There is a staff flat, a cottage, stables, and grounds with direct access to the south downs. But Britain's seaside begins and ends at Brighton, where Fox &amp; Sons (0273-688 148) has several flats for sale in converted Regency buildings on the seafront in Marine Parade, Kemp Town, at prices from Pounds 47,000 to Pounds 129,950. Simon Francis, manager of the Kemp Town office, says: 'The peak time for buyers is the spring and summer - so we are expecting a revival in the market now.'</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Nomura drops action over book THE WORLD'S largest security house, Nomura, has decided to drop its libel action against Bloomsbury, the independent publisher, after more than two years of legal wrangling. The action is believed to have cost well over Pounds 1m, of which the lion's share has been paid by the Japanese. It emerged yesterday that Nomura has agreed to a 'drop hands settlement', under which both sides will bear their own costs, but all claims for damages are withdrawn. In April 1990 Nomura issued a writ for libel in connection with The House of Nomura, a book published by Bloomsbury and written by the US-born stockbroker Mr Al Alletzhauser. It also pressed for an injunction requiring that the book be withdrawn. Nomura went ahead with the action after both the publisher and the author had rejected earlier demands from the Japanese company that the book should be withdrawn and a payment of damages should be negotiated. In the original writ issued in the High Court in April 1990 alleging defamation, solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines, acting for Nomura, alleged that the words in the preface to the book 'in their natural and ordinary meaning meant and were understood to mean' that the Japanese securities house had: Succumbed to the demands of gangsters and/or extortionists and/or blackmailers. Conspired with blackmailers to misuse its funds for the purpose of making payments to the blackmailers. Carried out and/or committed immoral and/or illegal acts and/or practices which they wished to conceal by making payments to blackmailers. Habitually engaged in the practice of insider trading and misused confidential information. Preparations for a trial were still under way in July 1991 when the chairman and vice-chairman of Nomura resigned after taking responsibility for a series of scandals. Mr Setsuya Tabuchi, the chairman, said his resignation would show that the company genuinely regretted its improper behaviour, which also included compensating favoured clients for trading losses and lending to a gangster group. The resignations led to private celebrations at Bloomsbury, whose managing director, Mr Nigel Newton, had earlier declared that he was not in the business of 'sanitising well documented, well researched and well written works of non-fiction'. Linklaters &amp; Paines was not prepared to comment on the litigation. Mr Nick Thomas, of Kennedys, which is acting for Bloomsbury, however described the out-of-court settlement as 'not quite a total victory but near enough' for his clients.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Syerhey Plytkevich: "23 June Is Around the </F> Corner, And Everyone Should Determine Their Position"]    [Text] Since 15 March, Belarus is a presidential republic.  It is expected that the president, who will be elected on 23  June or a bit later by a popular vote, will become head of the  state and the executive power. Paradoxically, however, the new  Constitution left the soviets that -- at least in the hinterland  -- will continue to hold sway, as they did in the past. As no  presidential structures are envisioned so far for the country's  regions, it would take a lot of optimism to expect that the  introduction of the presidency will bring only good things to  our people. The example of Russia, showing what confrontation  between Executive and Legislative Branches can lead to, is only  too vivid, but you do not even have to go as far as Russia! In  other former Soviet republics that introduced presidential rule,  changing the government system is conducted with great  difficulties.    What is it that Belarus expects? With the most probable  presidential candidates already known, this can be predicted  even today. Knowing those candidates and the forces standing  behind them, one can predict with a great dose of probability to  what the victory of any of them will lead.    In an article "About `Bison,' `Mice,' and Gorbachev's  Shadow," published in NARODNAYA GAZETA of 22 February, 1994, I  spoke out on why the majority in the Supreme Soviet chose this  particular time to introduce the presidency in the Republic, and  why the Belarusian Popular Front opposition, the free trade  unions, and the striking committees attempted to stage a  nationwide political strike in February of this year. As we  know, the attempt fizzled out, but the Republic's leadership,  supported by the legislative majority, did reach its goals. The  scenario that I predicted before has already started to unfold  -- in what might prove a very risky undertaking, the party of  power is now attempting to strengthen its power. It needs its  own president. Its main candidate is Belarusian Prime Minister  Vyacheslav Kebich. In the words of certain parliamentary  deputies, a collection of deputies' signatures in his favor has  already gotten under way. In addition, we received phone calls  from several places and learned that the callers were  intensively instructed to set up initiating groups to support  Vyacheslav Kebich as the candidate for president.    As a matter of fact, there will be nothing reprehensible  about this if such groups emerge voluntarily, but it would be a  different thing if they are forged by directives, forcing  officials, whose fate is now in the hands of the Cabinet of  Ministers and rayon and oblast executive councils, to enter  them. That would be the case of blatant pressuring and an  attempt to influence the citizens' free choice. However, there  is no need to repeat all this right now, because our state has  always exerted pressure on its citizens; and it would be naive  to think that this will change during the first presidential  election in independent Belarus. Of course, all opponents of  Kebich are perfectly aware of this fact, and are bracing up for  heavy fighting. It was not by accident that the legislative  majority, pressing for the soonest possible election of the  president, wished to break its promise to hold early elections  to the Supreme Soviet in March 1994. The explanation is simple  -- under control of the Cabinet of Ministers, they will elect  their new president in June, and then, under control of the  president, hold legislative elections. This would not violate  the democratic procedures and will leave power in the hands of  previous wielders.    This will happen if Vyacheslav Kebich emerges as a victor in  the presidential elections. His present moves show where he is  going to lead the Republic.    I am not sure about all the Belarusian people, but this  outcome is most desirable for the Cabinet of Ministers and the  legislative majority.    What if Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb  joins the race for the presidential seat? Although this  prospect cannot be ruled out, the question is how realistic is  his victory? However, this would set a remarkable precedent  when local executive bodies would have to make decisions on  their own, instead of waiting for instructions from on high. In  this case, the elections would be more democratic. Even if Hryb  lost, he would forever go down in Belarusian history as a man  who tried to remove pressure from the electorate. The future  will show whether Mr. Hryb will decide to make this move.    And what will happen if deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka wins  the  elections? Although Mr. Lukashenka is a very complex figure,  he is resolutely proceeding toward his goal. He is quite  respected by Belarusian citizens, and... spurned both by leftist  and rightist forces. Remember an amendment proposed by Vasiliy  Chepik, member of the Popular Movement, saying that the  president should be at least 45 years old, not 35? Alyaksandr  Lukashenka is 39, and is open about his intention to fight for  the presidential post. It is clear that the amendment was  targeted at him in the first place. It was voted down, though.  It was supported both by far left candidates and by deputies  working in the Cabinet of Ministers. A paradox? Not at all. It  is just that everyone fears Lukashenka's unpredictability; and  state officials understand very well that once Lukashenka is  elected, many of them will have a difficult life.    However, Belarus will experience an even more uncertain  situation if Stanislav Shushkevich, Gennadiy Karpenko, or Zyanon  Paznyak will be elected president. All of them will find  themselves in a bind if they win the election. First, the  Constitution does not give the Belarusian president too many  rights and powers. Second, a democratic Belarusian president  will have an alienated parliament, not to mention the Cabinet of  Ministers. You cannot fire everyone -- go and try to figure out  which of the Cabinet of Ministers' employees is capable of  working in new conditions! So, we might have a real but  absolutely powerless president; or, there will be a  confrontation between him and the parliament and local executive  council leadership. Most important, in spite of the activation  of the Belarusian Constitutional Court, these conflicts would be  practically irresolvable, perpetuating anarchy and a lack of  responsibility.    This outcome was forecasted by the opposition deputies. This  is why they had called for the reformation of local authorities  -- the Soviet power is incompatible with the presidential one,  but the [legislative] majority did not hear them. Obviously, it  was confident that a puppet of the Cabinet of Ministers will  become president, leaving no room for conflicts.    Alas, life teaches us that even the most promising and easy  plans sometimes fall through at the last moment, and then,  disappointed, we curse ourselves for our own improvidence.    But still, a reader might ask, if all of the possible  outcomes of the presidential election are so bleak, for whom  should I vote? I am not going to campaign for anyone here. I  know that all Belarusian citizens want to live better, but what  does it mean to live better? To live the kind of life we had a  decade ago, having a guaranteed piece of bread and sausage, and  thinking this was the best that could have happened to us? Or,  to live as people do in civilized countries, experiencing true  freedom and really enjoying life? We had been thinking about  our socialist Motherland, cutting back on our salaries to buy  furniture or a car, and hoping that our children will be  happier. Those on top of the power had been thinking about  themselves, working for big money, and vacationing all over the  world.    So, a better life can mean different things. We hope that  most Belarusian citizens look ahead, into the future. If so, we  need a president who would lead the Republic in this very  direction. If he reflects opinions of most of the people, we  should fear no confrontation with conservative forces.    We will overcome everything if we want to. So, determine  your positions, dear citizens!</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Jefferson Smurfit prices US offer at Dollars 13 Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging group, yesterday priced an initial public offering of 19.25m shares in its US division at Dollars 13. The company also offered Dollars 400m of senior notes in Container Corporation, which is owned by its US arm. The equity offering is part of a Dollars 2bn refinancing plan for Jefferson Smurfit Corporation in the US, which is partly owned by two equity funds run by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. Mr Michael Smurfit, chairman of the Irish group, said he was pleased the company had achieved the offering 'despite extremely difficult and volatile markets'. In addition to the 19.25m shares to be sold to the public, a unit of the parent Jefferson Smurfit group will also buy 11.54m shares at the same price as the public offering. The remainder of the refinancing comes from a bank facility of Dollars 1.65bn, of which a Dollars 900m loan will be delayed until December. That loan will be used by the company to redeem Dollars 844m of junk bonds which date back to 1989. The refinancing will save the US company Dollars 68.3m a year in interest payments on its debt burden, which is largely made up of junk bonds. The US company has struggled under high interest payments and weak paper and packaging markets, pushing it into the red in the past three years. However, company officials say the market is on the upturn again with prices for liner board - its main product - increasing by Dollars 55 a tonne over the past five months and another price rise scheduled for June. The price increases will add Dollars 110m a year to the company's bottom line.</p>

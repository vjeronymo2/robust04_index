			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE ARTS GROUP REPORTEDLY WITHDRAWS NEA PROPOSITION  </P> <P> An association of state arts councils that floated a controversial plan to  split up the National Endowment for the Arts and hand over most of its money to  state art agencies distanced itself from the plan Friday, with top officials  reportedly telling arts supporters the proposal had been "withdrawn."  </P> <P> The executive director of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies,  Jonathan Katz, was reportedly away from the organization's Washington  headquarters on Friday, and most of Katz's top aides were said to be  unavailable.  </P> <P> But it was learned that a telephone conference call involving the group's  five-member executive committee ended late Thursday with a consensus that the  controversial plan should be withdrawn from consideration and that the group is  officially opposed to a legislative proposal based on it that was made  Wednesday by two Republican congressmen.  </P> <P> The national assembly is one of 17 arts groups that are scheduled to  participate in meeting starting Tuesday on Capitol Hill to try to develop a  consensus solution to the NEA's political difficulties. Distancing itself from  the controversial plan to break up the agency -- or abandoning the effort  completely -- had been urged on the assembly by key arts supporters for the  last several days.  </P> <P> In a memo -- obtained by reporters last week -- that represented itself as  summarizing the national assembly's position, the organization's board  advocated shifting 60% of all NEA money to state arts councils -- triple the  proportion now sent to them.  </P> <P> The proposal could radically alter the system of public arts funding throughout  the United States.  </P> <P> Derek Gordon, director of the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, said the  national assembly executive committee concluded that it was inappropriate to  propose any formula to reapportion the NEA budget. "To even discuss that  percentage is to accept the fact that the endowment would have to be changed,"  said Gordon, an executive committee member.  </P> <P> "I think any discussion of percentage would be inappropriate. This is a very  sensitive subject and it's one we are all very concerned about. I think there  has been too much misunderstanding and misinterpretation already."  </P> <P> Reps. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) and Tom Coleman (R-Mo.) proposed that the NEA's  $171.5 million budget be split up exactly as proposed in the national assembly  formula -- with restrictions on the kinds of art NEA can support. The GOP plan  was almost identical to the national assembly proposal described in a  memorandum last week written by written by Mary Hayes, director of the New York  State Council on the Arts.  </P> <P> But Friday morning, the national assembly appeared to be taking pains to  distance itself from the plan originally attributed to it. Gordon said the Hays  memo that created the controversy misstated decisions made by the national  assembly board and characterized as a proposal for legislative consideration a  discussion that had been far more general, less final and less specific.  </P> <P> "The board of NASAA did not make a proposal," said Gordon. "We firmly believe  that a strong and healthy NEA is what's best for the arts. The language of the  memo perhaps does not fully convey the context of the discussion. There is a  considerable amount of misinterpretation, even in that memo."  </P></p>

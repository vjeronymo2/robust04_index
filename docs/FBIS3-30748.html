			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ewa Kaszuba and Ewa K. Czaczkowska: "Day After </F> Day Toward the Crisis"]    [Text] Conflicts within the governing coalition started  even before the government was formed; with varied intensity,  they persisted through the 100 days of governing. However, none  of them shook the coalition as hard as the last one.  <H5>  Overheard Near the Door </H5>   As a consequence of the seriousness of the conflict and the  gravity of the accusations leveled at one another by the  politicians of both coalition parties, the last session of the  Chief Council [RN] of the Social Democracy of the Polish  Republic [SdRP] was held behind closed doors; journalists were  not admitted. However, fragments of statements that could be  made out in the corridor suggested that the participants were  expressing severe criticism of the peasant [Polish Peasant Party  (PSL)] partner.    Aleksander Kwasniewski admitted that the main shortcoming of  the prime minister is the fact that he is not acting in line  with the coalition agreements and that he is unable to  communicate with the mass media. The cadre policy that the PSL  is carrying out was termed by him as a "buddies" policy. As he  later repeated officially, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  has so far proposed eight candidates for the posts of voivodes  and deputy voivodes; among them, only one person was a member of  the party's leadership; the others were experts. The 22  appointments that were made at the motion of the PSL concerned  people chosen from among the PSL party apparatus.    Kwasniewski argued that the conflicts must not be left as  they are, so both partners and the public will not be led to the  conclusion that there is no problem at all; a similar situation  might repeat itself in several weeks or more.    Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski said that economic  policy entails a look into the future; it also requires a clear  statement of what kind of policy the government wants to pursue.  However, on this there are differences between the coalition  parties.    According to Borowski, the PSL fulfills the role of a brake  in the government by demanding the time to think things over.  Now the problem is that there is no time because the atmosphere  in the West is once again favorable to Poland, and new  possibilities for obtaining foreign capital are opening up. One  cannot be suspicious, the deputy prime minister said; one cannot  review every single law every three months and correct  provisions that are world standards. It is also intolerable  that the coalition's deputies introduce and vote on amendments  that distort bills submitted by the government.    Emphasizing that PSL policy is currently, to a considerable  degree, catering to the needs of its own electorate, Borowski  gave a few examples of decisions favoring the inhabitants of  rural areas, such as great subsidies for the Agency for  Agricultural Marketing [ARR], amendments to the Law on ARR, the  Law on Compensatory Fees, and raises in old age pensions, which  will primarily benefit farmers. Out of the 5 trillion zlotys  [Z] earmarked for this year's raises, Z4 trillion will be  received by them.    Even though he admitted that indeed the situation should not  be aggravated, Borowski said that submitting conditions is  different from offending a partner. He believes that the best  solution would be if the PSL accepted the five conditions  submitted by himself and the SLD, if it adopted the budget  without tampering with its provisions; the peasants should also  unblock the National Investment Funds so mass privatization  could finally begin. Only then could the details be discussed.    The statements of both politicians were extensively  commented  on in the corridor. Some people in the corridor pointed out  that the present conflict was brought on by excessive submission  toward the PSL, which, they said, was the fault of Kwasniewski.    "If we let the peasants fill the post of the voivode in  Wloclawek, it is clear that anything can be done to us," they  said.    Members of the SdRP leadership did not conceal the fact  that the proposal that all decisions be made by the government's  Presidium was prompted by the need to watch the prime minister's  hands. SLD politicians said the same during the coalition  talks. The signing of agreements and appendixes was a  consequence of the fact that, even in the previous Sejm, the PSL  and its leader were well known for violating their agreements.  The coalition also wants to keep a tighter rein on Michal  Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], by  holding consultations concerning the filling of the positions of  voivodes and deputy voivodes. As one politician conceded, the  appetites of the URM head are enormous; however, one should  rather not think about it in terms of one's own party or even in  terms of the coalition but in much broader terms.  <H5>  Conflicts, Disputes, and Understatements </H5>   Frictions that posed serious threats to the coalitions began  as early as the day that was supposed to end the talks on the  final shape of the Pawlak Cabinet. When, after over a month of  coalition talks, everyone, both politicians and journalists,  sighed with relief that we already had a government, it turned  out that it was too early. The list with the names of the  ministers that the prime minister brought to the Belweder was  contrary to the earlier agreements. The SLD politicians  threatened to break the coalition; Pawlak had to yield. The  "bone of contention" was the Finance Ministry, which, along with  the portfolio of the deputy minister, was given to Marek  Borowski, as well as the Ownership Transformations Ministry,  which was taken over by Wieslaw Kaczmarek. These two politicians  with "liberal" views on the economy were not welcomed by the  PSL. The crisis ended when both sides signed an appendix to the  coalition agreement. This appendix was not observed, which  caused the latest conflict.  <H5>  What Will Happen Next With the Coalition? </H5>   Before the government was sworn in, the coalition was quite  considerably rocked by the election of the chairman of the Sejm  Foreign Affairs Committee. It is not known whether this  conflict was caused by the disloyalty of coalition partners or  by the fact that the agreement was not very clear. PSL leaders  officially did not pay great attention to this, but the deputies  began to express strong doubts about the intentions of the SLD;  they started to ask: "What will happen next with the coalition?"    The same question was asked unofficially in the Sejm when  the  SLD Deputies' Club did not take part in discussions on the "New  Year's" speech by the prime minister. The speech was not  favorably received by the SLD; its deputies wondered why it had  been delivered at all at that time. They argued that, among  other things, the condition of the economy was depicted rather  subjectively in the speech.    The coalition was also not really unanimous in the ballots  on  the acceptance of accounts of the Oszewski and the Suchocka  governments. According to Kwasniewski, the discussion and the  ballots were exclusively political, not substantive acts.  <H5>  Assistant or Spokesman </H5>   The government's information policy caused a serious  misunderstanding as well. The appointment of Ewa Wachowicz to  the post of press secretary did not bring about an enthusiastic  response from the SLD, which wanted the prime minister to have a  press spokesperson. Negative opinions of politicians and  journalists on the information policy of the government forced  the SdRP Presidium to forward a letter to the prime minister and  ask that a concept of information policy be adopted.   <H5>    Dispute Over Voivodes </H5>   For a long time, it seemed that, if the issue of the filling  of voivode posts might cause a split in the coalition, it would  be not because of its appetites for the same voivodships but  because of the attitude toward the need to replace voivodes in  general. When, before the government was sworn in, Michal Strak  spoke about the need to adjust the political map of voivodships  to the election results, SLD politicians either tried to calm  the situation or did not say anything. Finally, in early  December, Kwasniewski admitted that the concept proposed by the  PSL was very much to the SLD's liking. Despite the fact that  both parties agreed that the post of the voivode in a given  voivodship would be offered to the party that won the elections  in that voivodship, conflicts were not avoided. A heated  dispute arose when the Wloclawek voivode was being replaced. In  the Wloclawek voivodship, the SLD won the elections (it gained  five seats, the PSL only one); however, it was a PSL member who  was appointed as voivode. He received definite support from the  regional self-government sejm. This issue is said to have been  discussed at the meeting of the "directorate"; Ryszard  Jarzembowski, who is in charge of coordinating the replacement  of voivodes on behalf of the SLD, was forced to say that URM  should have an SLD representative--in the rank of an under  secretary of state--who would also exert influence on decisions  concerning voivodes.  <H5>  Between the Coalition and the Belweder </H5>   For quite a long time now, we have been witnessing a dispute  over the posts of deputy ministers in the presidential  ministries. As a result of the stance taken by the prime  minister, who was afraid of a conflict with the Belweder, this  controversy turned into a conflict between the Sejm National  Defense Ministry, chaired by SdRP Secretary Jerzy Szmajdzinski,  and the prime minister. Since December, the committee has been  waiting for the prime minister to provide an answer to the  question of merging posts by Jerzy Milewski. In the beginning,  both PSL and SLD deputies demanded that the deputy ministerial  posts in the presidential ministries be filled by their own  people. When the prime minister did not really abandon this  idea but definitely put off its implementation, the PSL stopped  insisting on this. A few days ago, however, Leszek Bugaj (PSL)  confirmed that the coalition would "not let it go at that," and,  in a few weeks, it would have its own deputy minister in the  National Defense Ministry. This demand emerged once again  during the latest talks between Kwasniewski and Pawlak.  <H5>  Principles of the Work of the Coalition </H5>   1. In line with the coalition agreement, responsibility for  the right work of the coalition lies with the chairmen of the  coalition groupings and chairmen of the Deputies' Clubs of these  groupings, who act jointly.    2. The drafts of strategic political, economic, and cadre  decisions of the government are submitted to the chairmen of the  Deputies' Clubs of the coalition groupings before final  decisions on them are made.    3. Decisions concerning the members of the leadership of all  of the ministries, appointed by the coalition groupings, are  made by the prime minister after consultations with the relevant  deputy ministers and the chairmen of the coalition groupings  whose representative does not head the given ministry.    4. Decisions concerning personnel issues in the voivodship  state administration are preceded by consultations with the  chairmen of the Deputies' Clubs of the coalition groupings.  <H5>  [Box, p 2 </H5> <H5>  Principles of the Work of the Coalition </H5>   The above-mentioned provisions were included in the appendix  to the coalition agreement that was signed before the final  composition of the Council of Ministers was forwarded to the  Belweder.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Radical shake-up at TUC urged by 'super-unions' A THOROUGH rationalisation of the Trades Union Congress, promised for years but never delivered, has come a step closer. The AEEU engineering and electrical union has called for a 'radical reassessment' of the organisation in a motion tabled for this year's TUC congress. Leaders of the growing number of 'super-unions' complain that the TUC duplicates services they provide. They believe the cost of the organisation can no longer be justified while trade union membership is falling. They also say that its role as the labour movement's alternative civil service, and lobbyist of government, has become obsolete. The AEEU says resources should be concentrated on four areas: health and safety, education and training, European and international lobbying and co-ordination of union submissions to government. The TGWU general union, Britain's biggest, has also submitted a motion calling for a refocusing of the TUC's role. Congress is likely to consider amalgamating the two motions. Previous moves to reform the TUC have been frustrated by the inability of union leaders to agree over which of its functions should be dropped. But the Conservative general election victory and the recession have lent urgency to the debate. The TUC is already reducing costs, mainly through job cuts. Almost 40 jobs, out of 250, are being phased out but even after this reduction staff numbers will still be at 1979 levels, when total trade union membership was more than four million higher than it is today. It is understood the TUC accepts the need for reform and does not view the moves by the AEEU and the TGWU as unhelpful. The AEEU emphasises its motion should not be interpreted as a obituary for Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary. The TGWU's motion was seen by some as a direct attack on Mr Willis's leadership.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Hurd strives to mend EU rift: Move to end UK's diplomatic isolation; Support for common policies Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday launched a campaign to end Britain's recent diplomatic isolation in Europe and persuade its partners that the UK views the European Union as more than a free trade area. In remarks aimed at breaking the stranglehold of the Conservative party's Euro-sceptics on UK policy toward Europe, Mr Hurd pledged British support for a stronger common foreign and security policy, including an offer to pool sensitive political intelligence reports in Brussels. He told EU foreign ministers in Brussels: 'The European Union cannot be simply a free trade area or even a single market. We need to develop a system for constructing our foreign policy better internally, and projecting it better externally.' Mr Hurd's intervention appeared aimed in part at easing tensions with France and Germany over Britain's veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier backed by Bonn and Paris for the European Commission presidency. But it was also an effort to recoup lost ground after the row over Britain's unsuccessful campaign to maintain its power to block EU legislation once the Union expands, as planned, from 12 to 16 members. 'We need to talk less exclusively about British interests and more about Europe's interests,' said a senior UK official. Mr Hurd suggested that the EU's newly established relationship with Ukraine could serve as a trial run for a more co-ordinated foreign policy approach among the Twelve, starting with foreign ministers sharing intelligence and analysis. There was a need for a 'strategy' for relations with central and eastern Europe combining expanded trade and closer security ties leading to the ultimate goal of EU membership. Ministers moved in this direction yesterday with the signing of free trade agreements with the Baltic states. They also welcomed a new European Commission policy paper which aims to help the East Europeans prepare for EU membership by integrating their laws and trade prac-tices with those of the Union. A Commission official said harmonisation of competition law, trade practices and other laws would, in effect, expand the single European market eastwards. This would create a new market of about 450m people, including the EU, Baltic states, Slovenia, and the six countries which have concluded association agreements with the Union - Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. The Commission paper also suggests that both west and eastern Europe must make radical reforms to lay the groundwork for membership. It says former communist countries should cut capacity in smokestack industries, modernise banking and promote small businesses. Similarly, EU members need to brace themselves for changes in the hugely expensive system of farm price supports under the Common Agricultural Policy and the regional aid budget. The UK is pressing this agenda, but is conscious that opening the question of CAP reform prematurely could trigger a confrontation among EU member states. Meanwhile, British officials believe that it might be possible to invite the east Europeans to join meetings of EU foreign ministers or interior ministers with the power to speak but not vote.

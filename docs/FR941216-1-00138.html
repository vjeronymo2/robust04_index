It is recommended that temperatures not exceed 170  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Automatic internal sprinkler systems shall equip each oven and shall conform with NFPA Standard No. 13, <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Installation of Sprinkler Systems. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Automatic operation of the system may be accomplished by approved electrical heat-actuated devices, installed as required for NEC-defined class I, division 1, group D, hazardous locations. Refer to NFPA Standard No. 70,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Electric Code. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See footnote 15 to &sect;184.170. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Hot air or other means may supply heat, provided ammunition and explosives are kept from contact with coils, radiators, and heating elements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In case of power failure, the heat supply for any conveyor system shall automatically stop. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Electric drying units that are not approved for use in class I hazardous locations should be designed so that solvent vapor concentration in the oven is kept below 25 percent of its lower explosive limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.172 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Rework, disassembly, renovation, and maintenance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Rework and disassembly operations shall not usually be conducted with other inert or explosives operations. However, when concurrent scheduling cannot be avoided, operations shall be sufficiently distanced from one another to protect adjacent personnel and equipment, and prevent propagation to adjacent explosives. Such separation may be accomplished with Q/D, operational shielding, or the remote control of operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The operator and all other personnel shall be fully protected during rework and disassembly operations known or expected to use force exceeding assembly specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If A&amp;E items have been assembled normally, the same equipment, tools, methods, and applied forces may be used to disassemble them. In such cases, only that personnel protection required during the assembly operations is also required during the rework or disassembly operations. Care shall be taken, however, to ascertain that the assembly was normal and that the surfaces to be separated are not corroded and not sealed with metallic applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) When renovation or maintenance not adequately addressed in the contract is required, the contractor shall request specific safety guidance through contract channels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.173 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Munitions loading and associated operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Screening and blending high explosives. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Bulk high explosives intended for processing shall be screened or visually inspected and passed over a magnetic separator to detect extraneous material for removal. Screening equipment shall not subject explosives to pinching, friction, or impact. Explosives screening units without exhaust ventilation shall be thoroughly cleaned as often as necessary and after every shift, to prevent hazardous accumulations of explosives dusts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Screening and blending initiating explosives. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Suitable operational shields shall be provided for screening and blending operations involving initiating explosives, or operators shall be located at intraline distance from screening and blending facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Explosives melting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Temperatures used for melting explosives and keeping explosives molten should not exceed 228  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. However, steam pressures up to 15 psi (250  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) may be used to melt composition B and similar binary explosives and to maintain a molten state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Melt unit valves and melt mix draw-off or other lines carrying molten explosives shall provide against friction or impact capable of initiating the explosives. Diaphragm-type valves should be disassembled and inspected regularly. Damaged or old diaphragms shall be replaced so no cracks allowing metal-to-metal contact can develop. Draw-off lines should be constructed to prevent exposure of threads, fastening screws, and bolts, both outside and between the flanges. A sealing compound should be used to prevent explosives seepage or vapor condensation on the contacting surfaces of the bolts, flanges, screws, and nuts. Melt mix kettle draw-off pipes should be electrically connected to items being filled during draw-off operations. Items shall be individually grounded unless tests show that grounding through contact surface is adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Wet-type collectors effectively remove dust and vapors from exhausted air, and are recommended for melt mix exhausting systems. Water in the wet collector will not be recirculated unless the system removes hazardous suspensions. Water retaining such explosives shall be discharged to a sump designed to keep such explosives wet. The exhaust and collecting equipment shall be regularly inspected and flushed of explosives accumulations. When protective construction prevents propagation of a detonation between melt kettles, a complete dust and vapor collection system shall equip each kettle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

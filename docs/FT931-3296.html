			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Avoiding the pitfalls of amenity agriculture - Most successful ideas for diversifying farm enterprises quickly become oversubscribed / Farmer's Viewpoint CHARLES BENNETT organises children's parties on his 50-hectare (120-acre) farm between Oxford and Thame. The entertainment includes pony rides, looking at lambs, collecting eggs from nest boxes under the free range hens, treasure hunts around the farmyard and tractor trailer rides around the fields, all culminating with tea in the hay barn. The children, who are between three and ten years old - 'they get too difficult to control after that', says Mr Bennett - love the temporary freedom of the farm and getting dirty. Parents are only too happy to pay him for providing the facility. And incidentally, in case any Food Safety Official begins to worry about Mr Bennett's ability to provide food to the high standards they require, he insists that the parents provide a picnic. All he does is to allow the children to eat it in his barn. This activity comes under the general heading of diversification, which farmers have been encouraged to explore in recent years as the government has sought to divert resources from the production of food perceived to be in surplus. But the truth is that farmers who enjoy having people around the farm, like Mr Bennett, or who became bored with planting seeds and then waiting long months for harvest, or, even more likely, needed to increase their incomes, have been diversifying for years. Mr Bennett, for instance, has a long record of holding farm open days on bank holidays and weekends. He also has a farm shop selling produce from the farm at retail rather than wholesale prices. With only 120 acres from which to try to derive a living he needs extra income from alternative sources and I wish him every success with his efforts. But the history of such initiatives is littered with failures The classic diversification is farmhouse holidays. Farmers in beautiful scenic areas, which are, almost by definition, the most difficult in which to make a living, long ago realised that they had to earn more cash from somewhere. Some decided to offer bed and breakfast for passing travellers and signs appeared at farm gates in the hills and moorlands of Britain. Charges were modest and country-loving guests could not believe the value for money compared with hotels. Comfortable beds and slap-up farm breakfasts combined to create a demand for such accommodation and more and more farmers joined the bandwagon. The number of beds increased, the standard of bedroom offered rose, in many cases to include en suite bathrooms, the costs of providing the services rocketed and charges had to go up. In many of those areas expensive uprated bedrooms now stand empty for most of the year. It is a classic case of a good idea that has been overdone and it shows how fragile is the balance between success and failure when diverting resources from the farmer's basic task of producing food to exploiting a niche market, which is necessarily more limited in potential. Another concept that became popular a few years ago but now seems to have run out of steam is pick-your-own. Fruit-growing is inescapably labour-intensive. You cannot mechanise the picking of strawberries and expect them to be of sufficient quality to grace the tea table (although it is now possible to pick them by machine if they are destined for the jam pot). And getting the quantity and quality of labour when it is needed has become increasingly difficult over the years. Someone, I don't know who, had the brilliant idea that if you could persuade the public to pick their own you could charge less for it and if they picked sub-standard produce they would only have themselves to blame. All through the 1970s and early 1980s the idea spread like wildfire across the country. But just like b &amp; b it has been overdone, with too many PYO farms chasing too few customers. Some PYO farms are still doing well. But many more are closing for lack of punters, who prefer, it appears, to pay inflated supermarkets prices for the convenience of having their produce pre-packed. I should not pretend, however, that I am immune to the temptation to diversify. Even as I write, the farm men are converting a range of redundant farm buildings into horse stables in the hope that the local riding fraternity will want to pay us money to keep their animals in them. Having seen how easy it is to get it wrong I have no illusions about the dangers. We are therefore controlling the costs of the investment rigidly. The one certainty about agricultural diversification is that it will cost money; but it is by no means certain that it will make money. Even if a feasibility study suggests that there is potential for a farm to divert some of its activity in a certain direction there is little doubt that it will be copied by other farmers and overdone within a few years. Such is the nature of farmers. Even the Ministry of Agriculture seems to have got that message at last. Five years ago the minister launched a scheme to grant aid for diversification on farms. The money was specifically directed towards feasibility studies and marketing and 1,500 farmers have so far received Pounds 8m. There are a further 750 diversifying farmers in the pipeline whose schemes have been approved but who have not yet had the cash. But a few weeks ago the prospect of more such grants was withdrawn. For the fact is that too many farmers try to diversify from financial weakness rather than strength in the vain hope that it will solve all their problems. It is said, moreover, that the banks are increasingly warning farmers against such activities because many of the clients from under whom they are now having to pull the rug are the ones who have spent big money on diversification.</p>

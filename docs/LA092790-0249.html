			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PICKENS TO PAY STOCK SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that maverick oilman T.  Boone Pickens and his Mesa Limited Partnership agreed to pay a $2.3-million  settlement in the sale of a gold mining stock.  </P> <P> The agreement requires Mesa "to disgorge $2.3 million in profits obtained as a  result of conduct as alleged in the complaint" to pay claims by Homestake  Mining Co. shareholders.  </P> <P> The agency's complaint stems from an announcement by Pickens and Mesa on Feb.  29, 1988, offering to purchase the gold mining company "in a negotiated  transaction," the SEC said. That announcement caused Homestake's stock price to  surge by nearly $4 a share, the agency said.  </P> <P> But over the next two weeks, Pickens and Mesa sold more than 3 million shares  of Homestake stock without disclosing their intent to sell a substantial  portion of Mesa's holdings of Homestake common stock.  </P></p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: 33 and still laughing Sir, I have just finished reading Christopher Dunkley's article 'Funny icons of youth' (February 9), and to be honest, I don't get it. I cannot understand why, if the comedians such as Sayle, Saunders, Elton etc disappoint him so much, he doesn't just utilise his other options - namely, turn over to another channel, switch the television off altogether, listen to the radio, read or even, God forbid, hold intelligent conversation with his partner. I also do not understand how someone who obviously was a teenager in the 1960s can be commenting on what the youth of today consider rebellious, and their 'own personal thing man'. I happen to be a 33-year-old financial director's secretary, married, no kids, and come from a family of four girls, the youngest of which is 16. I do not consider myself over the hill, in fact I think I must be a very young 33-year-old, as my 16-year-old sister actually likes having me around and going out with me and my 40-year-old husband. But maybe it could be because we do not condemn her and her friends for what they like or consider to the 'their rebellious domain'. I was a rebel at 17, just as my parents were and probably their parents etc, etc. It is immaterial whether it is comedy or the Rolling Stones that is the 'in thing'. The time to start worrying about the youth of today is when they start to hold fascists, dictators, cult religions, etc, in the same high echelons as the Rolling Stones were to Mr Dunkley. I do agree that the present Alexei Sayle series, Absolutely Fabulous 2, Ben Elton - Man From Auntie, are not as good as previous series, but they still make me smile and laugh, and really that's what it's all about, isn't it?

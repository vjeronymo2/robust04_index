Fifteen days into the conflict, this region of Los Altos de  Chiapas -- approximately 200 km southeast of Mexico City -- was  calm following a brief violation of the unilateral truce the  government ordered 72 hours ago. [passage omitted]    Following a three-hour meeting with President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari in Mexico City last night, Manuel Camacho Solis,  special commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas,  said that negotiations in Chiapas are advancing although the  problem is very complex.    Without going into details, Camacho Solis said: "We are  working well in a serious manner. It is a complex problem, but  the approach is appropriate."    On Friday a group of armed men broke the truce established  by  a presidential order to suspend military operations in Los Altos  de Chiapas by attacking an army unit on a stretch of the highway  to Oconsingo. There were no casualties. [passage omitted]    Last night Camacho Solis announced that Bishop Samuel Ruiz  of  San Cristobal de las Casas will be the practical "liaison" to  establish contact with the armed group.    The clergyman, known as a strong defender of Indians in  Chiapas, made an appeal "to seek alternative means" to solve the  major, profound problems affecting the region.    Camacho Solis offered to give his immediate attention to any  genuine proposal made by the armed group through Bishop Ruiz,  who last week agreed to a petition by the rebels to serve as  mediator in the dialogue with the government.    "Peace will be the result of a solution to the military and  political problems, as well as of an orderly and institutional  handling of the changes to be made in the region," the peace  commissioner noted.    "If Chiapas achieves reconciliation by taking steps forward,  instead of being a problem for the country, it will provide a  major contribution to the nation as a whole," Camacho Solis  added. Los Altos de Chiapas is a region of 100 square km with  a largely Indian population which, the government acknowledges,  lives in extreme poverty.    A communique by the Bishops Committee on Peace [Comision  Episcopal para la Paz] announced that a mission of bishops will  visit the conflict area to convince the armed militants to agree  to a dialogue after laying down their weapons. [passage omitted  on background material]    Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark has also joined  the repeated appeals for talks. He is a delegate of a human  rights organization based in Southern California. [passage  omitted on background material]    Clark's visit coincided with a report by the National Human  Rights Committee, headed by ombudsman Jorge Madrazo, that 60  percent of the cases reported as missing during the conflict  have been resolved.    Madrazo noted that out of 231 persons reported missing in  the  10 days of fighting and attacks, 163 have been found.</p>

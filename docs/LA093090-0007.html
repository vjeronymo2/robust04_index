			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: EH, WHAT'S UP, DOC?  </P> <P> Though production wrapped this summer on "Box Office Bunny," Bugs Bunny fans  will have to keep waiting for the five-minute cartoon scheduled to coincide  with Bugs' 50th anniversary. It still has no release date.  </P> <P> "It needs to be attached to the right movie," explains a spokesman for Warner  Bros. -- meaning a family film.  </P> <P> Likely contenders: one of the studio's holiday pictures, which include the Dan  Aykroyd-Chevy Chase-John Candy comedy, "Valkenvania," and the animated feature  "The Nutcracker Prince."  </P> <P> "Box Office Bunny" has the kwazy wabbit going into action when a multiplex  movie house is built over his hole. Co-starring Elmer Fudd as an usher, and  Daffy Duck as an irascible duck, with voices by Jeff Bergman, it marks the  first Bugs short to be released theatrically in 26 years. Or maybe it will be  27.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another cottontail continues his big screen spree, as work is under  way at Disney on Roger Rabbit's third cartoon short, "Hare in My Soup." It's  due next year. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

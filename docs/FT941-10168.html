			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Bonds: FRNs take centre stage amid interest rate doubts Floating-rate notes again featured prominently yesterday, meeting demand from investors expecting interest rates in the US and the UK to creep higher. However, the interest rate outlook on both sides of the Atlantic remained uncertain. Dealers said activity was subdued, with many investors preferring to remain sidelined until this week's US Treasury's auctions of 10- and 30-year bonds and Friday's January US producer prices index data were out of the way. Goldman Sachs issued the day's largest FRN, a Dollars 500m offering of four-year notes. The deal will be priced today to give a margin of three-month Libor plus 3/8 point at the reoffer price. A syndicate official at Goldman Sachs reported strong interest in the issue from investors seeking exposure to rising interest rates. 'We are seeing strong demand for US dollar floaters - there's a lot of money coming out of fixed-rate into floating rate assets, and spreads in the floating-rate sector are tightening,' said another trader. In the sterling sector, Salomon Brothers issued Pounds 150m of five-year FRNs paying a coupon of three-month Libor plus 40 basis points. According to one FRN dealer, the issue was generously priced and traded up after the syndicate broke. While UK rates are expected to continue falling, most participants say they are close to bottoming and will track US rates higher eventually. Elsewhere, Austria's Girocredit Bank issued Dollars 100m of 10-year notes paying six-month Libor less  1/8 point and incorporating a 5 1/8 per cent coupon floor. According to lead manager Merrill Lynch, the deal met strong demand and sold out in one hour. Yesterday's two straight dollar bonds received a cooler welcome and were widely deemed to have been too aggressively priced. Swedish Export Credit (SEK) issued Dollars 300m of three-year 5 per cent bonds, priced to yield 10 basis points over the new three-year US Treasury, via Kidder Peabody. The Bank of Dutch Municipalities (BNG) issued Dollars 150m of 5 per cent three-year bonds priced to yield 13 1/2 basis points over the three-year Treasury via Goldman Sachs. The spread on both deals widened after syndicate broke, with the SEK bond yielding about 17 basis points over the Treasury and the BNG yielding some 19 basis points over in late trading. However, the deals were largely targetted at retail investors and spreads are expected to tighten as the bonds get placed, one of the lead managers said. 'Once they're on the retail buy-list, they should start to perform.' Another favourite retail borrower tapped the market in the afternoon. General Electric Capital Corporation issued Pounds 150m of 6 1/4 per cent bonds due December 1999 via Deutsche Bank. They were priced to yield 19 basis points over the 6 per cent gilt due August 1999. Given that the GECC bonds have a slightly longer maturity, 'on the interpolated curve they look expensive', said one trader. However, an official at the lead manager reported solid interest from UK and continental European accounts. The European Investment Bank issued the largest peseta bond in the Spanish Matador market, Pta50bn of 7.5 per cent seven-year bonds, and today is expected to launch its long-awaited Greek drachma bond via Midland Bank Athens and the Hellenic Industrial Development Bank.</p>

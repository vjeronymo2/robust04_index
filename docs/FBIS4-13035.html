			<p>BFN     [Text] On 13 April Iranian artillery bombarded the border  areas of (Kuna Sus), [name indistinct], (Rajibadah),  (Mirasawah), and Sarakal in the al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate.  However, the bombardment, praise be to God, did not cause any  casualties. It should be recalled that the Iranian artillery  shelled the (Kanisan) border area on the night of 8-9 April,  killing one citizen and injuring four.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTEIN FOUND TO HALT BREAST CANCER CELLS  </P> <P> Researchers said Thursday that they had isolated a human protein that in the  laboratory was found to stop the growth of breast cancer cells without  affecting other types of human cells.  </P> <P> The scientists said the discovery may mark a significant advance in the search  for a breast cancer treatment and may ultimately help lead to a strategy for  prevention of the malignancy, which now strikes one American woman in 10.  </P> <P> A team of University of Michigan scientists led by Dr. Max S. Wicha, writing in  Friday's Science magazine, said it had isolated a human protein that it  believes plays a key role in the body's own system for controlling cell growth.  </P> <P> The team has dubbed the protein mammastatin and is now trying to produce it in  sufficient quantities to test it in laboratory animals and ultimately in  humans, Wicha said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> "Mammastatin, which is produced by normal breast cells, is a potent inhibitor  of breast cancer cells growing in the laboratory," Wicha said.  </P> <P> "It specifically stops the growth of breast cancer cells but not cells from  other tissues."  </P> <P> Wicha said he and his colleagues were now using genetic engineering techniques  to try to clone the human gene responsible for producing the protein.  </P> <P> Achieving this would enable them to make relatively large amounts of the  compound in the laboratory, but it may take several years to accomplish this,  he said.  </P> <P> About 142,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and an  estimated 43,000 will die of the disease this year, according to the American  Cancer Society.  </P> <P> In normal breast tissue, cell growth appears to be controlled by a balance  between growth inhibitors and growth stimulators, the researchers said.  </P> <P> In cancerous tissues, abnormal cell growth may occur because a stimulator  overpowers its inhibitor, creating an imbalance, they said.  </P> <P> The scientists said they had developed a test to measure mammastatin in blood  and found it to be present in all women, though at widely varying levels.  </P></p>

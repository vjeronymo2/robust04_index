			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: HK alters exchange listing rules HONG KONG yesterday moved closer to securing its role as one of China's most important financial centres when the British colony's stock exchange released a package of amendments to its listing requirements, paving the way for the flotation of nine Chinese state companies over the coming 12 months. The publication of the amendments, which are designed to enable the nine to list while seeking to protect the interests of minority shareholders, comes ahead of the signing in Beijing tomorrow of a 'memorandum of regulatory co-operation' between Hong Kong and Chinese securities market regulators. The memorandum will embody a set of principles for the regulation of securities markets on the mainland, including a commitment to the operation of fair, orderly and efficient markets which are informed by the timely disclosure of material information. The agreement between the Hong Kong stock exchange, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, and the two regulatory authorities - the China Securities Regulation Commission and the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong - marks a significant development in co-operation between the colony and China, The amendments will allow the nine to issue a minimum of 10 per cent of their shares - denominated in yuan, quoted in Hong Kong dollars, and defined as 'H' shares - for quotation on the Hong Kong exchange. Up to 15 per cent of a company's equity will be listed on one of China's two exchanges in 'A' shares. To strengthen investor protection, the nine will report results according to western standards; appoint at least two independent directors; and retain a foreign investment adviser for three years. Mr Robert Nottle, chairman of the SFC, said that the distinct markets for 'A' and 'H' shares presented 'novel regulatory issues' for Hong Kong. Once listed, a mainland company would come under the jurisdiction of relevant Hong Kong laws and non-statutory requirements, Mr Nottle said. Hang Seng Bank, which is controlled by HSBC Holdings, yesterday appointed Mr Alexander Au as its chief executive officer with effect from October 1, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Mr Au is the bank's managing director and deputy chief executive officer. Chinese bonds backlog, International Capital Markets</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / NTT's cut of 10,000 jobs could pave way for others NTT, the Japanese telecom company, said yesterday it is seeking to cut about 10,000 employees from its payroll through voluntary retirement by the end of next year. The announcement could pave the way for other companies to implement similar cuts. Many Japanese companies are feeling the pressures of high labour costs amid the slowdown but are unable to carry out staff cuts because of Japan's tradition of lifetime employment. NTT, which is Japan's largest company in terms of the number of employees, said that the staff cuts were part of a restructuring programme announced earlier this year aimed at eventually reducing staff numbers from more than 230,000 to 200,000. In fiscal 1992, NTT fell from second to third place in the rankings of Japan's top earners, according to statistics compiled by the National Tax Agency. The company's reported earnings fell 44 per cent last year to Y205.8bn (Pounds 1.33bn) and was outranked by Toyota, the car company and Sanwa Bank. NTT, which became a private company in 1986, has been suffering the effects of greater competition, but it is by no means the only company feeling the need to cut jobs. The Industrial Bank of Japan said in a recent report that Japanese companies employed about 900,000 staff in excess of what they needed.</p>

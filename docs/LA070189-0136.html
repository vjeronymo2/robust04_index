			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Charles H. Loos, who lost his job as editor of Orange County Business First  this week when the weekly newspaper closed its doors, has been hired as an  editor at the Irvine World News. Loos will oversee special projects and edit  business and religion stories, said Brien Manning, publisher of the weekly  Irvine paper owned by the Irvine Co. Loos succeeds Warren Esterline, who will  help Manning research the possibility of starting a new publication. "We're  looking at contiguous areas," Manning said, naming Newport Beach, Costa Mesa  and Tustin. Loos was the founding editor of Business First, which began  publishing in August, 1986, as Orange County Businessweek. His career began at  the Orange Coast Daily Pilot in Costa Mesa in 1961. He rose to managing editor  of the Pilot before leaving in 1982 for a news job with Media General Co. in  the San Fernando Valley.  </P></p>

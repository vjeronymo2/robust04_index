			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Labour party on course to return to power NORWAY'S ruling Labour party remains on course to return to power in Monday's general election, according to an opinion poll published today, Hugh Carnegy reports from Oslo. However, another poll yesterday showed a clear majority against membership of the EC, underlining the tough task facing a new Labour administration committed to pushing ahead with Oslo's application to join the community. The election poll in the newspaper Aftenposten showed support for Labour at 36.2 per cent, down slightly from earlier this week but still well ahead of its nearest rival, the Conservative party, which was up almost 2 points at 21.1 per cent. The anti-EC Centre party continued its sharp rise in the polls to 12.8 per cent. Opposition to EC membership, meanwhile, stood at 54 per cent.</p>

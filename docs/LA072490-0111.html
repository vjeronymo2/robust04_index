			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: GENEVA;  </P> <P> THE OIL ANTE  </P> <P> The fractious membership of OPEC, the world's most exclusive oil club, will  take up the question of house rules when the ministers meet in their favorite  Swiss city this week.  </P> <P> On the table will be a raise in the target price that the 13 member nations  charge for a barrel of benchmark oil from $18 to $20. Iran, citing recent  pledges by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to stay within their assigned  production quotas, thinks the time is ripe for such an increase.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Iraq is making thinly veiled threats against Kuwait if it violates  quotas that come out of the Geneva meeting.  </P></p>

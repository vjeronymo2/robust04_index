			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, from Jamal al-Halabi and Nidal  al-Mughrabi--Dr. Nabil Sha'th has stated that the detainees have  the right to be fully liberated, regardless of their places of  residence or their political affiliations. He stressed that the  basic conditions we have accepted are:    1. That the prisoner abide by the PLO commitments.    2. That those convicted of civil crimes be handed over to  the Palestinian authority so as to continue their imprisonment  or to keep them under the Palestinian authority's supervision.    He added: Anything other than this would be an Israeli  violation of the agreement and we will struggle to rectify it.    Reacting to reports about the formation of a new security  liaison committee and the changing of the security liaison  committee that signed the Gaza agreement on the detainees, Dr.  Sha'th said: Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya will head  the Palestinian side in the higher "Palestinian-Israeli"  security committee because he had the same job in the  Gaza-Jericho negotiations and knows all the agreement's details.  Brig. Gen. Ziyad al-Atrash is a Palestinian military and  security asset and we need him in all the security positions.    He added: There is a problem with the Israeli side on  whether the West Bank prisoners will go to their houses or will  be confined within the Palestinian authority's areas after their  liberation. We do not want hundreds of people to feel that they  are in Jericho which cannot provide houses. We refuse to  deprive the released detainees from returning to their families.  We are struggling to solve this problem.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th said: Anyone who carries the Gaza-Jericho  identity card has the right to enter the West Bank. Any person  who carries the West Bank identity card has the right to enter  Gaza and Jericho. Banning any person from doing so would be an  Israeli security violation of the spirit of the agreement.  Israel has the right to grant its citizens entry visas to the  Palestinian authority's areas and we have the right to grant  entry visas to Israel and the West Bank.    The Palestinian official went on to say that programs for  the  infrastructure and public utilities have been drawn up and that  around half of the international aid will be allocated to  housing. There are plans for tourist, agricultural, and  industrial projects. Palestinian investors will be the source of  Palestinian economic growth. They will bring tourist and  commercial projects that will earn profits but will also benefit  the homeland. Our role is to provide the necessary facilities  for them.    He added: There is talk about a comprehensive project for  cleaning Gaza after one month and that will employ around 15,000  workers for three months. All the aftereffects of the  occupation and the piles of garbage will be removed during that  period. I am seeking to collect aid to finance this project,  which will be similar to the one in Rafah which is financed by  the EC. He said: An international airport will be built. The  first flights from it are agreed on and will not need permits:  Gaza-Jericho and Gaza-Cairo. Other routes need permits.    Dr. Sha'th denied reports that the Palestinian president  will  be coming today. He said that the Palestinian authority will be  informed of his date of arrival at least three days before that  date.</p>

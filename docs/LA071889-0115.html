			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE BACKS BILL TO GIVE BLM STRONGER ENVIRONMENTAL ROLE  </P> <P> The House approved a bill Monday that seeks to bolster the environmental role  of the Bureau of Land Management in its stewardship over 270 million acres of  federal land, most of it in the West.  </P> <P> Enactment of the measure, which the House adopted by voice vote, would mark the  first formal reauthorization of the BLM by Congress in seven years. The bill  now goes to the Senate.  </P> <P> Among the key provisions of the bill is the reinstatement of a congressional  mandate that the deputy director, assistant directors and state directors of  BLM be nonpolitical, career appointees.  </P> <P> The Ronald Reagan Administration interpreted the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act  as allowing those posts to go to political appointees, who, critics charged,  largely failed to enforce conservation measures under federal land management  statutes.  </P> <P> Technically, the BLM has operated without authorization since 1982, but the  Interior Department agency has continued to receive money under a waiver of  House rules.  </P> <P> The bill approved Monday was introduced as a reauthorization measure to allow  for "such sums as may be necessary for the programs, functions and activities"  of the BLM through fiscal 1993.  </P> <P> However, the measure was amended by the Interior Committee to include a series  of provisions generally aimed at forcing the BLM to give greater consideration  to the environment in the management of public land and its natural resources.  </P> <P> The environmental amendments were strongly opposed by Western Republicans on  the panel, who argued that they are needless limits on mining, livestock  grazing and other legitimate land uses. The amendments also are opposed by the  Bush Administration.  </P></p>

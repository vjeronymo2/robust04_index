			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAMAGE TALLY STILL RISING WEEK AFTER QUAKE;  </P> <P> EARTHQUAKE: POMONA, CLAREMONT AND LA VERNE OFFICIALS SAY FEW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  DISPLACED AND FEW BUSINESSES CLOSED. BUT LOSSES APPROACH $10 MILLION.  </P> <P> A week after a strong earthquake and hundreds of aftershocks, officials in  Pomona, Claremont and La Verne were still adding up the damage Wednesday,  inspecting cracks in buildings and waiting to hear from state and federal  officials on the availability of aid.  </P> <P> The 5.5-magnitude quake, centered three miles northwest of Upland in San  Bernardino County, did much of its damage in eastern Los Angeles County. Losses  in the three cities approach $10 million, according to the latest estimates.  </P> <P> "We're still getting calls coming in," said La Verne Fire Chief Robert Miller.  "It may be seven to 10 days before we know how many residential structures were  damaged."  </P> <P> Much of the damage to homes and businesses is minor. Few residents have been  displaced and few businesses have been forced to close.  </P> <P> But at Mt. San Antonio Gardens, a retirement complex that straddles Pomona and  Claremont, 78 residents of a four-story building were evacuated Friday night  and will be kept out of their apartments indefinitely while structural damage  is repaired.  </P> <P> Ted Radamaker, executive director of the 460-resident retirement center, said  some of the displaced residents moved into other buildings in the 28-acre  complex and some went to live with their families. But 35 residents have moved  to Griswold's Claremont Center, a hotel about five blocks away.  </P> <P> "It's inconvenient," said Emily Ronfeldt, a 75-year-old retired teacher who is  one of those who moved to Griswold's. "But we're so lucky."  </P> <P> Ronfeldt said she and her husband came through the quake unhurt. The temporary  move to Griswold's, she said, is less traumatic than their decision a year ago  to give up their nine-room house in Claremont and move into the retirement  complex.  </P> <P> In Claremont, 11 businesses in the two-story Harvard Square building remain  closed because of structural damage that is being repaired.  </P> <P> "We hope to reopen by the weekend," said Joan Bunte, owner of the Craft Designs  gift shop.  </P> <P> Bunte, who was in her shop when the main quake struck said, "It was sort of  like a horror movie with stuff flying around." Pottery and glassware broke, she  said, but no one was hurt.  </P> <P> The experience was so unnerving, Bunte said Tuesday, that "today was basically  the first time I could talk about this earthquake without crying. It has been  so traumatic. I finally let my daughter go home to her apartment today. I  thought I could be grown up and stay by myself."  </P> <P> Caltech spokesman Robert Finn said there have been 400 to 500 aftershocks since  the Feb. 28 temblor, about three dozen of them large enough to be felt. He said  the number of aftershocks was not unusually high. Seismologists have not yet  agreed on which fault was responsible for the quake.  </P> <P> In Claremont, City Manager Glenn Southard said the city has estimated the  damage at about $1 million. Major reported losses are $400,000 to $600,000 at  the Claremont Colleges and $100,000 to grocery and liquor stores. About 150  houses have damaged chimneys.  </P> <P> In La Verne, Fire Chief Miller said 15 businesses have damage estimated to  total $375,000 and about 100 residences, including some mobile homes, sustained  damage estimated at $1 million.  </P> <P> In Pomona, officials have estimated the damage at almost $7 million. Nearly 600  buildings were damaged. By Wednesday, 25 buildings were still in such hazardous  shape that entry was being restricted.  </P> <P> California Conservation Corps crews have been working in Pomona and La Verne to  tear down damaged chimneys at no cost to homeowners.  </P> <P> The La Verne City Council this week adopted a policy of waiving building  permits for property owners repairing quake damage.  </P> <P> Jim Alexander, regional administrator of the state Office of Emergency  Services, said that whether property owners will be able to apply for low-cost  loans to repair damage hasn't been decided.  </P></p>

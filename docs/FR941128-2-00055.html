			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cost of Capital, Taxes, and Other Imputed Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Table A&hyph;3 shows the financing and tax rates, as well as the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required PSAF recoveries proposed for 1995, and compares the 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates with the rates used for developing the PSAF for 1994. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-tax return on equity rate decreased from 12.7 percent in 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 12.1 percent for 1995. The decrease is a result of 1993 BHC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial performance included in the 1995 BHC model, relative to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the stronger 1988 BHC financial performance in the 1994 BHC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decrease in the FDIC insurance assessment from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $19.8 million in 1994 to $19.0 million in 1995, shown in Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&hyph;3, is attributable to lower adjusted gross cash items in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process of collection (CIPC) and lower clearing balances. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDIC rate of $0.26 for every $100 in clearing balances remains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unchanged from the rate used in the 1994 final PSAF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Net income on clearing balances for 1995 is projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be $21.3 million, down from $25.4 million estimated for 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This decrease of $4.1 million is due to the decrease in excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearing balance levels, partially offset by a wider spread  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between income, which is earned at the 90-day Treasury bill rate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and expense or interest, which is paid at the federal funds rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Capital Adequacy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As shown in Table A&hyph;4, the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of capital imputed for the proposed 1995 PSAF totals 35.9 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of risk-weighted assets, well in excess of the 8 percent capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guideline for state member banks and BHCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1995 Fee Schedules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the Reserve Banks' estimates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs, volumes, and revenues, the proposed 1995 fees for priced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services are expected to yield net income of $36.0 million for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the year, compared with a targeted ROE of $31.5 million. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Reserve Banks project that 100.6 percent of total expenses,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including targeted ROE, will be recovered. In addition, during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995, approximately $19.1 million of automation consolidation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special project costs, including about $0.8 million that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deferred in prior years, will be recovered. Additional finance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges for 1995 on accumulated deferred special project balances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be $2.5 million, resulting in accumulated special project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs to be recovered in the future of $36.7 million. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In 1981, the Board adopted a policy that permits the Reserve Banks to defer and finance development costs if the development costs would have a material effect on unit costs, provided a conservative time period is set for full cost recovery and a financing factor is applied to the deferred portion of development costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the most part, 1995 fees approved by the Board do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not include significant changes in the level or structure of fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for priced services. For the electronic payment services_funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer, book-entry securities, and the automated clearing house  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ACH)_all operating costs and imputed expenses, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> targeted ROE, are expected to be recovered. Some electronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection fees will be raised to reflect the higher costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the higher service levels available through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fednet <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &reg; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  communications network. The Board, however, has approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a modest reduction in the funds transfer fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The check service also is expected to achieve full cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery, including targeted ROE, in 1995. Although continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume losses are anticipated due to depository institutions'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growing use of direct presentments under the same-day settlement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule and continued consolidation of the banking industry, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reserve Banks expect the decline in volume to be more moderate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than it was in 1994. The Board was able to approve modest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases in fees because the Reserve Banks are taking aggressive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps to reduce costs. For example, the Reserve Banks are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing staff and making greater use of automation to improve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating efficiency. In addition, the Reserve Banks are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improving deposit deadlines, promoting electronic presentment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit products, and developing products using image technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The noncash collection service has faced rapidly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declining volume levels since the Tax Equity and Fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) was enacted. Due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant volume losses, the Reserve Banks incurred an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating loss in 1993 and project operating losses in 1994 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995. The service should realize lower and more stable costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> once all operations are consolidated at two sites in 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In November 1993, when the Board considered the 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee schedules, volume-based fees were approved for selected check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products and the noncash collection service. The Board also has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested the staff to develop criteria for the use of volume- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based fees. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Econometric studies of the cost structure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Reserve payment services are being conducted to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if criteria based on scale efficiency are relevant. Preliminary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results indicate that the use of volume-based fees is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for paper-based check services. A similar study of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost structure of the noncash collection service was deemed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impractical because of the rapidly declining volume levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis of the cost structure of electronic payment products is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in progress. The Board has approved: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For the notice approving the use of volume-based fees for certain check and noncash products, see 58 FR 60649, November 17, 1993.

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: DON KING'S POST-FIGHT COMMENTS HEARD AT TRIAL  </P> <P> An audiotape of boxing promoter Don King's comments after Buster Douglas  knocked out Mike Tyson to win the heavyweight championship was played during  the trial of King's breach-of-contract suit against Douglas Monday in New York.  </P> <P> "All I'm looking for is justice and fair play -- for one side or another," King  said on Feb. 11 in Tokyo.  </P> <P> "There's a grave injustice here. It's an injustice if it holds that Mike Tyson  was knocked out."  </P> <P> King is scheduled to testify today.  </P> <P> King is suing Douglas and his manager, John Johnson, for allegedly breaching  King's promotional contract by signing a contract with the Mirage hotel in Las  Vegas for a bout against Evander Holyfield.  </P> <P> Jose Sulaiman, president of the World Boxing Council, who was called as a  witness for King, testified that King did not ask him to stop the fight after  Douglas was knocked down in the eighth round. Douglas was apparently down for  13 seconds because the referee failed to pick up the count of the timekeeper  and instead started his own count.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Two young women who posed for paintings shown in China's first major art  exhibit of nudes have hired lawyers and threatened to sue the exhibit's  sponsors because they failed to ask permission before "exposing the models'  secrets." Beijing newspapers on Thursday quoted the unidentified models as  saying that since the exhibit opened Dec. 22 at the China Art Gallery in the  capital, their husbands have thrown them out of their homes and asked for  divorces. The Legal Daily News reported that the models are asking for an  apology and for financial compensation. The exhibit of nearly 140 paintings of  nudes, ranging from portraits to abstracts, has drawn record crowds expected to  surpass a total of 150,000 before it closes next week. The exhibit charged an  unusually high admission price of 2 yuan (53 cents); the models were paid 2.10  yuan (57 cents) per hour for posing. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

The aforementoned checks are to be bought up and deposits  are  to be indexed for all owners, irrespective of the specified  place for acquiring the cars;    pay back to suppliers of agricultural products from the 1991  harvest, who sold grain, oil seeds, potatoes and vegetables on  terms envisaged by the 17 July 1991 RSFSR Council of Ministers  decree No. 403 "On Measures To Implement the 8 July 1991  Directive No. 1554-1 of the Chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet  and Chairman of the RSFSR Council of Ministers `On Additional  Measures To Establish State Grain and Other Food Resources in  1991,'" money owing on bonds through the payment of financial  compensation amounting to 70 times the price of the commodity  before 2 January 1992.    2. Carry out the measures mentioned in point 1 of this  decree during the period from 15 June 1994 and 1 June 1995 on  the basis of federal budget funds allocated for this purpose in  1994-1995.    3. It is to be laid down that the following owners of  specific interest-free 1990 state loan bonds are entitled to  financial compensation:    Russian Federation citizens living on the territory of  Russia  and outside it;    individuals living on the territory of the Russian  Federation  and deemed to be enforced migrants or refugees, irrespective of  where the bonds were acquired.    4. The Russian Federation Finance Ministry, Russian  Federation Economics Ministry, and Russian Federation State  Committee for Statistics are to present to the Russian  Federation Savings Bank before 1 June 1994 set consumer prices  for consumer goods, as envisaged by the 21 December 1989 USSR  Council of Ministers decree No. 1119 "On the Issuing of Specific  Interest-free State Loans" (except car prices).    5.

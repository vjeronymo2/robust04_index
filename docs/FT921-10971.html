			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Miyazawa queries US work ethic MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in remarks likely to escalate the war of words between Japan and the US, told parliament yesterday he had long felt that Americans 'may have lacked the work ethic,' Reuter reports from Tokyo. He told the budget committee of the House of Representatives: 'Because so many American university graduates were recruited into Wall Street, the number of engineers in charge of developing goods has declined.' Mr Miyazawa made the remarks when Mr Kabun Muto, former trade minister, asked for his views on trade friction between Tokyo and Washington. 'The problem lies in the management of US plants, doesn't it?' Mr Muto asked. The prime minister added: 'I think a similar case was found in Japan's bubble (economy). It is important to have the sweat on one's brow to produce added value.' The Foreign Ministry said later that Mr Miyazawa did not intend to criticise American people. An official said: 'The thrust of what the prime minister said in the Diet (parliament) was  .to stress, as a part of his economic philosphy, the importance of producing things and creating values by the sweat of our brow in our approach to work.' 'The phrase 'work ethic' was used to explain such philosophy of work, and the prime minister regrets any misunderstanding which may have been caused.' The White House later said that disparaging Japanese remarks about American workers were 'not helpful' but they could benefit the US in the long run. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, said: 'These kinds of comments are probably helpful in stirring the rages in all of us who want to compete, and show who the best work force really is.'</p>

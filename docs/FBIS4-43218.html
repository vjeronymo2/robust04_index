			<p>BFN     [Text] Quite understandably, Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi is very happy both at the strengthening of the  government coalition and at his personal success: he was on top  of his party's lists in all five Italian constituencies. Let us  listen now to the prime minister's first reaction after the  first projections last night. He was speaking on the phone to  RAI Uno.    [Begin Berlusconi recording] I think the victory will  encourage all cabinet members to continue in the same direction  in which we started. As far as I am concerned, I must say that  it will encourage me to try as hard as I can and to work with  enthusiasm and absolute commitment, since I have been rewarded  with the approval of so many citizens.    As for the situation in the Senate, I hope the opposition  will learn from what happened and that they will want to be in  opposition in a positive way. The opposition is comprised of  several groups today -- I clearly mean the Italian Popular Party  -- which should think about these results and about their  behavior. This would lead them, I believe, to get more in touch  with their electorate, that is, people who want to remain among  the moderates and want to support the government. [end  recording]</p>

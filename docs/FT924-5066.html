			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Surrey falls near Pounds 1m into loss and makes disposals THE SURREY Group, the bookmakers, reported a Pounds 946,000 pre-tax loss for the half year to September 30 compared with profits last time of Pounds 117,000. At the same time the group announced the disposal of 26 betting shops in Scotland to Stanley Racing, a subsidiary of Stanley Leisure Organisation, for a maximum Pounds 2.99m in cash. Mr R Green, the chairman, said the proceeds would be mainly used to reduce borrowings. Interest payable for the six months totalled Pounds 368,000 (Pounds 272,000). As a result of the disposals, which follow the sale of the majority of the group's betting shops in East Anglia, Surrey has been able to renegotiate its bank facilities with its principal banker, Allied Irish Banks. The directors consider the new working capital to be sufficient for the group's current requirements. Mr Green said that in the half year margins had been lower than for some years. Since the period-end there had been some improvement but it was too early to tell whether that was likely to continue. Turnover improved to Pounds 27.9m (Pounds 26.1m) but cost of sales increased to Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 23m) and there were higher administrative costs of Pounds 3.26m (Pounds 2.73m). Losses per share amounted to 0.49p (0.09p earnings). An extraordinary meeting to consider the disposal proposals will take place on December 16.</p>

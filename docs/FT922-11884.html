			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Holders of O&amp;Y public bonds may be paid HOLDERS of publicly-traded bonds issued by Olympia &amp; York are in a stronger position than many bank lenders in the restructuring of the cash-strapped property developer's Dollars 12bn debt in what is a rare reversal of roles. O&amp;Y has failed to make interest and principal payments on several bank loans and private placements in the past month but holders of about Dollars 1.5bn worth of bonds in O&amp;Y buildings in the US and Canada are likely to be paid at least their interest on time, provided the individual properties continue to generate sufficient cash flow. 'It would be very rare for an O&amp;Y bond or debenture holder to rank behind the banks,' a Toronto real estate financier said yesterday. Mr Jim Titus, vice-president at Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York rating agency, adds that the bondholders will be protected even in the event of an O&amp;Y bankruptcy. Trustees would take possession of income from the buildings and, in a worst case scenario, could appoint new property managers. Ironically, the strong position of the bond holders is largely due to the secrecy which has enveloped O&amp;Y over the years. O&amp;Y's refusal to make its financial statements public forced it to put other safeguards in place when it tapped outside investors to refinance many of its North American properties in the mid and late-1980s. O&amp;Y provided financial statements to its main bankers, except for details of the leases signed with tenants in its buildings. As a result, many of its private placements and bank loans are at least partially secured by corporate guarantees. Only about Dollars 300m of O&amp;Y's debt is unsecured, but questions are bound to be raised whether the banks were cautious enough in evaluating security for many of their other loans. The securitised buildings include First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's 72-storey Toronto flagship; 55 Water Street, a 53-storey tower in lower Manhattan; another Manhattan building at 59 Maiden Lane; two large office buildings in Calgary; and one in Ottawa. To attract investors, O&amp;Y set up single-purpose companies for each building with no recourse to the parent. Rental income is channelled into a specific operating account from which only running expenses can be paid before debt service obligations. In most cases, the bondholders have a first lien against the assets. O&amp;Y has been able to take cash out of these projects only by pledging collateral. In the case of 55 Water Street and 59 Maiden Lane, for instance, it has posted a blue-chip surety bond issued by Aetna Insurance. Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York credit-rating agencies, say this collateral is likely to be sufficient to meet interest payments. Interest of Dollars 35m is due to bondholders of the Water Street property on June 30. No such escrow requirement exists on the Dollars 800m privately-placed Eurobond secured by a building at the World Financial Centre, on which O&amp;Y failed to make a Dollars 62m interest payment earlier this month. Mr Larry Miller, vice-president at Moody's, said the single-purpose companies 'were designed to be insulated from the insolvency of the parent'. Investors continue to face a risk, however, from the weak North American office rental market. Banks have on at least one occasion already had to carry the cost of safeguards given to public holders of O&amp;Y securities. Five Canadian, US, and Japanese institutions as well as an Austrian bank were required to retire a Dollars 160m commercial paper programme last year secured by Gulf Canada Square, a Calgary office building. Investors were reluctant to roll over their paper as prospects for the western Canadian oil industry and property market soured.</p>

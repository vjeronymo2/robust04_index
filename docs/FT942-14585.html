			<p>940420 FT  20 APR 94 / Asia to spend Dollars 950bn on infrastructure Asia will need to spend up to Dollars 950bn (Pounds 646bn) on infrastructure by the year 2000 to meet the demand created by rapid economic growth and growing populations, the Asian Development Bank estimates today, writes Alexander Nicoll. The bank's annual report says developing member countries - virtually all Asian countries except Japan and North Korea - put 5 per cent of their gross domestic product each year into physical infrastructure. This 'will have to rise by another 2 per cent over the next decade if supply is to keep pace with demand,' it says. It estimates the needs of the power and transport sectors at Dollars 300bn to Dollars 350bn each, telecommunications at Dollars 150bn and water supply and sanitation at Dollars 80bn to Dollars 100bn. The ADB says this cannot be financed from traditional sources so it suggests wider application of user charges, tighter commercial discipline on utilities, and greater private sector involvement.</p>

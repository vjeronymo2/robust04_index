			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Defense Secretary General Antonio </F> Riviello Bazan by Jesus Casasola "on the occasion of the  commemoration of freedom of speech;" place and date not given;  from the "Evening News Panorama" newscast]    [Text] Mexican Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello  Bazan has affirmed that the National Army will not patrol the  streets of Mexico during the 21 August elections and that its  only role in that process will be to safeguard the electoral  balloting material.    Gen. Riviello said the Army is apolitical and is ready to  serve whomever the people elect in the August elections.  Regarding the troop movement in Guerrero State, the defense  secretary said there is nothing abnormal about it.    [Begin Riviello recording] Right now the citizens are  working  normally amid peace and tranquillity. The Armed Forces must  fulfill their constitutional role. They are called upon to  fulfill their constitutional mission throughout the republic.  We are represented by the military zones, which are called upon  to be aware of the national problems and of the jurisdiction of  national defense organizations. [end recording]    Defense Secretary Gen. Antonio Riviello breakfasted with  reporters this morning on the occasion of the commemoration of  freedom of speech. He said there is social peace in Mexico and  that the Defense Secretariat does not know of any specific  problem that could destabilize the country, such as weapons  smuggling.    [Begin recording] [Casasola] During this time of political  activity, there is a climate of social peace in the country,  Defense Secretary Gen. Antonio Riviella stated. He said the  Mexican Army will always preserve the sovereignty and security  of the people. Interviewed at the end of the breakfast held on  the occasion of the commemoration of freedom of speech, he said  the Armed Forces' commitments are to support society in case of  disasters or tasks as important as fighting drug trafficking to  benefit Mexican society.    [Riviello] There has been a profound modification in the  National Defense Secretariat, both in its objectives and its  achievements. Perhaps with more calm, I will gladly talk about  that.    [Casasola] How does the social peace situation stand at the  moment, Sir?    [Riviello] Well, the citizens are dedicated to their normal  activities, working normally and calmly amid peace and  tranquillity.    [Casasola] Mr. Secretary, what exactly did you mean when you  said the Armed Forces are keeping abreast of things in Oaxaca,  Guerrero?    [Riviello] The citizens are working normally amid peace and  tranquillity. The Armed Forces must fulfill the constitutional  role assigned to them. They are called upon to fulfill their  constitutional mission throughout the republic.    [Casasola] Do you mean throughout the entire republic?    [Riviello] Yes, throughout the country we are represented by  the military zones, which are supposed to stay abreast of  problems involving national defense.    [Casasola] Could any problems arise at this time?    [Riviello] So far, no.    [Casasola] Could problems be greater than those that already  exist?    [Riviello] I have no information about that. [end recording]    Antonio Riviello Bazan denied that there is arms  trafficking.  He said no shipments of AK-47 rifles have been detected. He  did comment, however, on weapons seized during the  counternarcotics campaign of the present administration.    [Begin recording] [Riviello] As you have seen in the media,  we have seized over 133,000 weapons during this administration.  We have not confirmed any massive smuggling of weapons. It is  our obligation and that of other government offices to ensure  that this does not occur.    [Casasola] Is this equipment very sophisticated?    [Riviello] No, the type seized by the Defense Secretariat is  of all types, revolvers, rifles. [end recording]    In his speech, Antonio Riviello Bazan recognized the work  carried out by Mexican reporters, saying they have become a  decisive force in the country's democratic life. During the  interview, he added that the Mexican Army is apolitical and will  support the president elected by the people in the 21 August  elections.</p>

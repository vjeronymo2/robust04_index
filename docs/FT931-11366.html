			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Queen says Sun broke copyright THE QUEEN'S solicitors have written to The Sun newspaper threatening legal action for alleged breach of copyright when the paper published the text of her 1992 Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, The Sun's editor, confirmed last night that he had received a letter from solicitors Farrer &amp; Co giving him seven days to respond to a demand for damages and costs or face a High Court action. The letter said printing the text of the Queen's speech on its front page on December 23 was a 'clear infringement of Her Majesty's copyright'. The Sun said: 'We shall be vigorously defending the action'. Buckingham Palace said last night it was not prepared to comment on the matter at this stage. Mr Richard Price, a partner of City lawyers Taylor Joynson Garrett who specialises in intellectual property law, said the Queen had copyright in anything that she had written subject to her licensing its publication. 'The question is did The Sun obtain the speech lawfully? If they did they would effectively be licensed to use it and the Queen would have no case,' Price said. 'If, however, they obtained it unlawfully or they breached the terms of the licence by, for example, breaking the embargo then the Queen would have a solid case for breach of copyright.' The damages sought by the Queen are not specified in the letter from Farrer &amp; Co, but the final amount is expected to be in six figures. One lawyer said last night that the dispute will depend on whether The Sun published the speech early in order to obtain a commercial advantage over its rivals. This is the latest episode in a long-running battle between the palace and The Sun. The last time the Queen instructed her lawyers to take action against the newspaper was also over a breach of copyright. In 1988 the paper paid Pounds 100,000-plus costs in an out-of-court settlement after it printed a private photograph of members of the royal family. The year before, The Sun paid an estimated Pounds 20,000 to charities after the Queen extracted an apology for the publication of a private letter from the Duke of Edinburgh to the head of the Royal Marines. No action has been taken over stories about the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales or over publication of transcripts of alleged phone conversations between members of the royal family.</p>

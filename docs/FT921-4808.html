			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Current account deficit cut to Pounds 4.4bn HIGHER THAN expected invisible earnings in 1991 cut Britain's current account deficit to Pounds 4.4bn, the smallest annual shortfall since 1987. Provisional figures released last month put last year's current account deficit at Pounds 5.8bn, but hefty revisions in the fourth-quarter figures led to yesterday's improved figure which compares with a Pounds 15.4bn deficit in 1990. The current account deficit in the fourth quarter of 1991 was revised down to just Pounds 642m from an earlier estimated shortfall of Pounds 1.6bn. The surplus on invisible earnings, which cover trade in services and various financial transfers, was revised up to Pounds 1.9bn from Pounds 900m. The invisible surplus for 1991 as a whole was Pounds 5.7bn. Although the Treasury welcomed the 'sharp recovery in invisibles', economists were more cautious, pointing to 'unsustainable' features in the fourth-quarter figures that reflected one-off changes rather than underlying improvements in the economy. Much of the improvement to the invisibles balance in the fourth quarter stemmed from lower government payments to the European Community. The UK government received a payment of Pounds 500m back from the EC in the fourth quarter so that the UK's overall payments to EC institutions dropped from Pounds 1.6bn in the third quarter to Pounds 1.1bn in the fourth. There was a big jump in earnings from interest, profits and dividends within the invisibles balance to Pounds 1.1bn, from Pounds 599m in the third quarter. However, economists said this was another potentially unsustainable figure. Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at the Nomura Research Institute, said the sharp increase in net interest income from overseas was the result of a fall in the amount of profits paid to overseas investors which in turn reflected a fall in UK profits last year. Further breakdown of the invisibles showed that the surplus in services, such as banking and insurance, shrank to Pounds 1.3bn in the fourth quarter from Pounds 1.5bn in the third. The Central Statistical Office said the smaller surplus was mainly a result of a poor performance by Lloyd's, the London insurance market. Overall exports of invisible items totalled Pounds 28bn, down from Pounds 28.8bn in the third quarter. Imports totalled Pounds 26bn, down from Pounds 27.7bn in the third quarter and down from Pounds 29bn a year ago. A break down of capital flows showed that UK investment overseas slowed. However, inward investment increased with a strong uptake of government bonds. The balancing item, which represents the discrepancy between the current account deficit and recorded capital flows into Britain, was a record Pounds 14.7bn</p>

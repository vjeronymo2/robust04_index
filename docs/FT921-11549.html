			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Management: Nannies take first steps in Whitehall - Childcare / Moves to provide nurseries for the children of civil servants When Angela Rumbold, chairman of the ministerial group on women's issues, opened the First Steps nursery for the children of Westminster-based civil servants in December 1991, she could claim more than just a fashionable interest in childcare provision. A Cabinet Office study in 1990 had shown that a central London nursery could save the civil service around Pounds 40,000 a year if it enabled even modest numbers of mothers to return to work after the birth of their children. As Rumbold put it: 'More and more, employers are recognising that one way to retain valuable staff is to help make it easier to combine career and family responsibilities'. The problem will become more acute for the civil service as the number of new entrants to the labour market drops in the mid-1990s. Like other employers which have traditionally relied on a steady stream of school-leavers, government departments will either have to offer higher wages to maintain recruitment or find ways to retain more of the staff they currently have in post. Luring back staff who have stopped work to have children is one option. The First Steps nursery offers places for 27 pre-school children of civil servants from five central London departments and the Metropolitan Police Office. Located just behind the Tate Gallery, the nursery is run by the Westminster Children's Society under the aegis of the Home Office. Parents pay Pounds 60 a week per child, with the rest of the cost being picked up by the employing department. First Steps is one of more than 20 civil service nurseries based in towns such as Guildford and Bootle where there are large government offices. The biggest, with 65 places, is the Sunbeam Nursery in Croydon, run by the Home Office in the headquarters of the Immigration Service. More are in the pipeline: the Inland Revenue which already has seven is planning to open another nine, including a purpose-built nursery in a new office block in Leicester. There is no central organisation which can set up nurseries for different departments and agencies, since provision depends on local circumstances. In each case, a sponsoring department or local office takes the lead in setting up the nursery, offering surplus places to other departments. Partnerships between departments are fostered by a small unit in the Cabinet Office which provides information to departments and acts as a clearing house for spare nursery places. In some parts of the country, departments and agencies have formed partnerships with other local employers to run nurseries. In Sheffield, two government departments share nursery facilities with Midland Bank, the largest provider of workplace nursery places in the private sector. Partners in other parts of the country include Sainsbury's, county councils and local colleges. Also popular among civil servants with children are the holiday play schemes now running in more than 80 locations. These provide entertainment and stimulation for children during the school holidays, typically at a cost of Pounds 5 a day. Stephanie Bradley, a mother of two, is enthusiastic about the play scheme run by the Inland Revenue at Bush House in London's Strand. 'In the past, I have had to save up my leave for the summer holidays and take unpaid time off,' she says. 'It just wouldn't be possible in my present job as press officer.' In Scotland, three departments participate in local out-of-school schemes which look after children between the end of the school day and the parents' return from work. Other pilot schemes may be run, though they are more difficult to set up because they must be located close to schools and home, rather than the workplace. Finally, the civil service has pioneered flexible working arrangements which help staff combine parenthood with a career. More than 27,000 women (and over 1,000 men) work part-time or as job-sharers, a three-fold increase since 1984. The vast majority are in clerical and administrative jobs, but more than 250 women and 150 men at the senior grades 7 and above now work part-time. Other patterns of flexible working have been developed, including annual hours and part-year appointments which allow parents to work during term-time and take time off during school holidays. Homeworking, fixed-term appointments and recurring temporary appointments have all been used to help civil servants combine home responsibilities with a civil service career. 'It is too soon to put a figure on the effects of childcare provision on recruitment and retention,' according to Susan Haird, head of equal opportunities at the Cabinet Office. 'But where childcare is available, there is keen interest from many applicants. 'Departments and agencies tell us that nurseries and holiday play schemes reduce absenteeism, sick leave and special leave taken because private childcare arrangements break down. 'Resignations for domestic reasons also seem to drop and a higher proportion of women civil servants having babies return to work at the end of their maternity leave.' This is one of a series of articles on childcare.</p>

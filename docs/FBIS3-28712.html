[6 February] -- Kadazans can  choose from many other capable leaders who are honest,  hardworking, and who care for the people to lead them, Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said today.    He said the people of Sabah, particularly the Kadazan/Dusun  community, should not sacrifice their well-being by supporting  Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party -- PBS] President Datuk  Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan's aspiration to continue as the chief  minister. [passage omitted]    Dr. Mahathir said as Sabah was lagging behind in  development,  the people now had the opportunity to be on par with their  counterparts in other states by giving the mandate to the BN in  the coming elections. He said a Barisan government would be fair  to all races. "When the BN makes promises, they will be  delivered," he said to the applause of the large crowd. Dr.  Mahathir said Barisan had nothing against the PBS but could not  get along with its leaders, particularly Pairin, who had proven  himself to be insincere.    He said that during the 1990 general election, Pairin played  out the BN by pulling out of the coalition a few days before  polling. "Pairin now wants to return to the BN, but how can we  trust him?" He urged the voters not to be duped by the PBS'  tactics of confusing the people that UMNO [United Malays  National Organization] was trying to grab power in the state.  [passage omitted]</p>

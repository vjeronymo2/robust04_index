			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Goodyear sees second-quarter earnings rise GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the only surviving large US-owned tyre group, yesterday forecast an increase in second-quarter earnings to between Dollars 130m and Dollars 140m on sales of around Dollars 3bn. Second-quarter profits last year came to Dollars 106.9m and in 1991 were Dollars 22.5m. The forecast would signify further improvement in the once-troubled company. Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, told analysts that the operating margin was expected to approach the company's long-term objective of 10 per cent, with plants operating near capacity worldwide. Interest expense had been reduced, he said, as a result of a debt reduction programme. The strong second-quarter figures in a weak market suggest that the company has continued to gain market share against its main European and Japanese rivals, Michelin, Continental and Bridgestone/Firestone. Goodyear increased its share of the US passenger vehicle tyre market last year to 31.5 per cent, 1.5 percentage points more than 1991. Ms Sue Zajac, a Goodyear spokeswoman, said growth was spread across all segments of the tyre market, although the success of its Aquatred tyre in the car market contributed most to revenues. Goodyear's car tyre sales have been boosted by expanded distribution in retail stores, such as Sears Roebuck. The company has also benefited from aggressive brand advertising, up about 30 per cent on previous years, and demand from car companies for tyres on new cars. Ms Zajac said this was due both to increased market share and a rise in second-quarter car production. However, Mr Gault suggested that there was some concern with weak demand in the sector, saying there was no strong recovery and that the economy was 'hesitant'. The US passenger vehicle tyre market is expected to grow by just 1 or 2 per cent this year, compared with 5 per cent last year.</p>

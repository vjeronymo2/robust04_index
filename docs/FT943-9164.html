			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hopes of increased bid boost Esab shares Shares in Esab, the Swedish welding group, yesterday defied a sharp general fall on the Stockholm stock exchange as investors gambled on a higher bid from Charter, the UK industrial group. In spite of a near 2 per cent fall in the general index sparked by an unexpected rise in interest rates, Esab B shares rose a further SKr5 to SKr365, SKr20 above Charter's offer of SKr345 per share. The takeover ran into trouble earlier this week when five Swedish institutional shareholders, holding almost 20 per cent of the voting capital in Esab rejected the Charter bid, saying it was underpriced. Charter already holds acceptances worth 53 per cent of the votes, but set a condition of winning 90 per cent acceptances by today's deadline in order to achieve a complete takeover of the world's largest welding equipment supplier. Charter said it would see how holders of the balance of the shares reacted before deciding its next move, which is not expected before the weekend. The UK company still insists its bid - recommended by the Esab board and accepted by Esab's controlling shareholder, the Wallenberg company Incentive  -is fair, but many minority shareholders believe a higher offer is likely. Charter has not publicly ruled out raising the bid in light of a sharply increased profit forecast issued by Esab earlier this week and the rise in the Esab share price. But Mr Jeffrey Herbert, the chief executive, has also suggested Charter could pull out of the deal, as its agreement with Incentive allows if the 90 per cent level is not reached. However, in Stockholm, shareholders believe Charter will be reluctant to walk away from an acquisition which so neatly satisfies its long search for a fourth international industrial arm to add to its interests in building equipment, coal and rail track equipment.</p>

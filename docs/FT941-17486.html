			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Diversify and die These are hard times for conglomerates. The leading UK examples of the form all underperformed the stock market last year, while Imperial Chemical Industries broke itself up on the grounds that it had become too like a conglomerate to be manageable. Italy's giant state holding company, IRI, said one reason for being privatised was that the conglomerate principle was outdated. The argument falls under two main headings. First, as ICI observed, technology is becoming ever more sophisticated and fast-moving. As a result, it becomes increasingly hard to make informed choices on investment across different industries. This may be why many companies which might once have qualified as conglomerates have in recent years chosen to narrow their focus. In the UK, even the remaining true conglomerates like Hanson and BTR have stuck to relatively low-tech industries. The last old-style conglomerate bid battle in the UK, between Hanson and Tomkins, was for a manufacturer of sliced bread. The second part of the argument might be termed evolutionary. In the developed world, conglomerates are out of fashion. In developing countries, the reverse is the case. In many Asian countries, large chunks of the local economies are controlled by private conglomerates. In a transitional economy like South Korea, the landscape is still dominated by vast and sprawling groups such as Samsung and Hyundai. At the same time, such companies are increasingly criticised in Korea as having outlived their usefulness. In short, runs the argument, conglomerates work best at a certain stage of economic development. When growth rates are high and management talents scarce, it makes sense for those who have the skills to spread themselves widely. The more mature and sophisticated the economy becomes, the greater the need for specialisation. So far, so good. Yet 1993 was also the year when the title of America's largest company by market value was decisively claimed by a conglomerate, General Electric. On the face of it, this is all wrong. America is the world's most advanced economy and it is stuffed with large, specialised companies. GE is no low-tech company. To be sure, it is exceptionally well-run, and its chairman, Mr Jack Welch, is perhaps the most admired manager in America. But the exception need not prove the rule; and it is striking that GE defends its conglomerate status in terms which in other quarters became unfashionable a decade ago. Conglomerates have a breadth of experience and talent: and above all, they operate in different business cycles, so that one business can balance out another. As the past year has shown, specialisation is not without its risks. The pharmaceutical industry, hitherto a model of high-tech focus, has scrambled to diversify in the face of the administration's attack on healthcare costs. In the UK, specialist food retailers such as Sainsbury and Tesco have seen their share prices weaken in the face of low-cost competition. The old-style conglomerate is probably on its way out. But managers should not come to believe uncritically that a focused business is necessarily a safe one. As Mark Twain observed, having all your eggs in one basket may be no bad thing: but you had better watch that basket.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Heseltine broadens energy review: Major tries to restore authority by rebalancing economic policy towards recovery THE GOVERNMENT was confi-dent last night that it had headed off a House of Commons defeat over coal closures by broadening the scope of its planned review to include a detailed analysis of Britain's long-term energy requirements. The latest concessions to Conservative critics came as Mr John Major signalled a drive to restore his battered authority at Westminster by rebalancing his economic policy to emphasise the priority of recovery. The prime minister told colleagues he was willing to respond to the depth of the recession with further cuts in interest rates if public spending was kept under control. But he made clear that on one issue - his determination to ratify the Maastricht treaty - he was not prepared to give any ground to his critics on the Conservative backbenches. With Conservative MPs deeply gloomy about the economic outlook, Mr Major indicated that international deflationary pressures might allow interest rates to drop below the 8 per cent mark without risking an upsurge in inflation. But he also warned that next month's autumn economic statement must see the tightest squeeze on public sector pay in recent memory if the Treasury was to convince financial markets that it remained serious about containing the pace of price rises. The prime minister is said to be determined that the sharp cuts in most Whitehall spending programmes needed to meet the Treasury's targets should not fall on projects which have a direct impact on 'jobs and growth'. That implies that increases in public sector pay will be below 2 per cent and might be frozen. He has also indicated that he wants the government to offset the inevitable reductions in some capital spending programmes by scrapping Whitehall rules which inhibit private sector involvement in large-scale infrastructure projects. One suggestion last night was that reductions in the Department of Transport's road-building programme could be matched by a drive to make it much easier to allow the private sector to build toll roads. Mr Major's decision to rebalance his economic policy came as senior ministers engaged in a frantic effort to restore discipline among Tory MPs after the government's embarrassing U-turn over the bulk of its coal closure programme. The latest concessions on the pit review were foreshadowed by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in meetings with Tory MPs designed to ensure their support in today's Labour-sponsored debate on the industry. Mr Heseltine promised that the planned review of the future of 21 threatened pits would be wide-ranging and open, embracing an strategic analysis of Britain's energy requirements. That pledge was reinforced by Lord Wakeham, Lord Privy Seal, who told the House of Lords that a whole range of issues would be covered by the review - including the level of coal imports, the relationship between electricity suppliers and the owners of gas generation stations and allegations that some suppliers were abusing their market positions. Mr Heseltine had suggested previously that the review would be much more narrowly focused on the viability of the threatened pits, but was forced to give further ground to quell the disquiet among Conservative MPs. After the latest concessions he received a public assurance that the executive committee of the powerful backbench 1922 committee would now urge all Tory MPs to back the government - and a tacit acknowledgement that his own cabinet position was now secure. Mr Major emphasised the government's willingness to listen to its critics during clashes in the House of Commons with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. He stressed that all the evidence given to the review would be available publicly and that the government would co-operate fully with a planned inquiry of the trade and industry select committee into the pit closures. The judgment of Conservative party managers at Westminster last night was that the concessions would ensure that all but a handful of potential rebels on its own side would now support the government against the Labour motion demanding a complete moratorium on all closures.

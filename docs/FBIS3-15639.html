			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Rukh believes that holding presidential elections  without determining the presidential status and authority by the  [words indistinct] Supreme Council is illogical. This is the  essence of a statement by the Rukh Small Council, which was  publicized today. According to Council members, the people  should know whom they are going to elect -- only a head of  state, or a head of executive authority. The Small Council also  resolved to immediately begin preparations for local elections  by all the Rukh structures.</p>

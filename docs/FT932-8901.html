			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Spending curbs hit drug sales GROWTH of the European drugs market continued to slow during the first quarter this year as governments struggled to control healthcare spending. Underlying sales of prescription medicines in the top seven European markets increased only 2.1 per cent during the first three months. During the whole of 1992 the same markets grew 8 per cent. The seven markets, about 85 per cent of the entire west European market, actually fell in dollar terms from Dollars 11.923bn (Pounds 7.7bn) during the first quarter last year to Dollars 11.166bn over the same period this year. The figures, compiled by IMS International, the pharmaceuticals market research company, include purchases by pharmacies, representing about 80 per cent of total drugs sales. The statistics exclude end-users such as hospitals. Sales in Germany fell from Dollars 2.942bn to Dollars 2.527bn. Excluding exchange rates, they dropped 13.4 per cent, following price cuts introduced at the beginning of the year and followed by a price freeze. France remains Europe's largest single market and the third largest in the world after the US and Japan. Spain, which has recently overtaken the UK as the fifth largest market, is now Europe's fastest-growing market for drugs sales, increasing 14.4 per cent, compared with the UK growth of 11 per cent. The British government is concerned about the UK drugs bill.  ------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN DRUG PURCHASES USDollars m  ------------------------------------------------- (Retail pharmacies)                     January    January    % growth                    to March   to March   excluding                        1992       1993    exchange  ------------------------------------------------- 1  France             2,952      3,169        +7.8 2  Germany            2,942      2,527       -13.4 3  Italy              2,822      2,282        +2.1 4  Spain              1,209      1,215       +14.4 5  UK                 1,278      1,186       +11.0 6  Belgium              377        397        +6.5 7  Netherlands          343        390       +14.4  ------------------------------------------------- Total                11,923     11,166        +2.1  ------------------------------------------------- Source: IMS International  -------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Jet partnership with Japanese discussed BRITISH Aerospace is discussing with Japan's three leading aerospace companies a possible partnership in its 146 regional jet programme. The three are Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. BAe has been seeking industrial partners for its regional jet programme, which has suffered from the downturn in civil aviation and the acute financial difficulties of smaller airlines. BAe executives confirmed yesterday that the company had talked with several European and Japanese manufacturers but that it was particularly interested in an alliance with Japan. A Japanese partnership would boost BAe's presence in the Asia-Pacific civil aircraft market, which is expected to grow strongly in the next 10 years. The Japanese companies are interested in a partnership venture with an established western aerospace manufacturer which would give them access to the development of a commercial aircraft programme rather than just sub-contracting work. Mitsubishi has discussed co-operation in the regional aircraft sector with Deutsche Aerospace. These talks are understood not to have progressed. BAe has offered the Japanese manufacturers an opportunity to join its 146 programme, including development of a 100-seat regional airliner. The European Airbus consortium, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake, has also held preliminary talks with the big three Japanese companies. This was to discuss a possible partnership in the development of a very large Airbus aircraft programme, involving a 600-seater jumbo airliner towards the end of the decade. The Japanese companies have so far been tied to the US Boeing company, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, but their role in Boeing programmes has involved only sub-contracting work. BAe and Airbus would offer the Japanese an opportunity to share in the development of commercial aircraft programmes, something Boeing has been reluctant to do. BAe has been seeking a partnership to rationalise its loss-making 146 business as part of its overall restructuring strategy. The UK group has called for a rationalisation of the regional aircraft industry, where competition has become intense because of the large number of rival aircraft programmes. BAe's link with the Japanese Honda car group in its Rover car subsidiary has helped increase the UK company's visibility in the Japanese market. The Japanese companies have also shown interest in BAe's profitable jet business involving the 125 corporate aircraft family. BAe has made it clear, however, that it is not considering selling this concern at this stage.</p>

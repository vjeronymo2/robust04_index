			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Manifesto rebuff for Tory Euro-sceptics Mr John Major has rejected calls from the Tory right wing to recast in Euro-sceptic terms the government's manifesto for the June 9 European elections. The near-final version of the document sticks with the careful compromises set out in the original draft written by foreign secretary Douglas Hurd. The draft marks a significant setback for the party's anti-Europeans. The document has been shortened to give it a sharper edge and sections attacking Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also been toughened up. Report, Page 26</p>

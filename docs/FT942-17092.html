			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Shares shake off political worries in Italy Financial markets yesterday generally shrugged off the threat by Forza Italia, the political party formed by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi to force Italy back to the polls if a new government could not be formed. They had earlier been unsettled by bickering within the right-wing alliance which won last week's general elections. Despite the prospect of continued political uncertainty, the main Milan stock market index closed nearly 1 per cent higher yesterday, although the lira lost ground against the US dollar and the D-Mark. It closed in London at L1,654.83 against the dollar from L1,640, and at L965 from L960.8 against the D-Mark. Analysts said they were surprised equities had not suffered, but predicted that Mr Berlusconi and his allies would eventually form a government. On Tuesday night, Mr Berlusconi raised the political stakes by suspending talks on forming a government. He said negotiations with his ill-matched allies - the federalists of the Northern League and the centralising far-right of the National Alliance - would restart only when President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro had decided who should be prime minister. The Northern League's leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, has spent most of the last week sniping at Mr Berlusconi, claiming he should not be prime minister. Forza Italia's spokesman hit back yesterday, saying: 'If Umberto Bossi betrays the will of the people once again, preventing the formation of a government, there will be no alternative except a return to the polls.' Forza Italia officials believe that if Mr Bossi does not fall into line, several of the League's newly elected deputies could defect to Mr Berlusconi's party. Mr Bossi was expected to hold talks in Rome yesterday with representatives of the weakened centre parties.</p>

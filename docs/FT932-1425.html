			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bull in link with US computer company GROUPE Bull of France and Packard Bell, a US personal computer manufacturer, yesterday announced an agreement in principle to form an alliance between the US company and Zenith Data Systems, Bull's microcomputer arm. Bull said it was taking a 19.9 per cent interest in the privately-held US company but refused to disclose the value of the stake. Under the terms of the alliance, ZDS and Packard Bell will jointly design and manufacture desktop PCs, giving both companies the benefit of their combined engineering expertise and the high-volume, high-efficiency manufacturing technology used by Packard Bell. ZDS will supply Packard Bell with private-label versions of the French company's notebook and sub-notebook PCs. It already has an agreement with IBM for the supply of notebook computers, but the new deal will allow it to find greater cost efficiencies through increased volumes. A pioneer in portable computing, ZDS has been losing market share to Compaq and Apple since its acquisition by Groupe Bull. Mr Bernard Pache, Groupe Bull chairman and chief executive, said the deal reinforced Bull's commitment to the PC market. Packard Bell is a leading supplier of low-priced 'clones' of IBM's market-leading PC designs. It is the third-largest US supplier in unit terms of PCs, according to market research organisation International Data Corporation.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (2): Split over speed of reform - Politics / The diminutive figure of Mr Deng Xiaoping towers over orthodox political debate. He is the only one of the octogenarian leadership with the intellectual vigour and personal clout able to exercise a decisive influence on events in China Any discussion of politics must take into account three facts of life concerning the Chinese polity. Firstly, the Communist Party of China has abandoned Marxism, though not Leninism. The party now stands for staying in power, above all else. But communist egalitarianism and central planning, which made the country poor, has given way to tolerance of inequality and markets, which might make it rich. Secondly, political life is still dominated by a clique of elderly revolutionaries, the primus inter pares of whom is Deng Xiaoping, 87. Mr Deng's aim is to ensure that China's door remains open to foreign economic development, though not ideas. Many of the rest appear to stand for little more than safeguarding the future of their children and followers. Thirdly, and crucially, the Chinese leadership has not devised an institutional structure for the transfer of power from one generation to the next. In an age when Chinese leaders have repudiated assassination as a political instrument, politics at the very top is as much about correctness or deviation in policy as it is about brokering compromises and forging consensus between competing interests. It is against this background that events in 1992, both past and forthcoming, have to be set. The two key ones are Mr Deng's trip to the southern province of Guangdong at the beginning of the year, and the 14th Congress of the Communist Party due to be held in the last quarter of this year. The diminutive figure of Mr Deng towers over orthodox political debate in China. He is architect of the country's economic reforms over the past 13 years and is the only one of the octogenarian leadership with the intellectual vigour and personal clout able to exercise a decisive influence on events in China. That Mr Deng can still exercise this power underlines the essentially feudal nature of Chinese politics as he holds no formal position in either the government or, more importantly, the Communist Party. But Mr Deng's influence and power should not be overstated; he is not a latter-day absolute monarch whose writ runs unlimited. His trip to the south went unreported in China's media for nearly two months. His personal intervention - a rare attendance at a politburo meeting  -was needed to get the working leadership's endorsement of his views after an intense rearguard action was fought by opponents mainly located in the party's propaganda and culture bureaucracies. His personal testament - released to the party as Central Committee Document Number 2 at the beginning of March - had to be censored before its release because it contained criticisms of senior party officials. And he had to court the military's approval. The form, if not all the content, of Mr Deng's thought has won broad support. Any visitor to provincial China cannot but be impressed by the lift Mr Deng's sojourn to the south has given Chinese officials who are charged with administering local economies and local interests. It is no coincidence either that his biggest supporters in Beijing are those officials who have come to the leadership via senior positions in the provinces. The consensus which appears to be taking shape nationally is one which supports economic reform and further foreign engagement. Few party officials would disagree with the proposition that growth is good. They know that rising prosperity is popular with the Chinese people; most probably agree with Mr Deng that salvation lies only in going forward, not back. As Deng noted in Document 2: 'The people are pleased and the world has been astonished' with China's development over the past decade. Where disagreement exists is on the speed of reform and economic growth and the role of the centre versus the provinces. This came to the fore during the meeting of the National People's Congress in March when prime minister Li Peng's work report was amended 150 times - a public humiliation without recent precedent in Chinese politics. But Mr Li survived this humiliation; importantly his target rate of growth for the Chinese economy of 6 per cent was left unamended. However, the debate over the growth rate and centre versus province is becoming more academic as each day passes. Beijing has been singularly unsuccessful in developing instruments of macroeconomic control while the provinces are learning well the ancient lessons of Chinese politics: they mouth the line but go their own way. Reform measures on the agenda, such as those planned for state enterprises and social welfare, suggest a further weakening of central control. What is clear from the current debate is that political reform is not on the agenda. As one western diplomat said, concerning Document 2: 'It emphasised (Deng's) overriding concern for social order and economic reform. It gave no sign of hope of any liberalisation in the political sphere. Deng looks to the model of development in South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan; he doesn't believe that economic reform has to be accompanied by political reform.' As Mr Deng approaches the end of his life his greatest failure has been his inability either to devise a structure for power transfer or, more traditionally, to anoint a successor. He failed with the late Hu Yaobang and the disgraced Zhao Ziyang, and he shows little enthusiasm for his third choice, Jiang Zemin, the general secretary of the party. The 14th congress of the party is due to be held later in the year. Congresses occur every five years and are important events in the life of the party. A new central committee and politburo are selected - two of the most powerful institutions in the country. If Mr Deng's southern tour was about putting new vigour into the economic reform debate it was also about the leadership. As he has said: 'A correct political line has to be underwritten by a correct organisational line.' Determining the organisation is something the communist party is currently engaged in. Party committees all over the country are selecting delegates to provincial assemblies which, in turn, will select representatives to the congress. The 14th congress is the last one in which the gerontocracy can play a large role, assuming no significant deaths before the end of the year. The leadership that is selected will have to take China to the next, more difficult, stage of reform. Observers in Beijing, both foreign and local, believe that the congress may well remove Mr Li from the prime ministership, though not from the leadership. It is felt that Mr Li is not wholeheartedly behind the economic reform movement, that his heart really lies in central planning. Rumoured successors include Zhu Rongji, the industry minister and Zou Jiahua, head of the state planning commission. Mr Zhu appears to be of the liberal/reformist stripe and is well connected with Jiang Zemin whom he succeeded as mayor of Shanghai. But Mr Zhu is seen as possibly too reformist and the smart money in Beijing is betting on Mr Zou, a more conservative reformer, for the premiership if Mr Li loses his job. As one observer of Beijing politics observed: 'I have never seen a party congress that lived up to the advanced billing. Congresses always get stalled on personnel issues. China is a big country with factions and interest groups to be taken account of and it is made more complex now because of the children.' The children of the gerontocracy hold important provincial and national posts and many of them are making a bid for a seat on the central committee. The sons of veteran politicians such as Mr Deng, Chen Yun, Yang Shangkun, Peng Zhen, the late Nie Rongzhen, and Xi Zhongxun are all making a bid for a seat on the central committee. Some are undoubtedly talented - such as Mr Chen who is deputy governor of the People's Bank, China's central bank - but many have simply used their parents' position to enrich themselves. It will be an indication of just how feudal China still is if many of them succeed. It will send a signal to the party and the people at large that the way to get on in public life remains determined by the strength of your connections, not your talent.</p>

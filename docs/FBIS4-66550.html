The first 100 days of Chief  Minister Digvijay Singh, who had filled Madhya Pradesh with his  promises and declarations, are not enough to evaluate his  effectiveness. However, it appears that the chief minister who  rides on the shoulders of the masses is busy, but everything  around him is in a mess. He had the image of a macho chief  minister when he arrived in this state. Even after innumerable  efforts, they have failed to change his image to that of the  sole leader of the state. Instead, Digvijay Singh has the image  of a servant in this state of three super chief ministers--Arjun  Singh, Kamal Nath, and Madhavrao Scindia.    Digvijay Singh was the candidate from the Arjun Singh camp  last December when the leader of the Congress legislative group  was elected. In the power struggle between the Arjun Singh and  Shukla groups that climaxed at the polling booth, Digvijay Singh  defeated Shyamacharan Shukla and became the chief minister from  the Arjun Singh camp and from the Arjun Singh political family.  However, during the first 100 days, the roles of the main  characters in the state political drama have changed. The most  interesting and shrewd scene is that in which the chief minister  is in the Arjun Singh camp as are his most eloquent detractors.    The political wild game hunt of these two Thakurs [warrior  caste] has not only thrown the remaining factions of the  Congress Party in the background, but also has put a question  mark on their political existence. The names of followers of  Madhavrao Scindia and Ram Charan Shukla can be counted in the  latest episode.    Digvijay Singh is a `Macho chief minister' because throngs  of  people surround him seeking his help until 2:00 am. He puts one  hand on one person's shoulder, listens to a second person,  respond to a third person, and smiles at the fourth person.  Members of the Congress Party arrive from all over the state.  They have submitted more than 50,000 requests for transfers and  new jobs and have made Digvijay Singh feel that he is the super  leader sitting at the peak of his popularity. It is surprising  that Digvijay Singh is using this crowd as a standard to measure  his popularity. This style can work for the state Congress  president, however, it does not work for someone in the role of  [state] Congress president and chief minister. Digvijay Singh  has been mostly the state Congress president during his first  100 days. Perhaps, during the next few months he will emerge as  the real chief minister.    Amidst all kinds of assumptions, Digvijay Singh is trying to  maneuvour maintaining a balance between Arjun Singh and Kamal  Nath. He does not want to defy or anger either of these leaders.  In this game of keeping balance, Digvijay Singh appears to be  alternately leaning towards the camp that puts more pressure on  him at a given time.    Still, the change that is visible is Digvijay Singh's  efforts  to stay away from Arjun Singh, the human resources minister at  the Center.    Only time will tell how many leaders in his own camp and  from  other groups will support Digvijay Singh. If we review the  visits by state Congress leaders, especially Central Human  Resources Minister Arjun Singh and Central Forests and  Environment Minister Kamalnath, then we can see the increasing  warmth between Kamalnath and Digvijay Singh. Digvijay Singh has  publicly declared that Kamalnath played an important role in his  election to the chief minister's position. He has not given a  similar statement about Arjun Singh. The relationship between  Arjun Singh and Digvijay Singh has been seen to be both hot and  cold. These state leaders occupying central government positions  have only strengthened their power bases instead of empowering  the chief minister. Their agenda, speeches, and methods have  divided the Congress workers. They are also creating doubts.  Five Congress (I) power bases in the state, with varying degrees  of influence, are present. These power groups are led by Arjun  Singh, Kamal Nath, V.C. Shukla, Madhavrao Scindia, and  Shyamacharan Shukla.    As for the Shukla brothers, the state government will not  try  to openly oppose V.C. Shukla because of his position. However,  central Water Resources Minister V.C. Shukla is quiet. The  former Chief Minister Shyamacharan Shukla is waiting for an  opportunity.    The group that is baffled most is that of Arjun Singh's  supporters inside and outside of the government. They had  considered Digvijay Singh a foot soldier in Arjun Singh's camp  at one time. One cabinet member who had gone to see Arjun Singh  off at the airport on 14 March after his visit to Moni Baba  [holy man] said, "How long will he be able to run the government  without the support of King Arjun Singh?" This is the most  complicated issue in the state politics now. Madhya Pradesh is  the umbilical cord from which Arjun Singh acquires strength just  like some mythological characters. The supporters of Arjun Singh  cannot stop expressing their feelings seeing the decline in his  prominence in that state for the first time. Important leaders  believe that a power struggle is going on between Arjun Singh  and Digvijay Singh. If we look closely, Arjun Singh, Digvijay  Singh, and Kamal Nath have basically the same views, but are  telling different things to the prime minister and the party  president.    Another major change has been noticed in Arjun Singh's  supporters. They appear to have fully submitted to the prime  minister. It could be that this change was forced on them. He is  the same person who used to mentioned the prime minister as a  villain during the Surajkund conference. He drools when showing  respect for him now.    It should be remembered that in addition to these challenges  from within the Congress (I) Party, there is the challenge of  the Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP]. The first Vidhan Sabha  election held after Digvijay Singh became the chief minister was  for the Satna seat. The election for this seat was held later  because of an Election Commission order. The chief minister was  so impressed with his own proclamations that he announced before  the voting that, "the people will give me their mandate in  Satna." The opposite happened; the BJP won. The second major  challenge is the Rajgarh Lok Sabha seat. The atmosphere is now  getting heated up after the march of former Chief Minister  Sunderlal Patwa and responding march by the chief minister's  brother Lakshman Singh.    The first 100 days of Digvijay Singh's rule have hurt the  people more than the party according to one interpretation. Some  leaders within the Congress (I) Party and the cabinet have  emerged who are speaking the language of Bahujan Samaj Party's  [BSP] Kanshi Ram. These attacks made from public platforms,  however, were mostly because of political pressure. These  attacks are made sometimes [in a bid] for the the presidency of  Madhya Pradesh Congress Party, and sometimes just to undermine  the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. The effect of this on the  people is such as never seen before. The fact that Chief  Minister Digvijay Singh never forgets to pay homage to Kanshi  Ram during this visits to Delhi is entirely another matter.    This has made the Congress members who have never practiced  the politics of casteism before restless. They practiced  politics keeping the state in mind. Except for a few districts,  there is emphasis on castes as is in Uttar Pradesh. The BSP was  active in the 1989 vidhan sabha elections, however, it could not  make its presence known until the 1993 election. However, the  BSP did not achieve the success that the Congress and the BJP  were afraid of before the elections. The BSP leaders now have  the excuse to use their party as a threat. This has led to the  rise of caste sentiments in many districts, including Vindhya  Pradesh, Chhattis Garh, and Bilaspur.    The chief minister of the state had started to add the issue  of caste to every announcement from the beginning. He has  softened now that he was accused of using the caste issue as a  weapon. These accusations are still being levied. Some ministers  and Congress leaders seem to be in a competition to give the  most instigating speech. They target the high caste people  directly or indirectly.    The latest example of is of Tanwant Singh Kir, minister of  administration in Digvijay Singh's cabinet. There was a  divisional conference of Ujjain division's sanitary workers on 6  March. A part of Mr. Kir's speech in that conference went like  this: "The scheduled castes and the backward groups have not  taken over the responsibility of cleaning and picking up trash.  Now, whoever makes the mess will have to clean up. In the  future, 20 percent of the jobs for sanitary workers will be  reserved for high caste people. Both God and I like the sanitary  workers. The high caste people, the traders, and the Brahmans  just do not understand it all. All citizens have equal right for  upward mobility. I will not allow any discrimination and bias  against these castes."    There was a sharp reaction to Mr. Kir's speech both inside  and outside of the Vidhan Sabha. The turmoil inside was so  intense that Chairman Srinivas had to cancel the assembly  activities and remove the verbal assaults from the proceedings.  That day, former Chief Minister Kailash Joshi was seen to be  upset when coming down the stairs of the Vidhan Sabha. He said,  "How did he become a cabinet member? What kind of language does  he use?"    It was Arjun Singh who started this new practice of  providing  or demanding positions based on caste in Madhya Pradesh. On the  evening of 5th December, the election heat was sharp in both the  election camps--Shukla's and Arjun Singh's. Digvijay Singh  proposed his name with the help of Kamal Nath in Arjun Singh's  camp. At that time, Arjun Singh's "dummy" candidate Subhash  Yadav had to withdraw. However, when Arjun Singh stood up to  speak in the legislators' meeting, Sushil Kumar Shinde, party  supervisor for elections, stopped him from speaking. Arjun Singh  left the meeting in anger. He issued a statement from his  residence 15 minutes later. He said that the world would not  have come to an end if he had had the opportunity to speak to  the legislators. He wanted a Harijan or tribal to be elected to  the state's leadership. All he wanted was to make an appeal. It  is important to remember that in 1980 when Shivbhanu Singh  Solanki ( a tribal) had more votes in the Congress legislative  group, Arjun Singh had become the chief minister by usurping  Solanki's votes with the support of Kamal Nath. The population  of tribals and Harijans in the state was the same at that time.    Later, central Human Resources Minister Arjun Singh came to  Bhopal on 4 January 1994. He said that he was still firm on the  opinion he had given at the time of election of the legislative  leader. He wanted one of the tribals to be elected leader.  According to knowledgeable circles, Mr. Singh wanted the leader  of the state Congress Party to be of the same group and from his  own camp. Thus, Ajit Mukherji emerged as the choice and he went  around the state giving statements asking for first being  elected chief minister and later, the state party president.    Interestingly, except for some of Digvijay Singh's cabinet  members, the Congress members viewed this demand differently.  Most of them belonged to Arjun Singh's camp and had lost in the  election. All the coalitions that were either stagnant or  defunct suddenly became revitalized and there began a series of  conventions. On 4th January, Arjun Singh requested Governor  Mohammed Shafi Qureshi in the presence of Digvijay Singh on the  platform to decide on enlarging the Baba Saheb Ambedkar National  Institute of Social Sciences. The work on this institute had  been discontinued since 1984 and Arjun Singh could have made  work possible by giving a grant before 4th January. He had  announced a grant of five million rupees for this purpose.    Another statement was issued after Digvijay Singh was  elected  chief minister on the advice of Arvind Netam, central minister  of state for agriculture. In the statement issued on 5th  January, he said that the demand to elect a chief minister from  scheduled castes, tribals, or backward groups was not honored.  Parasram Bhardwaj, president of the Joint Legislative Council,  said from Bhillai that in addition to administrative positions,  the scheduled castes and tribals have not gotten proper  representation in public service programs, municipal committees,  and other places.    Because of this pressure, two deputy chief ministers,  Subhash  Yadav and Pyare Lal Kanwar, were appointed for the first time.  Subhash Yadav's speech made in the Yadav group's meeting in  Indore on 26 January was also discussed. Mr. Jogi said on 1  February in the scheduled castes and tribal groups' meeting in  Bhopal, "We will fight only over burning issues. We will not  make any more requests, it will be the higher caste people who  will do that now. Reservation of quotas is our right. We will  pass this quota to 15 percent of the people. We will not  tolerate those leaders who were elected with our votes any  more." Mr. Jogi told the reporters after the conference that he  thought just like Kanshi Ram, however, they were on different  platforms. His efforts won 25 cabinet positions and two deputy  chief minister positions.    It was Jamuna Devi, the minister for welfare of women, who  put a stop to Ajit Jogi's statements. She said that, "Ajit Jogi  who is talking about scheduled castes and tribals, should first  look at himself and tell us who he is. What has he contributed  to the party? Ajit Jogi's statements and actions were making the  government and the chief minister unstable. Ajit Jogi appears to  be a subversive politician. He started to oppose the state  government with a conference in Bhopal and such action is  intolerable." Jamuna Devi demanded expulsion of Ajit Jogi from  Congress and action against the cabinet members who took part in  that convention.    Thus continued the routine of caste-based politics. On 4th  February in Bhopal's Ravinder Bhawan, a backward-classes meeting  was held. They demanded in this meeting that the president of  the state's Congress Party should be a backward class member, a  tribal, or from a scheduled caste. In addition to that, they  demanded that 50 percent of positions in the Congress  organization, public programs, and municipal committees should  be reserved for these groups. Rajmani Patel, the president of  this organization, is a former cabinet member and belongs to  Arjun Singh's camp. Similarly, Bansilal Dharitlehre, another  former cabinet member, has also demanded that the presidency of  state's Congress Party should be given to a member of these  groups. Mr. Dharitlehre himself is also a candidate for this  position.    The caste equation that is changing the the face of the  Madhya Pradesh Congress Party does not appear to stop here.  There is no opposition to it within the party, and no one has  the courage to come forward to oppose it. However, a statement  issued by Kamal Nath from Tikamgarh is of significance. He  announced in his speech during the closing ceremonies of the  Amar Singh Rathaur volleyball tournament that it does not matter  whether the president of the Congress Party is from a backward  group, that person must be qualified for the position, and then  he added, "We do not want to make Madhya Pradesh another Uttar  Pradesh."</p>

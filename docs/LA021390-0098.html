			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> More Thrifts Meet Capital Standards: The Office of Thrift Supervision said that  about 18% more savings institutions are meeting the new, tougher federal  capital standards than initially expected, the result of thrifts' efforts to  raise capital by selling assets. Of the 836 thrifts originally expected not to  meet the standards, plus another 25 institutions termed "subpar," 147 are in  compliance, the agency said. So far, 541 thrifts have filed capital recovery  plans.  </P></p>

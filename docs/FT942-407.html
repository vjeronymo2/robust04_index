			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy How quickly the markets have forgotten their fears that April's tax increases would abort the UK economic recovery] Yesterday's Treasury forecast paints a remarkably happy picture of the economy. Growth is higher than expected, but not so high as to rekindle inflation and put upward pressure on interest rates. The public sector borrowing requirement is coming down, but not so fast that it will encourage calls for tax cuts. The corporate financial surplus will lead companies to invest more next year, but not so much that the balance of payments balloons. Such projections would have been unthinkable in February or March. Yet the irony is that a forecast of 2.75 per cent growth for this year may prove too conservative, not least because of the modest contribution factored in from stock-building. If that is the case, calm on the interest rate front may not last. Pressures are beginning to mount from commodity prices and on wages. It still looks likely that base rates will come under upward pressure during the autumn. One wonders how that will affect corporate investment plans, especially since it is only next year that the government expects capital spending to come into its own. If this year is better than expected, 1995 could disappoint.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Brussels starts 'dumping' probe into ethanolamine THE European Commission has opened an investigation into alleged 'dumping' of ethanolamine by the US, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels. Community chemicals companies claim that ethanolamine, used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, was sold at artificially low prices in the Community between 1988 and 1991. They say US sales rose by 38 per cent in the period, from 40,660 tonnes to 56,197 tonnes, and the market share of US producers rose from 31.3 per cent to 39.2 per cent. Cefic, the European chemical companies' trade association, said the boom in cheap US imports prompted a 7 per cent drop in EC production during the three-year period and a 14 per cent slump in capacity utilisation. Reuter adds: The EC is making anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean car radios permanent, it said yesterday. The Community's Official Journal said it was setting the duty at 34.4 per cent, with reduced rates for 18 companies which co-operated in its investigation. Goldstar will pay 3.9 per cent duties, Hyundai Electronic Industries 10.8 per cent and Samsung Electronics 20.8 per cent.</p>

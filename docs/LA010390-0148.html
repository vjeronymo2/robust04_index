			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: MEDICATION COULD BE THE KEY TO IMPOTENCE PROBLEM  </P> <P> Question: My husband has had a problem with impotence for years, but we got by  somehow. Now he is not interested at all. He doesn't even come near me and  yells if I approach him.  </P> <P> Is there a medicine or a vitamin or anything that can bring him to life? I  don't want to give up sex yet. We are in our 50s.  </P> <P> Answer: You shouldn't have to give up sex in your 50s. First, your husband  needs to have his doctor check his medications to make sure one of them isn't  to blame. A surprising number of drugs can cause impotence or lower sex drive.  </P> <P> Next, a urologist may be able to tell if there is a biological problem. There  are now several prescription medications that may actually help restore  erections, including yohimbine or papaverine injections. Surgery is even  possible in some cases.  </P> <P> Finally, psychological or marital counseling can provide the kind of support he  needs to maintain a more loving relationship with you.  </P> <P> Q. You recently suggested the FDA approve 12-minute strep tests for home use.  As a pediatrician, I question your understanding of the situation.  </P> <P> All of the quick strep tests on the market are inaccurate compared to a 24-hour  culture.  </P> <P> An inaccurate, negative 12-minute strep test done at home could give a false  sense of security and should never replace evaluation of the child's other  symptoms, or the parent's intuition -- which I have found very reliable.  </P> <P> A. You are right -- the quick strep test is not perfect. If it indicates a  strep throat, our consultants assure us that is highly reliable and deserves  immediate antibiotic treatment.  </P> <P> The problem arises when the test shows no strep. About one in 10 of those are  "false negatives." These children actually have strep which can be cultured in  24 hours.  </P> <P> If every sore throat were seen by a doctor, we wouldn't advocate home testing.  But many children don't get their throats cultured and home testing might  assist parents in making better decisions. A positive quick strep test would  allow the doctor to call a prescription in. Unfortunately, a negative test  would probably still require a follow-up visit to the doctor.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> STING LOBBIES FOR BRAZIL INDIANS  </P> <P> British pop star Sting met Brazilian President Jose Sarney on Wednesday for the  second time in less than a year to lobby for the nation's Indians.  </P> <P> Accompanied by Kaiapo Indian chief Raoni, with whom he toured the globe to  raise funds last year, Sting asked that lands be demarcated for the Kaiapo  tribe in the Amazon state of Para.  </P> <P> Before the meeting at the presidential palace, Sting told Reuters that he would  tell Sarney that he was also concerned about the fate of the Yanomami Indian  tribe in the state of Roraima.  </P> <P> The Yanomami are the biggest forest tribe left in the Americas, but the 7,000  who live in Roraima are dying from malaria and other diseases brought there by  some 40,000 gold prospectors.  </P> <P> "I'll tell him (the president) the killing of the Yanomami must stop," Sting  said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday Brazil announced that the government had negotiated a peaceful  departure of the prospectors.  </P> <P> Sting last year founded the Foundation Mata Virgem (Virgin Forest) with a view  to preserving the Amazon rain forest and its native people. His spokesmen said  the singer had raised more than $1 million for the cause during his travels.  </P></p>

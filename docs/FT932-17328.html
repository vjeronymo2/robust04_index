			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / E German employers pull out of steelworkers wage deal WAGE PARITY between east and west German workers moved further away yesterday after steel industry employers pulled out of an agreement with unions. Employees in steel, electrical and engineering, which make up the three main sectors of the east German economy, have been hit by the employers' refusal to pay steelworkers a 21 per cent wage increase which was due today. IG Metall, the giant engineering union, responded by calling for warning strikes throughout eastern Germany in protest against the action. Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association, voted to end a contract made with IG Metall and east German managers in March 1991. The contract, also agreed with Gesamtmetall, the electrical and metal employers' association, would have brought eastern German wages up to western German levels by April 1994. Gesamtmetall, which had been due to pay eastern German electrical and metal employees a 26 per cent wage increase today, had broken the contract in early March on the grounds that eastern Germany's economy had sharply deteriorated. IG Metall earlier this week called for warning strikes in the metal and electrical sectors. Officials from both employers' associations yesterday said they could not afford to pay such wage increases in view of low productivity levels - about 70 per cent below west German levels. 'We propose to offer the employees a 9 per cent increase, which is in line with inflation in eastern Germany,' said Mr Philipp Vossen, a spokesman for Arbeitgeberverband Stahl. He added: 'Our decision ends the timetable towards income parity. The present wage demands would have slowed down any future investment plans.' IG Metall officials yesterday denied that their wage demands, and the threat of an all-out strike later in the month, would postpone growth, and slow investment in east Germany. 'We cannot ask our members in eastern Germany to accept low wages, but pay western German prices,' said Mr Gerd Schulz, an IG Metall representative. The threat of strikes in eastern Germany arising from high wage demands coincided with the publication of a joint report issued by the German Institute for Economic Forecasting in Berlin and the Institute for World Economy in Kiel. The report showed how high wage demands, linked to continuing low productivity, would depress growth, stem investment, and stifle the fledgling small and medium sized enterprises in eastern Germany. 'Wage costs are the Achilles heel of the eastern German economy,' says the report, adding that there is hardly any gap between labour costs and output per head. Output may fall 7%, Page 2</p>

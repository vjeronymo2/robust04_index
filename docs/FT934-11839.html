			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / New attack on credit advert rules THE COUNCIL of Mortgage Lenders has backed calls for simpler and more streamlined regulations on advertising consumer credit. The council, which represents building societies and centralised lenders such as banks, told an Office of Fair Trading inquiry on the working and enforcement of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 that the rules were not justified on consumer protection grounds. Mr Michael Coogan, head of legal services for the council, said that the regulations were too prescriptive and that simplifying them would make them more effective. Both the council and the British Bankers' Association criticised the obligation on lenders to provide written quotations on request. Mr Coogan told the OFT that while in theory written quotations benefited the consumer, in practice very few people asked for them. Even the association, which was much more cautious about deregulation, argued that a full advertisement would meet most consumers' requirements. Both organisations also strongly opposed the implementation of the 'tying-in' provisions of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. These would specify what information banks and building societies should provide when offering a house insurance and residential mortgage package. The council and association argued that consumers could be better protected in other ways.</p>

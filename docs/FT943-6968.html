			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Ford and Mazda plan Thai truck deal Mazda Motor, the Japanese carmaker, yesterday announced plans to launch a joint venture with Ford of the US to produce pick-up trucks in Thailand. Ford holds a 24.5 per cent stake in the Japanese group and this year has strengthened its representation on the Mazda board. The companies have started feasibility studies, to be completed next spring, of the south-east Asian pick-up truck market, after which details of the venture will be decided. Production is set to start in 1998. The companies plan to make a pick-up truck based on Mazda's multi-purpose vehicle. Mazda has a joint venture production line with Japanese and Thai companies in Bangkok. Mazda said the Ford venture would run separately from the existing plant, now working at full capacity. Mazda holds 4 per cent of the Thai pick-up truck market, trailing Japanese car makers Isuzu, which holds 31 per cent, and Toyota, at 27 per cent. Ford only has a 0.2 per cent share. Pick-up trucks account for 90 per cent of Thailand's commercial vehicle market.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: ICI faces charges of restrictive practices ICI, the UK-based chemicals multinational, is facing possible legal action in Spain following charges of restrictive practices made by the local partner in its biggest Spanish joint venture, ICI-Zeltia, a producer of agrochemicals. Zeltia formally complained to the Spanish Ministry of Industry in mid-December about a 'unilateral' ICI decision in 1989 to raise the prices of the joint venture's products by up to 30 per cent 'without the slightest justification'. The issue could go to Spain's competition tribunal if it is not settled amicably. In a statement, Zeltia said the decision to raise prices had 'provoked a drastic reduction in ICI-Zeltia's profits and reduced its competitive-ness'. Between 1989 and 1990, the joint venture's profits slipped from Pta344m to Pta136m (Dollars 1.35m). The company dropped from being the second largest Spanish company in the agrochemicals sector to fourth place, it complained. The price rises, Zeltia said, had 'also made it impossible to export'. ICI is understood to have offered to make a one off payment to compensate its Spanish partners but this has, so far, been rejected. The company's products are designed to control pests, weeds and diseases. Under the 50-50 joint venture, ICI has exclusive distribution rights inside and outside Spain. ICI said it was aware of Spanish press reports of possible legal action, but did not know if a complaint had been formally made. It said it viewed the threats of action as 'sabre-rattling' and expected the dispute to be settled normally within the joint venture. The group said its commitment to ICI-Zeltia, was demonstrated last year when it agreed to use the company to distribute the products of Stauffer, the US group it acquired in 1987.</p>

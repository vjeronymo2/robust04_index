In an  interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, PPP Secretary General Bashir  al-Barghuthi said that the numerous meetings held in Tunis last  week with Fatah officials produced positive results,  particularly including an agreement on formulating clear and  common ground between his party and Fatah regarding developments  related to the current negotiations with Israel for the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles as well as  current Palestinian conditions.    This development comes after months of estrangement and cool  relations between the PPP and the Palestinian leadership  resulting in the PPP's suspension of its participation in the  last rounds of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations in  Washington and boycott of the work of the joint  Palestinian-Israeli committees for the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles in Egypt.    Al-Barghuthi said that the impasse reached in the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations for the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles was new evidence of the need for the  Palestinian leadership to understand and respond to the demands  made by the PPP. He emphasized that these were national, not  partisan or factional demands, aimed mainly at strengthening  Palestinian national unity through the introduction of clear and  realistic concepts of what should be done in the current and  next phases to ensure fulfillment of the Palestinian people's  aspirations.    On the PPP's position on the current negotiations between  the  PLO and Israel on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, al-Barghuthi said: There can be no doubt that the  situation is difficult. It is clear that, under the pressure of  internal opposition, the Israeli Government has retreated from  previous positions. That makes it necessary for the Palestinian  side to consolidate its unity and explain its position to Arab  and international public opinion. It is also necessary for the  Palestinian parties which support the Declaration of Principles  to assess the situation.    The Palestinians, al-Barghuthi said, have no alternative now  but to insist on their positions, strengthen their internal  front, close their ranks, and continue their struggle.    Al-Barghuthi said that his party categorically rejected the  recent Israeli proposals on the crossing points and the area of  Jericho. He added that "these proposals are totally rejected  and should not be accepted because they run contrary to the  Declaration of Principles." He pointed out that the Jericho  area under Ottoman, British, and Jordanian rules always reached  the River Jordan.    On Fatah's side, Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), its official  in charge of mobilization and organization, emphasized that the  PPP, as a part of the existing PLO coalition, had expressed  interest in bilateral relations with Fatah that would cover  organization and coordination in the various fields of common  interest. Fatah, he said, welcomes such a formula which should  be open to all the Palestinian forces which support the  political grounds on which the Declaration of Principles was  based.    He added that that formula would be tantamount to an agreed  framework for political and field cooperation in the occupied  territory among all the organizations which share similar views  on a political settlement based on the same foundation, namely  the Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September.    Abu-Mahir emphasized that the purpose of that bilateral  formula is to scrutinize daily activities and draw the necessary  plans for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles on  the ground to pave the way for a Palestinian state.</p>

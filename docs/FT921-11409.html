			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Defendants shake off blues: Three aquittals in the Blue Arrow trial THE DECISION of the judge in the Blue Arrow fraud trial to direct the acquittals of all three corporate defendants met with a muted response yesterday from the companies concerned. Only the briefest of statements welcoming the decision was issued by their parent companies, National Westminster Bank and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Neither wanted to comment further while proceedings continue against five former employees of their acquitted subsidiaries, NatWest Investment Bank, County NatWest and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities. The judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, ordered the acquittals on the ground of insufficient evidence. His explanation to the jury was limited to saying that there were legal and separate evidential reasons concerned with corporate criminal liability that had led him to his decision. The ruling had no bearing on the cases against the remaining defendants, he said. They had all acted with the authority of their companies in buying the shares rather than on some 'frolic' of their own. The reasoning behind the judge's decision will become public only after the end of all proceedings - including a possible second trial. There is no doubt that yesterday's decision was received with considerable relief by those in the parent companies. The acquittals mean the removal of the prospects of both criminal convictions and fines on a scale that few lawyers were prepared to speculate about. Few legal precedents exist for the charge of corporate fraud and there is little or no established tariff for possible fines. The Guinness trial ended with Mr Gerald Ronson and Mr Jack Lyons being fined Pounds 5m and Pounds 3.5m respectively, but those were penalties against individuals and the charges were of theft and false accounting rather than conspiracy to defraud. With the Blue Arrow corporate defendants backed by companies of the size and financial resources of NatWest and Union Bank of Switzerland, estimates that fines could have run into tens of millions of pounds were commonplace. The decision to award costs in the companies' favour was also welcomed by them. The companies are continuing to meet the legal costs of the individual defendants, but the refund from public finances following yesterday's acquittals is likely to be substantial. The total bill for defence costs is estimated by some to total Pounds 30m. Neither NatWest nor P&amp;D were able to comment on the precise cost of defending their corporate subsidiaries, but they certainly ran into several million pounds each. Yesterday's acquittals will be seen in both organisations as a further step away from a serious corporate trauma. At County, the publication of the Department of Trade and Industry report had a substantial effect on both its reputation and business. Blue Arrow was one of many reasons, including the general management style, that prompted the wide-ranging reorganisation after the appointment of Mr Howard MacDonald as chairman and chief executive. Although the City's regulators were quick to acknowledge the changes, it took time for the bank to recover standing within the markets. P&amp;D also saw organisational changes after Blue Arrow, although they would have happened regardless as Union Bank of Switzerland introduced its business philosophy into the partnership it was then in the process of taking over. Nevertheless, concerns remain that the existence of criminal charges against the company may have hampered its efforts to win some business, such as government privatisation work.</p>

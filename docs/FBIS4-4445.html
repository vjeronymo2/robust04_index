			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marichu Villanueva] </F>   [Text] Senator Rodolfo Biazon yesterday brushed aside  objections to the second round of amnesty proclamations  President Ramos issued last week especially the possible  coverage of the convicted killers of U.S. Col. James Rowe and  those of the late Senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr.    Biazon pointed out that the two suspected communist hitmen,  Juanito Itaas and Donato Continente, who were convicted of the  Rowe assassination, and the 28 soldiers serving life terms for  the Aquino-Galman double murder can not be covered by the two  latest presidential amnesty proclamations. Biazon made his  statement yesterday before he joined President Ramos in the  state visit to Vietnam.    Biazon, chairman of the Senate committee on peace,  unification, and reconciliation, classified the convicted Rowe  killers and the Aquino assassins as criminals charged with  "common" crimes or crimes committed not in furtherance of their  political beliefs.    "For the common criminals, such as the convicted killers of  Aquino and Galman and the convicted killers of Col. James Rowe,  the president may consider granting them Executive pardon which  does not require a concurrence of Congress for it is a private  act of the president," Biazon clarified.    Under the country's 1987 Constitution, the grant of amnesty  by the president is subject to concurrence of both chambers of  Congress.    The Congress had earlier concurred with Presidential  Proclamations 10 and 10-A that Mr. Ramos issued granting amnesty  to all rebels who applied for it on or before 31 December 1992.    Biazon started Saturday his committee's public hearings on  Presidential Proclamations 347 and 348 that Mr. Ramos issued  last week which sought to grant amnesty to all rebels charged  with common crimes in pursuit of their political beliefs and  agents of state charged with human rights violation in relation  to their counter- insurgency operations, respectively.    However, the latest round of amnesty grant's was not  welcomed  by leaders of communist insurgents as well as by military rebels  who said they preferred an amnesty grant as a result of their  peace negotiations with the government. In the case of Rowe's  killers, the U.S. government is against their coverage of the  amnesty grant.    "The objections of the rebel leaders to the amnesty are  irrelevant because they have no right to decide for those who  are already out of their control and influence because they have  already returned to the folds of the law," Biazon pointed out.    Biazon disclosed that about 4,000 of these rebels from both  the left and the right have come down from the hills but were  forced to return to the underground because they were being  charged with common crimes by relatives of their victims.    These rebels, he said, failed to avail themselves of the  first round of amnesty grants which expired 31 December 1992.    Thus, he explained, Presidential Proclamation 347 aims to  grant amnesty only to rebel returnees who have already come out  and opted to lead a peaceful life but are not covered by  Proclamations 10 and 10-A.</p>

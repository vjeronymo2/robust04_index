			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Observer: Bladder press Fresh evidence emerges of the multifunctionality of the FT. It's gained pride of place for papier mache modelling, been used in various window-dressing displays and even lined the bottom of Princess Diana's royal hamster cage. Now, in Stockholm, it's providing lavatory wall entertainment. Guests using the gentlemen's loo at the venerable Grand Hotel can read the FT of the day framed on the wall above the urinals. The International Herald Tribune and the Swedish paper, Dagens Nyheter, also get a showing. The Grand's guests must occasionally consume copious amounts in the bar: pride of place occasionally goes to lengthy FT features, requiring several minutes' reading.</p>

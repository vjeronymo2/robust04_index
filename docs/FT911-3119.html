			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / The Property Market: Birmingham core breaks outwards Rosehaugh, whose fall from financial grace has overshadowed what remains an extensive development programme, is talking with the Birmingham City Council about the treatment of 16 acres of land adjacent to the new international convention centre and the national indoor arena, still under construction. This is the Brindleyplace project. Waterlinks, the joint venture company of Bryant, Douglas, Tarmac and Wimpey, is negotiating with two large office users about the construction of nearly 250,000 sq ft of offices - a big addition to an existing development at Birmingham Heartlands, on the north-east side of the city. At first glance, these two schemes have nothing to do with each other. The first is next door to a new focal point of the city. The second is part of a scheme to regenerate a rundown district, has received the help of city grant and is the object of a visit today by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary. But on closer inspection they have elements in common. The first element is geographical. The schemes are just outside, but at opposite ends of the city centre. They illustrate the way in which the core business district of the city is breaking outwards. This is partly a planning question: the city council has for some years been seeking to induce greater vibrancy outside an inner ring road. This carriageway is efficient for through traffic but holds in the city centre like a belt with a sealed buckle and is largely responsible for Birmingham's reputation as a car-crazy city. So far the private sector has fallen in with the planning aim only to a limited degree. But Brindleyplace and Waterlinks, coupled with the London &amp; Edinburgh Trust redevelopment of the famous, or notorious, Bull Ring Centre with its landmark cylindrical tower, and Avatar's Arcadian shopping and leisure development, offer the possibility of a wider and more diverse city centre. The concomitant of the geographically-constrained city centre is that the central office district is small - too small to cope with the demands which have been placed upon it. The agents' boards are ready evidence of a plethora of small space, but new buildings with large floors are scarce. Research by Chesterton, the chartered surveyors, shows that this year more than 1m sq ft of office space will be completed in the city centre. But a high number of pre-lettings means that only 272,000 sq ft of it will find its way on to the market. However, Chesterton notes that, at the end of 1990, another 19 schemes, totalling 2.4m sq ft, has outline or detailed planning consent which had not been implemented. Whether all these schemes will be built is a matter of some doubt. Against this background, Brindleyplace and Waterlinks - the latter with abundant land supply - could have the effect of doing for Birmingham what the Rosehaugh-Stanhope-British Rail Property Board development at Broadgate did for the City of London: extend the central business district. The second common element of Brindleyplace and Waterlinks is that, although they were born in the heady days of surge in property values during the late 1980s, they are projects likely to come to fruition in the next cycle of the property industry, probably during the mid- and late 1990s. But their financing techniques reflect not the debt-led speculative development of the 1980s but the desire to reduce exposure of the early 1990s. Waterlinks was conceived as part of a wider regeneration plan, progeny of the joint city council/private sector urban development agency which also bears the name Birmingham Heartlands. It owed its origins to a belief that private-sector expansion would make financially possible the transformation of old factory areas into an office park, a belief given a fillip by the fact that the companies, before the values surge, had quietly assumed control of up to 40 acres of land for a mere Pounds 10m. Brindleyplace has always been seen as a complement to the convention centre. It was under the control of the ill-fated Merlin group, which persuaded the city council of the advantages of a development which combined the once-fashionable idea of the festival marketplace, with offices and other amenities such as a national aquarium, thought to be a potentially lucrative national tourist attraction. Merlin moved into a joint venture with Shearwater, in the late 1980s a high-flying Rosehaugh subsidiary specialising in retail. Merlin eventually bowed out. Shearwater was absorbed in Rosehaugh, as the latter sought to control its finances. Rosehaugh has completed the purchase of the land from the city council for Pounds 16m and brought in the Terry Farrell partnership to re-work the whole scheme. This re-working is now the subject of negotiation with the city council, but Rosehaugh hopes by the end of September to have in place a detailed planning application for a first phase, largely of shopping and catering facilities to back up the convention centre, and an outline application for the whole site. Rosehaugh envisages a development built around a series of squares with 1m sq ft of offices (up from the 600,000 sq ft planned by Merlin), about 50,000 sq ft of retail (down from the 200,000 sq ft in the Merlin scheme) plus a hotel and a leisure complex. the nature of which remains the subject of talks. Rosehaugh has dropped the idea of an aquarium. So there is much for the city council to ponder. While Rosehaugh will move into the first phase on its own account, the rest of the development will be market-led. That is, if there are no customers for the office buildings they will not be built. Cash flow would be helped by selling on the land for the leisure developments. Likewise, Waterlinks keeps 40,000 sq ft of offices, speculatively built, as stock, but will not undertake large-scale office building without a pre-let or a design-and-build contract. Caution is the watchword.</p>

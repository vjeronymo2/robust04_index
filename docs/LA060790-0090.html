Cleary on Wednesday, Hiegert  said, "I think (Cleary) is curious to see what Sacramento is going to do."  </P> <P> United States International University, Southern Utah State, Northeastern  Illinois and Chicago State reportedly are prepared to join the American  Conference.  </P> <P> The addition of Northridge and Sacramento would give the conference six teams,  the minimum required by the NCAA in Division I.  </P></p>

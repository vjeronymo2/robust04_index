			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Desk of Memories: What was the best gift Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) ever  received? "The desk that was used by my father when he was ambassador to the  Court of St. James," he told Business Week, "and then was used by my brother  John in his Senate office, and by my brother Robert in his Senate office, and  is now with me in my Capitol Hill office . . . it provides a presence of my  father and my brothers in my office, which sustains me in many ways."  </P> <P> Misfortune: Federal law officials in Chicago looking into the disappearance 13  years ago of a multimillionaire candy heiress may be close to new clues. A body  believed to be that of Helen Vorhees Brach will be exhumed and genetically  tested, officials said Thursday. Brach controlled a $21-million fortune when  she disappeared Feb. 17, 1977, and may have been buried in a shallow grave in a  forest preserve south of Chicago. "We have fresh information that came out of a  separate investigation," said one official. Once a hat-check girl in a Florida  nightclub, Brach married chocolate king Frank Brach in 1951 and inherited his  fortune when he died.  </P> <P> Earhart Sighted: With the airplane that carried Amelia Earhart across the  Atlantic as a backdrop, the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.,  accepted the lost aviator's papers from Radcliffe College. The ceremony this  week came 53 years after Earhart was lost on a flight across the Pacific. For  decades, the college in Cambridge, Mass., has held boxes of Earhart's  correspondence, including post-mortem letters from seers claiming to know her  whereabouts.  </P> <P> Double Trouble: A Roman Catholic priest once accused of lying to help socialite  Claus von Bulow beat attempted-murder charges denied Wednesday he stole  $200,000 from his parish to support a lavish lifestyle. The Father Philip  Magaldi, former head of St. Anthony's parish in North Providence, R.I., was  closed-mouthed after pleading innocent to charges of embezzlement, larceny and  forgery. "A 'no comment' is not necessarily an admission of guilt," he said.  </P></p>

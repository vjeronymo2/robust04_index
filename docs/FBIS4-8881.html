			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, 18 Feb (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic,  president of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], in an interview  for today's NIN weekly, stated that he "is not opposed to the  normalization of relations between the Republic of Croatia and  Yugoslavia."    Martic has nothing against "the normalization of relations  between the republic of Serb Krajina and the Republic of Croatia  in the foreseeable future," either.    For the normalization of relations between Krajina and  Croatia, Martic stressed, it is necessary to establish permanent  peace; to this end Croatia should stop its continuous attacks on  the republic of Serb Krajina. "It has to give up resolving its  frustrations by force," he said.    He said that he is "a pessimist when it comes to the present  political leadership of Croatia and their real intentions."    Martic stressed that Veljko Knezevic, head of the Yugoslav  bureau in Zagreb, has "connections with Krajina only through  relatives," and that "if this mission brings about transition  from the war option to the political option, we in Krajina will  welcome it."    The president of the republic of Serb Krajina stresses that  he does not believe in the serious intentions of official  Croatian policy, the aim of which, as far as the opening of the  Yugoslav bureau in Zagreb is concerned, according to Martic, is  to "create a picture in the Croatian public that Krajina will in  that way be reintegrated into Croatia."    According to Martic, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic  "in  the light of his past achievements and what he has done for the  Serb people," is the number one person for the post of president  of all the Serbs, once all Serb lands unite.

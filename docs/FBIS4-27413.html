			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 28 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Navigational  safety and pollution-control mechanisms in the Straits of  Malacca need to be updated to keep pace with development.    This was one of the recommendations made by Southeast Asian  coastal and sea management experts at a three-day conference on  sustainable development of coastal and ocean areas in Southeast  Asia which ended Saturday.    It was organised by the Southeast Asian Programme in ocean  law, policy and management (SEAPOL).    The experts believe that while the mechanisms were still  relevant, its elements -- some of which were 20 years old --  could be improved as more vessels were using the straits and new  coastal development projects came up.    The basic principles for safety of navigation and  consequently prevention of pollution that we have laid out  remain solid but the problem is whether we have been left behind  by development, said Indonesia's ambassador at-large Professor  Hashim Jalal.    International Maritime Organisation (IMO) programme manager  Dr. Chua Thia-Eng said a long-term financing mechanism to combat  marine pollution was necessary and oil spill contigency plans  strengthened at the regional and national levels.    But, he said, the problem of marine pollution could not be  resolved by governments alone as it required public support such  as in reducing waste disposal into the sea.    Department of Geography Associate Professor Dr. Chia Lin  Sien  of the National University of Singapore said the the element of  human error as a cause of accidents at sea should be given  serious attention in view of the increasing traffic in the  straits.    People manning the ships have to be properly trained and the  vessels in good condition, he added.    Conference joint-chairman Professor Tommy Koh agreed that a  problem faced globally was in the training of seamen and this  had led to crews being below par.    Another problem was an aging fleet with few new ships being  commissioned and those in service unseaworthy, said Professor  Koh, who is director of Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies.</p>

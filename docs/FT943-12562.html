			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / 'Our nation is in pieces': Leslie Crawford talks to the new president about recreating Rwanda It is not often that a president is charged with the task of reinventing, as well as rebuilding, a nation. Such is the challenge facing Mr Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's new president. Mr Bizimungu is taking over a country with half its people in exile, and a history of ethnic conflict which reached its chilling apotheosis in the genocide of the minority Tutsi ethnic group by the majority Hutus in April. He believes the only way Hutu and Tutsi may live together again is by erasing the ethnic distinctions which divided them in the past. 'Our nation is in pieces,' Mr Bizimungu said at the weekend. 'We must teach new values to the population, based on respect for universal rights.' Mr Bizimungu must try to govern with no civil service, electricity, running water or telecommunications. The only institution functioning at present is the army of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, which installed Mr Bizimungu as president last Tuesday. Yet he insists he will not be a mere civilian figurehead for a military regime. 'I joined the RPF when it launched its struggle in 1990,' he says. 'I was their spokesman in Brussels and I led the peace negotiations with the former government.' The Tutsi-led RPF has been careful to name Hutus such as Mr Bizimungu to prominent positions in the new government, and to include moderate political parties in the cabinet. It even invited two members of the former ruling party to join, but they declined. Real power, however, is expected to remain in the hands of Gen Paul Kagame, the military commander who formed an army of Tutsi exiles in 1990 to fight the Hutu dictatorship of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana. Gen Kagame has taken the posts of defence minister and vice-president. Mr Bizimungu will not say how long the RPF-installed government intends to remain in power. The government has hundreds of thousands of displaced people to resettle. They must be housed where they feel safe. The survivors of Tutsi massacres may be reluctant to return to their former villages. Hutus who have fled into exile must be persuaded to return. The government must ensure security throughout the country. It may be a generation before Hutu and Tutsi can live together again.' Mr Bizimungu says his first priority is to persuade millions of Hutus who have fled Rwanda to return. That task may be made more difficult by the new government's intention to bring the authors of the Tutsi genocide to justice. 'Impunity will not be a condition for reconciliation,' he says. 'Those who have killed must face justice.' But with few magistrates and a non-existent judiciary, the new president admits that the task of bringing suspects to trial is beyond Rwanda's capabilities at present. Mr Bizimungu, a 44-year-old former banker, has moved into the former dictator's residence. As if he needed a reminder of Rwanda's recent bloody past, the wreck of the presidential aircraft, which was shot down on April 6 by unknown saboteurs, can still be found in the grounds of the presidential mansion. The assassination was used by Hutu extremists as a pretext to launch their plan to exterminate the Tutsi population and the moderate Hutu leadership. Mr Bizimungu concedes the extremists, now in Zaire, still pose a threat to the new government. In the absence of an extradition treaty with Zaire, the remnants of the Hutu army could yet regroup and restart the war. The new government in Rwanda is seeking the co-operation of foreign governments to bring the leaders of the former government and army to justice, and Mr Bizimungu hopes to meet President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire this week to discuss the issue.</p>

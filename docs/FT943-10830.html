			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Channel 4 to launch screen changes Channel 4 is to become the first national broadcaster in the UK to transmit widescreen programming regularly - with the help of grants from the European Union and support from Nokia Consumer Electronics, Raymond Snoddy writes. The channel has undertaken to screen at least 500 hours of programmes between the launch date in October and the end of 1995. Widescreen television is similar in shape to a cinema screen. When Channel 4 is transmitting in widescreen those with conventional television sets will receive 'letterbox pictures' with black bands at the top and bottom of the screen. Nokia is sharing Channel 4's Pounds 1.5m bill with the EU.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEIDMAN SAYS S&amp;L CLOSURE COSTS MAY EXCEED $50 BILLION  </P> <P> L. William Seidman, the government official overseeing the rescue of the  federal savings and loan insurance fund, said Wednesday that Congress may need  to spend more than the $50 billion it approved in August to help close  insolvent S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., also predicted that  it will take a work force of at least 5,000 people to help manage the assets  seized from failing institutions. Seidman is also chairman of the Resolution  Trust Corp., the government agency created to handle defunct S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> The government is on the verge of closing or selling five large, financially  crippled S&amp;Ls, a step that will consume about $10 billion of the $50  billion, Seidman told the Senate Banking Committee. And hundreds of other  S&amp;Ls may be taken over during the next three years, he said.  </P> <P> Asked if Congress should expect the spending total to rise, Seidman replied, "I  have no way to know for sure." He said he did not know how many assets will  wind up in the Resolution Trust Corp.  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan also told the committee that the  rescue price tag is highly uncertain.  </P> <P> "We won't know exactly whether $50 billion is, or is not adequate," Greenspan  said. "We do know the federal government is obligated to clean up this mess.  (We) will do what has to be done."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan Is Flexible  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the spending figure is not as  important as Congress' determination to restore public confidence in the  savings and loan system.  </P> <P> "Maybe we need $52 billion, maybe we need $48 billion," Brady told the  committee. "The point is, we've taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the point  where it is embers."  </P> <P> The $50 billion, approved by Congress as part of this year's S&amp;L bailout  legislation, represents the cash available to help close or sell crippled  institutions over the next three years. Some of the funds will be used to pay  off depositors, whose accounts are insured up to $100,000.  </P> <P> In some cases, federal officials may decide to close ailing S&amp;Ls and pay  off all their insured depositors. In others, it might sell troubled S&amp;Ls to  healthy financial institutions, with the government keeping the problem assets,  such as condominiums and shopping centers that were foreclosed when developers  could not make payments on their loans.  </P> <P> The $50 billion will come from the sale of bonds. The ultimate price tag for  restoring the S&amp;L insurance fund, including interest payments on the  30-year bonds and premiums collected from the S&amp;L industry, has been  estimated at nearly $300 billion. It may take the government years to sell the  assets of the failed S&amp;Ls. Meanwhile, cash will be needed to handle new  S&amp;L failures.  </P> <P> The Resolution Trust Corp. may be forced to acquire $100 billion in  hard-to-sell assets from failing S&amp;Ls before these institutions can be  sold, Seidman noted. "In effect, the RTC must buy, then collect, on these  illiquid assets," he said. "This ties up the RTC's cash very quickly."  </P> <P> While waiting to sell off the foreclosed real estate and other assets, the RTC  would still be responsible for handling any new failures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Top Financial Institution  </P> <P> The RTC, which is operated by personnel on loan from Seidman's Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp., has seized 283 failed S&amp;Ls with $112 billion in assets. It  has closed 24 small S&amp;Ls and expects to complete the sale of the five big  institutions by next week. Seidman would not identify the five.  </P> <P> More than 300 additional failures are expected during the next three years,  according to Seidman.  </P> <P> The Resolution Trust Corp. will become the nation's biggest financial  institution, the reluctant owner of billions of dollars of seized properties  and assets of uncertain value. As a result, Seidman said, it will need at least  5,000 employees and possibly "many more" to manage and dispose of the vast  portfolio of properties and investments.  </P> <P> The RTC decisions "will be felt in the capital markets and real estate markets  throughout the country," said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of  the Banking Committee.  </P> <P> "Homeowners and investors are worried about potential dumping that could  adversely affect property values," Riegle said. Because so much money and  property is under the RTC's control, vast potential exists for corruption and  scandal, he said.  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Brady, a member of the oversight board that will set policy  and watch over the RTC, said the panel "is as anxious as this committee to  protect against conflicts of interest, political favoritism and other improper  actions by employees, agents, independent contractors and all others."  </P></p>

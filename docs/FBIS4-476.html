			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC Department of Information and </F> Publicity on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 8 April: "Dirty Tricks  Campaign To Discredit ANC"]    [Text] April 10th will be marked throughout South Africa as  a tragic anniversary marking the brutal murder of Comrade Chris  Thembisile Hani, general secretary of the South African  Communist Party and member of the National Executive Committee  of the ANC, at the hands of ultra-right conspirators.    During the weeks preceding this dastardly act, a vicious  disinformation campaign, orchestrated by forces intent on  derailing the transition to democracy was set in motion. The  objectives of those behind the campaign became clear only after  the assassins had struck -- they were to besmirch the character  of Comrade Chris Hani and thus lend legitimacy to his murder.    The ANC has noted with grave concern the unfolding of a  similar campaign as we approach April 10th. Entire communities  are awash with wild rumours and irresponsible speculations about  impending disaster. A malicious rumour, that was promptly denied  by the British authorities, to the effect that preparations were  in hand to evacuate British citizens in the event of unrest  after April 27th was floated. Shoppers have been panicked into  the stockpiling of non-perishable foods against the continency  of shortages that will allegedly follow the first democratic  elections. Spokepersons of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] have  brazenly proclaimed their intention to make the holding of  elections impossible in a number of provinces including the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and Natal.    It is against this backdrop that the ANC wants to warn the  South African public about a reckless conspiracy which its  authors hope to operationalise over the next few days. The  information at our disposal has already been placed before the  South African authorities at the highest level.    The ANC has been reliably informed that:    (i) Presently large quantities of arms have been transported  into the PWV region and stockpiled in at least 16 hostels, with  a view to launching armed attacks in that province commencing  Saturday 9th April. The flats and houses of ANC members resident  in the Hillbrow-Berea-Yeoville area of Johannesburg have been  targeted.    (ii) The IFP has come into the possession of at least 2,000  ANC T-shirts and other paraphernalia, with a view to  infiltrating the Chris Hani memorial rallies scheduled for this  weekend so as to stage a provocation that will result in  bloodshed, loss of life and consequently heighten the tensions  in the PWV. As a bonus such a provocation would also serve to  bring the ANC into disrepute by linking it and its supporters to  acts of violence.    (iii) Attempts will be made on the lives of a number of ANC  leaders in order to deepen the atmosphere of instability and  possibly provoke a backlash among ANC supporters. Comrades  Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and Cyril Ramaphosa have been  mentioned in this regard.    (iv) The ANC head offices on Plein Street in Johannesburg  have been placed under surveillance by rotating reconnaissance  teams in preparation for an armed assault.    (v) A comprehensive plan of intimidation and violence is  planned to coincide with the last three weeks before the  elections in the hope of producing a low turn-out, especially  among African voters.    It is not our intention to cause alarm, but the information  we have received is extremely disturbing and should be brought  to public attention. There have been a number of clear  indications that the gun running trail uncovered by the  Goldstone Commission is still operational. Recent reports  concerning the transfer of firearms between persons in the  employ of Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] and members of  hit squads confirm this. Specific ANC leaders have been  subjected to surveillance by suspicious persons and at least one  member of our security department has been shot and seriously  injured by unknown assailants in the streets of Johannesburg.    The ANC will not be intimidated by these tactics and we  intend to pursue and implement every aspect of our programme and  election campaign over the coming weeks. Any attempts to disrupt  our activities commemorating the life and work of Comrade Chris  Hani will be dealt with firmly. We shall not allow the spoilers  and wreckers to destroy South Africa's chances for free and fair  elections.</p>

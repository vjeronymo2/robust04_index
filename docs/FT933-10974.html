			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Markets: That's the way the money goes - London IT'S ONLY money. Half the governments of Europe spent the week hurling vast sums at their collapsing currencies. Merck, the US drug giant, spent Dollars 6bn buying a company which puts prescriptions in the mail. Reuters decided to hand Pounds 350m back to its shareholders, on the grounds that if it kept the cash it might do something silly with it. All in all, one sees Reuters' point. Undeniably, cash is not what it was. Not in the UK, at any rate. Bill Smith, head of research at BZW, observes that the return you get on cash these days is the lowest for a generation. It is also lower than the return on gilts, equities or property. This helps to explain why unit trust sales in this year's second quarter were the second highest on record. Professional investors tend to get slightly twitchy at this point, rather as they do when taxi-drivers start buying gold. If the private punter reckons that the market can only go up, it is usually time to sell. It scarcely helps that the highest quarter on record for unit trust sales was the third quarter of 1987, just before the worst market crash in two decades. But this time, the private punter surely has a point. Though the savings ratio is a little below its peak of six months ago, people are still squirrelling money away; and with equities still yielding almost 4 per cent, there is simply no incentive to leave it in the bank. The other thing helping the market this week was, of course, the spectacle across the Channel of what looked increasingly like the ERM's death-throes. At the time of writing, the French authorities were still grappling desperately with the speculators and affirming their commitment to the system. But then they would, wouldn't they. As one market cynic put it yesterday, to make sense of what is happening you need only take what the UK government was saying last autumn and translate it into French. From the UK market's point of view, the beauty of it all is that the collapse of the ERM would help UK corporate profits whatever the UK government did in response. The immediate result would be a fall in Continental interest rates, Germany presumably excepted. That would stimulate the Continental economies, thereby improving the prospects for UK exporters. This is something of a live topic: according to the CBI this week, exports to the Continent are proving so sticky that the whole UK recovery is at risk. Of course, if Clarke followed the CBI's other piece of advice and cut UK rates, so much the better. From the market's point of view, there is only one possible way the government could get it wrong: if an ERM collapse sent sterling through the roof and Clarke still refused to cut rates, in spite of the damage to exports. But he wouldn't be so silly. Would he? Let us assume that the market is right, and that UK rates are due for another fall. That makes even more sense of Reuters' decision this week to give Pounds 350m back to shareholders. In fact, the money is to be used in buying back Reuters' own shares, rather than simply handed out as a one-off dividend payment. But as Reuters explained, that was simply a means of giving shareholders with a high tax rate the option of leaving their money where it is. Implicitly, though, Reuters is saying that with interest rates where they are, spare cash is better returned to the owners than left to burn a hole in managers' pockets. Besides, the likely return through investing that cash in the business is likely to be lower in the stingy 1990s than it was in the free-wheeling 1980s. Other companies are in the same dilemma: in particular, drug groups like Glaxo and Wellcome, which have steep cash mountains and and a steadily worsening commercial outlook. As it happened, their response to that outlook was also on display this week. Glaxo and Wellcome formed a grand triple alliance with the US drugs and consumer group Warner-Lambert, whereby they hand over to Warner-Lambert the job of selling any of their drugs which are converted from prescription medicines to consumer products. This is specifically in response to the efforts of Hillary Clinton and her counterparts around the globe to control their drug bills. When Glaxo's Zantac, the world's biggest-selling drug, is prescribed for ulcers, it is mostly paid for by governments. Come the day that it is sold as a patent medicine for indigestion and hangovers, it will be paid for by the sufferers themselves. But the troubles of the drug industry are perhaps too grievous a topic to dwell on, as is the plight of those who bought Glaxo shares at the top of the market. Better to turn to a bit of light relief, from the somewhat surprising source of corporate Germany. This is the setting for quite the most diverting boardroom shocker to have surfaced in years: Volkswagen versus General Motors, or The Case of the Exiting Basque. This hinges, for those who missed earlier episodes, on the behaviour of the exotically named Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, an ex-GM top man who has seriously annoyed Detroit by defecting to Volkswagen and - GM says - taking secret documents with him. The row over this has been bad-tempered from the outset. For connoisseurs of the Higher Childishness, however, this week's exchanges had classic status. Volkswagen's boss, Ferdinand Piech, said GM had planted its secrets on VW as a means of getting at Lopez. The whole thing, he implied, was a dirty American plot to do down German industry. Opel, GM's German subsidiary, rejoined that Piech was not one to talk. As an Austrian, he does not even have a German passport. So there. Almost unnoticed in the hubbub, GM announced on Thursday that it had swung from loss into profit in the second quarter, and its shares went up. But that, as the obsessed combatants would doubtless say, was only money as well.</p>

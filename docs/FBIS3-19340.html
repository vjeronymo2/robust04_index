			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Reinhard: "A Pretext"] </F>   [Text] The primaries will probably never take place. They  contradict our country's electoral customs and habits. Moreover,  they are totally incompatible with the spirit of our  institutions. The president of the Union for French Democracy  (UDF) is thus not wrong in reminding us that the true  "primaries" are, in reality, the first round of the presidential  elections. However, Valery Giscard d'Estaing would be more  convincing if he had not accepted the principle himself. Like  all leaders of the Right, he signed the 12 June 1991 agreement  on the primaries. To say at present that one refuses to honor a  promise would give a bad image of the credibility of political  leaders.    Ever since Charles Pasqua invented the "primaries  French-style," all the bosses of the Right--or almost all--have  said everything and anything on this issue. With the exception  of the minister of interior himself and of Gerard Longuet, who  have been constant partisans of this system, as well as Raymond  Barre, who never hid his hostility to it, all have changed their  opinion according to circumstances and polls. These about-faces  are not meant to improve the image of political leaders, but  they are understandable. Even those who adhered at one time or  another to this idea never really believed in it. In the mind of  most of them, the primaries have only been a pretext for subtle  maneuvers, generally aimed at weakening the adversary.    Charles Pasqua's present initiative cannot be interpreted  differently. There is little probability that the minister of  interior thinks it is possible to carry out his project. Even if  the prime minister accepted the submission to Parliament of a  text authorizing the organization of primaries, and supposing  that such a law were declared constitutional, it is not certain  that deputies will approve it. The majority of the UDF does not  favor it, and Jacques Chirac's Rally for the Republic (RPR)  deputies are showing a lot of reserve, to say the least.  Finally, even if this bill were submitted and approved, it is  doubtful that the selection of an eventual single candidate of  the majority could take place. [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur  has asked his majority not to open the presidential debate  before 1995, and it is difficult to imagine primaries-  -necessarily organized for the second half of 1994--that would  force candidates, beginning with the prime minister himself, to  reveal their intentions prematurely. Were this to be the case,  Balladur, who intends to govern in a climate as serene as  possible until the end of the year, would be inconvenienced more  than others.    Charles Pasqua has certainly thought of these parameters.  Hence, his initiative has another objective. He intends to force  part of the majority --first of all Giscard and Chirac--to  reverse their position officially. If they to persist in  rejecting the procedure, they would be seen by the electorate of  the majority as bad players. Pasqua, and no doubt Balladur as  well, thus hope to palm off on them the evils of division.  Indeed, following the 1981 and 1988 presidential elections,  those who will be judged responsible for a new break in the  Right run the significant risk of being accused of a mortal sin.</p>

The announcement came  in response to a statement by the spokesman of the Yemeni  Embassy in Beirut in which it was said that since the beginning  of February the central government in Sanaa had stopped paying  salaries to the Yemeni diplomats abroad who are originally from  the southern governorates. The spokesman noted that this is a  step toward division by influential parties in Sanaa.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Spending by rivers watchdog up 18% THE COST of the drought and higher investment in pollution control and flood defences pushed National Rivers Authority spending to Pounds 445m in the year to March 31, a rise of 18 per cent on the previous year, Bronwen Maddox writes. In its annual report and accounts, published yesterday, the rivers watchdog repeated its support for recent proposals to combine it with the pollution inspectorate under a new environment agency. Earlier proposals had suggested splitting the authority's pollution and river-management roles, a move it resisted on the grounds that it would weaken its ability to control river quality. The watchdog saw its spending on water resources jump 37 per cent to Pounds 77.2m last year, largely because of the drought in south-east England. Spending on pollution control rose to Pounds 76.4m compared with Pounds 60.5m the year before, partly because of the costs of its survey of 40,000km of river, published at the end of last year. The survey found a net overall deterioration in river quality both because of higher pollution and lower rainfall. Schemes to recover some of the costs of cleaning rivers from the polluters generated Pounds 22m in the year to March, and are expected to bring it Pounds 38m in the current year.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil holds on to price gains as market 'ignores fundamentals' Oil prices yesterday held on to most of the gains made earlier this week when a rally sparked by the entry of hedge funds into the oil futures' markets caused the price of the benchmark Brent Blend to rise by more than Dollars 1 a barrel. In late London trading yesterday Brent Blend was Dollars 14.25 a barrel. Last week prices fell from the Dollars 14 level to around Dollars 13 in the aftermath of the Geneva meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Many traders believe the market over-reacted to Opec's decision to forego a cut in output in favour of rolling over the present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day until the end of the year. The latest price strength was evidence that it was experiencing a 'guilt syndrome' for taking such a negative initial view of the Opec decision, according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at brokers Smith Barney in London. Other analysts said the latest price swings ignored market fundamentals, which continue to point to plentiful supplies and relatively weak demand in the second quarter. Mr Vahan Zanoyan of the International Petroleum Finance Company in Washington said 'there was no justification for the Dollars 1 a barrel rally,' which he said was 'unrelated to the reality on the ground'. He cited especially weak demand in Asia and the prospect of greater Russian exports with the return of good weather at the country's main oil ports as factors maintaining downward pressures on prices. In addition a Reuters survey yesterday of Opec production suggested that the organisation's March output exceeded its ceiling by 500,000 barrels a day. Mr Zanoyan said the hedge funds now constituted a technical factor in the market. They could prove particularly volatile if they 'liquidated their position at a time when weak fundamentals are baring their teeth,' he added.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): CBI warns over public sector pay increases GOVERNMENT policies that allow a form of pay comparability between the private and public sectors were attacked yesterday as 'mindless indexation' by the Confederation of British Industry. Mr John Banham, CBI director-general, made the charge as he warned that public-sector pay was rising too fast and threatening 'essential further cuts in interest rates needed to get the economy moving again'. His comments came four days after the government offered more than 300,000 civil servants pay rises of between 7.6 per cent and 7.8 per cent under formulae linking public-sector rises to those at private companies. Mr Banham, speaking at London's Guildhall, said the private-sector employers had responded in pay negotiations to Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism, higher unemployment and inflation. Pay determination in the public sector had yet to respond to the changes. Public-sector pay settlements in the financial year April 1991 to March 1992, when inflation is likely to be less than 5 per cent, according to the CBI, would be based on considerably higher inflation figures for the previous year. 'Such mindless indexation amounts to accommodation with the enemy, inflation, which is costing business some Pounds 5bn a point,' said Mr Banham. 'The watchwords for pay negotiators are plain: no performance, no pay increase.' The six unions representing the 23,000 manual workers at ICI asked yesterday in their annual pay negotiations for a 'substantial increase', Lisa Wood writes. ICI will respond on May 20. The Chemical Industries Association which negotiates on behalf of other companies in the sector, employing more than 20,000 process workers, has offered a 5.17 per cent increase on the basic chemical industry rate. The offer has been rejected and unions and management will meet again on April 26. The association said the main gulf between the two was over the unions' demand for a reduced working week - at present 38 hours.</p>

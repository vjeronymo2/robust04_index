			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Benefits revolt brings blow for Solchaga SPAIN'S conservative finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, is facing an embarrassing political reversal following a rebellion in the ruling Socialist party against unemployment benefit cuts he hurriedly decreed earlier this month. Faced with mounting trade union threats against the measures, which are part of a five-year convergence plan designed by Mr Solchaga to cut public spending ahead of European Community economic and monetary union (Emu), the Socialist party executive on Tuesday evening decided not to rubber stamp an enabling decree gazetted two weeks ago when it reaches parliament on Thursday next week. Even though the eventual changes may be minor, the Socialists have effectively decided to submit the decree to a lengthy parliamentary legislative process - which Mr Solchaga hoped to avoid - as a prelude to changing the planned cuts. In addition, the party has invited the two main trade unions, the socialist UGT and the communist CCOO, to discuss the decree, threatening Mr Solchaga's insistence that the convergence plan could not be negotiated. Mr Rodrigo Rato, parliamentary leader of the main opposition party, the conservative Partido Popular, said Mr Solchaga would have to resign if his non-negotiable plan was to be altered. 'The decree was passed to lend a sense of urgency to the cuts,' he said, 'and if the minister now finds his own party is not backing him he loses all credibility. If he cannot make a decree stick, why should anyone believe the rest of the plan?' The role of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez in the party's decision remained unclear. The party, still largely controlled by its left wing, has been horrified at union threats to mobilise opinion against the measures. The UGT has been threatening a general strike. The credibility of the convergence plan is crucial to Madrid because it is designed to impress upon Spain's EC partners that it is serious about trimming its budget deficits ahead of Emu and as a lever with which to wrest so-called cohesion funds from the EC.</p>

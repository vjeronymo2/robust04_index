			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Japan on  Tuesday agreed to exchange naval vessels' goodwill visits and to  mutually inform about their war planes' flights through  overlapping defense identification zones near Kushu and Tsushima.    The agreement was made during talks between visiting Korean  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Japanese Defense Agency  Minister Kazuo Aichi.    Under the agreement, a South Korean cruiser is expected to  visit Japan this fall, followed by a similar visit to Korea by  Japanese Maritime Defense Agency vessels.    The two ministers decided to expand military personnel  exchanges and take others steps to further promote mutual  understanding through substantial military exchanges, the report  said.    Exchanging opinions on other matters of common interest, Yi  and Aichi agreed that the North Korean nuclear question should  be resolved forthwith and North Korea should promptly return to  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if only to fulfill its  obligations as a member of the world community.    The Yi-Aichi talks lasted one and a half hours beginning  4:15  PM.    Yi is set to tour major Self-Defense Force installations and  pay a call on Prime Minister-designate Tsutomu Hata before  leaving Japan for the next leg of his tour, Moscow, on Thursday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(dan)": "Temelin Is Behind Schedule"] </F>   [Text] Temelin--The date for putting into operation the  first block of the Temelin nuclear power station, originally  scheduled for the fourth quarter of next year, will probably be  postponed until mid-1996. In connection with the envisaged  delay, the timetable for the work was on the agenda of  yesterday's supervisory meeting held to discuss the Temelin  nuclear power station project, which was attended by Minister  Dlouhy. Engineer Petr Karas, chairman of the Czech Energy  Enterprises board, told LIDOVE NOVINY that one of the reasons  for postponing the date for bringing in the nuclear fuel is the  change in the technology, and processing the documentation  associated with it. "Of course, there are other reasons. For  example, the government's talks on whether to say yes or no to  Temelin lasted almost two years, which, naturally, had an  influence on commencing certain activities," added Eng. Karas.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Red tape EXCESSIVE regulation imposes unseen costs on business that raise prices, stifle innovation and lose jobs. In February, the prime minister launched a crusade against the red tape that appears to be engulfing the UK. Six months on, little has yet been achieved, though some worthwhile initiatives were launched at yesterday's Downing Street seminar on deregulation. Certainly if the list of deregulation measures put forward by departments is anything to go by, Mr Major's crusade is flagging. Campaigners against growing red tape have more in their sights than allowing shops to stay open later or creating more 'family pubs'. The environment department's promise to repeal the Seal Fisheries Acts will not impress small businesses wrestling with the complexities of environmental legislation. As for the transport department, top of its list of deregulation measures is a green paper on regulating mini-cabs - hitherto unregulated. This is the traditional Whitehall approach of selling departmental priorities under the guise of the latest prime ministerial initiative. Some useful ground-clearing measures were agreed yesterday. Around 400 regulations have been targeted for further scrutiny. A deregulation bill is promised for the next session of parliament. Future regulations will be tested for their impact on small businesses and whether their costs are commensurate with the benefits. There will also be encouragement for legislators to specify the outcome of actions rather than attempting to control the details of business processes. All of this is welcome, but whether it is successful in cutting through red tape will depend on how it is implemented. The people who drew up yesterday's unconvincing lists of deregulation measures may not be the best people to entrust with this task. A report supervised by the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit proposed a commission to give deregulation much greater clout. The government has sensibly rejected such a quango - creating another bureaucracy to fight bureaucracy would be particularly inappropriate. But the deregulation drive needs a stronger push with the prime minister's active participation. A special Cabinet Office unit to co-ordinate action is called for, modelled on Sir Peter Levene's highly successful Efficiency Unit.</p>

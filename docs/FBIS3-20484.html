			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Zhongwen (1729 1813 2429): "Establishment </F> of `Human Talent Engineering' Imminent"]    [Text] The CPC Central Committee's listing of the machinery  and electronics industry as a principal industry in the national  economy has greatly encouraged the millions of staff members and  workers on the machinery front. "Close involvement in reform,  hastening development, vigorous development, and making the most  of the national economy's dominant role," have become action  slogans for stimulating an all-out effort throughout the  industry. The development program for invigorating the machinery  industry that the Ministry of Machinery has drawn up has been  revised many times and will soon appear.    Human talent is the keystone in dominant industries. One  important aspect of the invigoration of the machinery industry  is good management and good use of all kinds of specialists and  technical talent to improve the caliber of the rank and file  throughout the industry.    Survey data show that as education, the economy, and science  and technology develop, and as society and enterprises  increasingly respect science and technology as well as  scientific and technical talent, the speed of growth of  technicians in the machinery system has been markedly higher  than the total number of staff members and workers. Statistics  from 10 dominant enterprises show an 8.6 percent increase in the  total number of staff members and workers between 1988 and 1991,  but a 20.8 percent increase in the number of technicians. At the  same time, the caliber of technicians as a whole has also risen  markedly, and the percentage of graduate students, and college  undergraduates has increased by varying degrees. An environment  of respect for human talent, respect for knowledge, and respect  for contributions is gradually taking shape.    However, by comparison with needs in invigorating the  machinery industry, numerous problems in need of immediate  solution continue in the training and use of human talent.  <H5>  Human Talent Utilization Efficiency Not High </H5>   A questionnaire survey of 201 scientific and technical  personnel shows that only 5.5 percent of scientific and  technical personnel in the machinery and electronics industry  personnel feel that their skills are being used to the full;  39.8 percent feel they largely apply their talents; and 17.4  percent believe their talents are not being used at all. In  another survey of engineers in large and medium size  enterprises, 72 percent felt they were being held back, 80  percent felt work unsatisfying, and only 5 percent put in  overtime. Such a slack and easy going state of affairs naturally  creates not very high work efficiency. Some comparative data for  1988 is shocking. In Japan, per capita gross output value of  engineers in the machinery industry was $350,000, while it was  only $84,000 in China. This is to say that in machinery  industries having the same output value, China used 4.1 times  the number of engineers as Japan.    There are both structural reasons and conceptual reasons for  this state of affairs. Examples include out of date products,  antiquated organizational methods, softening of demand for  technology and for technical personnel, and being accustomed to  the expansion of extensive inputs primarily, using large amounts  of money and manpower; and a serious shortage of development  funds that leads to having a large number of technical personnel  in name but not in reality, which makes the development of new  products very difficult, and makes it even harder to translate  scientific research achievements into production. (The money  provided for technical progress in some developed nations  generally runs between 3 and 5 percent of total sales. In strong  Japanese enterprises, it runs as high as 10 percent. In China,  by contrast, many enterprises invest less than 1 percent.) A  Shanghai survey shows 70 percent of new research achievements  have not been translated into the development of products. The  value of knowledge is not fully appreciated. Many enterprises  continue to treat scientific and technical personnel like  organizational cadres, their average bonus being between 10 and  30 percent less than workers on the front line of production.  Egalitarianism in distributions is a serious problem. "It makes  no difference whether one works or does not work," or whether  one "does not work and also takes few risks." This situation  results in scientific and technical personnel not doing their  best; production efficiency in the enterprise itself is not  high; and overstaffing is the general rule, etc.  <H5>  Serious Flight of Human Talent </H5>   Surveys show that despite the increase in technicians in the  machinery and electronics industry in recent years, in  state-owned enterprises -- particularly in large and medium size  enterprises -- the dropping out of skilled personnel, the aging  of human talent, and the flight of human talent is extremely  serious. It is mostly middle age and young permanent scientific  and technical cadres that leave. A sample survey showed a  decline from 24.6 to 19.28 percent in the number of scientific  and technical personnel between the ages of 30 and 40 between  1986 and 1991. Another survey showed the flight of more than  one-third of the young scientific and technical personnel during  the past 5 years from large and medium size machinery and  electronics enterprises. More than 60 of the best graduates of  institutions of higher education assigned to the Dalian  Municipal Machinery Bureau were snapped up by the three kinds of  partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Between 1984 and  1990, 4000 university graduates were assigned to a Beijing  machine tool plant. More than half have already left. The  problem in frontier regions is particularly serious. Survey  statistics from 287 enterprises show only 7.92 percent of  technicians in enterprises today are between 31 and 35 years of  age, and 14.5 percent are between 26 and 30 years old. The  flight of human talent not only weakens enterprises technical  strength, but also damages continuity. It tends to create a  vicious cycle.    The main reasons for the flight and dropping out of human  talent are that large and medium size state-owned enterprises  are in the least favorable position in the intense competition  for human talent. They cannot compete with the three kinds of  partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, or with township  and town enterprises, in earnings. In the probability of making  a name for oneself and opportunities to travel abroad,  state-owned enterprises cannot compete with educational and  scientific research units. In housing, working conditions, and a  feeling of being respected, state-owned enterprises cannot  compete with administrative institutions. In work freedom, work  environment, and income, state-owned enterprises cannot compete  with companies of all kinds. Yet another important reason for  the flight of human talent is that technicians can more easily  put their talents to use in the three kinds of partially or  wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and in township and town  enterprises, unlike in some large and medium size state-owned  enterprises where seniority and age play a role, and where  people are not used to the full. This corrodes people's spirit  and enthusiasm.  <H5>  Accelerate Building of a Human Talent Corps </H5>   Informed people believe that the priority task in  invigorating the machinery industry is accelerating the creation  of a high caliber specialist corps that combines ability and  political integrity, and that is sensibly composed. The human  talent strategy that the Ministry of Machinery espouses is  "maintenance of continuity in the corps, optimization of the  make-up, improvement of caliber, and speedy selection for  promotion and training of middle agent and young permanent  technical cadres and academic leaders so that new technical  personnel will be available to replace old technical personnel  over the next 10 years. It wants to build a technician corps of  good political quality, that has fine professional skills, whose  make-up is rational, that is highly trained, and that is imbued  with vitality to meet the needs of reform and opening to the  outside world, scientific and technical competition, and social  development."    The specific measures that the Ministry of Machinery has  proposed to attain this strategic goal are the founding of a  human talent bank, including the establishment first of a high  level specialized talent bank, accelerated training of  three-in-one talent (technology, management, and sales), and  four-in-one talent (technology, management, sales, and foreign  language); founding of a human talent exchange center,  improvement of enterprises competitiveness, using fair  competition as a basis for accurately guiding rational exchanges  of human talent; formulation of preferential policies for the  importation of scientific and technical management talent;  founding a rewards system, increasing investment in education,  etc. In short, the establishment of "human talent engineering"  is imminent.</p>

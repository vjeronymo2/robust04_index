			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Proton begins flotation offer with profit warning PROTON, Malaysia's only car-maker, yesterday opened its offer for the flotation of 30 per cent of the company with a forecast that pre-tax profits for the 12 months to March 1993 may drop by 24 per cent to MDollars 308.6m (USDollars 114m) from MDollars 406.6m a year earlier. The company intends, however, to maintain its dividend of 16.25 cents a share, although earnings are expected to drop from 81 cents a share in March 1992 to 62 cents the following year. The flotation offer at MDollars 5 a share is intended to raise MDollars 750m from 120m existing and 30m new shares. It values the company at MDollars 2.5bn. The offer, the first this year under Malaysia's privatisation programme, marks a partial retreat by Japan's Mitsubishi from the company. Mitsubishi, which has a 30 per cent shareholding in Proton, has provided it with technology. Holdings by Mitsubishi and Kuala Pura, its Malaysian associate, will fall to 20 per cent on completion of the capital restructuring and listing. The Malaysian government, principally through Heavy Industries Corporation, will retain 50 per cent equity control. Only 20 per cent of the offer proceeds will be accrued to the company, while the MDollars 600m balance will be returned to government agencies, Mitsubishi and Kuala Pura. Proton has forecast that pre-tax profit to March 1992 will be 55 per cent up on the previous year's MDollars 262m. The group, helped by the growth of disposable personal incomes and tariff concessions, has helped Proton gain 62 per cent of last year's 130,000 car market.</p>

To date, some 1,300 of the 5,000-plus state-owned  enterprises  in the province have been incorporated into limited liability  company or joint stock companies.    Over the past year, the number of enterprises which adopted  the corporate system has been increasing rapidly. By the end of  last year, the province had approved 126 enterprises to become  joint stock companies which met the prescribed standards, with a  registered capital of more than 8.1 billion yuan. Of the  enterprises, six have been listed on the stock exchanges in  Shanghai and Shenzhen and another five will be listed soon. Two  of them have floated stocks, which will be listed in Shanghai  and Shenzhen.    At present, there are 1,064 limited liability companies in  the province, 40 of which were converted from former state-owned  enterprises.    In addition, 262 state-owned enterprises have been merged,  310 auctioned and 11 declared bankrupt over the past few years.    The aim of defining the property rights is to enable  enterprises to meet the requirements of the modern enterprise  system instead of to privatize them, an official of the system  restructuring commission said.    He said that township enterprises, which produce 60 percent  of the province's total output, will try the joint stock  companies this year.</p>

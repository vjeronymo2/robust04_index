			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS ASKED TO RESTORE OK ON PROJECT;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICAS: BUILDERS HOPE TO REVIVE A CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT. BUT LOCAL  OFFICIALS SEE THE ATTEMPT AS A CIRCUMVENTION OF THE PLANNING PROCESS.  </P> <P> Developers of a controversial housing tract in the Santa Monica Mountains are  trying to persuade the state Legislature to restore planning approval for the  second time on a project that the city of Los Angeles claims expired three  years ago, their lobbyist acknowledged this week.  </P> <P> No measures have been formally introduced, but the developers of the 1,500-acre  site near Mandeville and Mission canyons have spoken to several lawmakers about  carrying special-interest legislation on their behalf, said their lobbyist, Les  Cohen. The developers, Eastport Associates, want the Legislature to restore a  tentative 500-home tract map the city says expired in 1987.  </P> <P> Disclosure of the effort elicited anger from state and local officials, who  said they resented what they characterized as an attempt to circumvent the  local planning process.  </P> <P> "I find it outrageous and will do everything possible to block it," said  Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Tarzana), whose district includes the site.  </P> <P> "If this can be done," said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa  Monica Mountains Conservancy, "then there is no project -- however outrageous  -- that has been turned down or died of its own weight that cannot be revived."  </P> <P> The conservancy has been working to preserve and eventually obtain nearby  Mission Canyon from Los Angeles County. Development of the Eastport site would  jeopardize those plans, because Mission Canyon has been proposed for a required  access road.  </P> <P> Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), whose district also includes the site,  said he, too, will oppose the plan. Rosenthal said developer W. Charles  Chastain, who is involved with the project, told him: "I'm not going to walk  away from it, there is too much invested."  </P> <P> The property lies west of the San Diego Freeway and south of Mulholland Drive,  in a mountainside area with views of West Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean.  Eastport is attempting to reorganize under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy  laws.  </P> <P> Renewal of the tract map is considered crucial. Without it, whoever attempts to  build on the site would have to start the approval process over and contend  with hillside construction laws and homeowners groups that did not exist when  the tract map was initially granted in 1979.  </P> <P> The city says its approval expired in 1987, after Eastport had received several  extensions. Developers then took their case to the Legislature and succeeded in  obtaining a measure, enacted in 1988, designed to retroactively extend the life  of the firm's tract map.  </P> <P> The city later challenged the validity of the legislation and last month a  federal judge ruled that Eastport's measure could not revive building rights  that had expired.  </P> <P> Attorneys for Eastport have indicated that they will appeal the ruling. In the  meantime, Eastport wants the Legislature to clarify its intent, said Cohen.  </P> <P> The original measure was sponsored by former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya  (D-Whittier), who has since become the first California legislator in 35 years  to be found guilty of corruption in office. His conviction last February did  not involve the Eastport legislation.  </P> <P> But his sponsorship was noted by several angry officials. "Considering how this  occurred the first time, through a devious, secret measure by convicted felon  Sen. Montoya, I think there's going to be much closer scrutiny of any such  efforts," said Friedman.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) said Eastport has asked him to  sponsor a new amendment and attach it to an inactive bill he introduced last  year. The Costa bill, AB-1661, was written to preserve building permits issued  before voters enact slow-growth measures.  </P> <P> But Costa has not yet studied the proposed amendment and no decision has been  made, said his senior consultant Terry Reardon.  </P> <P> Chastain and Eastport Associates' general partner, Donald H. Albrecht, could  not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Chastain, who built the high-priced Palisades Highlands tract in Pacific  Palisades, was brought into the Eastport project by another developer, Ray A.  Watt, because of his success in building in the Santa Monica Mountains,  according to Cindy Miscikowski, administrative aide to Westside Councilman  Marvin Braude.  </P> <P> "Clearly, we would oppose any bill that would revive and attempt to resuscitate  zoning that had expired. . . . It's kaput and has no validity," Miscikowski  said. "If someone wants to reapply and start over under city processes, that is  available. I don't see how anyone could reach back and revive something this  dead."  </P> <P> Watt, one of the state's most powerful and politically influential developers,  last summer offered $69 million for the troubled Eastport project. But in  recent months Watt allowed his option on Eastport to expire, and he said again  this week that he is no longer interested in the project.  </P> <P> Watt also denied speculation by Miscikowski and others that he was only  assuming a lower profile in the Eastport project and that Chastain was really  working on his behalf.  </P> <P> Lobbyist Cohen acknowledged business ties between himself and Watt, and between  Watt and Chastain. But he, too, said Watt had withdrawn from the Eastport  project.  </P> <P> Chastain also has experience with special-interest legislation. His firm,  Headland Properties Inc., tried several times in 1979 to have the Legislature  exempt Palisades Highlands from Coastal Commission control. In 1985, Chastain  again appealed to the Legislature for help in changing the location of 100  moderately priced homes he had promised to build, from the entrance of the  wealthy Highlands to a more commercial site in West Los Angeles. Both efforts  failed.  </P> <P> Staff writer Myron Levin contributed to this story.  </P></p>

Lien, in his capacity as special envoy to President Li  Teng-hui, is leaving Monday [24 January] afternoon for  Tegucigalpa to attend the inauguration of Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina.    Lien will call on outgoing Honduran President Leonardo  Callejas soon after his arrival at the Honduran capital  Wednesday and then attend a dinner party hosted by President  Callejas.    Foreign Ministry officials said that during his trip Lien  will meet with the heads of state from Guatemala, Nicaragua, El  Salvador, Panama and Colombia, and the deputy heads of state  from Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic as well as the prime  minister of Belize who are all expected to attend the  presidential inauguration.    In addition, the officials said that the Republic of China  [ROC] embassy in Tegucigalpa is arranging for formal meetings  between Premier Lien and the leaders of those countries.    They said that although there have been no disputes between  Taiwan and those countries, Lien's meetings with the leaders  will still be conducive to enhancing bilateral ties.    Diplomatic sources here also attached much importance to  Lien's trip as Beijing has recently launched a series of  diplomatic offensives in Central and South America, which  traditionally are Taiwan diplomatic strongholds.    Lien and his delegation will also visit Miami and San  Francisco before returning home Feb. 1.    Lien's delegation includes Vice Foreign Minister Fang  Chin-yen, Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien and Government  Information Office Director-General Jason Hu.</p>

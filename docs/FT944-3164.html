			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early rise in shares eroded by sell programme - Market report A sizeable sell programme executed in mid-morning put paid to any chances of the UK equity market maintaining an early strong rally. Also affecting sentiment was another disappointing performance by the gilts market ahead of this morning's crucial economic data, which sees the publication of inflation figures for November, monthly unemployment details, news of underlying average earnings for October and unit wage costs for the latest three months. There was no real pressure, however, from across the Atlantic, where Wall Street was never anything but steady and marginally higher on balance well after London closed. Strategists said US markets had given a steadfast response to the day's economic news, which showed a surprisingly good core rise in producer prices but worryingly high retail sales that were well above consensus forecasts. The FT-SE 100 Index, which had fallen more than 2 per cent over the previous two sessions, managed to end the day 3.0 up at 2,946.4. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index never looked like matching the FT-SE 100's early performance and eventually settled 0.8 firmer at 3,373.2. Dealers said the market had also been restrained by various technical factors affecting markets across the globe. The FT-SE future December contract expires on Friday, as does a series of German derivatives instruments. Friday also brings 'triple witching hour' in the US, where all the major derivatives contracts expire. Such expiries are often the trigger for exaggerated movements in international stock markets. The Footsie kicked off yesterday morning in good shape, opening almost 20 points better at 2,946.4, thanks mainly to a solid overnight performance from Wall Street, where the Dow index continued to confound the pundits by closing some 27 points higher. But there was little institutional business in London and prices quickly began to trickle back, influenced also by a retreat by some European equity markets, notably Germany, which was hit by a Morgan Stanley downgrade. In mid-morning the full force of a sizeable sell programme saw early gains entirely wiped out and the FT-SE 100 Index fell into negative territory, eventually hitting a session's low of 2,938.8, down a net 4.6. Thereafter, share prices embarked on a slow recovery, moving back to positive territory after Wall Street delivered a reassuring opening. The latest Confederation of British Industry survey of distributive trades, although pointing to a continued slowdown in sales, failed to cause any damage in the retailing sectors, which have underperformed the market by a considerable amount this year. The stores sector provided two of the FT-SE 100's best performers on the day in Boots and Marks and Spencer. Marketmakers mostly remained unconvinced with the market's performance and were noticeably wary of Wall Street. 'I am still sure we will see Wall Street upsetting the applecart,' said one senior dealer. He added that the London market had been 'blown around in a light breeze' and fund managers remained unconvinced about short term opportunities. He did not rule out, however, the chances of a rerun of the big gains in the market between Christmas and the new year when derivatives activity, mostly featuring tailor-made OTC trades, reaches a peak. Regional electricity stocks provided some of the sharpest action in the market, with Southern Electricity continuing the long list of 20 per cent-plus interim dividend increases and the takeover speculation in Northern Electricity continuing to build. Turnover in equities reached a healthy 685.7m shares, with activity in non-Footsie stocks accounting for over half the total. Customer business on Monday was worth Pounds 1.4bn.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmers Viewpoint): Gatt deal adds twist to beef hormone plot - Health-based barriers to trade must in future be justified by scientific evidence In some farming circles, last month's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement has been presented as the answer to all the world's food problems. Like ministers of fundamentalist religions, enthusiasts regarded the prospect of accord between Gatt-member nations as a shining star for all to follow. Only reject the sin of subsidies and throw out protectionism, they seemed to say, and everything will come right. The purity of market forces will take over and all will be well. Cynic that I am, I have never held that simplistic view. For while I accept that a Gatt deal was necessary and that some sectors of industry  - perhaps even farming industry - will benefit, others will suffer irreparable damage as relative price stability disappears and is replaced by market volatility. That situation may even be exacerbated by the fact that Gatt-member governments have not decided to deregulate completely but will still keep their fingers in the regulatory pie - albeit at a much reduced level - even after the six-year transitional period starting in 1995. The other main reason I am sceptical that the Gatt accord will bring peace and light to all is that trade disputes between nations are not confined to production subsidies and export refunds. They are also concerned with matters that are even more difficult to resolve. When it comes to food, this includes such things as the perceived safety of goods to be traded between one country and another. Moreover, in the week that the Gatt agreement was signed in Europe, I was visiting farms in the US and immediately came across an example of what may prove to be an insoluble problem. I was on a specialist beef-finishing farm in Colorado. In common with many such operators in the US, the owner took in calves and fed them in open, uncovered yards until they were ready for slaughter. In order to achieve maximum growth rates and the highest possible proportion of lean meat in the animals' carcasses he, like most American beef farmers, routinely dosed them with synthetic growth hormones. These come in the form of slow-release pellets, which are inserted beneath the skin of the animal's ear. The reason for this unusual application site is that ears have no meat value and are discarded, thereby eliminating the risk that any hormone not absorbed into the rest of the body of the animal could be consumed by humans in concentrated form. The farmer I visited last month claimed that he rigorously observed food safety regulations and never dosed his cattle with more than two pellets in their lifetime. In California a few months previously, however, I had been told on another beef lot that in order to produce 'best meat quality' some animals had up to four hormone pellets during their finishing period. A few years ago, the same hormones were in common use across the European Union, although normal practice was to inject one pellet per animal in its lifetime, with only the occasional farmer contemplating using two. Then, however, the use of such products was banned amid accusations by consumer groups that they were a health hazard. Sex change symptoms, particularly in Italy, were alleged to have been caused by the improper use of hormones and the European Commission decided to forbid their further use. The commission took the action without considering evidence from its own scientific committee and there were suggestions at the time that the ban might have had more to do with the growing beef mountain in the European Community, as it was then called, than with the real dangers of using growth-promoting hormones. Nevertheless, the products remain illegal throughout the EU - as, incidentally, does bovine somatotropin (BST), a similar product which boosts milk yields in dairy cows, the EU ban on which has just been extended for a further year. In the US, the use of BST on dairy cows has just been authorised and it may soon be as much a part of American cattle production systems as beef hormones. Now, the Gatt agreement contains a section intended to limit the extent to which human, animal or plant health measures can be used as barriers to trade. Any measures that are invoked must in future comply with scientific principles and be based on recognised international standards. Colorado beef farmers took no time at all to conclude that this would enable them to export beef to Europe. There was, they claimed, no scientific evidence to justify a ban on the use of hormones, otherwise why did the US allow it, and the EU ban had only been imposed to stop them exporting across the Atlantic. I did not visit any US dairy farmers on this trip but presumably they will have come to similar conclusions about milk and milk products produced with the help of the BST. A committee on sanitary and phytosanitary measures will be established under the new World Trade Organisation (the successor to Gatt) to adjudicate disputes between member countries. If the attitudes and ambitions of Colorado beef farmers are any guide, that committee will have its work cut out. Here are just a few of the questions it will need to answer. Is there or is there not scientific evidence against beef growth hormones? If there is, should US farmers be banned from using them? If there is not, should EU farmers again be allowed to use them? And whichever way they decide, how do they persuade at least one significant group of consumers, in the US or the EU, that previous information on the safety of beef was inaccurate? It would, I think, be naive to assume that the Gatt agreement brings international trade disputes to an end.</p>

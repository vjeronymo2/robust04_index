			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: New issues A remarkable number of flotations is being mooted on the London market, ranging from the big to the enormous. The companies are domestic - MFI and 3i - and international, such as Guinness Peat Aviation and Waste Management International. The revival of public offerings is not new in the US, where the total raised last year was not far short of the 1987 record. But in the UK the phenomenon is more curious, given the uncertain economic outlook and the imminence of the election. It could plausibly be argued that private companies have until lately been crowded out of the UK market by the privatisation programme. It may also be that companies are now more confident about their future; though in that case, it is not immediately obvious why they should dilute their equity and reduce their debt ahead of the upturn. It is also possible that UK companies do not actually intend to float before the election, but nevertheless think it prudent to set the ball rolling early. All that leaves open the question of why investors, who are plainly in two minds about the equity market in general, should warm to untried newcomers. In the case of US companies seeking to float simultaneously in the US and Europe, investors might be more wary again. International equity offerings have become commonplace enough in recent years. But at a time when most US stocks are rated higher than their UK counterparts, the attraction of tapping a wider pool of savings may be offset by the reduction in the earnings multiple. Investors may also recall London's great US flotations of the past, ranging from the ghastly International Signal down to the hapless Mrs Fields.</p>

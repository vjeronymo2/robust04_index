			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Motoring: The fear that won't go away - Stuart Marshall explains how women motorists can cut the risks of being attacked STATISTICALLY, the chance of a woman motorist being attacked in her car is said to be minute. But the fear is real. Incidents may be few but the results can be devastating. There is no complete answer, of course. But all women can take sensible precautions to reduce the risk of either breaking down or being mugged in their own car. Some are so simple they should be second nature, as routine as fastening your seat belt before moving away. Always drive with the doors locked. Then, a thief cannot open one when you stop in traffic and steal your handbag - which should not be visible from outside, anyway. Worse still, he might get in and hijack the car. Because alarms and engine immobilisers are making them more difficult to steal, hijacking is becoming popular with thieves in the US. Inevitably, it is only a matter of time before it happens in Britain. Never park, even for a minute or two outside a shop, without locking the car. One in five of the almost 1.5m cars broken-into, stolen or driven away each year have been left open, some with the keys still in the ignition. Making life easy for a thief is irresponsible. Insurance companies now take a hard line on claims for losses from unlocked homes. Cars are no different. Next, breakdowns. Some, such as running out of petrol, are really inexcusable. Yet, on a typical day, the Automobile Association alone answers 100 calls from members who have done so. Never ignore a low fuel warning; go to the next garage. And remember that sensible drivers fill up long before the light comes on. Check the tyres now and again. Roadside wheel changes are usually avoidable. If one tyre looks a bit soft, just putting in more air is asking for trouble because sudden deflations nearly always start with a slow loss of pressure caused by a nail. The leak can only get worse as time goes on and could eventually leave you stranded on a motorway when an under-inflated, overheated tyre blows out. I suppose I am old-fashioned but I believe that, legal obligations apart, motorists are morally bound to keep their cars in safe mechanical condition. Regular servicing is essential. Too many people do nothing to their cars except put in petrol and call out the rescue service when they break down. Just as there is active and passive car safety - not getting into dangerous situations and surviving a crash, in that order - there is active and passive car security. Active security is using your head to avoid trouble; passive security is mostly about car alarms and engine immobilisers. Increasingly, alarm systems are being fitted as standard by car manufacturers but according to Ross Group, a maker and installer, many women are confused. What, they ask, is the difference between an alarm and an immobiliser? Answer: an alarm sets off a siren and flashes lights if a thief tries to get into a locked car. An immobiliser is an electronic cut-out to prevent the engine from being started. The best and most expensive systems have both. Other questions include: Can I protect myself when returning to my car at night? Fit a remotely controlled alarm like Gemini 5000 with a distress button. (Cost Pounds 199 to Pounds 349). You can set off siren and flashing lights from a distance if you suspect someone is lurking near your car. Is there any way of telling if someone has tried to break into my car so I can be extra-careful and perhaps park it somewhere else in future? Yes. An alarm with a status indicator will even show which protective circuit has been tampered with. Can I leave my children and dogs in the car for a moment after setting the alarm without them accidentally making it go off? Some alarms have remote sensor disconnection (RSD). For a short period, it will go off only if someone tries to force the doors. How can I go about fitting an alarm? It depends how much security you want. Do-it-yourself installations start from around Pounds 60, or a specialist will fit one at his workshop or your home. Call Homefit on freephone 0800-378 400 for details. If you plan to have an alarm fitted, consult your insurance company. Many offer discounts on both premiums and the cost of installation.</p>

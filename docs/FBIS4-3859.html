			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- China today called  on the developed countries to coordinate their monetary policy  more adequately and effectively, which it said is vital to world  economy and trade.    "The asymmetrical economic cycles and adjustment pace as  well  as the resulting weakening coordination mechanism have weakened  the role the industrial countries in the world economy," said  Chen Yuan, deputy governor of People's Bank of China.    Speaking here today at the 42nd meeting of the Interim  Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Chen  stressed that the developing countries have played an important  role in helping the global economy out of its difficulties.    Chen said most of the developed countries, with better  conditions of fiscal deficit and public debt, should enhance the  underlying fiscal position to create favorable conditions for  world economic growth.    Noting that many developed countries have achieved price  stability, Chen said that these countries should take the  domestic economic cycles into consideration while formulating  monetary policy.    These countries, Chen said, "should also coordinate policies  to avoid a recurrence of the turbulence in the international  monetary system."    He said that the long-lasting structural unemployment in  developed countries can only be addressed through reforms of the  labor market and an acceleration of industrial restructuring in  these countries.    The deputy governor of China's central bank also pointed out  that the developed countries' reliance on protectionism to ease  domestic economic difficulties will only prolong the structural  adjustment process.</p>

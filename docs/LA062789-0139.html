			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHANGHAI TRAIN BLAST'S TOLL REACHES 24  </P> <P> The death toll in a dynamite explosion on a Shanghai-bound express train rose  to 24 today, and Chinese state television, showing dramatic footage of the  twisted, gutted carriage, said the blast was "man-made."  </P> <P> It was not clear whether Monday's blast was linked to massive public anger over  the June 3-4 army operation against pro-democracy protesters in Beijing and the  subsequent repression of sympathizers across the country.  </P> <P> Three men were executed in Shanghai last week for attacking a train that had  plowed through demonstrators blocking the line. Seven other people were  executed in Beijing.  </P> <P> A diplomat in Shanghai, China's largest city and industrial hub, said he  understood that the explosion aboard the train was "deliberate."  </P> <P> Another envoy said the possibility of sabotage was high. "It's hard to imagine  anyone accidentally dropping dynamite into the toilet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tighter Security  </P> <P> Possibly coincidentally, security in Beijing appeared to have been further  strengthened, with many more troops on the streets. Parts of the Chinese  capital have been under martial law since May 20.  </P> <P> The mass media, still pouring out propaganda to justify the decision to send  troops with tanks against unarmed protesters, killing hundreds, published for  the first time a key speech about the crisis by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping  and ordered everyone to study it.  </P> <P> Deng's June 9 address to top military and Communist Party leaders was already  required reading for the 47 million party members out of the total population  of 1.1 billion.  </P> <P> Now the speech has been revealed to all.  </P> <P> State radio broadcast long extracts, and the official New China News Agency  issued the full text, ensuring it will be splashed across newspaper front pages  Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Asian bank tries to reverse closure A director of Mount Banking, the small Asian-owned bank, yesterday tried to overturn in the High Court the Banking Appeal Tribunal's decision to uphold Mount's closure by the Bank of England in 1992. In its first ever case, the tribunal found last October that the Bank had been right to assess Mount's two directors and shareholders as not 'fit and proper' to run a bank. Counsel for Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah claimed that many of the original grounds for the Bank's decision had not been upheld by the tribunal and that it had changed the charges from 'not fit and proper' to 'may not have been fit and proper'. Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Shah, the other director and owner of the bank, did not appeal against the tribunal's decision. The hearing is expected to last about three days.</p>

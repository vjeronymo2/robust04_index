Less That 1 Percent of the  GRoss Domestic Product Is Being Allocated for Science'']    [Text] On Tuesday a joint meeting with the participation of  Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice bloc, Nikolay  Vorontsov, head of the Duma Committee for Education, Science,  and Culture, and Russian Federation Minister of Science Boris  Saltykov, which was devoted to the search for means of reforming  the organization and financing of scientific research, was held  at the Ogareva, 5 Center.    In the USSR the expenditures on design development and  scientific research came to 6 percent of the gross domestic  product (GDP) with 100 percent state financing. Now it will be  impossible to maintain such a structure. And last year the real  budget of science came to only 0.78 percent of the GDP with 100  percent state financing. In the opinion of Nikolay Vorontsov,  such a budget became a regional leader, but is absolutely  unacceptable for a country with such a level of development as  Russia. ``In any event Russia should preserve its basic science,  which is national property and creates the prerequisites for the  economic revival of the country,'' the duma committee chairman  believes.    In such countries as the United States, the FRG, and Great  Britain the spending on basic science comes to 2.5-3 percent of  the GDP with relatively low state coverage--40-50 percent. The  large countries of the third world, which aspire to leadership  in their regions (Brazil, India), are allocating for science up  to 1 percent of the GDP with a very high (up to 90 percent)  level of state financing. While the Pacific Ocean model (the  ``dragons''--Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan) is characterized by  high expenditures on science (on the order of 2.5 percent of the  GDP) with low (20-30 percent) state participation.    The question is, What model should Russia follow? In the  opinion of the conference participants, now, inasmuch as private  business, which would be capable of financing the spending on  applied research at the level of 2.5 percent of the GDP, does  not yet exist in the country, Russia cannot venture to orient  itself toward developed western countries. The necessary minimum  spending on science is 15 trillion rubles (or 2 percent of the  GDP). In accordance with the Summary Financial Balance for 1994  only 11.8 trillion rubles have been allocated. It turns out that  the per capita spending on science in the Russian Federation is  significantly less than the average world spending and a factor  of 10 less than in the leading industrial countries.</p>

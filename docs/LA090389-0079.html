			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FLORA OF THE VALLEY: FENNEL  </P> <P> Sweet fennel sometimes announces its presence ahead of time.  </P> <P> From around the bend on a mountain road or around the corner on an urban block  comes the smell of anise.  </P> <P> When the turn is accomplished, the source is confirmed: a tall cluster of  stalks with branches of fern-like leaves and crowned with airy light-yellow  snowflakes of blossoms.  </P> <P> Naturalized from Europe long ago, sweet fennel, a perennial herb, is usually  from 3 feet to more than 8 feet tall and blooms from May to September.  </P> <P> All parts of it are aromatic, including the stalks, which are bluish-green with  a silvery sheen that is easily wiped off with a finger that becomes suddenly  fragrant.  </P> <P> Crushing the flowers or leaves or seeds intensifies the scent.  </P> <P> In fact, the early missionaries, it is said, harnessed this property by  spreading sweet fennel in the church aisles.  </P> <P> A member of the carrot family, sweet fennel bears the Latin name of Foeniculum  vulgare.  </P> <P> Foeniculum means "small hay," and probably derives from the plant's scent;  vulgare means common.  </P> <P> The leaves, which are sheathed at the base, can be cooked as a vegetable or  used in sauces.  </P> <P> Some leaves make up the ingredients of today's French and Italian cuisine.

There is no  end in sight to the wave of demonstrations and conflicts. The  situation remains highly explosive. [passage omitted]    What do our politicians have to say?    SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] leader Rudolf  Scharping told BILD: "The law must be rigorously applied  against people who commit acts of violence and go on the rampage  in our country."    Speaking to BILD, Baden-Wuerttemberg Minister-President  Erwin  Teufel called for more police to be deployed against terror in  the streets: "People who are eligible for military service  should be able to serve in the police force as volunteers for a  period of 10 years instead of joining fire brigades or disaster  relief organizations." They should help the police in the case  of demonstrations, large-scale operations, or assist with office  work.    Teufel also does not exclude the possibility of deploying  the  Bundeswehr within Germany. "Before I would let the state go to  the dogs, I would support using the Bundeswehr as a kind of  National Guard within the country, but only with the approval of  majority that can alter the constitution."</p>

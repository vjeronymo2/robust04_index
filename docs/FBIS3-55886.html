The compromise set the figure at 35. The opposition proposed  50, while reformers insisted on 20.    Lawmaker Anatoliy Lukyanov, former Soviet parliament  speaker,  explained that the State Duma will consist of groups and  factions which will enjoy equal rights. The minimum number of  members for factions will be 14. This is the number of seats  enjoyed by the Democratic Party of Russia which was the last  among eight election blocs to overcome the five per cent hurdle  in the December elections.    Another compromise was reached on the issue of the interim  chairman. Several lawmakers called to replace Georgiy Lukava  from the party of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who they said is  inexperienced in the job.    Now the session will be chaired by three oldest deputies in  turn for two hours each -- Vladimir Bokov, Sergey Kovalev and  Georgiy Lukava.    The Duma also elected Sergey Stankevich, the sacked  presidential aide, to head the interim secretariat consisting of  20 people.    Igor Bratishchev was elected head of the vote-counting  commission while Grigoriy Bondarev became the chairman of the  interim commission for procedural rules.    The interim secretariat will include five commissions -- for  registration of deputies' associations, for organisation of the  Duma sessions, for registration of deputies' proposals, for  public relations, for work with proposals on Duma's schedule.</p>

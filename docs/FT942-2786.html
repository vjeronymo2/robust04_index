			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional charge for Allied Leisure Shares in Allied Leisure fell 2p to 25p yesterday after the nightclub and ten-pin bowling group said that an exceptional charge of Pounds 500,000 relating to the year ended July 16 1993 would be included in its results for the current year. In June 1993 the company received Pounds 500,000 following a trading arrangement with a supplier which was treated as income in the accounts. However, the company said it had subsequently become apparent that the receipt was a loan and accordingly it was necessary to include it as a charge in the current year's accounts. Also, in its interim results statement for the 24 weeks to January 2, when the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 16.1m, the company said it was in breach of its banking covenants. Since then it has entered into a formal standstill agreement on capital repayments and a continuation of banking facilities has been agreed until September 19 1994. Allied said the agreement would enable it to continue its negotiations regarding possible disposals and on a wider range of strategic options. In order to aid the negotiations and the financial restructuring the company is bringing forward its year-end to June 19.</p>

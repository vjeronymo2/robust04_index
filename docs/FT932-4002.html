			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Row over schools funding THE Department for Education yesterday admitted that grant-maintained schools, which have opted out of local education authority control, had been double-funded by Pounds 13.6m. However, it denied a claim by Labour that grant-maintained schools would now be 'squeezed'. It said: 'Education Secretary John Patten is committed to ensuring that GM schools continue to get the extra funding they need to meet their added responsibilities as self-governing schools.' Figures revealed in a parliamentary answer to Mr Win Griffiths, a Labour education spokesman, and analysed by Local Schools Information, which is funded by local education authorities, showed that 260 schools received greater compensation for the loss of LEA services than those opting out this year. It also showed that 127 schools received more than Pounds 50,000 a year more than if they had opted out this year. The anomaly arose because early opt-out schools received cash protection for the amount of central grant paid to them to reflect the loss of local education authority services, while schools remaining in local authority control received less grant as more services were devolved to them under the local management of schools programme. The department said cash protection would continue for early opt-out schools because they had already made spending plans. It also published a second consultation paper on how a common funding formula for all state-maintained schools would work.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, June 20 (CNS) -- Railway service from  Fuzhou to elsewhere across the country came to a halt effective  at 2 a.m. this morning because there were landslides along the  railway lines caused by heavy rain.    Since the mid-June, various places along domestic railway  lines within Fujian Province were hit by torrential rain, which  was over 180 millimetres on average and up to some 400  millimetres in some places. Landslides because of floods  occurred along the Yongan branch railway line and outbound  railway lines between June 17 and 19. Roadbed was undermined,  culverts blocked up and tracks buried by mud. The 92-kilometre  outbound railway line between Laizhou and Gutian was badly hit  since early morning on June 19 when railway service there  stopped.    Officials from each section of outbound railway lines went  to  the scene to direct the flood control and emergency repair in  order to make railway service from Fuzhou to elsewhere across  the country resume as soon as possible.</p>

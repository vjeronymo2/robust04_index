			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (11): Running hard to make up lost ground - Company Profile / Northern Telecom NORTHERN TELECOM spent most of the 1980s carving out a market in the US for its big public switches, and developing a new fibre-optic transmission system. It failed to notice the rapidly growing cellular market. The Toronto-based company is now having to run hard to make up lost ground. 'We're still a small player coming in late,' says Mr John Roth, president of Northern's two-year-old wireless systems division, which now employs about 3,000 people. While Mr Roth says that Northern already has a 'superior product', he acknowledges that it has yet to build a reputation or a market presence which can match its rivals, notably Sweden's Ericsson. Its efforts to do so have so far had mixed results. On the one hand, a slew of new products and two international joint ventures have succeeded in raising its profile in the cellular business. Revenues have tripled in the past two years (Mr Roth declines to be more specific). Breakthroughs have included an order for switches and other cell-site equipment from Southwestern Bell, the Texas-based utility which has previously placed all its cellular business with AT&amp;T, Ericsson and Motorola. Northern is also supplying equipment for a residential wireless-telephone system being developed by Ionica, the UK company which obtained a public telephone operator's licence earlier this year. But Northern's entry into the cellular market has not been without setbacks. Its overall market share remains small. Northern's strength is its switching expertise. It claims that its DMS-MTX SuperNode digital switch has more than double the capacity of its nearest competitor. Northern expects demand for such high-powered switches to soar as the distance between cells continues to shrink and more calls from mobile phones require 'hand-offs' from one cell to another. A big challenge, however, has been to improve its access to radio technology. Northern gained one toehold with its purchase last year of the cellular radio manufacturing business of Novatel, a financially strained Alberta company. Northern has moved production to its own plant in Calgary, from where it has shipped about 12,000 digital radios. But a joint venture with Motorola, to serve the North American market, has failed to meet expectations. Mr Roth says that 'we thought that (Motorola) would have a stronger radio portfolio than it turned out they actually had.' Another point of friction has been Motorola's strong commitment to Code Division Multiple Access, a new - but controversial - radio-frequency technology. CDMA clashes with the digital Time-Division Multiple Access technique favoured so far by Northern. The joint venture has been all but disbanded, although the two companies still plan to press ahead with cellular systems which integrate Northern switches with Motorola wireless equipment. A global partnership with Matra Communications of France, based on the European Groupe Special Mobile wireless standard, has been more fruitful. This joint venture, known as Nortel Matra Cellular, installed a GSM cellular network for Optus Communications of Australia earlier this year. It also has orders from Austria, and is currently negotiating a sizeable contract in Germany. In North America, Nortel Matra has provided handsets and other equipment to MCI, the US long-distance carrier, for GSM trials in Washington DC. The tests aim to give cellular subscribers access to such features as voice mail and screening incoming calls. Northern's thrust into mobile communications has also taken it into the low-powered end of the market. Its digital Companion wireless system is designed for customers - such as hospitals, car dealerships and hotels  - whose employees need a cordless phone without the range of a full-scale public cellular network. The Companion system can be used either as a sophisticated two-way radio, or linked to a switchboard as an adjunct to an office telephone. Employees can answer calls dialled to their internal phone number either on a wired telephone or a cordless handset. Numerous other variations are being developed, including a system which will link divisions of the same company located in buildings miles apart. British Telecom began offering Northern's Companion system last June. Mr Roth expects that customers in 15-20 countries will have signed up by the end of this year.</p>

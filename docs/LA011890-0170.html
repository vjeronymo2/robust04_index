			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPROVAL OF $50-MILLION PROJECT DELAYED;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: PASADENA BOARD OF DIRECTORS WANTS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FUNDING  OF THE MARENGO BLOCK PLAN.  </P> <P> Continued objections by the city's Endowment Advisory Commission have caused  the Board of Directors to withhold approval, at least for a week, of the  $50.5-million Marengo block development plan, a key element in the city's  downtown Civic Center master plan.  </P> <P> Faced with money questions Tuesday from the commission about the complicated  project that took 1 1/2 years to devise, the board asked members of the city's  planning staff and the Janss Corp., the project's Santa Monica-based developer,  to meet immediately with commission members.  </P> <P> The commission was directed to examine whether the city has a strong enough  guarantee of repayment of a $2.9-million loan that is part of the development  deal.  </P> <P> "We're in favor of the project; we're not opposed to the project. We just don't  like the financial arrangements," Leigh Rosenberg, chairman of the eight-member  commission, said during Tuesday's board meeting.  </P> <P> Director Chris Holden said he wants to hear alternatives to a controversial  part of the project that calls for relocating and converting the out-of-date  police building to low-income senior housing at a cost that could reach $6.1  million.  </P> <P> The board did not rule out discussion of other financial aspects when it meets  again Tuesday to vote on the project.  </P> <P> "I'm open to new information," Director Rick Cole said, although he said the  board should avoid rehashing the same issues already covered during three hours  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The project is proposed for a roughly triangular-shaped, four-acre piece of  land between Holly and Walnut streets and between Marengo Street and the Santa  Fe Railway tracks next to Memorial Park. The four-story, 59-year-old police  building on the site would be relocated and the building converted to 44 units  of senior housing. The Fire Department headquarters, fire station and emergency  operations center on Marengo Street would be moved and the buildings  demolished; 350 units of housing in nine separate buildings would be  constructed.  </P> <P> The development would include two levels of parking and 9,000 square feet of  retail space. If the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission approves a  light-rail line through Pasadena, the site would also contain the city's major  rail stop.  </P> <P> The Endowment Advisory Commission's objections center on the city's financial  share in the project and the high cost of converting the police building to  senior housing.  </P> <P> As now proposed, the Janss Corp. would give the city $6.9 million for the  property -- $4 million in cash and a note for $2.9 million payable over 22  years. The city would also receive a small share of any future profits should  the corporation sell the project. Commission members believe the city should  establish a partnership with Janss to retain city ownership of the land and  garner a larger share of the profits from any future sale.  </P> <P> In addition, the commission said that it believes the cost for the renovation  of the police building -- which it estimates at $130,000 a unit -- is too high.  </P> <P> Like the commission, board members on Tuesday expressed their overall  satisfaction with the project but also voiced reservations about its financial  arrangements. Director John Crowley asked for collateral for the $2.9-million  loan, and Director Jess Hughston asked for information about the costs to the  city of relocating the Fire Department structures.  </P></p>

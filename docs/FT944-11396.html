			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / International Press Review: Molly a lone voice among doom-sayers - US The best antidote to gloom, doom and US media portentousness is called Molly Ivins, the unreconstructed liberal who writes a column when the mood takes her out of Austin, Texas. When California got hot under the collar about illegal immigrants from the south, she wrote that, in her neck of the woods, no one could find anything wrong with 'Messakins', as Texans call them. She was again outspoken last week in taking the wind out of the sails of the ship of heavy analysis about America's electoral agonies. On learning that the prevailing wisdom is that it is the 'cranky voters', not Washington politicians, who are to blame, she wrote that 'you could have knocked me over with Michael Huffington's brain'. The reference was to the Republican candidate for Senate in California. However, the unsinkable Molly, even at her most deliciously ironic, is a minority with few companions. The comics and cartoonists have had their fun with the likes of Huffington and Oliver North (Republican Senate candidate in Virginia), but most of the rest of the media have been wringing their hands and often screwing up their noses before making endorsements. Clearly partisan publications - the Wall Street Journal on the right, the New York Times on the centre-left - have taken editorial satisfaction, respectively, in likely Republican gains generally and the probable re-election of Mario Cuomo as Democratic governor of New York. There has been some breaking of type - the liberal Los Angeles Times, which has made no endorsement in a governor's race since 1970, opting for Republican Pete Wilson in California, and the Washington Post preferring Republican Carol Schwartz over the rehabilitated Marion Barry for mayor. But Boston's leading newspaper, the Globe, did its duty and supported Edward Kennedy in glowing terms, finding no evidence of a liberal resting on his laurels. 'Kennedy's pace has only quickened, especially in the last two years. . . for these reasons - his energy, his focus and his ability - the Globe endorses his re-election.' Still, there is nothing like dislike of a candidate to sharpen the leader writer's pen. The Cincinnati, Ohio, Enquirer said this of the hapless Joel Hyatt, running for the Senate as a Democrat; he 'is only as deep as a fresh coat of furniture wax. He comes across like a college student who thinks he can fake it through finals with a charming smile.' The other end of the age scale was also on the mind of the Wilmington, Delaware, News Journal, which was relatively unusual in finding good in both its Senate candidates before plumping for the return of William Roth, the 73-year old Republican. It acknowledged the senator had slowed down but wrote, charitably, that 'doesn't mean that we have outlived our usefulness or that we should be thrown on to the scrapheap.' But the Burlington, Vermont, Free Press, turned rather savagely on James Jeffords, one of the most liberal Republicans in the Senate, in endorsing his opponent, Ms Jan Backus. 'Now, it's sad to say, he has come to typify what is wrong with Washington; lots of money spent and nothing getting done.' Some newspapers found merit in Washington seniority, however. The liberal Bergen, New Jersey, Record, endorsing Senator Frank Lautenberg, the Democrat, wrote 'we agree with his philosophy of using the federal government to solve major domestic problems'. The view of the Courier Post of Camden, New Jersey, could not have been more different. '(Chuck the Republican) Haytaian's thrust is right for the '90s. A lot of us are as mad as hell. We want the government off our backs and the sooner the better.' Reflections of this view have been the dominant strain in analytical reportage and punditry. Writing on negative campaigning in the Washington Post, David Broder, who has rarely seen an election he did not like, wrote 'people are looking for enemies. . . it's that criminal out there, real or symbolic, that people want to run against rather than run against their opponent'. Albert Hunt of the Wall Street Journal, with views never to be confused with those of his newspaper's leader writers, wrote sadly that 'the one lesson that should be drawn from this dreary experience - the need to make state and congressional campaign financing more like the presidential system with partial public funding - is a non-starter politically.' But the last word on all this lamentation and navel-gazing should be left with Molly Ivins. 'What a bunch of chumps, boobs, saps, dolts, clods, goofs, mutts, jerks, fools and ignorami we all are. I know you're feeling just as ashamed as I am.'</p>

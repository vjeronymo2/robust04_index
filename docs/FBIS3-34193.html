Our correspondent reports: [passage omitted]    Upon his arrival to Tehran, Mr. Bolkiah said that the  expansion of relations in all fields was the most important aim  of his visit to our country.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani spoke on the visit of the sultan of  Brunei, saying:    [Begin Rafsanjani recording] Brunei is an Islamic country,  its people are committed Muslims, and its government and people  are all Muslims and our brothers.    In our foreign policy we give priority to Islamic countries.  I had asked the esteemed sultan of Brunei to visit Iran to  discuss common religious issues and the current situation in the  world of Islam, which necessitates cooperation among Islamic  countries. Also his excellency can become more familiar with  Iran and we can get to know Brunei better. We can also assess  any kind of cooperation which may exist between us and Brunei.  In any case, we believe that further cooperation among Islamic  countries is in the interests of Muslims and their countries.  We hope to pave the way for further cooperation and become  closer to each other. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Leading Indian industrialists call for reforms LEADING Indian industrialists have appealed to the government for measures to help them raise capital for their listed companies without over-diluting the founding families' shareholdings. Eight entrepreneurs, the heads of some of India's largest companies, presented their demands on Wednesday in a report to Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister. Their proposals include permission for companies to issue non-voting shares and to buy stock at large discounts to stock market prices as well as changes in tax laws. The appeal follows a month of meetings of conservatively-inclined industrialists at which concerns were raised about parts of the government's economic liberalisation programme. The businessmen, dubbed the Bombay Club after their first meeting in Bombay, have been accused of wanting a slowdown in reform and protection against foreign competition. The entrepreneurs themselves deny this and say they support the pace and direction of liberalisation. The members of the Bombay Club include Mr Hari Shankar Singhania, chairman of the Delhi-based JK Organisation, and Mr LM Thapar, chairman of Ballarpur Industries, a top papermaker. Their chief concern is that the state-owned financial institutions which dominate the Indian stock market have permitted multinationals to raise their stakes in Indian affiliates from 40 per cent to 51 per cent by issuing stock at discounts of up to 90 per cent. Institutions have indicated they would not permit Indian companies to make similar cut-price issues. The report to the finance minister also proposes permission for shareholders to pledge stock as security for bank loans, easing limits on corporate borrowing and permission to issue non-voting stock. Foreign companies have secured government approval for direct investments worth Rs61.1bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in the first nine months of 1993, compared with Rs5.3bn in 1991 and Rs38.9bn last year. The government said this was an unprecedented response to the new industrial policy from foreign investors, who had now pledged Rs104.1bn since reforms started in mid-1991. More than 90 per cent of the capital was intended for priority sectors such as power and oil refining or high-technology projects.</p>

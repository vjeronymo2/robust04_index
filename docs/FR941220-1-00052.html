			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) The State has the option of whether or not to allow PWSs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate compliance through the Alternative Method of Compliance. Where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State has chosen not to allow the Alternative Method of Compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PWSs shall demonstrate compliance by achieving the MCL in samples taken at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each entry point to the distribution system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Where EPA is the primacy agent, the Regional Administrator may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize PWSs to demonstrate compliance through the Alternative Method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance. In determining whether to authorize the use of the Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method of Compliance, the Regional Administration in its sole discretion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may consider the availability of regional resources, and whether it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable and practical for the Regional Office to oversee implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Alternative Method of Compliance. If the Regional Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizes the Alternative Method of Compliance, each PWS shall have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option to comply either by achieving the MCL in samples taken at each entry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point to the distribution system or through the Alternative Method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Until such time as notified by the State or Primacy Agency that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative Method of Compliance will be authorized, PWSs shall be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to achieve the MCL at each entry point to the distribution system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The general prohibition on the use of bottled water and point-of-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices in 40 CFR 141.101 shall not apply to PWSs that choose to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the MCL for sulfate by meeting the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative Method of Compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) A PWS must report failure to comply with a NPDWR to the State under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of 40 CFR 141.31. Within 30 days of notifying the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of failure to comply with the sulfate MCL, the PWS shall notify the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as to which of the two methods of compliance, &sect;141.23(r)(1)(i) (A) or (B),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the PWS intends to use to return to compliance with the sulfate MCL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative Water Supplied to Target Populations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirements of this subsection apply only to a PWS that has chosen to comply with the MCL for sulfate through the Alternative Method of Compliance instead of by achieving the MCL in samples taken at each entry point to the distribution system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative water:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this section, a PWS supplies Alternative Water when it supplies either bottled water or water that has been treated with a POU or POE device (as defined in &sect;141.2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Target population,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for purposes of this section, means all infants, travelers and new residents within the PWS's service area, according to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For the purposes of this rule,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infant <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is defined as persons under the age of 12 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transients <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means visitors from outside the service area, vacation travelers and business travelers. <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New residents <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means persons who have resided in the service area for no more than six weeks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Community water systems shall maintain a record of all requests for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative Water. Records shall include the name and address of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person requesting the water, date of request, date of delivery requested,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of delivery and quantity of water delivered (or date of installation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the case of a POU/POE device). This record shall be maintained for five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years from the time of recording.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Community water systems shall supply Alternative Water in compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this subsection to the Target Population for the time periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described under paragraph (r)(2)(vii) of this section. Transient water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems and non-transient, non-community systems shall have alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water available for infants, travelers, newcomers and visitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Community water systems shall provide door-to-door delivery of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water or installation of POU or POE devices upon request to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customers who are within the Target Population. The PWS shall have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of deciding whether to provide a customer with bottled water or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> POU/POE devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bottled water requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quality. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Bottled water provided by the PWS shall meet the requirements of &sect;142.62 (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quantity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Community water systems shall have bottled water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available and delivered at the level of two liters per day for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each person within the Target Population for whom bottled water is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested (unless the customer requests a lesser amount).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transient water systems and non-transient, non-community systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall have sufficient bottled water to serve the transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population, unless POE or POU devices are installed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Time of delivery. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Community water systems shall deliver the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water within 24 hours of the request, or on the date requested, whichever is later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> POU and POE device requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  PWSs that choose POU or POE devices as a method of compliance shall meet the following requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) PWSs that choose POE devices as a method of compliance shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the requirements of &sect;141.100 (a) through (d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If the PWS decides to provide a POE/POU device and is unable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to install such equipment within 24 hours of the request, or on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date requested, the PWS shall provide bottled water to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target population during the interim time period between the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the request and the time of installation of the POU/POE device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) PWSs that choose POU devices as a method of compliance shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain the approval of a monitoring plan which ensures that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices provide water that complies with the sulfate MCL. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the responsibility of the public water system to operate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain the POU system. The microbiological safety of the water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be maintained at all times. The State shall require adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification of performance and a rigorous engineering design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review. The design and application of the POU must consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for increasing concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in water treated with activated carbon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

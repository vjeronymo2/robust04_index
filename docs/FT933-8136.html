			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Tensions hamper Greek investment in Albania OUTSIDE the Gjirokaster tannery in southern Albania's north Epirus region, local farmers are disputing the offering price for sheep hides. Inside, Greek technicians are installing an automated production line for making shoes. Mr Spiros Lilis, the deputy manager, says a year-long delay in starting up the Dr2.5bn (Dollars 10m) joint venture between a leading Greek leather manufacturer and the Albanian state, the country's largest single foreign investment to date, is due more to bureaucracy than to political tensions between Greece and Albania. 'It took months to work out an exemption from the 30 per cent import tax on new machinery, on the grounds that we'll be exporting most of our output,' he said. 'But we demonstrated our commitment to the project by paying the workforce during that time.' Close to the tannery, three joint ventures making clothes for export occupy what was a state-owned textile factory. The 1,200 workers employed there earn Dollars 60 a month, double the average Albanian wage but only a fraction of that in Greece. 'Our Irish partner provided the sewing machines, the Greek partner sends ready-cut fabric for sewing and the French partner organises the marketing,' said Mr Konstandin Caro of Gjirotext, the largest manufacturer. Still, the revived dispute between the Greek and Albanian governments over the region, where much of the population is of ethnic Greek descent, is damaging its chances of leading Albania out of dire poverty with a steady flow of Greek investment. Albania's expulsion last month of a Greek priest accused of promoting nationalism provoked violent demonstrations in Gjirokaster. Greece responded by deporting more than 30,000 of an estimated 200,000 Albanian immigrants who mainly work in the flourishing black economy. Albanian fears that Greece still covets the region, where Greek troops set up a shortlived protectorate in 1914, have been rekindled, reflecting both the emergence of a strong nationalist faction in Greece's governing conservative party and concern that the war in Bosnia may spread to the southern Balkans. Such anxieties were heightened when Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, recently raised the issue of autonomy for north Epirus within Albania. The Greeks worry that the Albanian government, growing authoritarian, will step up discrimination against the ethnic Greek minority. Its leaders have already claimed they face obstacles in getting permission for Greek to be taught in schools, as well as in bidding for property and businesses being sold under Albania's privatisation programme. 'Greek businessmen are definitely more hesitant about investing in southern Albania because of the worsened political climate,' says Mr Yiannis Tzen, who is in charge of the Greek Economy Ministry's programme for investing there. About 70 Greek-Albanian joint ventures have been set up since Greece's investment incentives law was extended last year to include southern Albania, creating about 12,000 jobs there, according to the ministry. So far this year, the government has provided Dollars 1.1bn in grants for 35 projects.</p>

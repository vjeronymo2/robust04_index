			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Hong Kong shrugs off doubts Hong Kong has shrugged off earlier economic uncertainties surrounding the 1997 handover of the colony to Chinese rule and looks set for continued rapid growth sustained by a large booming economy on its doorstep, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said yesterday. The latest report by the Gatt secretariat on Hong Kong's trade policies and practices says trade patterns have changed markedly over the past few years. Exports of domestic goods stagnated between 1990 and 1993 but re-exports from China doubled and services exports increased by over 50 per cent. At the same time, Hong Kong-based companies have poured investment into China, especially in the neighbouring Guangdong Province and the Special Economic Zones. Hong Kong is the largest source of foreign direct investment in China and in 1993 accounted for 83 per cent of such investment in Guangdong province as businesses took advantage of lower costs to relocate basic manufacturing activities. However, Gatt notes that a drop of two-fifths in Hong Kong's manufacturing workforce since the mid-1980s has been entirely offset by a rise in services employment, especially business services such as finance, marketing, design and logistics. Textiles and clothing still represent over one-third of manufacturing value-added, followed by electrical and electronic products with about one-quarter.</p>

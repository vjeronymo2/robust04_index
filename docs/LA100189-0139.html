			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM SCHOOL SURVEY RESULTS  </P> <P> I must take exception with some information in a letter to the editor (Sept.  24) written by Edwina Walsh, a teacher in the Anaheim Union High School  District.  </P> <P> She stated that "more than half" of the Anaheim parents were dissatisfied with  the superintendent, according to a survey conducted last year. This is an  inaccurate interpretation of the results.  </P> <P> The district conducts a survey each year of a randomly selected sample of  parents to determine levels of satisfaction, as well as need for change. Last  year when asked if they were satisfied with the actions and decisions of the  Board of Trustees and the superintendent, nearly half the parents had a  positive, not negative response. The actual percentages are as follows:  </P> <P> Positive: 44%.  </P> <P> Negative: 6%.  </P> <P> Undecided: 10%.  </P> <P> Insufficient information: 38%.  </P> <P> In fact, if those who disqualified themselves for lack of information were  removed from this group and the results recalculated, the results would be even  more positive.  </P> <P> Positive: 73%.  </P> <P> Negative: 10%.  </P> <P> Undecided: 17%.  </P> <P> JAMES COX  </P> <P> Director, Research and Evaluation  </P> <P> Anaheim Union High School District  </P></p>

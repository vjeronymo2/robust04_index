			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Green agenda EMOTIONS about the environment run deep, as the FT's postbag in response to a summer series of leading articles about green issues has demonstrated. The core of our argument has been that the costs and benefits of environmental policies must be established as precisely as possible and that priorities should be set on the basis of those calculations and judgments. This is the inescapable task of the next phase of environmental politics, which must try to implement the rafts of regulation which governments have written in the last two decades. Everyone should consider that legislative effort a success; we should also learn from it. The costs of going green need to be made explicit, particularly as recession has deepened reservations about meeting the bill. If people are ignorant of price, their environmental demands may be limitless. But when UK water companies this summer asked their customers where they would like money spent, the results confounded those who say that customers cannot make hard environmental choices. More on getting lead out of drinking water, even at the expense of better sewage treatment, was the clear answer. Governments and pressure groups also need to do a better job of helping people judge which trends pose the greatest risk to their health. One global 'danger' after another has provoked anxiety: from over-population to food and energy shortages, to ice ages and then global warming. Some of these have stood the test of time more than others: the risk of global warming, the FT has argued, should head the current list. Some look overblown, such as fear of nuclear power, genetic engineering, ozone holes or loss of species. The UK's Health and Safety Executive, a government agency, has published perceptive reports pointing out that people's fears often correspond poorly to the risk of disaster. There are limits to the precision with which economists can value environmental preferences, but those who resists attempts to price the environment are more often than not wishing, undemocratically, to impose their preferences upon others. The public has shown strong support for green issues in the past two decades; in the past two years it has also shown realism about the costs. But a healthy debate requires accurate information about the state of the environment, which governments have frequently failed to provide. The green wish list is long and there is no sign that the world is willing to pay for all of it. Previous articles: July 21, August 2 and 19 and September 1.</p>

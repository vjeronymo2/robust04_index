			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I just read the smug letter by Lorraine Evans (Viewers' Views, Aug. 19)  regarding the TV commercial for Secure Horizons.  </P> <P> I had seen the commercial many times but paid no attention to it until January,  1986. Then I listened, acted and received the information from the company. You  have no idea what Secure Horizons has meant to us and still does.  </P> <P> Lorraine, don't be so smug. That commercial has been a blessing financially to  hundreds of senior citizens.  </P> <P> Sally Olivas, Banning  </P></p>

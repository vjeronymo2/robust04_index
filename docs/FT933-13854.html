			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Banks 'break code' on disclosure SIR BRYAN Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, yesterday accused banks of breaking their own code of practice by evading requirements to gain customers' consent before disclosing account information internally. Sir Bryan said the 'spirit and perahaps even the letter' of the code was being broken by banks when they required customers to give consent for internal disclosure of information if they wanted to receive services. He said the review committee under Sir George Blunden which is considering alterations to the code from next March should recommend 'appropriately strong action' to prevent banks from interpreting the code requirements differently. Banks have been keen to gain customer consent to disclose account details to subsidiaries, such as insurance sales arms, because they are trying to increase 'cross-selling' of other financial services to existing customers. Sir Bryan listed different attitudes to the requirement that banks should not disclose customer information except in cases 'where the disclosure is made at the request, or with the consent, of the customer'. These included a bank (thought to be Lloyds) that requires express consent, and a bank that relies on 'negative consent' (thought to be a reference to Midland's requirement that customers not wanting disclosure should tick a box). He also referred to a bank that 'insists on customers providing access'. This is thought to be a reference to Barclays, which now tells customers applying for a variety of financial products that an application implies consent. Finally, Sir Bryan said one bank had made its life insurance sales force employees of the bank 'thereby giving them free access to customers' accounts'. This is thought to be a reference to National Westminster. In his submission to Sir George's review committee, Sir Bryan also called for banks to be required to give 'best advice' on the choice of mortgages. This would mean giving impartial advice between endowment and repayment mortgages. The Office of Fair Trading is thought to be concerned that the current code of banking practice, introduced as a voluntary alternative to legislation in March 1992, does not cover the growing range of financial services. Sir Bryan also said the code should be extended to cover small businesses. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

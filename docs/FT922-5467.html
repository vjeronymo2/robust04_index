			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Cricket: Umpires need to put their foot down - The contrast between this summer's test opponents PAKISTAN'S spirited cricket this summer, notably in their struggle with England at the Oval last Friday, has highlighted several issues which never loom large in the modern game: issues of play, not public relations. While comment on the ancient art of swearing at the enemy continues to proliferate, little has been said about the far more interesting question which Inzamam-ul-Haq's dismissal at the Oval brought to light but not, for some reason, to much discussion. Inzamam was out leg-before-wicket to Derek Pringle for 15. He left the pitch with momentous slowness, trailing his bat behind him across the grass in little stretches. He was not pleased with the decision. Nor were any of his countrymen. A group of Pakistani spectators near me shrieked and held their heads, bewailing his departure. 'Again] Again] Given out when he's not out]' I plucked up courage and asked why he was not out. The answer came with furious contempt. 'Because he was playing forward.' Lbw has never been popular. Its unpopularity has gone through phases. In its early, absolute days it was best expressed by umpire Fuller Pilch's scornful response to lbw appeals in the late 1850s: 'None o' that. Bowl 'em out. Bowl 'em out.' As time passed, cricketers became more used to lbw, but the advent of swing bowling brought new scepticism about an umpire's ability to judge whether the ball was going to hit the stumps. Modern cricket retains this scepticism, crystallised in the belief that a batsman playing forward is pretty well immune to lbw. In fact, an lbw conviction should be made if the ball pitches 'between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the striker's wicket' and 'the point of impact is in a straight line between wicket and wicket' (law 36). Inzamam was unlucky because he was well forward, making it hard to judge whether the ball was stump-bound. But when the ball hit him, in front of the stumps, it was going low and straight. There is no reason a batsman playing forward should be an automatic innocent. In this series, umpires must make their lbw decisions - and all other decisions - confidently, or at least firmly. Anglo-Pakistani umpiring relations have not produced much tranquillity in recent years, as anyone who remembers the Mike Gatting / Shakoor Rana troubles of 1987 will know. Happy the men in white coats in the next few months, with their harrowing chance to improve international cricket relations. Authority is crucial for umpires. There is a new power parasite overhanging that authority in all cricket nowadays, from international right down to club level: management, with its match referees, its committees, boards and executives, its endless meetings, discussions and talks to 'media personnel' like myself and its public statements about things like the need to keep quiet. Umpires' authority is based on the rules of cricket, not the advice of managers, and would do well to take a strong, simple line on some of the more outrageous breaches of the rules. Many of these we see so often we scarcely notice them any more. Leaving the field with invisible injuries, for instance. English cricket is fraught with health consciousness and concern; hypochondriacs abound. Pakistani cricket is bored with fielding. Both are inclined to produce players who leave the field of play a bit too easily. It goes without saying that I am unfamiliar with Aamer Sohail's internal condition and I can only describe what I saw at the Oval, where a short spell of his slow left-arm bowling induced Allan Lamb to commit suicide with a hideous attempt at a heave, after which fielding looked like a fall from grace. Sohail stayed in the pavilion after lunch until Pakistan came out to bat, when he was well enough to open the innings in a fierce, fast partnership with Ramiz Raja. My Pakistani guide to the Oval explained in fluorescent prose: 'We are a cross between Italians and West Indians. We like drama. Our great love is batting because that is where the glory lies.' Bowling is important, of course, and the absence of Wasim Akram, since the Lord's one-day game, and Waqar Younis, since the start of the series, has badly damaged Pakistani morale. Much will depend on how well these two recover and, if they do not, how well their substitutes can be encouraged to bowl. But the supreme skill is batting, not bowling. Wasim, like Imran, is idolised back home because he can bat as well as bowl, successfully. A good development of the modern game, especially in its one-day form, is the greater importance attached to fielding and the higher standard achieved. Pakistan remain aloof from this and prefer the traditional view of fielding as one of the suburbs of the game. While Pringle could manage only some ill-footed lumbering round the boundary, Aqib Javed entertained south London with bad fielding on a truly heroic scale. When Salim Malik, Pakistan's one great 'touch' fielder, threw down the wicket to run out Graham Gooch for 25, my Pakistani instructor hastened to explain that Salim only did it because Gooch was his captain in Essex last year. 'Every time Salim fields well he is telling Gooch: 'I'm as good as you.' His real triumphs are as a batsman. He is Pakistan's David Gower, a natural genius with the bat.' As with Gower, the game comes so easily to Salim that he is liable to periodic lapses of concentration. When he played on to Pringle for 26, it was a symbolic defeat of elegance by persistence. Alec Stewart is the star of the hard-working school of cricket in favour in England at the moment. He batted wonderfully well, not least in his nifty running between the wickets, in humid, scorching heat, his unnecessary helmet stuck to his head with sweat as he hit Sohail and Mushtaq Ahmed's gentle deliveries all over the place. His wicket-keeping was all right, but no more than that. Pakistan's use of a specialist wicket-keeper is another example of their traditionalism, and a most welcome one. Moin Khan's work behind the stumps was extremely good. It cannot have been funny, catching everything behind to young Tanvir Mehdi's fast medium pace entry into international cricket. The bowling was often wide, always enterprising and given to trying out the full possibilities of both off and leg side. Moin stood very deep, like all modern glovemen, but kept sharply. His appeals grew more belligerent as his team's chances weakened. The Test matches will make more subtle demands. Doubtless Pakistan will go into them with a battle campaign. Their greatest problem will be keeping carefully to the plan worked out for each situation. The English problem, by contrast, is lack of initiative in changing situations. The greatest help for both sides will be knowing that five days give ample time for plotting and retaliation. In good Test cricket, attack breeds counter-attack. Collapse inspires come-back. My advice to those engaged in Test (or any other) matches is to grovel to the umpires and keep the spinners spinning.</p>

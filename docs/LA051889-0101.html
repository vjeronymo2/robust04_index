			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AQUINO WILL NOT APPEAR ON VENTURA THEATRE FIGHT CARD  </P> <P> LBA Associates has announced its upcoming professional fight card for the  Ventura Theatre on Wednesday at 7 p.m., but missing from the lineup is former  super welterweight champion Lupe Aquino of Santa Paula.  </P> <P> There had been speculation that Aquino, who is awaiting trial on  vehicular-manslaughter charges, would appear on this month's card, but LBA  president Paul Konapelsky said that his matchmaker, Buddy Bereal, has not  talked to anyone in the Aquino camp.  </P> <P> "Lupe Aquino is a hot item to the residents of Ventura, but politics aside, we  just want to put on the best all-around program," Konapelsky said.  </P> <P> Controversy has arisen over whether Aquino had been suspended by the California  State Athletic Commission. However, both Konapelsky and Aquino's attorney,  Robert Caron, said that the fighter has not been suspended, that he simply did  not renew his California license.  </P> <P> Said Konapelsky: "Even if he was licensed, for the kind of money, five or six  thousand dollars, it would be better for us to use that money to draw a  heavyweight bout and let the politics of Lupe Aquino take care of itself."  </P> <P> There will be five bouts on Wednesday's, including the main event between  former WBC lightweight champion Lonnie Smith of Las Vegas and Ken Comer of Los  Angeles. The junior welterweight bout is scheduled for 10 rounds.  </P> <P> Other bouts include: Danny Garcia of Oxnard vs. Jose Loreiana of Bakersfield in  an eight-round junior welterweight fight; Raul Gonzales vs. Art Lizeraga, six  rounds, junior welterweight; Victor Flores vs. Juvenal Molina, six rounds,  featherweight; and Tony Rivera taking on Joe DeMarco in a four-round junior  lightweight opening bout.  </P> <P> Once again missing from the card is Camarillo's Robbie Ruiz, who has still not  been able to find his first professional opponent.  </P></p>

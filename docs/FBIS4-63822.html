			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 25 May -- The Russian side today submitted  to NATO a document containing the main parameters of Russian  participation in the implementation of the Partnership for Peace  program. At the same time it was proposed to start drawing up a  broad program of cooperation between Russia and NATO that would  be based on these parameters and to sign the outline document as  soon as this program is ready.    In the political sphere, Russia proposes the creation of an  effective mechanism of mutual consultations on the entire range  of problems of European and world security, which would operate  both on a regular basis and in emergencies. Such a mechanism  would be a practical step on the way to the formation of a  long-term system of collective security and stability in Europe  under the aegis of the CSCE. In the military sphere, Russia is  ready to develop cooperation with NATO and partners in such  areas as coordinating joint military activities, peace-keeping,  transparency in military planning and military activities, and  personnel training. It also expects to establish partnership  relations in other areas, such as disarmament and arms control,  conversion, nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons, and  protection of the environment.</p>

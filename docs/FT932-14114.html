			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Japanese money supply contracts by 0.3% THE FRAGILITY of the Japanese economy was yesterday underlined by a 0.3 per cent contraction in the money supply last month compared with March last year. The decline was a reverse from the modest expansion in February, which marked the end of a five-month money supply contraction from September. The BoJ also revised down the February rise in the money supply to 0.1 per cent from its initial estimate of 0.2 per cent. The central bank believes the fall in the money supply has probably reached its bottom but that it will not start growing until corporate demand for bank borrowing increases, which is likely only when industrial production rises. The contraction was partly due to the surge in the yen's value against the dollar which has reduced the yen value of foreign currency deposits. The broadly defined money supply, which includes cash in circulation plus certificates of deposit, shrank by 0.3 per cent.</p>

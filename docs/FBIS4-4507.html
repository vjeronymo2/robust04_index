			<p>BFN     [Text] Reportedly, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  prepared his own original ideas, such as clarifying the  additional spending for public works projects, to formulate an  outline of the market-opening package that was adopted by the  government on 29 March. Obtaining cooperation from Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa tried to persuade the  ministries and agencies concerned, including the Ministry of  Finance [MOF], to accept the ideas. Because of opposition by  bureaucrats, however, it is said that Hosokawa was forced to  give up all of his ideas and to delay formulating a program.  This was disclosed by a government source. It seems that the  prime minister's leadership will be tested again before  formulating the final measures in June.    According to the source, the prime minister reportedly  firmed  up his original ideas while listening to the opinions of  nongovernment figures -- including Yotaro Kobayashi (chairman of  Fuji Xerox Co.), who acted as chairman of the Japan-U.S.  businessmen's meeting, which was held in February immediately  after the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit talks.    It is said that the prime minister firmed up his intention  about 13 March to include the following macromeasures in the  package: 1) adding 100 trillion yen to the public investment  plan; 2) announcing a cut in income and resident taxes to be  extended beyond 1995; and 3) reducing the current-accounts  surplus to 2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the  future.    The source said that Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and  concurrently foreign minister; Hiroshi Kumagaya, minister of  international trade and industry; and other ministers supported  the prime minister for a while. However, the MOF opposed the  public investment and tax cut plans because nothing had been  decided about obtaining alternative sources of revenue. As for  the self-imposed goal of reducing the surplus, the Economic  Planning Agency and other ministries changed their minds and  took a negative stand toward this.    On 24 March, the prime minister asked Chief Cabinet  Secretary  Takemura to visit the nine ministries and agencies to persuade  them to support the prime minister's intentions. However, the  attitude of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] toward Takemura was cold. A top MITI official complained  and said, "Does the prime minister think that the issue will be  settled simply by the chief cabinet secretary making a round of  visits?"    After this incident, close associates of the chief cabinet  secretary quickly changed their minds and began to express  negative opinions, saying, "It seems that the United States does  not want us to carry out an additional increase in public  investment."    After all, the government decided on 29 March to delay  making  decisions on increasing public investment and continuing tax  cuts. The government barely managed to include in the package a  plan to reduce the current-accounts surplus to 2.8 percent of  GDP.    Reportedly, an MOF source bragged: "Members of the Prime  Minister's Office were reluctant to give up on their ideas. You  can understand how the Prime Minister's Office was isolated."  However, this series of recent events unexpectedly revealed the  fact that the prime minister was at the mercy of the bureaucrats  of MITI and the MOF. President Clinton once said that Japanese  bureaucrats "control Japanese politics."</p>

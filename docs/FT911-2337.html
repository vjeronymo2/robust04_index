			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tight nickel stocks predicted SOVIET NICKEL exports now account for about 13 per cent of Western nickel supplies, leaving the market vulnerable to any disruptions in shipments, according to a report from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the London stockbrokers. The recent unrest in the Baltic states has highlighted concern over the reliability of supplies, says the report. 'This major factor should prove supportive to prices over the coming months, particularly as the steady erosion of the political and economic infrastructure of the Soviet Union gathers pace.' A large amount of nickel is shipped from the ports of Riga and Tallinn, says the report, which also points out that production at the primarily coal-fired nickel complex at Norilsk has been disrupted by the strikes in the Soviet coal fields. Meanwhile the normal seasonal increase in stainless steel production is expected to tighten the finely balanced supply-demand situation in the next two to three months. The report predicts stocks will decline further from the already minimal level of seven weeks' consumption. The situation is likely to be exacerbated by production problems at a several primary producers and a shortage of stainless steel scrap. The report points out that some steelmakers depend on scrap for up to 70 per cent of their nickel supplies. Carr is predicting an average nickel price in the second quarter of Dollars 4.40 a lb, compared with Dollars 3.93 a lb in the first quarter. Last night cash nickel on the London Metal Exchange closed at Dollars 8,967.50 a tonne, or Dollars 4.07 a lb, down Dollars 32.50 on the day. However, once the second quarter is past prices are likely to weaken again, resuming the downtrend that was in evidence before this year, says the report. Stainless steel production is expected to fall by 1 per cent this year, the third year of decline. 'As a result Western world nickel consumption should be lower by about 2.3 per cent at 635,000 tonnes in 1991, compared with 650,000 tonnes in 1990,' says the report, which puts Western refined production this year up 1.8 per cent at 575,000 tonnes. After allowing for 85,000 tonnes of imports a surplus of 25,000 tonnes is likely by the year end.</p>

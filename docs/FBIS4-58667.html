			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Washington, 5 May (KUNA) -- Shaykh Muhammad  Sabah al Salim al-Sabah, Kuwait's ambassador to the United  States, categorically denied reports that a number of  correspondents were prisoners in Kuwait. The ambassador was  replying to a letter he received from the American press club.  [passage omitted]    The Association of Kuwaiti Correspondents issued a statement  a week ago in which it denied that there was any foreign  correspondent detained against his will in Kuwait. It stressed  that there were no prisoners of conscience in Kuwait but  mentioned that there were detainees who collaborated with the  Iraqi occupiers for publishing the paper "AL-NIDA." It pointed  out that those detainees were not professional correspondents  and that most of them were Iraqis and Jordanians. [passage  omitted]</p>

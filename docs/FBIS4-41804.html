			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received] -- On 27 June, at around  1030 GMT, supporters of Yuriy Meshkov who regularly gather near  the Crimean Supreme Council offended and used physical force  against certain Supreme Council deputies because they were  annoyed at the actions of the Crimean parliament which had cast  doubt on the competence of certain edicts issued by the Crimean  president.    At a presidium meeting of the Crimean Supreme Council at  1130  GMT, presidium member Serhiy Nikulin demanded that Interior  Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov be called out to establish order;  however, Supreme Council Chairman Serhiy Tsekov went out himself  to see those who had gathered near the entrance to the premises  to assess the situation.    At the same time Yuriy Meshkov made a speech to his  supporters in which he noted: "Thanks to your support I was able  to announce the possibility of reforms in Crimea. The richest  people in the world have already promised to give material help  in the near future in an amount that I am even afraid to say."  Yuriy Meshkov also said that the results of his trip to  Switzerland were very hopeful. Several European and Asian  countries, in particular Hungary, Korea, and especially Iran  have declared their intention to establish friendly relations  with Crimea.    After a stormy assessment of the situation, Serhiy Tsekov  also left the rally which had decided that on 28 June the  Supreme Council deputies would meet representatives of the  community that support President Yuriy Meshkov of Crimea.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS, AIRPORT OFFICIALS BUFFETED BY TRAVELER TURBULENCE  </P> <P> What an ingenious idea that the Orange County Board of Supervisors has come up  with! It can solve the problem of overcrowding at John Wayne Airport, as well  as having to locate a new airport site, merely by closing the Main Street  parking lot and forcing everyone to use the airport parking structures at $14  for each of the first two days and $7 for every day thereafter.  </P> <P> The natural result is that a lot of people such as myself will revert to using  LAX, leaving John Wayne for the businessmen and women, whose companies will  reimburse them for their parking expense.  </P> <P> I'd like to add that I am an airline employee who can fly much more cheaply out  of LAX, and have willingly paid extra money to utilize John Wayne, but I have  been priced out of this market.  </P> <P> I also have the feeling that after the 90-day "trial period," the remote lot  will be quietly closed. How much will it cost to use the parking structure  then? $15?  </P> <P> K. HOOVER  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

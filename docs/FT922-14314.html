			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Consumer credit up Pounds 13m in month CONSUMER credit demand showed the first signs of recovery in February after six consecutive months of decline. The Central Statistical Office reported that net credit advanced to consumers by finance houses, building societies and through bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard systems increased by Pounds 13m in the month, lifting the amount of such credit outstanding to Pounds 30.14bn. The slight increase in the amount of credit outstanding contrasted with City expectations of net repayments totalling Pounds 50m in February. Net repayments had reduced the amount of credit outstanding by Pounds 62m in January. Over the six months to January, net repayments cut the total of consumer debt by Pounds 492m. New credit advanced to consumers was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.97bn in February, compared with Pounds 3.9bn in January and Pounds 3.57bn in February last year, the CSO said. In the three months from December to February, the amount of new credit advanced to consumers totalled Pounds 11.94bn, compared with Pounds 11.68bn in the previous three months. City analysts were reluctant to read too much into the February figures, although the rise in credit outstanding added to evidence that consumer confidence and spending are recovering. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Warburg Securities, pointed out that mortgage loans were a far more important indicator of the willingness of consumers to go into debt and that there was no sign yet of a recovery in the housing market.</p>

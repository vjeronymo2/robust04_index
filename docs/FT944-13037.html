			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Issue is aromatics rather than lead in petrol Sir, As a professional chemical engineer, but with no interest in the refinery industry, perhaps I could put another side to the 'green fuels' story ('MPs spark row over risk from 'green' fuel', October 26). The presence of the carcinogen benzene in petrol has no relevence to whether the petrol is leaded or unleaded. Benzene and other aromatics are added to petrol by the refiners to increase the octane value and recent surveys show that there is very little difference in benzene levels between leaded and unleaded petrol in the UK and Europe. Benzene levels are permitted in Europe up to 5 per cent (by volume), but in reformulated gasoline in the US the limit is 1 per cent. There is no technical reason why European refiners could not meet this level, by adding processes like isomerisation, alkylation or adding oxygenates such as MTBE or TAME to petrol. It would seem a pity to confuse the issue over unleaded petrol, which has obvious environmental advantages, when what is required is a standard for Europe to reduce benzene to the US level or lower.

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> NO-SMOKING ORDINANCE  </P> <P> The City Council has instructed its city attorney to draft an ordinance banning  smoking in most retail stores and in at least 60% of the dining space in  restaurants.  </P> <P> The regulations would be modeled after an ordinance adopted by Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant on Monday urged the council to adopt the  ordinance to "protect our nonsmoking population from the dangers of tobacco  smoke while preserving the inherent right of smokers."  </P> <P> Mayor Donna Smith abstained from voting, and other council members expressed  reservations. Councilman Tomas Ursua said the city may "be getting into areas  we don't want to get into. . . . I'm not sure the city should be involved in  policing people's habits."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Nell Soto said she too has qualms, but she and Ursua voted with  Bryant and Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer to instruct the city attorney to  prepare an ordinance.  </P></p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Further advance as market regains confidence - Market Report Revived confidence that next week's Budget will not deal too harshly with the fragile UK economy brought another day of widespread gains in the London stock market yesterday. Further weakness in oil shares failed to hold London back, although there was heavy trading after the New York's blue chip oil majors opened down. Equities were again driven ahead by a strong buyer in the futures market, where traders believe that overseas investors have turned more positive ahead of the Budget speech due on Tuesday from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. After a slow start, share prices turned sharply upwards and by mid-session the FT-SE Index was more than 30 points ahead at 3,123.4. There was some nervousness ahead of Wall Street's return from the Thanksgiving Day break. London fell back as profits were taken before the equity trading account closed at 4.30 pm, and the final reading on the FT-SE of 3,111.4 showed a net rise on the day cut to 18.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was also firmer, gaining 9.7 to 3,454.9. There was general satisfaction with comments in parliament by the chancellor which seemed to confirm that Budget tax increases would lean on the consumer rather than on industry. In particular, the stock market appeared less fearful that tax changes on life assurance companies were planned. These could have hit both at premium income and investment policies at the big life companies. The recovery in the stock market over the past two days has left the FT-SE Index 3.4 points up on the week and only 12.3 up over the two week trading account. But on Wednesday, the Footsie closed at 3,067.2 in spite of the half point reduction in base rates on the previous day. Activity in futures was complemented by a lengthy but fairly modest trading programme in equities. Traders believe that, while UK funds remain cautious, overseas funds are buyers on equities on the grounds that the Bundesbank is likely to cut rates soon, perhaps next Thursday. Traders admitted that the close of the two week trading account had caught marketmakers short of stock in the face of the sudden turn in sentiment. But many were surprised by the strength of the market which is now so close to Budget Day. 'In the past, trading has always died away as Budget Day drew near,' said one. 'But this time it is not just a few speculators at work. There is real investment business out there.' Seaq volume remained high, with the day's 697.6m shares traded comparing with 696.3m in the previous session. Retail, or customer business was worth Pounds 1.59bn on Thursday, a strong figure for what had been been a session marked by pre-Budget caution and Wall Street's closure. Although the oil stocks suffered heavy pressure, especially after Exxon opened around 4 per cent off in New York, the rest of the international sectors responded well to a dip of only 6.43 on the Dow Industrial Average in London hours. There were good rises among the interest rate-related issues, including the stores and some banks. UK strategists suggested that global investors have become more confidene that Wall Street will prove able to shake off the weakness in the US Federal bond market, and respond to the signs of growth in the US economy.</p>

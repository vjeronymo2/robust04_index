			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "NIKA": "Free Market Gives to the Rich but </F> Takes From the Poor; PENTOR--What Do Poles Think About  Liberalism?"]    [Text] Almost half of the Polish people feel  distaste for political and economic liberalism--this according  to the most recent survey by PENTOR. Thirty-two percent of the  polled are in favor of liberal values, including 24 percent who  recognize the values in conjunction with simultaneous social  protection by the state. Even the mere notion of "liberalism"  arouses negative responses by a majority of the polled.    From among citizens' rights, the right to social protection  turned out the most important one to our society (97 percent of  citizens said it is important). Among others, the right to  freedom of speech (85 percent) and electoral rights (78 percent)  were listed as less important. As far as fulfilling citizens'  duties is concerned, caring for one's elderly parents is the  most important duty (96 percent), according to those polled.  Fewer people talked about the need to observe the law (95  percent), the need to pay taxes (73 percent), or about military  service duty (57 percent).    People in favor of economic liberalism not accompanied by  the  state's social protection (8 percent of those polled) are mainly  young people with higher educations.    Poles are a conservative nation that bases its values on  authorities. Eighty-eight percent of those polled think that  children should be taught obedience vis-a-vis their parents and  that one should listen to older and more experienced people (75  percent).    Liberal principles are approved by Polish people on an ad  hoc  basis; the majority are in favor of state intervention and  strong state power. On the other hand, we agree with the  separation of church and state (69 percent).    A majority of Polish people (77 percent) are convinced that  the market economy will make the rich even richer while the poor  will get poorer. Those polled approve of such principles of  economic transformations as privatization, the lifting of price  controls, and free trade, but, at the same time, they take a  suspicious view of people involved in independent economic  activities. Even the mere notions of "liberalism" and "liberal"  bring negative images to the respondents' minds.    Despite this, Polish people are of the view that enterprises  run by private owners are the most efficient. This view was  expressed by 67 percent of those polled.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The poll was conducted last January for the Friedrich  Naumann  Foundation by PENTOR, using a 1,000-person sample of adult Poles.</p>

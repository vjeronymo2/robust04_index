			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANDBERG IS RIGHT AT HOME, HITS 3 AS NL WINS HOME RUN CONTEST, 4-1  </P> <P> "Well," Ryne Sandberg said with something of a straight face, "I was definitely  looking to hit a home run in that situation."  </P> <P> That was the name of the game Monday as Sandberg, the Chicago Cubs' second  baseman, lifted the National League to a 4-1 victory over the American League  in the home run hitting contest that featured the workout day activities  preceding tonight's All-Star game.  </P> <P> Sandberg, who hit 30 home runs last season and leads the National League with  24 this year, was the last batter with the score tied, 1-1, and delivered three  home runs to the delight of a capacity crowd at Wrigley Field.  </P> <P> "I've got a good swing right now, and I've learned to look for a pitch I can  drive in certain situations, but I don't fit in with guys like (Jose) Canseco  and (Cecil) Fielder as far as power (goes)," Sandberg said.  </P> <P> Maybe not, but Fielder and Canseco were unable to hit homers for the AL, and  Darryl Strawberry and Bobby Bonilla could not connect for the NL.  </P> <P> Only Matt Williams of the San Francisco Giants and Mark McGwire of the Oakland  Athletics hit home runs before Sandberg, who later smiled and said, "The home  run is the biggest thrill in baseball for me."

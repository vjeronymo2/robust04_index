			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Dec 30, BNS - The Estonian Interior  Ministry reports that the earlier announcement about the  cessation of registration of Soviet passports for foreign travel  on January 1 was erroneous.    Soviet foreign passports of foreigners living in Estonia on  the basis of residence permits or as settlers who moved to the  country before July 1, 1990 are registered in local bureaus of  the citizenship department. A stamp of the department as well  as an official stamp are put on the first page of the passport  which is also signed by a bureau official.    A registered passport remains valid until July 12, 1995 or  the end of the residence permit.    The Interior Ministry has advised persons planning foreign  travels to take along their Soviet internal passports.</p>

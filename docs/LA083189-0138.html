			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO WALL, ABBOTT GIVES ANGELS A LIFT  </P> <P> The day after the blitz, when the Boston Red Sox strafed seven Angel pitchers  for 30 hits and 21 runs in a doubleheader sweep, struggling Angel rookie Jim  Abbott took his turn on the Fenway Park mound.  </P> <P> Preparations were made.  </P> <P> Terry Clark, scheduled to start Friday night in New York, volunteered to give  up that assignment and move to the bullpen, just in case. Bert Blyleven  volunteered to take Clark's turn in the rotation, which would mean he'd have to  pitch on three days' rest come Friday. And shortstop Kent Anderson, emergency  relief specialist, volunteered his services again, should things really turn  ugly.  </P> <P> Wednesday evening, Abbott kept them all waiting.  </P> <P> Righting both himself and his team with a startling four-hit, complete-game  performance, Abbott shut out the Red Sox, 4-0, before 34,182 at Fenway Park,  moving the Angels back within two games of first-place Oakland in the American  League West.  </P> <P> It was the Angels' 19th, least-expected and most significant shutout of the  season, all things considered. Among them were:  </P> <P>  -- The nine-game winning streak Boston took into the game.  </P> <P>  -- The depleted state of the Angel bullpen, which could scarcely afford  another early-inning washout by a starting pitcher.  </P> <P>  -- Fenway Park, historically a chamber of horrors for left-handed pitchers,  particularly 21-year-old ones.  </P> <P>  -- Abbott's recent slump. Winless in his last three starts and 1-3 in his last  five, Abbott was pushed back in the rotation -- giving him six days' rest  instead of four -- because the Angel coaching staff believed he was beginning  to show fatigue.  </P> <P> After shutting out the Red Sox for the second time this season -- he beat Roger  Clemens, 5-0, on May 17 in Anaheim -- Abbott joked about the cautious handling  he'd received and all the pregame care that went into this start.  </P> <P> "I should've pitched a complete game -- I've had enough rest," Abbott said.  </P> <P> But a shutout? At Fenway, whose green walls were riddled by so many Boston hits  the night before?  </P> <P> "I think they got a little tired scoring so many runs last night," Abbott said.  </P> <P> Could be. Abbott has a habit of getting right to the heart of the matter, even  if he doesn't always pick the proper place to state it. Abbott made this  observation to a cable television reporter, whose live feed was patched into  the Angel clubhouse for the viewing pleasure of the battered Angel pitching  staff.  </P> <P> So when hearing Abbott's crack about the exhausted Red Sox, Angel reliever Bob  McClure arched an eyebrow and raised his voice, demanding, "What's that  supposed to mean?"  </P> <P> Gee, give up 21 runs in one night and everyone gets a little sensitive.  </P> <P> McClure was only kidding. The mood in the Angel clubhouse was light again --  and not surprisingly, what with Abbott giving every other pitcher on the roster  the evening off.  </P> <P> Abbott (11-9) snapped Boston's nine-game surge by limiting the Red Sox to  doubles by Marty Barrett and Mike Greenwell, a single by Ellis Burks and a bunt  single by Luis Rivera. He was only in trouble once, in the third inning, with  the bases loaded and Greenwell at bat.  </P> <P> The predicament was partly Abbott's fault -- he walked Rick Cerone and Barrett  -- but Angel second baseman Johnny Ray also had a hand in it. With two out, Ray  misplayed a routine grounder by Burks into an error, loading the bases for  Boston's cleanup hitter.  </P> <P> Abbott didn't risk another mishap afield and retired Greenwell on his own with  a quick strikeout.  </P> <P> Another Red Sox runner would not see third base again.  </P> <P> "That was a key moment," Abbott said. "The game was still up for grabs. They're  such a good-hitting team, and with them playing as well as they are, it  could've (meant) a big momentum swing for them."  </P> <P> Boston Manager Joe Morgan certainly thought so.  </P> <P> "When you've walked two guys and you get an error like that and the other  team's hot, you kind of expect a score in that situation," Morgan said. "Then  when (your) guy doesn't deliver, you kind kind of wonder if it's not going to  be your night."  </P> <P> The Angels scored all the runs Abbott would need against Boston starter John  Dopson (9-6) in the fourth inning. A single by Chili Davis, a walk to Brian  Downing and another single by Jack Howell produced one run before Anderson  drove home two more with a double to left field.  </P> <P> Anderson, whose big league pitching debut was ruined when rain halted Tuesday's  second game after 7 1/2 innings, added another double in the eighth inning,  which contributed to another Angel run. Lance Parrish scored from first on the  play when Red Sox right fielder Kevin Romine, trying to throw Anderson out at  second base, wound up throwing the ball away instead.  </P> <P> When Abbott continued to coast through the Boston batting order, Anderson knew  that debut would have to delay until some other, distant day.  </P> <P> "Luckily, I didn't have to get in there tonight," Anderson said.  </P> <P> Anyway, hitting's more his game, right?  </P> <P> "Sometimes," Anderson said with a laugh. "Sometimes. Not as often as I'd like."  </P> <P> Abbott took care of the pitching. With a seven-strikeout, 129-pitch  performance, Abbott recorded his second major-league shutout, helped the Angels  reclaim a game in the AL West standings and, perhaps most importantly, gave the  Angel bullpen some time to heal.  </P> <P> "It was important for us to get our pitching back intact," Angel Manager Doug  Rader said. "Maybe things are starting to come together."  </P> <P> That beats the Angel outlook of Tuesday night, when everywhere they turned,  everything seemed to be falling apart.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Apparently, a little autonomy can go a long way. Wednesday night, Angel Manager  Doug Rader credited Jim Abbott's sudden pitching reversal to "adjustments" made  by pitching coach Marcel Lachemann -- adjustments that entailed giving Abbott  more strategic freedom on the mound. Previously, Abbott was told when to pitch  out, when to throw over to first base, even when to step off the pitching  rubber by Rader and Lachemann from the Angel bench. Wednesday, in Rader's  words, "We just turned the game over to Abbott." The result, according to  Lachemann, was a more aggressive and assured pitcher.  </P></p>

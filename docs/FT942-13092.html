			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / French to beat deficit target The French government is aiming to reduce its budget deficit to between FFr275bn (Pounds 31.8bn) and FFr280bn (Pounds 32.3bn) for 1995, compared with a target of FFr300bn this year, ministry officials said yesterday. The objective is in line with the government's five-year budget plan, which seeks to reduce the public sector deficit to 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product next year and to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 1997. In 1993, the deficit represented just over 4 per cent of GDP. In a letter to ministers, Mr Balladur, the prime minister, said 1995 'should mark a new step in the redress of the public finances'. He called on each ministry to present proposals which would enable a 1.6 per cent reduction in government spending, excluding debt servicing. Productivity gains of 1.5 per cent will also be sought from public sector employees, although the prime minister made no mention of job cuts. The targets revealed yesterday are the first step in forming next year's budget. Estimates of revenues are expected to be finalised by the autumn, after which the budget law will be presented to the cabinet and parliament.</p>

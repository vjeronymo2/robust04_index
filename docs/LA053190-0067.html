			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSE BIRD  </P> <P> How dare we continue to ridicule and chastise someone who has so bravely and  unselfishly stood against this barbarous and criminal form of revenge.  </P> <P> Californians must move beyond their emotional disgust and hate for capital  offenders to the reason and logic that guides us to value all human life.  </P> <P> Do I as a taxpayer wish to pay some astronomical sum to keep a murderer in  prison for the rest of his/her life? No. But rather than be a murderer myself,  I would like our prisons to be more self-sufficient. This, however will only  happen if we first value the lives of those in prison. The death penalty issue  continues to pinpoint in the most extreme way state-sanctioned murder, and our  society's contempt for those at the bottom.  </P> <P> Perhaps, years from now, when the U.S. is the last democracy to ban the death  penalty, Bird will gain her rightful place in history as a champion of justice.  The death penalty is not a punishment, it's a crime.  </P> <P> STEVEN J. CARRILLO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> 18-YEAR-OLD SENTENCED IN SCHOOL FIRE  </P> <P> An 18-year-old Oxnard student has been sentenced to seven years and eight  months in the California Youth Authority for setting a fire that destroyed most  of Hueneme High School's administration wing in October.  </P> <P> However, the youth cannot be held past his 21st birthday because he was a minor  when he set fire to his school, said Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Eric Bond. The Oct. 14 fire, which was set in Assistant Principal Daisy Tatum's  office, caused an estimated $400,000 to $800,000 of damage, Bond said.  </P> <P> Bond said the Ventura County district attorney's office will seek some form of  probation for the youth after he turns 21. He declined to name the youth  because of his age at the time of the fire.  </P> <P> Investigators never determined the motive for the fire, and said there is no  evidence that it was aimed at Tatum. "It was an angry attack on a fundamental  institution of this society, on the schools," Bond said.  </P> <P> A 14-year-old who acted as lookout during the arson and a 16-year-old who  kicked in a school window to let the arsonist inside were found guilty of  burglary, but were never charged with arson, Bond said. They have since been  expelled from Hueneme High School.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Hueneme High School officials and counselors are working in four  trailers, which were set up on school grounds as temporary offices after the  fire, Tatum said.

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Arthur Andersen widens lead Arthur Andersen, the US based accountancy firm, has widened its lead over its competitors in terms of worldwide fee income, according to the annual survey undertaken by the International Accounting Bulletin. Andersen's fee income rose 12 per cent to Dollars 6.74bn allowing it to increase its lead at the top of the league. Nearly 50 per cent of fees came from Andersen Consulting, the business services arm. The bulk of Andersen's growth was registered in the Americas and the Asia-Pacific regions. 'The survey recorded a Big Six average fee income growth of 4.6 per cent. This confirms that the effects of the recession, which took its toll on accountants' incomes in the early part of the decade, have abated,' said Lafferty Publications, survey publishers. Results from KPMG Peat Marwick in the UK showed signs of a strong recovery. It recorded a 5 per cent growth in fee income to Pounds 516.4m (Dollars 846.89m) for the year to September 1994 from Pounds 491.8m in the previous year. Worldwide, KPMG, which until last year was the highest earner, saw fee income grow 1.7 per cent to Dollars 6.1bn. In third place was Ernst &amp; Young at Dollars 6.01bn - an increase on the previous year of 3 per cent. In fourth place was Coopers &amp; Lybrand with a 4 per cent rise to Dollars 5.5bn, with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International in fifth at Dollars 5.2bn. Price Waterhouse, BDO Binder, Grant Thornton International, and Moores Rowland International followed behind. RSM International, placed tenth, grew 14 per cent to reach fee income of Dollars 784m.</p>

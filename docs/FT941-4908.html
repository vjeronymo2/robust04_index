			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: CAP reforms or protectionism Sir, The warning issued by Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner ('East Europeans warned against farm protectionism', March 4), reveals the blatant arrogance of the Common Agricultural Policy. As Professor Paul Krugman has shown in a seminal article published in 1985, in an industry exhibiting increasing returns to scale - such as agriculture  -import protection is in many ways equivalent to export subsidisation. The intuitive idea is easy to grasp: by hindering farm inputs, domestic agricultural production is increased, per unit costs are reduced and, thus, export chances enhanced. By the same argument, a popular fallacy about the CAP can be exposed as well: instead of assisting developing countries by lowering their food prices, it cripples their farming industries and deprives them of foreign exchange earnings. Consequently, Mr Steichen's demands amount to nothing else but denying east European countries the same weapon the EU is employing against them. Without any real CAP reforms, we shouldn't be surprised to see agricultural protection continue its disastrous spread.

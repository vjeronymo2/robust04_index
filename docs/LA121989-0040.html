			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> FOG HAMPERS TRAVEL, TRIGGERS PILEUPS  </P> <P> Dense fog shrouded the central San Joaquin Valley, closing airports, delaying  and canceling school bus runs and, California Highway Patrol officers reported,  causing several major chain-reaction pileups. One of the worst involved 12 to  14 cars, pickups and truck-trailer rigs on California 41 near Fresno. No deaths  were reported, but there were several major injuries, officers said. There also  were chain-reaction pileups in Tulare and near Selma, but no major injuries  were reported. The CHP said another traffic hazard was created northeast of  Fresno when about 150 cows wandered onto a road after escaping from a nearby  pasture. It took officers several hours to round up the cattle in the fog.  Airports around the valley were fogged in until nearly noon.  </P></p>

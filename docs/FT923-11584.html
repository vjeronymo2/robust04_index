			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Cartel office rules on Gillette: German investigation decides against link with Wilkinson Sword THE German cartel office yesterday ordered Gillette, the US razor group, to dispose of its interest in Eemland, the parent company of Wilkinson Sword, which is Gillette's main competitor in the world market for wet shaving products. The order follows a decision last March by Mr Peter Lilley, then the UK trade and industry secretary, to seek parliamentary authority to require Gillette to dispose of its shareholding in and loan to Eemland, formerly Swedish Match. Investigation of Gillette's interest in Eemland has involved an unprecedented degree of co-operation by competition authorities worldwide, including the European Commission, which is expected to rule against the investment shortly. Gillette owns 22 per cent of Eemland through non-voting shares. It also lent the company Dollars 69m (Pounds 36m) to finance a buy-out, three years ago, of the consumer products businesses of Stora, the Swedish paper and forest products group. The cartel office said the equity interest and loan, together with pre-emptive rights to buy further Eemland shares, enabled Gillette to influence the company's management. However, Gillette says it has no influence over Eemland and made its investments only so that it could buy Wilkinson Sword's businesses outside the US and the European Community. Gillette says it is prepared to dispose of its Eemland interests by the middle of 1994. Once the order sought by Mr Lilley is granted by parliament, Gillette would be required to make the disposal in six months. If Gillette refused, the government would have to seek a High Court injunction enforcing the order. The cartel office has set no deadline for the implementation of its decision, which Gillette may challenge in court. The cartel office said that if that happened, the case could take up to three years to reach a conclusion. Gillette and Wilkinson Sword together have more than 90 per cent of the German wet shaving products market, according to the cartel office. Their combined shares of the European Community and world markets are estimated at more than 75 per cent. Gillette's relations with Wilkinson Sword have also been investigated by competition authorities in Canada, France and the US, where the former company agreed, under official pressure, to dispose of the latter's American businesses.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Derek Hanekom, South African </F> regional and land affairs minister, by Phillip van Niekerk in  Pretoria; date not given: "South African Land Gradually Passing  Into Black Hands"]    [Text] Derek Hanekom, the new regional and land affairs  minister and one of the two white ANC ministers in the national  coalition government, has much more on his mind than old  symbols: He must satisfy the expectations of the millions of  poor living in the South African countryside. Just 13 percent  of the agricultural land is owned by the black majority, a  figure frequently quoted as illustrative of the injustice of  apartheid. The ANC's ambitious Restructuring and Development  Program will stand or fall on the thorny question of land reform.    In August 1993, the World Bank forecast a violent uprising  by  farmers if the land was not shared out. Hanekom, who has headed  the ANC Land Commission for the past four years, does not agree.  "The World Bank has exaggerated the possibility of a revolt.  If the people in the countryside had been at the point of  rebellion, we would certainly have been able to mobilize them  during the struggle for liberation."    Hanekom believes that South Africa is very different from  Zimbabwe where, following independence in 1980, the desire for  land and the failure of Robert Mugabe's government to give land  to farmers was one of the central political issues.    "In Zimbabwe, there was a large population of farmers and  very little land. They wanted their own land more than anything  else. The liberation movement therefore had the support of the  farmers." Hanekom believes that the population in the South  African countryside wants facilities and services more than  anything else, such as water, electricity, better health care,  and pensions.    "The PAC [Pan African Congress] judged the situation very  badly. They considered land reform to be the most important  question and stated that the rest would follow. Very few people  in the countryside believed that." This does not mean that the  ANC is not committed to ambitious land reforms. The aim is to  redistribute 30 percent of agricultural land within five years.  Hanekom does not believe he is promising something he cannot  deliver.    Hanekom's commission has drawn up a very detailed reform  program for the ANC. His expertise is one of the principal  reasons why he has been given this important job, although many  in the ANC feel that, due to its symbolic value, the post should  have gone to an African.    The ANC wants to begin by the return of land to black  communities which were forcibly evicted from it under apartheid.  A special court will be set up to hear land claims. Special  loans are also to be introduced to make it easier for poor  farmers to buy their land.    The government will help black farmers to start farms on  land  which is at present owned by the state or white farmers.  Tenancy laws will be reformed, giving tenants, who had no  rights to the land they cultivated, the right to buy.  Supporting measures are also to be introduced for farmers who  are already cultivating their own land.    "Our land reform program can only be successful if the  people  support it. And that means also better planning, water,  electricity, housing, and hospitals. Redistributing the land is  not in itself enough."    The land reform could result in a major conflict with one of  the country's most powerful lobbies, the white farmers and their  large-scale farming. This does not discourage Hanekom. He  believes that talk of farmers about to oppose the schemes are  exaggerated. He believes government intervention to be  unavoidable, because at least one third of white farmers are so  deeply in debt that they are never going to be able to get out  of the situation without the state's support.    "Even if we wanted to maintain the status quo, government  intervention would still be necessary. The debts are the result  of difficult trading conditions and poor financial management.  In the past, it was too easy for white farmers to obtain loans.  You can only keep these farmers in place if you agree to  subsidize them. We find it only logical for some farmers, who  are very heavily in debt, to sell their farms. Some farms have  already been repossessed. That provides an opportunity to  establish black farmers. We must make the most of these  opportunities."    "Our program is not based on repossessions and evictions.  These measures will only be used in cases of extreme urgency.  But if this program is not successful, we will then have to  look at more drastic measures."    Hanekom is not afraid of encountering opposition among the  bureaucrats in his ministry who were once committed to the  apartheid ideology of Verwoerd. "We have inherited people who,  in the past supported the previous policy. But in general the  ministry is staffed by very able people, that I have already  noticed. It took us time to get to know one another. But some  ministry staffers are already committed to the reorganization."    As if they sought to emphasize Hanekom's words, we found  that  following the interview, the portrait of De Klerk and the old  land law had been removed from the walls. Nothing has yet been  put up to replace them.</p>

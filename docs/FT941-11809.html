			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Stronger fourth quarter lifts Marine Midland to Dollars 173m Marine Midland Bank, the US retail banking subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, yesterday disclosed a 59 per cent rise in post-tax profits to Dollars 173.2m (Pounds 115.4m) for 1993, despite losing Dollars 203m on home mortgage servicing contracts. The bank, continuing its recovery from high levels of bad debt, raised fourth quarter post-tax profits by 27 per cent to Dollars 45.4m (Dollars 35.6m). It made no provisions for loan losses in the quarter, and released provisions of Dollars 115m in the year. The bank lost Dollars 12m (Dollars 1.1m) in mortgage servicing fees in the fourth quarter, suffering from having to write down the value of servicing rights as consumers re-financed home mortgages because of falling US interest rates. Mr James Cleave, president and chief executive officer, said Marine, a regional bank operating in New York state, had raised profitability. It had reduced non-accruing loans and mortgage servicing rights to below industry benchmarks. Allowances for loan losses in the balance sheet fell by 34 per cent to Dollars 350m (Dollars 529.9m), but cover against non-accruing loans rose from 75 per cent to 102 per cent. Non-accruing loans fell by 51 per cent to Dollars 341.4m (Dollars 697.8m). Interest-earning assets rose by 4 per cent to Dollars 15.2bn (Dollars 14.6bn), and the bank's tier one ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 10.1 per cent at the year-end from 9.1 per cent at the end of 1992. Return on common equity for the year rose to 14.1 per cent (9.9 per cent) and return on assets rose to 1.03 per cent (0.66 per cent). Moody's Investor Services said, following the results announcement, that it was raising Marine Midland's debt rating from BAA1 to A3. HSBC shares closed up 23p at Pounds 10.14p.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Colonia upbeat as profits rise to DM308m for year Colonia, Germany's third largest insurance group, yesterday reported a sharp increase in pre-tax profits for last year and predicted that earnings in the current year would again be satisfactory. Mr Claas Kleyboldt, chairman of the German insurer, which is a subsidiary of UAP, the largest insurance group in France, said the group had improved pre-tax profits to DM308.9m (Dollars 189.5m) up from DM248m in the previous year. Earnings per share climbed to DM55 from DM37.50. The improvement reflected a combination of reduced claims and increased premium income, a trend which had continued in the current year to date, Mr Kleyboldt said. In 1993, the gross premium for what is to be known as the CKAG group rose by 11.4 per cent to DM13.6bn, while the ratio of money paid to settle insurance claims to premium income in mainstream insurance business fell by 2.3 percentage points. In the life insurance sector, payments to policyholders increased by 9.3 per cent compared with an 11 per cent rise in premium income. In the first four months of the year, premium income at the group's two non-life insurers - Colonia Versicherung and Nordstern Allgemeine Versicherungs - increased by 9.6 and 7.9 per cent respectively, while claims expenditure decreased. Premium income at Colonia Lebensversicherung and Nordstern Lebensversicherung, the two life subsidiaries, rose by 8.7 and 13.3 per cent respectively. Income from investments rose 37.1 per cent to DM128.3m. The group is rationalising its domestic operations to make Colonia a more efficient competitor to Allianz, the biggest insurer in Europe, and Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungen, the second biggest German insurer.</p>

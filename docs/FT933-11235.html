			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Arts: Focus on the finer things - Paris Exhibitions Last week I made some disparaging remarks about the currently dishevelled condition of the Palais du Louvre in Paris. Now is the moment to make partial amends by recommending two rewarding exhibitions in the Louvre's Pavilion de Flore (enter on the Tuileries side by the Porte Jaujard). You need to move quickly to catch Antonello da Messina's 'Christ at the Column' which closes on August 9. It will be worth it to see a model of the kind of small, highly-focused exhibition on which museums should increasingly be concentrating their resources. Last year, the Louvre bought 'Christ at the Column' by Antonello, the 15th-century Sicilian master, for FFr42m (Pounds 4.78m). It is a small, grimly intense painting of the head and shoulders of the weeping Christ, a noose round his neck. There are only about 40 known paintings by Antonello. The exhibition traces his contribution to the evolution of the 'Man of Sorrows' type of single-figure devotional image required by patrons for private worship. As evidence of Antonello's influence we also see Mantegna's sublime 'Ecce Homo', borrowed from the Musee Jacquemart Andre. Pure, undemanding enjoyment is provided by the Louvre's principal show this summer, French Master Drawings from the Pierpont Morgan Library (until August 30). The sponsor, JP Morgan &amp; Co., has brought 125 drawings to Paris to mark 125 years of the House of Morgan's involvement in French financial life. The Morgan Bank's finest hour in France was 1870 after the country was on her knees after suffering defeat in the Franco-Prussian war. Alone among the London banks, Morgan &amp; Co. was prepared to help with a Pounds 10m loan. Pigeons took documents to and from the blockaded city and one particularly heavy batch went in by hot air balloon. J. Pierpont Morgan, legendarily avaricious collector and founder of the Library in New York, adored France and all things French. In the 1900s he started to amass drawings; more have since been added to make this one of the finest collections in the US. Lovely things abound in the exhibition, not least the earliest exhibit, a remarkable little sketchbook made in about 1400 from wafer-thin sheets of boxwood. Poussin, Greuze, Claude, and six Watteau drawings of delightful spontaneity are just a few of the particular pleasures of a selection which ends with Gauguin and Redon. (The show runs until until August 30 then moves to the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, September 5 - January 2.) If you are interested in 19th-century Orientalism I recommend Album de Voyage at the Musee Hebert. This is the obscure but atmospheric studio-residence of Ernest Hebert, a grandee of the art scene in late 19th-century France. The exhibition is on until September 27; the museum is at 85, rue de Cherch-Midi (open from 12.30 on weekdays, closed Tuesdays). In 1868, six French painters, a photographer and one Dutchman set out on a five-month journey through the Levant. Two decades after Delacroix's delirious reaction to the colour, grace and nobility of native life in Morocco, Orientalist painting was at its peak. Professional artists descended on the Levant, hungry to sketch, take photographs and buy studio props. Sketches, paintings and photographs of the trip have been brought together from collections in France and the Netherlands. Most of the work which survives is by Gerome, leader of the trip, and Leon Bonnat. Both were to become enormously successful academic painters. Whatever one feels about their full-scale productions, their small oil sketches of landscapes in Egypt and Palestine are most attractive. The same cannot be said for the tedious, careful studies of bedouin by the Dutchman, Willem de Famars Testas. He, too, did well out of the experience and became the first and premier Orientalist of the Netherlands. His journal for 1868 was recently discovered and is published (in French) in the catalogue (FFr280). It appears that the Middle East traveller was not obliged to rough it. A birthday feast on Mount Sinai cooked by the dragoman consisted of more than 20 dishes including conserved dishes of artichokes, turkey, fillet of beef, truffled partridges, chicken, woodcock, and four different puddings. Bonapartists will want to revisit the lovely Musee de Malmaison (take the RER to Grande Arche) where Queen Hortense: An Artistic Woman describes the joys and sorrows of that lady. Daughter of Empress Josephine and Queen of Holland, Hortense possessed an above average aptitude for the arts, from writing novels to musical composition. (Show ends September 27; closed Tuesday and 12-1.30 daily.) One final suggestion for your Parisian wanderings; from August 1, the 'Lady and the Unicorn' tapestries, one of the most famous works of art of the entire middle ages, will go back on display in a new, halogen-lit installation at the former Musee Cluny, which now goes by the altogether less evocative title of Musee du Moyen Age.</p>

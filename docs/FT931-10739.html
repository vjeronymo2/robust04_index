			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Glaxo Glaxo is not the only drugs company being dragged through the mud by the market. Its performance over the past two months is not markedly worse than Wellcome. The US health sector fell by 8 per cent relative to Wall Street during January. On both sides of the Atlantic, investors are more interested in recovery than the defensive qualities of healthcare. Sterling's slide has made UK drugs stocks doubly unattractive. Since around a quarter of Glaxo's shares were held in the US, it has borne the brunt of the selling. But Glaxo cannot expect to find firm support until its ambitions in over-the-counter medicines are clear. The company's conversion to the OTC cause was poorly explained from the outset. A perfunctory paragraph in last year's chairman's statement is hardly sufficient after the best part of a decade preaching the opposite. A rights issue to fund an OTC acquisition looks unlikely, especially since Glaxo has lost its premium rating. Given the dizzy multiple commanded by OTC businesses, funding any large move by selling paper would be uncomfortably dilutive. Without a clear statement of intent, the market might be forgiven for worrying. A cautious move into OTC - perhaps on the model of last year's joint venture between SmithKline Beecham and Marion Merrell Dow - might secure a future for Zantac, the ulcer drug which accounts for 40 per cent of sales. Regardless of whether Glaxo defends Zantac's US patent this year, competition from generic versions of SmithKline's Tagamet is looming. Zantac is more effective, but with the US healthcare system in a penny-pinching mood, that will not count for much. A break into consumer markets makes sense, but not at any price.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Usinor returns to profit in first half Usinor Sacilor, Europe's largest steel producer, has returned to profit in the first half after suffering losses of FFr5.7bn (Pounds 680m) in 1993. Mr Francis Mer, chairman, said that the French state-owned group, which is on the list of 21 public sector companies slated for sale by the government, achieved net profits of FFr471m in the first six months, against a loss of FFr2.59bn in the first half of 1993. Sales rose from FFr39.74bn to FFr39.84bn. The return to profit by one of the biggest loss-makers in the French public sector partly reflects recovery in the international steel industry after two years of recession. The revival was one of the main reasons that the European Commission this week abandoned its plan to cut steel capacity. Mr Mer forecast a continued improvement in demand and prices for steel and said that the full impact of these trends would be felt in the second half. Profits were also boosted by a FFr900m exceptional gain from the flotation of a 40 per cent stake in Ugine, the stainless steel division. Proceeds from the operation also helped reduce the group's debt from FFr24.4bn at the beginning of the year to FFr20.26bn at the end of June. For the first time in four years, Usinor's net debts are less than shareholders' equity. According to Usinor, operating results are now near break-even. But it said that losses suffered by Unimetal, which makes wires and steel for engineered products, continued to undermine the company's overall performance. Usinor has been implementing a restructuring plan to cut its borrowings, eliminate loss-making activities, and achieve sustainable profitability. Earlier this month, the company said it was negotiating the sale of its SAM steel reinforcements operation to ASW holdings of the UK. Mr Mer also outlined plans for a special steels division which would group its Unimetal, Ascometal and CLI units, pooling research and development costs. The restructuring is aimed at preparing Usinor for privatisation. A sale is not imminent, as Usinor needs to reduce its debts and other candidates, including the Assurances Generales de France insurance concern and Seita, the tobacco company, are being primed for sell-off.

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: NTT cuts profits forecast as competition heats up NTT, the telecommunications group which is the world's largest company in terms of capitalisation and Japan's largest employer, expects profits to fall sharply in the face of increased competition from newly licensed telecommunications carriers. Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT president, said that the group's profits for the year to the end of March 1993 were expected to fall to below Y300bn (Dollars 2.25bn), down from the Y351bn it had forecast for the period as recently as February. In the year to end-March, NTT expects profits within a range of Y300bn and Y375bn. NTT has faced mounting competition from rival telecommunications groups since it was privatised and the Japanese telecoms market was deregulated in 1985. The new telecoms groups, known as common carriers, have steadily increased their share of the domestic Japanese market by offering significantly lower call rates. On some heavily used routes, such as between Tokyo and Osaka, the new carriers are estimated to have taken about 50 per cent of the traffic. The expected deterioration in NTT's profits in the coming year stems from falling revenues due to lower prices and its loss of market share. NTT was forced recently to announce a further rate cut following cuts by its competitors. NTT will cut rates for calls over 160km by 17 per cent in June following plans by the three common carriers to introduce a 10 per cent cut in rates for calls over 170km. Unless NTT follows their lead in reducing costs, it can expect to see a further wave of customers switching over to competitors. The slowdown of the Japanese economy has already led more business users to opt for the services of the common carriers. At the same time, although NTT faces pressure on revenues, it is practically impossible for it to counter the situation with drastic cost-cutting measures. NTT still carries the legacy of its public utility days, and capital investment decisions are largely dictated by public investment requirements. With the Japanese government expected to increase the level of public spending to boost the economy, analysts are forecasting a rise in NTT's capital investment to Y1,960bn in the coming fiscal year from Y1,890bn in the year to March.</p>

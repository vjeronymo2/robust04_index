			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Many roads from Rio once. It should not be repeated. A conclave of nearly 150 heads of government addressing all the world's problems simultaneously is not a forum from which immediately useful results can reasonably be expected. Yet the Earth Summit was not a complete waste of time. Its value is in the first instance educational; beyond that the treaties that have been signed may in due course begin to influence the future actions of governments. They should certainly give a fillip to the most powerful agency for environmental protection: public opinion. No one can now ignore the pressure to reduce emissions that contribute to global warming. Those who, like the US government, are sceptical about scientific forecasts of a greenhouse effect appear to have been brought round to an appreciation of the logic behind the precautionary principle. This suggests that some measures to curb CO and other destructive gases are worth taking today because the damage that will be done if the scientists are even half-right is so great. The price of insurance is relatively low. Again, the protection of endangered species is a universally accepted goal, embraced by President George Bush as well as by the 139 countries that did sign the relevant treaty. The driving force is economic as well as ecological. Proper management of forests is an acknowledged ambition; even the Malaysians are aware of the potential force of customer resistance to the purchase of tropical hardwoods. There may be no treaty but if there are reluctant customers the growers will want to proclaim their sustainable management of forests. If not much was said in Rio about the most destructive phenomenon of them all - overpopulation - the very omission of the topic should have served to remind many of the participants of its importance. Soft treaties So much for the good news. The hard truth is that the agreements concluded at the conference necessarily reflect the lowest common denominator of national interests. The treaties are soft. The binding declarations are loose. The agreements to disagree are dead-ends. This outcome is in itself part of the educational process. The group of 77 developing countries cannot be blamed for trying to see how much the rich world is willing to pay for environmental protection; its leaders go home with a clearer understanding that the amount is small, while the terms upon which it will be released are strict. Summit lessons That is perhaps the principal lesson of the summit. It was conducted as if it was an away-meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. As such it once again demonstrated that the demands of the many would always be rejected by the few. The framers of the UN charter were well aware of this defect of mass meetings. That is why they put in place a Security Council whose permanent members reflected the global balance of power. If the UN is to adopt protection of the environment as a goal equal in importance to keeping the peace it must establish a similar top-level steering committee. This might evolve out of the proposed Sustainable Development Commission. Its membership should reflect the balance of economic power while not allowing the interests of business to override those of either environmentalists or the developing world. A second lesson is that no human organisation can tackle everything in one meeting. It is true in theory that protection of the environment is bound up with both development and population control, but specific issues in each area need specific solutions. The Montreal convention on phasing out CFCs, the gases that damage the ozone layer, is a good example. Public pressure has built on this, and CFCs are on their way out. Greenhouse gases need at least one treaty, one convention and one monitoring mechanism to themselves; perhaps CO needs its own international agreement. Forests need another. Endangered species a third. The Rio meeting, with its several mechanisms for further action, has made a hazy start, but if there is to be genuine progress before the end of the century the proper disaggregation of environmental strategies is a necessary first step.</p>

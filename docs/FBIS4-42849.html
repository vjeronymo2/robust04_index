			<p>BFN     [Text] Valery Giscard d'Estaing is calling for a "European  referendum" on the future of political integration. In an  interview published in yesterday's LES DERNIERES NOUVELLES  D'ALSACE, the former president of the Republic wonders whether  it is necessary to have "two currents within the European Union  [EU]," one which "brings together only those states which  approve the idea of a political union," and "one which brings  together the other countries which only want a good organization  of relations among the twelve European partners." "This  distinction is important for the future," stated Giscard, who  suggested that the question be "clearly put," in a referendum,  "to the public of every member state." "If the referendum turns  out to be negative in some countries, we would have to draw the  appropriate conclusions," added Giscard, who, it needs not be  repeated, sides with those who "approve of political union." In  addition, the former president of the Republic repeated that he  remains "very attached to a federalist conception of the EU,"  adding: "And I think that no other solution exists." This  contradicts Dominique Baudis, the head of the UDF-RPR [French  Democratic Union-Rally for the Republic] list, who considers the  federalist conception "outdated."</p>

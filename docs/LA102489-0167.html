			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BILL ON AIRLINE TAKEOVERS MAY HIT BUSH VETO  </P> <P> The Bush Administration today threatened to veto legislation due on the House  floor later in the week to give the Transportation Department the power to  reject the leveraged buyouts of domestic airlines.  </P> <P> The warning from the Transportation Department was issued during a House Ways  and Means oversight subcommittee session examining the tax implications of the  buyouts -- often financed with heavy debt that can be deductible. The panel got  conflicting advice on the issue of restricting the interest deduction on such  debt.  </P> <P> The legislation under direct veto threat would require that those who want to  buy an airline get the department's approval before buying more than 15% of an  airline's stock.  </P> <P> Patrick Murphy Jr., a Transportation Department policy official, told the  panel's oversight subcommittee that the department "neither needs nor wants  such authority" to block takeovers and said Secretary Samuel Skinner has  recommended a veto for the bill.  </P> <P> Rep. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) has proposed legislation to restrict the interest  deduction on buyouts to the first $100 million in debt.  </P> <P> "I fear that putting major airlines 'in play' in this game of speculation as  practiced by the fast-buck artist will seriously damage airline companies that  so many people rely on for their transportation needs," Dorgan told the  subcommittee.  </P> <P> Morten Beyer, head of Avmark, an air transportation consulting firm, told the  subcommittee that the takeovers "have no redeeming economic or service  advantages to the airlines, their employees and . . . the traveling public,"  and takeovers of five strong airlines would load them down with $30 billion in  debt that "will transform them into the equivalent of a Third World country."  </P> <P> Bill Hoffman, secretary-treasurer of the Independent Federation of Flight  Attendants, endorsed Dorgan's bill.  </P></p>

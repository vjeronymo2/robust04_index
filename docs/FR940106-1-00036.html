			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. ``Authorized officer'' means any employee of the Bureau of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Land Management authorized to perform the duties described in 43  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR Groups 3000 and 3100 (see 43 CFR 3000.0&hyph;5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. ``Business day'' means any day Monday through Friday  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluding Federal holidays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. ``Gas'' means any fluid, either combustible or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncombustible, that is produced in a natural state from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earth and that maintains a gaseous or rarefied state at standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature and pressure conditions (see 43 CFR 3000.0&hyph;5(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. ``INC'' means incident of noncompliance, which serves as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Violation under CFR subpart 3163.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. ``Lessee'' means a person or entity holding record title in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lease issued by the United States (see 43 CFR 3160.0&hyph;5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. ``Major violation'' means noncompliance that causes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatens immediate, substantial, and adverse impacts on public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and safety, the environment, production accountability, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> royalty income (see 43 CFR 3160.0&hyph;5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. ``Meter uncertainty'' means the overall inaccuracy of a flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meter caused by the inherent errors of the flow measurement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H. ``Minor violation'' means noncompliance that does not rise to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the level of a major violation (see 43 CFR 3160.0&hyph;5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. ``Operating rights owner'' means a person or entity holding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating rights in a lease issued by the United States. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lessee also may be an operating rights owner if the operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights in a lease or portion thereof have not been severed from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J. ``Operator'' means any person or entity, including but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to the lessee or operating rights owner, who has stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in writing to the authorized officer that it is responsible under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the terms and conditions of the lease for the operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted on the leased lands or portion thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K. ``Production unit'' means, for purposes of reporting gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production, a measurement unit of 1000 standard cubic feet (Mcf).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L. ``Standard cubic foot'' means the volume of gas contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one cubic foot at a base pressure of 14.73 pounds per square inch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absolute, and at a base temperature of 60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F or 519.67 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; Rankine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see 43 CFR 3162.7&hyph;3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Required Recordkeeping <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The operator shall keep all test data, meter reports, charts/recordings, or other similar records for 6 years from the date they were generated, unless the operator is notified that an audit or investigation involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such records has been initiated. If the operator is notified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an audit or investigation involving the records has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiated, the operator shall maintain the records until released  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in writing from the obligation to maintain them. The authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer may request, and the operator shall produce, such records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any time within this period. For electronic flow computers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (EFCs), this includes but is not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Field edits or volume adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Hourly average static and differential pressures, hourly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow temperatures, hourly sums of extensions calculated at each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data point, hourly volumes, and the method used to obtain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summation of extensions, averages, and volumes. For the purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this Order, extensions are the square root of the product of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the differential pressure and static pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Subsequent edits or adjustments. If several changes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made, only the original and the final readings shall be retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Along with any records submitted at the request of the authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer, the operator shall provide all additional information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to compute volumes so that computations may be verified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All gas production shall be measured in accordance with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized method of measurement. As set out in 43 CFR 3162.7&hyph;3,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas measurement authorized for gas produced from leases, unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, and communitization agreements subject to the jurisdiction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Bureau of Land Management, as such jurisdiction is defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 43 CFR 3161.1, may be by orifice meter or other methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable to the authorized officer. The requirements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum standards for gas measurement are set out below. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these requirements for the primary element and chart recorder are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met, a meter accuracy of plus or minus 3 percent will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attained. However, given the complex components and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sophistication of electronic flow computers (EFCs), no ``cook  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> book'' method can be established. Therefore, an uncertainty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of plus or minus 3 percent would be included for EFCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements of this Order are based on the standards and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications published by the American Gas Association (AGA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and officially designated as ANSI/API 2530 and AGA Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report No. 3, second edition, 1985, hereafter referred to as AGA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee Report No. 3. The AGA-published standards and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications are considered to be appropriate for proper gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement by both the Department of the Interior and the oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and gas industry. The requirements set minimum standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to promote conservation of natural resources and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure proper measurement of gas production for sales and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation purposes, so that the Federal Government and Indian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mineral owners will receive the royalties due under governing oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and gas leases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Money Markets: More cuts expected STERLING cash and futures markets were yesterday discounting another easing in UK monetary policy by the summer, after the Bank of England signalled a cut in base rates from 7 per cent to 6 per cent, writes James Blitz. Sterling money market dealers were surprised by both the scale and timing of yesterday's move. Instead of signalling a base rate reduction to dealers in the course of its operations, the Bank had to take the unusual step of posting a minimum lending rate at the start of the day. Few dealers had been planning to offer bills to the Bank at rates below 7 per cent base rate; and the lack of bills in the market, the product of substantial cash shortages in recent days, would have made the subtle signalling of policy technically difficult to accomplish. Although UK base rates are now at their lowest since 1977, dealers were betting on more cuts this year. There was a sloping yield curve in the cash market last night, with three-month money ending at 6 1/4 per cent and the one-year rate at 6 per cent. Futures dealers appeared initially uncertain whether any more cuts would come before the March UK Budget. The March contract finished at 94.08, a level that prices three-month money at 5.92 per cent. However, dealers in the June contract clearly believed that there will be a 50 basis-point reduction in rates by the summer. The contract closed at 94.37, pricing three-month money in June at 5.63 per cent. One institution was willing to bet that base rates would fall substantially further this year. A dealer was reported to have bought an option to lend Pounds 250m for three months in September at 5 per cent. The tone of trading in the cash market should now improve. Few dealers expect a policy-easing immediately, and bills should be sold more readily to the Bank. The overnight rate closed yesterday at 6 1/2 per cent, in spite of a big shortage of Pounds 1.4bn. One dealer suggested yesterday that, with base rate at such a low level, it will be harder to push wholesale cash rates down. He said depositors in the retail sector were moving out of cash deposits into gilts. This makes the banks increasingly reliant on wholesale trading to fund their books, and creates a greater demand for funds.</p>

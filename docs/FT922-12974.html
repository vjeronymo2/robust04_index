			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Labour sets July deadline for selection of leadership THE OPENING shots in the Labour leadership battle were fired last night as Mr Bryan Gould found himself with just 12 weeks to halt the bandwagon rolling for his rival and odds-on favourite, Mr John Smith. Mr Gould called for a period of reappraisal after the election defeat, while Mr Smith presented himself as the candidate of continuity. Both declared their candidacies yesterday while the party's national executive agreed a compromise July 18 date for the election's conclusion - later than Mr Smith's supporters wanted, but much earlier than the October date favoured by the Gould camp. Mr John Prescott, the transport spokesman, became the third candidate to enter the race by declaring his bid for the deputy leadership, a post also being contested by Mr Gould. Both Mr Smith and Mr Gould called for the fullest possible participation by union members, including balloting wherever feasible, to complement voting by MPs and constituency parties. Mr Smith presented himself as the natural heir to the policy reforms undertaken by Mr Kinnock. The fundamental task for Labour, he said, would be to build on the party's principles. Arguing for policies to convince voters that prosperity is best advanced by a government which works for the welfare of the whole community, he said: 'Modern government should be pluralistic, decentralised and should be underpinned by recognition of individual rights.' Presenting himself as the candidate for change, Mr Gould insisted that the party needed 'a period of serious reflection about what went wrong and what needs to be done,' and promised a 'positive and radical agenda.' ''One more heave' may have been the right response to our 1987 defeat,' Mr Gould said, echoing pundits' claims that Mr Smith was better suited to fight the election just past than the one to come. 'It is a wholly inadequate response to our 1992 defeat.' There are clear differences between the two on economic policy. Mr Gould said it was necessary to discuss broader issues beyond the 'very narrow terrain' of tax policy, such as Britain's weighting in the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Smith has always insisted that a Labour government would not tamper with sterling's exchange rate. Both stopped short of open support for a new electoral system. While Mr Smith said he would await the Plant committee's findings, he made clear that the Labour party 'must be free to reach its own conclusions.' By contrast, Mr Gould said the conclusion of the Plant committee should trigger a wider debate with all the political parties and other groups. Neither candidate would endorse the possibility of an electoral pact or coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Mr David Blunkett, the local government spokesman, is acting as Mr Gould's campaign manager. Mr Robin Cook, the health spokesman, is acting for Mr Smith.

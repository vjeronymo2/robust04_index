			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Institutions give tentative support Institutions, unlike many in the coal industry, are prepared to give Mr Richard Budge the benefit of the doubt, albeit anonymously. 'We do not believe Richard Budge is a megalomaniac who is going to ruin his company: that, just to get his hands on the coal industry, he is prepared to pay through the nose for it,' said one large shareholder. The doubts surrounding RJB Mining's bid for the three English coal regions have left its investors largely unmoved. For them, the issue of whether Mr Budge is paying too much will be decided when the prospectus is published next month. RJB did the rounds of institutions several weeks ago and appears to have received fairly strong indications of financial support for its plans. 'We had to give a ball park figure,' said one investor. Another confirmed that RJB and its advisers asked 'for broad indications about what our level of interest would be'. However, undertakings were conditionally given when no one, not even Mr Budge, knew precisely what the company would be offering for the coal regions - or how many it might win. Initially, RJB is believed to have presented tentative plans to bid Pounds 1.3bn for all five coal regions. Thus, the institutions added heavy caveats to their support. 'It would obviously be subject to price,' said one. Yet backing will also be subject to Mr Budge's numbers adding up. Institutions will look for reassurance that RJB will be able to pay off the debt it incurs, that assumptions on the price for and volumes of coal it can sell are realistic, and that it has the right structure and management to take on such rapid expansion. 'We are not going to say yea or nay until we have seen the detailed workout,' said one. At the moment, shareholders remain confident they will be able to support RJB. 'You have institutions pleased with the progress of the company, impressed with the work they have done, and which would favourably view the opportunity to get involved on a greater scale, subject to the numbers making sense,' one party observed. A more pragmatic view sees RJB's potential in a slightly different light: 'There are only two ways of making any real money - one is breaking a union and the other is buying something off the government. Budge is doing both and there is the prospect of making an awful lot of money out of it.'</p>

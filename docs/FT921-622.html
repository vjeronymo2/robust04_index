			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / Yeltsin scraps draft constitution President Boris Yeltsin is understood to have ditched the official draft Russian constitution following attempts by parliament's constitutional committee to reduce his emergency powers, Leyla Boulton reports. Although a new constitution has been one of Mr Yeltsin's chief political goals, he has effectively killed the prospect of endowing Russia with a new one to replace that inherited from the old communist empire at a sitting of the Russian parliament on April 6. A constitution not only determines the power structure in Moscow but the relationship between the centre and the autonomous republics and regions within the largest republic of the former Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Ortega] </F>   [Text] Guadalupe Tepeyac, Mexico, 16 May (AFP) -- During a  meeting with center-leftist Mexican presidential candidate  Cuauthemoc Cardenas, Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]  subcommander Marcos warned that, "if there is not a peaceful  path" toward democracy in Mexico there will be "a path of war"  leading to "a transition government and a Constituent Assembly."    Cardenas is the first presidential candidate to attend a  meeting with the rebels who took up arms on 1 January. The  meeting was held on Zapatist territory in the Lacandon jungle  and under strict EZLN security measures. The location is  difficult to reach, requiring five hours of travel on unpaved  roads.    Marcos, EZLN's military commander, harshly criticized the  Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], whose candidate  Cardenas is, according to Marcos not the best alternative for  the transition to democracy. Marcos said that PRD "imitates  what poisons the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI],  that is, government circles' plotting, betrayal, the existence  of power groups, and neglect of the rank and file." In  addition, the PRD does not offer a political project designed  for the majority of the Mexican people.    Marcos said that EZLN differentiates between Cardenas and  PRD, but he criticized the PRD campaign saying that through it  the party attempts to "again side with the powerful ones."    On 21 August, close to 50 million voters will elect a new  Mexican president from among nine candidates.    In an event regarded as "historic" by the participants,  Cardenas met with the EZLN general command and talked with  Marcos at length on two occasions during a special meeting near  Guadalupe Tepeyac.    In a message addressed to some 200 delegates of Zapatist  communities, the presidential candidate said he shares "with  many Mexicans" the rebels' demands, particularly regarding  democracy and social justice.    During an impromptu news conference, Cardenas said if he is  elected he will respect any agreement reached between the extant  government and EZLN and that otherwise he would seek a peaceful  solution of the conflict "in the framework of the law." Also,  he heard EZLN command leaders say they "have hopes for but  mistrust" the candidates' because, they say, "the government has  always deceived us with promises."    The rebels, wearing balaclavas or colored bandannas on their  faces, warned Cardenas that they are determined to fight "down  to the last round of ammunition" for their demands, but they  asked Cardenas "to keep the homeland in mind" if he attains  office as president.    The meeting, which was held during a Zapatist celebration,  turned harsh because, while Cardenas spoke of settling the  conflict peacefully in the framework of the law, the Zapatists  virtually ruled out PRD, PRI, and the conservative PAN as  guarantors of the transition to democracy and the possible  originators of social changes in Mexico.    Cardenas said he is optimistic about the possibility of a  shift to democracy in Mexico, a framework through which a  solution to the Chiapas problem should be sought, because  without this solution "it will be impossible to solve the  country's problems."</p>

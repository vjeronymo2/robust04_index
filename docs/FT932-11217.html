			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Somerset Trust shares suspended Shares in Somerset Trust, formerly known as the Children's Medical Charity Investment Trust, were suspended yesterday morning at 178p at the request of the company, which later announced that it was in talks which might lead to a substantial acquisition. The potential acquisition is a manufacturing company with turnover of about Pounds 20m. If the acquisition proceeds it will constitute a reverse takeover of Somerset. The consideration of some Pounds 19m will be funded by a placing and rights issue. The company expects to make a further announcement in the next three to four weeks. The trust currently holds the bulk of its funds in short-dated gilts. Last September, it reported a rise in net asset value to 86.2p per share as at June 30, against 82.6p six months earlier.</p>

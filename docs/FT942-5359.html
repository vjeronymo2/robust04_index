			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Outdoors: Potting the way to a summer of profusion - Gardening / With retailers rushing to multiply their prices, Robin Lane Fox intends to be selective about the plants he buys to fill his containers. Sweet peas are at the top of his list This weekend, we can all play at decorating without being real gardeners: bedding might be out but potting is in. I have seen the signs all over England. Dog-tired wholesalers are heaving plants by the thousand from Hereford and Leicester; retailers are multiplying their prices up to five times and putting them out on the pavement; impatient gardeners have made off already with too much impatiens; and Lizzie has been ever so Busy. On Wednesday, I found the most over-priced pot in London. It was not being passed around a bond dealer's birthday: at Pounds 360, it was standing on the pavement in Knightsbridge, a clay container with two mini-roses in flower, a wisp of silver leaves, and a scattering of white pansies. For Pounds 20, you could have run up your own superior version. Potting is in because we have all learned to do it better. Gone are the days of a few petunias and a zonal geranium: potters pack in a jungle (and, if they have read the FT, they reduce the days of watering by adding water-retention crystals to the soil). They prolong the flowering season by feeding with Phostrogen once a week. And they aim at a profusion which leaves the new Royal Horticultural Society encyclopaedia looking out of date already. Undoubtedly, the best pots are terracotta, and none is better than the terracotta cast thickly in Britain by Whichford Potteries near Stratford, Warwickshire, which leads the exhibitors at each year's Chelsea show. I fear I am not rich enough to acquire enough of them, though. If each pot costs up to Pounds 80, how can I line my terrace and work towards the illusion that a warm Riviera without tourists stretches beyond the tree line? Wanting width, I have come to rest at Sainsbury's Homebase. For Pounds 13, they will sell you a 19in pot of clay, not terracotta (and would have given you 10 per cent off last week when you most wanted to buy it). These pots are plain, durable, and are much better than anything with little patterns or a plastic appearance. I use them for my yearly mainstays: the standard fuchsias, large salvias and felted grey helichrysum. Since these plants are taken indoors each October, there is no point in going to the extra expense of frost-proof terracotta when the plants themselves will die with a touch of frost. Instead, I am prepared to spend on plants. Mind you, it is not easy to splash out on the wholesalers' routine offerings. Far too much is being forced on us in mixed colours, which include beastly mauve and strong pink. Wherever there is a 'compact' form, the tall form is being discontinued. Scented, tall, white tobacco plants are now a collector's item at garden centres because of the monotonous Domino mixture which can be trusted to behave on a municipal roundabout. From the mass market, I have found nothing tolerable except white pansies, which are over-priced and trailing dark blue lobelia Sapphire. Vita Sackville-West used to insist that lobelia could look marvellous when massed in semi-shade in a dark-flowered form. I agree; but she might not agree with my fancy for finely-cut pyrethrum Silver Feather, or the blinding white flowers of lavatera Mont Blanc which are prone to provoke shock. Sensitive souls, meanwhile, head for half-hardy perennials. Most of them are a dream for part-time nurseries which have been started up on open days by one or other partner in the backyard: they root like weeds from cuttings, but we can all be nudged into paying Pounds 2.50 for our own individual piece. My ideal jungle would combine scented heliotrope; the finely-cut silver leaves of a senecio under its old name of leuchostachy; several angel pelargoniums; and a plant or two of the best verbena, the pale pink Silver Ann. The heliotropes may well trap the unwary. Ordinary stores sell boxes of dark purple forms with large flowers, often named Marine. These plants are annual varieties which have almost no scent and die totally in the autumn. The ones you want are the perennials, which cost at least Pounds 2 each and grow madly from what may seem a small fragment this weekend. Their smaller flowers smell exquisitely of sweet powder. Chats worth is a handsome mid-blue and Princess Marina should not be muddled with the pointless Marine. The sweetest of all is White Queen and, although these flower best in their first year, they can be rooted so easily from cuttings that one plant soon turns into 50. Pelargoniums are another trap. This weekend, the blotched and spotted Regal forms look very tempting (unless their flowers have too much pale mauve). They will flower briefly until July and will usually hold fire until a thin, second showing in autumn. By feeding heavily every week, I did force the old blotched form called Royal Ascot to flower beyond its form book but, this year, I am compromising with the small-flowered Angel varieties. They, too, have pretty, dark markings on pale petals, but they last much longer and can be tucked easily into the heavy planting of modern plotting. For connoisseurs, I recommend softer varieties: the violet-blue alyogynes and pale forms of the evergreen orange mimulus which are just appearing in the UK from California. The best way to find these varieties is to take a day trip to a specialist: Hopleys of Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, and Brian Hiley of Wallington, Surrey, are two Chelsea medallists near to London's north and south ring roads. Remember that you will be able to multiply your first plants from their stock and keep them going in ever greater quantities by yearly cuttings. They are a far better buy than yet more strips of annuals which will be dead by November. Lastly, what about some sweet peas? Here, too, we have been fobbed off too often with low-growing varieties and names like Snoopee. But at the Malvern show a month ago, one top grower was showing 19in pots with four plants each of his noted tall varieties, grown up 5ft bamboo canes and flowering magnificently. Start yours up canes of around the same height, feed them regularly with a strong tomato fertiliser and, when they reach the top, take them down to the bottom of the cane, wind them round and let them climb all over again. They will flower excellently and may even be better without the hottest sun or the reflection from a supporting wall. If you like potting and hate long Latin names or journeys down the motorway, opt for sweet peas in the knowledge that there is nothing better this side of paradise.</p>

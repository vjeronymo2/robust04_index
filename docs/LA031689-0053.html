			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROTEST STRANDS 140 TRASH TRUCKS;  </P> <P> LOPEZ CANYON BLOCKED AGAIN  </P> <P> Protesters blocked the Lopez Canyon Landfill entrance for four hours Wednesday  morning, stranding 140 full trash trucks along three miles of city streets and  remaining until Los Angeles police threatened to arrest them for illegal  assembly.  </P> <P> The 42 participants declared this, their third protest of a proposed landfill  expansion, a success and vowed to return again.  </P> <P> "We are tired of being the dump of the city of Los Angeles," said Jose DeSosa,  state president of the NAACP and long-time Pacoima activist.  </P> <P> City sanitary engineer Malcolm Toy said the city decided to "just be patient"  rather than reroute the trucks to private landfills as was done during the Feb.  23 protest. Toy said the protest might have forced the drivers to skip garbage  pickup in some Los Angeles neighborhoods Wednesday, although he said that would  not be known until today.  </P> <P> In a related development, the South Coast Air Quality Management District on  Wednesday cited the landfill for garbage excavation that released fumes that  sickened two workers March 8.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AQMD Permit  </P> <P> The excavation was being completed without the necessary AQMD permit, said  spokesman Bill Kelly. The maximum fine for the violation is $25,000, Kelly  said.  </P> <P> One worker fainted and another was hospitalized March 8 after unearthing a  layer of garbage, which Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said might have  contained hazardous hydrogen sulfide gas. The AQMD will begin setting up air  sampling equipment at the landfill this week to determine what the gas was,  Kelly said.  </P> <P> Worker Keith O'Kray, 33, of Newhall, remains at St. Joseph Medical Center in  Burbank, where he was listed in stable condition.  </P> <P> Katz asked the city Bureau of Sanitation to close the dump while circumstances  surrounding the incident are investigated. In a letter sent Tuesday to city  sanitation director Delwin Biaggi, Katz accused the city of trying to downplay  the incident by not releasing information about it until Friday.  </P> <P> However, Toy defended the delay in public notification concerning the accident,  saying that city officials did not realize until last Thursday that the two  workers' illnesses were linked.  </P> <P> "There was not a cover-up," he said. "It was just due to the way the events  unfolded."  </P> <P> Lopez Canyon, which opened in 1975 as a county landfill, accepts more than half  the city's household garbage -- 4,000 tons a day. Although the landfill  originally was to be closed in 1992, recently the city proposed keeping it open  until 2005 and doubling its capacity.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READ THEIR LETTERS  </P> <P> Live, in media land, means real. It means what the audience member sees and  hears in concerts is what is happening right there and then -- not what  happened in the studio six months ago.  </P> <P> For a concertgoer, it means that the interaction between the person on the  stage and the audience is genuine, not contrived, not premeditated.  </P> <P> Backing vocals are the antithesis of what a "live concert" is supposed to be  about. As a consumer, I already paid upward of $10 for the album or cassette  that made me think the performer was worth going to see live. If Headlee thinks  I am not being hoodwinked by having to pay upwards of $25 to hear that exact  same music at a so-called "live concert," he is only demonstrating his own lack  of integrity.  </P> <P> Real artists, the people I pay to see perform, would never give me anything  less than authenticity. When is the last time Sting, U2, Prince or 10,000  Maniacs used any kind of backing vocals or taped instrumentation? Tina Turner,  Paul McCartney and David Bowie are old (in rock 'n' roll terms, of course) and  their voices aren't all of what they once were, but when you see and hear them  in concert it is truly them.  </P> <P> ADREANA LANGSTON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

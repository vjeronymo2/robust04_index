			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Meissen thrives in new Germany - The world-famous porcelain company has made a smooth adjustment to the free market Meissen, the world famous porcelain company, is experiencing what most other east German companies can only dream of in the economic turmoil caused by reunification - a new lease of life. Based in the pretty but dilapidated Saxon town of the same name, its sales have risen sharply; it has been able to make its high-priced products even more expensive; and it has absorbed the steep rise in wages to levels near those in west Germany without a crisis or the need for subsidies. Along with other east German companies, Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Meissen - to give the company its full and imposing name - has had to make some important adjustments to life in the free market. 'Everything has happened in such a short time,' says Mr Hannes Walter, managing director. However, compared with most companies in the five new east German states, Meissen started from a position of relative strength. For one thing, its products have always been in demand in the west. Its biggest foreign market is Japan, accounting for 10 per cent of turnover. For another, it had a certain amount of freedom within the rigid East German system as a valuable earner of foreign exchange. There is no doubt that Mr Walter, 48, greatly prefers doing business without the old constraints. In spite of its status as a showcase company under the old regime, the company had to remit most of its profits to the East German government, a policy that deprived the company of investment funds and kept the historic town of Meissen short of local tax revenues. Today, the town is being smartened up, though patchily. The company is also refurbishing its impressive headquarters, not least to cater to the hordes of tourists who visit. In Easter week, as many as 12,000 people visited the company to see the impressive museum, housing porcelain objects and tableware covering the 282 years of its history. Deep wallets are needed to buy Meissen products, and Mr Walter forecasts that people will need to dig even deeper. Since 1989, prices have risen by around 30 per cent and Meissen intends to keep raising them by 10 per cent or more a year. 'We think we are still good value at these price levels,' he says. Demand for Meissen figures, tableware and other items shows no signs of abating. This year, Mr Walter expects turnover to exceed DM90m (Dollars 55m) after DM75m last year and DM50m in 1990. Prices of a Meissen coffee service start at DM3,000 and go up to DM60,000 or more for those with elaborate patterns. For this year's 175th anniversary of its vine-leaf design, it is producing the same number of special coffee services at a price of around DM9,000. It expects to have no trouble selling these, just as the 150 traditional figures of a wandering map-seller, sold to commemorate Saxony's re-creation as a separate state, were quickly snapped up at DM5,000 each. Saxony, whose capital is in nearby Dresden, is the sole owner of Meissen as it was before the formation of East Germany. To Mr Walter, the return to the Saxon fold is the most important thing that has happened to the company since unification. 'We have to earn our own keep as well as helping to continue the state's cultural heritage'. Meissen was established in 1710 under the rule of Augustus the Strong and has played an important role in Saxony's cultural and commercial life. It is also an important employer. Today, its workforce, including 170 apprentices, totals 1,680 people compared with around 1,800 two years ago. Of these, 700 are artists with the years of training and experience needed to produce the delicate Meissen patterns. Before the coming of the D-Mark and German unity, a painter earned only around 1,200 east marks a month, though top artists could earn up to 2,000 marks. The average wage is now nearly DM3,000; this is well over double the old level with the one-for-one exchange rate used for wage conversions under currency union, but much more if based on the east mark's previous low market rate. Since labour makes up nearly 80 per cent of Meissen's costs, such a steep climb in wages is undoubtedly a burden. It means profits are minimal after investments of around DM8m a year to make long-neglected repairs and to improve kilns and other facilities - since most work is done by hand, the scope for modernisation is limited. Mr Walter declines to forecast when profits will reach acceptable levels or state what these might be. He is aware that Meissen's wages must reach west German levels if it is to keep its best employees; they are now at 70 per cent and parity will be reached in two years' time. He is also encouraged by the fact that orders stretch two years ahead. Exports, representing about a quarter of sales, rose by 25 per cent in 1991. 'That,' says Mr Walter proudly, 'puts us almost alone among east German companies'.</p>

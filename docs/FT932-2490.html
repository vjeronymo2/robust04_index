			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Ukraine control AS THE Ukrainian government has moved to take control of many of the nuclear weapons on its territory, so President Leonid Kravchuk has unilaterally assumed personal command over the government, putting the reformist prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, in charge of a special emergency economic committee. But Ukraine's new team will have to act rapidly if it is to halt the country's slide towards economic disaster and pacify an increasingly restive population. While the country's leaders have been locked in a bitter struggle for power, Ukraine's planned economy has continued to disintegrate, as Russian oil prices have jumped and inter-republican trade collapsed. Inflation has accelerated to over 50 per cent a month while the country's currency has depreciated this year by over 250 per cent against the US dollar. Ukraine's political structures are equally precarious. While Ukrainians gave an overwhelming 90 per cent endorsement to independence in the 1991 referendum, the miners' strikes, which are now engulfing the Russian-speaking eastern regions suggest that, unless sovereignty soon delivers the prosperity voters expect, their patience will run out. The current political and economic instability would be worrying even without Ukraine's status as the only non-Russian republic which possesses an indigenous nuclear capacity. Mr Kuchma has declared that Ukraine should retain, at least temporarily, the 46 SS-24 inter-continental ballistic missiles on its territory, a proposal which parliament appears ready to embrace. The west should resist the temptation to bully and, instead, offer financial aid in return for nuclear disarmament. The International Monetary Fund has rightly urged Russia to move to world prices for its oil. But without financial help to cushion the blow, the Ukrainian government's only alternative to inflation would be rapidly to close loss-making coalmines and heavy industry. To do so would be to court civil commotion, in which Russian nationalist politicians might be tempted to intervene. For now, the ball is in Mr Kravchuk's court. He must show that his unilateral assumption of extra authority over the government is more than a bid for greater personal power. Mr Kuchma must be allowed to accelerate reform by assuming control over Ukraine's runaway central bank and reaffirming the commitment to liberalisation and privatisation. IMF aid can help prevent the dual threats of hyperinflation and confrontation in eastern Ukraine, but only once Mr Kravchuk and Mr Kuchma demonstrate that the money will not be wasted. Ukraine's new leadership is playing a risky game with the west. But it does so in the knowledge that a heavily armed, but impoverished and unstable Ukraine, located next door to an unfriendly Russia, is a dangerous combination.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 28, BNS -- The national budget shortfall  hit 12.88 million lats in the first four months of this year,  Budget Minister Janis Platais told reporters Friday [27 May].    Between January and April, the budget earned 164.634 million  lats, or 29.6 percent of the year's planned revenues, and spent  174.672 million lats, or 29.4 percent of the year's planned  expenditure.    The spendings exceeded incomes 10.04 million lats and the  state treasury working capital increased 2.84 million lats.    The consequent deficit is covered with 11.68 million lats in  state treasury borrowings and 1.2 million lats in the Bank of  Latvia credits.    In April, incomes exceeded spendings 2.183 million lats what  resulted in the reduction of the budget deficit from 12.22  million lats to 10.04 million lats, Platais said.    The most successfull is the collection of sales, customs,  income and social taxes. The collection of profit taxes takes  place with difficulties, Platais noted.    The debts for payments to the state budget have remained  large because the majority of state-run enterprises faces  economic hardships and their financial problems are unlikely to  be resolved in the near future, the minister said.    On May 1, taxpayers owed 27.288 million lats to the state  budget. Compared with April, the amount of the debts increased  582,000 lats.    From the total, 13,666,400 lats are debts for failed sales  tax payments, 11,295,200 lats -- for unpaid profit taxes and  1,092,600 lats -- excise tax arrears.    Platais mentioned JS Dauteks, state-operated RER enterprise  and JS Recept-Holding as the largest debtors to the state budget.    These enterprises blame their problems on their debtors and  the problematic sales of products.    The fluctuation of the unconvertible currency rates against  the lat cause additional problems because the bulk of these  enterprise's products are sold on the Eastern market.    Platais also informed reporters that the wages of state  budget employees would be raised to 28 lats per month in October.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOULD-BE TOWNHOUSE BUILDER SUES CULVER CITY OVER DEMAND FOR FEE  </P> <P> A small band of residents and the owner of a defunct Culver City sports club  have stepped up protests to the City Council for requiring that the owner give  the city $280,000 for recreational facilities in order to build townhouses on  the club site.  </P> <P> The owner reactivated a suit against the city, charging that the fee is  excessive and amounts to a taking of his property without just compensation. He  also argues that the city has not made proper findings that the townhouse  development creates a need for recreational facilities, as required by a new  1989 state law.  </P> <P> Mitch Chupack, a representative for owner Richard K. Ehrlich, said the  litigation will cost nearly as much as what he called the "bogus" $280,000 fee,  but he thinks he will win. "Any reasonable person would say there's something  wrong in making (us) pay $280,000."  </P> <P> City officials, however, have maintained that the fee is necessary because the  development means a substantial loss of recreational facilities to the  community. Both the council's decision-making process and the decision itself  were legal and justified, City Atty. Joseph Pannone said.  </P> <P> Ehrlich proposed the 30-townhouse development when he closed the Westside  Sports Club in August, 1988, after what he said was nearly 15 years of barely  breaking even. The site, at 4901 Overland Ave., was designated for use as a  sports club.  </P> <P> The City Council in April rejected the townhouse plan because of concerns over  the loss of the facilities, which included tennis courts and a swimming pool.  The council determined that the city could not afford to buy the club because a  study concluded it could not compete in today's market without major  renovations.  </P> <P> Ehrlich sued in July, saying the city was locking him into an unprofitable use  of the land. He and Councilman Steven Gourley discussed possible settlements,  such as the developer's building four tennis courts on city land.  </P> <P> In August, the Council reconsidered and approved the townhouses with the  $280,000 condition. The $280,000 is the approximate cost of building four  tennis courts at $70,000 each, a figure that the city derived in consultation  with Los Angeles city and county recreation officials. The council said the  money was preferable to the developer's building four courts, because the  council could then choose to build courts, a pool or whatever is most needed.  </P> <P> An amended lawsuit, filed Nov. 3 in Los Angeles Superior Court, asks for at  least $1 million in damages, which the owner estimates are his incurred costs  and lost earnings potential from at least August, 1988, when "we were unable to  do anything," said Ehrlich's attorney, Fred Gaines.  </P> <P> Gaines said the City Council violated a state law that orders cities to show a  reasonable relationship between a development's impact and any imposed fee. The  law has been raised in suits in other cities, he said.  </P> <P> While the suit is pending, the developer is finishing demolition of the club  walls. Chupack said he expected to get the city building department's final  approval of building plans late this year. Construction will take about eight  months, he said.  </P> <P> The $280,000 will have to be paid before the city issues certificates allowing  occupancy of the townhouses, Pannone said. Ehrlich has a letter of credit from  a bank guaranteeing payment should the city win the suit, said Chupack.  </P> <P> Also thrown into the lawsuit is a challenge to Culver City's law that  developers install public art or pay into a public arts fund. Ehrlich had  earlier been willing to pay the fee -- $30,000 in his case -- but "if you have  $280,000 (to fight), you might as well challenge this too," Gaines said.  </P> <P> The city "wants us to pay for artwork, (but) there's nothing in the record to  show that the project creates the need for art, or that our project is not  aesthetically pleasing," Gaines said.  </P> <P> Councilman Gourley, however, said the council's findings to justify the fees  were "certainly . . . adequate."  </P> <P> "We're trying to soften the impact of the blows to the community and the park  and recreation facilities," he said.  </P> <P> "This is a win-win situation," Gourley added. "The developer could give  something to the community and look like a hero. (But) he said, 'I deserve a  zoning change (from a sports club to a residential use) that increases my  property value 100%, and the public be damned.' "  </P> <P> Meanwhile, almost 1,000 residents have signed a petition to "end extraction  without due process" said former Planning Commissioner Chuck Blum, who launched  the drive. The petition asks that the council enact a law to assess fees on  developers before doing so.  </P> <P> Blum disputed the city's position that the townhouses mean a loss in  recreational facilities. "The city never had (those) recreation (facilities)  because it was private property," he said. He said his group of about 20  residents started collecting signatures in late October and will submit the  petitions to the council next month.  </P> <P> The petition also demands that the council rescind the $280,000 fee on  Ehrlich's project, but Blum and the developer said that they were operating  independently of each other. Ehrlich's case is merely "the first time (a fee  has been levied) without the benefit of legislation" in Culver City, Blum said.  "We're trying to head it off before it becomes an inbred practice."  </P> <P> But Gourley said the council's action was part of a new trend. "The old City  Council was mired in the ideology of the 1950s. This is the 1990s -- anybody  who is going to develop in Culver City has to pay his fair share and not expect  the taxpayers to absorb all the costs."  </P> <P> He said that a developer of a movie theater under construction just outside  Culver City complied with Culver City's requests for parking spaces and with  the city's sign regulations and paid $200,000 to the city to pay for additional  downtown parking. The complex at Hughes Avenue and Washington Boulevard is  technically in Los Angeles. "So if we can ask someone outside Culver City to do  that, why can't we ask someone in Culver City to do something like that?"  Gourley said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Owner Richard Ehrlich proposed a 30-townhouse development when he closed the  Westside Sports Club in August, 1988.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["eli"-signed report: "Industry Wants More Money From Bonn"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- A controversy has erupted between the  Defense Ministry and the Eurofighter Consortium over new  financial claims from the industry. The ministry confirmed  demands amounting to 570 million German marks [DM] for the  development of the Eurofighter (Fighter 90). However, State  Secretary Joerg Schoenbohm told the Defense Committee of the  Bundestag that the government will not accept such high demands.  According to the Defense Ministry, costs involving  approximately DM160 million are realistic. They resulted from  the fact that the industry had to develop a cheaper version  after the decision by Defense Minister Ruehe (Christian  Democratic Union).    The most recent demands by the consortium that is involved  in  the construction of the fighter were received by the Defense  Ministry in March. At the same time, the Eurofighter prototype  performed its maiden flight, but with engines of the Tornado  aircraft and an incompletely developed electronic system. The  Defense Ministry estimated the costs for the modification of the  fighter plane to an improved model at DM300 million. However,  the industry agreed to assume a little less than half the costs.  The government is willing to provide DM160 million for the new  control system. All other costs are not acceptable or have been  caused by the industry because of delays in the development.  Negotiations on the additional costs are to be concluded by the  summer. New demands were also addressed to Great Britain,  Spain, and Italy, which are all participating in the development  of the fighter plane.    The Eurofighter Consortium continues to offer the complete  aircraft, including the required equipment (system price), at  DM102.5 million. Ruehe stated in December 1992 that he is not  willing to pay more than $60 million for an aircraft, which  corresponded to approximately DM90 million at the time. The  Defense Ministry now expects a system price for the complete  fighter of below DM100 million, which is the price level of  December 1992. If one takes into consideration the inflation  rate, the offer would be acceptable for the industry. Ruehe has  not commented on the system price recently. The newly elected  Bundestag will make a decision on the acquisition of the  aircraft in one year when the fighter will be fully developed.</p>

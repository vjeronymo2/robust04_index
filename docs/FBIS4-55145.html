			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Sharkov] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, May 5 (BTA) -- [passage omitted] Speaking  before journalists during a reception at the Austrian Embassy  here yesterday, Austrian Defense Minister Dr. Fasslabend  expressed Austria's high appreciation for Bulgaria's  unquestionable contribution to the stability in the Balkans.  Mr. Fasslabend stressed the significance the observation of the  Yugo-embargo has for preventing an expansion of the conflict.  He conferred on Defence Minister Aleksandrov a high Austrian  award given for services rendered to Austria. Mr. Aleksandrov,  the first foreign defence minister to receive this award, was  decorated for his contribution in promoting the stability in the  Balkans, Mr. Fasslabend said. The only person entitled to a  higher award is the Austrian president, Austrian Embassy sources  told BTA. Bulgarian Chief of General Staff Army General Lyuben  Petrov and Major General Lyubomir Getchev, too, received awards  for their contribution to the regional stability and bilateral  cooperation.

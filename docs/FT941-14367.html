			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures closed at a record high and volume in the traded options soared as renewed hopes of a cut in UK interest rates brought hectic trading to the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, a tentative start to trading gave way to hectic buying of the March contract on the FT-SE 100 following the release of weaker than anticipated inflation figures as traders came to the view that the poor figures would lead to a rate cut. Dealers said demand was across the board, with independent traders (locals) said to have been particularly short of stock. This developed into a squeeze which drove March to an all-time intraday high of 3,506 just before lunch. Strong arbitrage activity was carried out by many of the leading players in the market as the contract maintained a strong premium to cash throughout the day. March came off the top in early afternoon trading but still closed at a record high for the future at 3,501, around 16 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume was particularly heavy, reaching 20,677 at the official close, while a further 2,000 lots were dealt in after-hours' trading. A very active session was also seen in traded options, where turnover rose to a hefty 58,425 contracts. However, dealers said activity in the FT-SE 100 option was slightly disappointing, though it reached 25,082 lots, while some 6,315 were traded in the Euro FT-SE option. Amstrad was the busiest stock option at 2,893 lots, followed by Tesco at 2,582 contracts. HSBC saw 1,954 lots dealt, with Kleinwort Benson said to have shown a keen interest in the October 950 straddle.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Reduction in lending rates prompts selling of gilts THE UK government bond market gave a cool reaction to yesterday's easing in monetary conditions, with cash bond and futures prices closing lower. Dealers said trading was dominated by investors taking profits following the strong performance of the gilts market since the Conservative election victory. The Bank of England signalled a  1/2 -point cut in base lending rates in morning money-market operations, supplying short-term liquidity to the banking system just below 10 per cent. The move was widely anticipated in the gilts market, but caused significant selling. The long-gilt futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, opened at 99.00 but quickly fell to 97 15/16 following the rate cut. Through the afternoon session sentiment improved and the contract stood at 98 7/32 in late afternoon. Volume was heavy at 51,000 contracts. In the cash market, selling was concentrated at the longer maturities. The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011, the benchmark long-dated government stock, opened at 99 31/32 and closed at 99 13/32 for a yield of 9.06 per cent. Shorter-dated stocks fared better. The 10 per cent gilt maturing 1994 closed down  1/16 of a point on the day at 101 1/8 , for a yield of 9.44 per cent. In addition to profit-taking, the market was unsettled by uncertainty over the outlook for UK inflation as the economy pulls out of recession. Analysts' forecasts for the annual rate of inflation during April range from 4.2 per cent to around 5 per cent. Official data is due to be released on May 15. Lower interest rates were also seen as threatening the position of sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism. The UK currency fell from DM2.93 before the easing was signalled to just above DM2.92 by late afternoon. Moreover, yesterday's interest rate reduction may be the last for some time. Most economists are forecasting one more rate cut before the year-end. 'There is not much good news on the horizon now,' said Mr Phillip Tyson, gilt market analysts at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'There is no incentive now to chase yields lower.' Another factor depressing gilts prices at the medium maturities is a partially unsold tap issue announced by the Bank of England on Friday. Dealers estimated yesterday that only around half of the Pounds 800m issue of 8 3/4 per cent gilts maturing 1997 had been sold. GERMAN government bonds moved lower yesterday with investors concerned over continued public sector strikes and plans to introduce withholding tax on interest income from bond market investments. The 8 per cent Unity fund bond maturing 2002 was trading at 99.64 in late afternoon, for a yield of 8.06 per cent, from around 99.68 at the opening. The June bund futures contract on Liffe opened at 87.11 but moved down to 86.70 during the day, before recovering to close at 86.86. Volume was very heavy at 83,000 contracts. Analysts said the government was likely to increase its 4.6 per cent pay offer to striking public sector workers at talks this week. A final settlement much above this level would increase fears of wage inflation, driving up prices throughout the economy and higher interest rates. The Bundesbank council holds its bi-weekly meeting on Thursday, although few analysts are expecting an immediate rate increase. The market was unsettled by indications that the opposition Social Democratic party, which controls the lower house of parliament, would vote against the government's compromise withholding tax proposals. If the current package of measures is rejected, more stringent measures may be applied. US TREASURY prices firmed slightly yesterday afternoon, on the back of a satisfactory three-year note auction in the first leg of the Treasury's Dollars 36bn refunding auction. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  3/16 higher at 99 15/16 , yielding 8.00 per cent while the two-year note was up  1/32 to yield 5.26 per cent. The Federal Reserve added liquidity to the banking system by arranging Dollars 1.5bn in customer repurchase agreements in the open market when Fed funds were trading at 3 3/4 per cent. The move was widely expected. The Treasury sold Dollars 15bn of three-year notes at an average yield of 5.96 per cent with a coupon of 5.875 per cent. Before the auction there was some concern that the recent urban unrest in the US would discourage Japanese investors from participating. The market was also preoccupied with the employment numbers due for release on Friday, which will give the first important evidence about the state of the US economy in April.</p>

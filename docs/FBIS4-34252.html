			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Seabed Authority is now located in  Jamaica. The Authority is expected to hold its first meeting in  Kingston on the 16th of November. This follows an agreement  reached by the developed nations of the world on June 3 to  ratify the United Nations convention on the Law of the Sea.  This disclosure was made by Minister of Foreign Affairs and  Trade Dr. Paul Robertson during his contribution to the 1994-95  sectoral debate. Philip Hamilton has more:    [Begin recording] [Hamilton] The breakthrough follows years  of intense debate between the United Nations and several  industrialzed countries where technology [words indistinct].  The United States had long opposed the section of the  convention dealing with the mining of seabed resources, an issue  which saw them refusing to ratify the convention for well over a  decade. Minister Robertson told parliament that Jamaica had  played a key role in the agreement, which will be presented for  adoption next month at the special UN General Assembly.    [Robertson] The main, outstanding issue involved the role  and  activities of the multilaterally owned enterprise in the mining  of the seabed as against private entities. That was the  sticking point why a number of the industrialized countries did  not sign.    [Hamilton] But there has been much controversy over the site  for the Seabed Authority's headquarters. Although Kingston was  chosen as the headquarters interim site several years ago,  Montego Bay has been lobbying hard for the Authority's permanent  home. Minister Robertson says it will be some time before the  permanent headquarters is constructed in Jamaica. He says the  site will be determined by the United Nations based on several  criteria, among them infrastructure as well as security.</p>

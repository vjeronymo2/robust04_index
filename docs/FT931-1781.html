			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Chessmen lure five white knights FIVE rival bids to stage the breakaway world chess championships were opened at a sometimes surreal ceremony in London yesterday. One was in early 20th-century Reichsmarks and another was locked in a metal box. Amid the ornate splendour of Simpson's-in-the-Strand the players, on a makeshift podium, revealed that four of the bids were higher than that from the original venue chosen by the Swiss-based international chess federation (Fide). As the 18-month-old daughter of British challenger Nigel Short gurgled into the microphone, her father said the bids vindicated the players' move last week to set up a rival championship in opposition to Fide. Garry Kasparov, the reigning world champion and his arch-rival over the chessboard, was at his side. 'This vindicates our original decision. The world championship had been undersold,' said Mr Short. Under the auspices of Fide, Manchester had originally won the bidding with an offer of about Pounds 1.17m. This time the city declined to bid. The highest offer, for Pounds 2m, is from the London Chess Group, a consortium of four London-based companies which has backing from the Barbican Centre and Corporation of London. The group had insisted on submitting their bid on Friday in a locked metal box, fearing envelopes might be secretly opened over the weekend. 'We've never seen anything like this before,' said an accountant involved in the consortium, who admitted to being baffled by the series of plots, counter-plots and closed-door dealings that had accompanied the bidding process. The other bids included a Pounds 1.7m offer from Times Newspapers and Teleworld Holdings, a Pounds 1.4m offer from the Brain Trust, and a Pounds 1.2m offer from the catering organisation Monsi. Although the Brain Trust requested that the match was played in seven different British cities, the London Chess Group and the Monsi bid both cited London as the preferred venue. The most colourful bid came from a Warrington chess enthusiast, who offered '10m marks' to stage the match in a village hall. Although it was originally assumed that the bid represented DM10m, Mr Noel Alms, of the economic consultancy Investment Chartwork and co-ordinator of the bid, later admitted that the figure was in Reichsmarks, a defunct German currency worth a small fraction of a US cent. 'We have done this to secure publicity for chess,' said Mr Alms, a keen member of the local chess league, who is campaigning to have more chess on television. A final decision on the bid will be made in the next couple of weeks.</p>

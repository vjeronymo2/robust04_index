			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Aer Lingus faces a wing-clipping TALKS between management and unions at Aer Lingus, the troubled Irish state airline, arrive at a crucial juncture this Friday, when a deadline for the acceptance of 1,280 proposed voluntary redundancies is reached. In Brussels, officials say the European Community is likely to ask the airline for more information before it decides whether to support a request for a IPounds 175m capital injection from the Irish government. The EC is due to make a preliminary ruling by early next month on whether planned state aid for Aer Lingus and three other EC airlines breaches competition rules. To date, only about 300 acceptances are believed to have been notified to management from the airline's 5,500 workforce, raising the spectre of compulsory redundancies, which the airline's trade unions have pledged to fight. Significantly, senior figures within the Labour party, the junior partners in the coalition government, have also said they will not support compulsory redundancies, threatening a dangerous split in the coalition and a possible government crisis in the weeks ahead. The redundancies are being sought as part of a rescue plan drawn up earlier this year by Aer Lingus management to cut operating costs by 10 per cent, or some IPounds 50m annually, to staunch losses, which are currently running at IPounds 1.2m a week. At March 31 this year Aer Lingus had accumulated net debt of IPounds 540m. When Mr Bernie Cahill, the executive chairman, unveiled the rescue plan last June he said that 'urgent and drastic action is needed' if the airline was to survive. The urgency of that message was heightened by a threat from the banks to shut the financial taps to the company if a rescue plan was not in place by late summer. Management and unions then agreed over the summer to a complex three-phase conciliation and arbitration procedure, through Ireland's Labour Relations Commission. That procedure faces a deadline of October 31, and to date very little progress has been achieved according to sources close to the negotiations. The banks apparently have accepted to await the outcome of the arbitration procedure before taking action themselves, but according to a company source, practically all of the airline's committed credit lines from the banks will have expired by then. Thus if the rescue plan is still in dispute at that time, the banks would technically be in a position to call in a receiver. The government's IPounds 175m equity injection is conditional both on EC approval and on acceptance of Mr Cahill's rescue plan by the workforce. If the plan is approved, the first instalment of IPounds 50m would be disbursed in December. The European Commission's policy on state aid is being challenged by British Midland, Aer Lingus's main rival on the Dublin-London route. Sir Michael Bishop, the British Midland chairman, said that Aer Lingus's financial problems were partly caused by exaggeratedly low Dublin-London fares. Pointing out that the Irish airline - although roughly the same size as British Midland - employed 8,000 people compared with his own company's 2,500. 'They (Aer Lingus) are knocking up staggering losses,' Sir Michael said, adding that a decision by the Commission to block the request for IPounds 175m aid would be 'progress'. But he said the EC also had to crack down on state aid for Belgium's Sabena, Spain's Iberia Airlines and Air Portugal. 'If they (loss-making airlines) know they are not going to get any more injections of state aid, then they will have to put their businesses in order in the same way as everyone else has done.'</p>

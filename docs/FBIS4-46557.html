			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bagrov and Andrey Sinitsyn: "The </F> Kirov Plant Has Shut Down: The Putilov Workers Have Gone on  Leave Until October"]    [Text] The threat of a halt in the production of  strategic missiles and the initiation of sausage production is  the most popular argument in the discussions of the directors of  the military-industrial complex with authorities at all levels.  However, the lack of success in numerous attempts by  representatives of the Russian VPK [military-industrial complex]  to convince the other sectors of the economy of the enormous  benefit of high-tech defense and of their competitiveness in  world markets provides grounds for doubting the fundamental  possibility of accustoming VPK enterprises to a "peacetime  situation" and the budget deficit; yesterday, for the second  time, the Kirov plant in St. Petersburg was shut down.    After going back to work following the first shutdown and  assembling 150 tractors, the Kirov workers were unable to solve  the problem of selling them: 400 machines await their fate in  the yard at the enterprise. The plant management attributes the  lack of buyers for the Kirov tractors to the doubling in cost of  the tractors since the beginning of the year, linking this rise  to a change in the tax laws (which appears extremely doubtful to  KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts; this can justify no more than a  10-percent increase.) Due to the shutdown more than 5,000  workers have been forced to take leave without pay. The most  likely date for the renewal of production is 1 October, although  "planted' loans by the federal government to the farmers could  stimulate demand somewhat, in which case the plant would begin  operating as of 1 April. Other, purely military assembly  subdivisions belonging to the Kirov Zavod AO [joint-stock  association]: the transmission plant, the Spetsmash plant (which  produces tanks and artillery) and the steam turbine unit (which  produces steam turbines for submarines, among other things).    The shutdown of the Kirov plant is yet another manifestation  of the already obvious economic crisis in which almost all of  the enterprises in the Russian military-industrial complex find  themselves. The overall drop in production at Petersburg defense  plants was 28.6 percent in 1993, including 38.8 percent in the  aviation industry, while indebtedness to the state by 132  military enterprises of the city reached 150 billion rubles. As  a result Petersburg has assumed 33rd place in Russia with  respect to the reduction in production volumes (Leningrad  Oblast, 67th; Moscow, 49th).    In this situation it would be logical to expect coordinated  actions from the management at the plants, local authorities and  the federal government to overcome the crisis. The plant  administration is working out plans for respecializing as a rule  oriented toward financing out of the budget, however, (papers  pertaining to a coordinated plan with the American Caterpillar  company were signed quite recently, but implementation of the  idea of producing city buses is still in the initial stage. A  recent conference showed that Anatoliy Sobchak has still not  defined his position--either to restrain the directors of the  VPK enterprises with a "Democles sword" or unequivocally to  support their demands (which could have a negative effect on the  attitude toward the mayor of Petersburg in Moscow). One way or  another, all of the main hopes are pinned on a solution  involving the federal budget. The end justifies the means in  this case. This will put into action the traditional lobbying  methods (the signing of demands for reduced taxes by the  directors, exemption from duties, the provision of subsidies,  the establishment of machine-tool committees and so forth), and  some now forgotten foreign economic tricks: delegations of  production veterans with Soviet orders on their lapels in  government offices. There is no doubt about the choice of the  members of the current "government management team": to envelop  the plant in the heroic performance of the first five-year plans  or not.</p>

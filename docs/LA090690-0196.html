			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> The next time the Dodgers take an 11-1 or 7-0 lead on a Tuesday night at Dodger  Stadium, the crowd should start chanting, "Dee-fense, dee-fense." . . .  </P> <P> Lousy fielding, combined with poor pitching, meant come-from-way-ahead defeats  for the Dodgers against Philadelphia and Houston and most likely cost them  whatever chance they had to win the National League West championship. . . .  </P> <P> Of course, to err is nothing new for the Dodgers. It's difficult to understand  why a team that relies so much on pitching wouldn't put together a tight  defense. The last time the Dodgers led the league in fielding was 1960. . . .  </P> <P> This time, I stayed for the entire nine innings. Good way to avoid traffic  leaving the stadium. . . .  </P> <P> Young Ramon Martinez, who no longer is striking out people, may be tired. . . .  </P> <P> UCLA is hoping to attract 60,000 for its opening game against Oklahoma Saturday  at the Rose Bowl. The Dodgers should do 45,000 to 48,000 each day against the  Reds over the weekend at Dodger Stadium. But the question mark is how many will  show up for the Raider-Denver game at the Coliseum Sunday. Advance sales have  been encouraging, and with a good walk-up, the count could hit 60,000. . . .  </P> <P> Terry Donahue is 9-5 in openers since he became UCLA coach in 1976. Among the  losses was a 38-3 whipping by Oklahoma at Norman, Okla., in 1986. . . .  </P> <P> Can the Bruins, who weren't real fast last season, keep up with the speedy  Sooners?. . . . Tennessee, which tied Colorado before routing mighty University  of the Pacific, received a first-place vote in the Associated Press poll.  Wonder if the same person will vote for the Volunteers again now that they've  lost Chuck Webb for the season. . . .  </P> <P> Young USC can use the extra week to prepare for Penn State, but the Trojans  came out of the 34-16 opening-night victory over Syracuse without a significant  injury. . . .  </P> <P> Two Raiders, Ron Brown and Sam Graddy, were members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic  400-meter relay team, whose record was just broken by a French team. . . .  </P> <P> Lawrence Taylor got what he deserved from the Giants -- enough money to make  him the highest paid defensive player in football. . . .  </P> <P> Former Stanford and Denver Bronco Coach John Ralston will coordinate the World  League of American Football's "Operation Discovery," a search for talent in  Europe. . . .  </P> <P> One reason the Carl Lewis-Ben Johnson race probably won't come off this fall is  that Lewis' people are asking for three times as much money as Johnson. . . .  </P> <P> Ruth Wysocki, who upset Mary Decker in the 1,500-meter run at the 1984 Olympic  trials, recently gave birth to a son, Tom. Asked at the time if she was  surprised by her victory over rival Decker at the Coliseum, Ruth said, "Hell  no. I've beaten her under three names -- Ruth Kleinsasser, Ruth Caldwell and  now Ruth Wysocki." . . .  </P> <P> Maybe Mike Tyson will start wearing modern-day headgear, instead of the World  War I aviator models worn by some of his idols, after suffering that cut in a  sparring session with Greg Page. . . .  </P> <P> Eddie Futch, 79, is applying the Futch Touch to Riddick Bowe, who will try for  his 11th consecutive victory Friday night against washed-up Pinklon Thomas in  Washington. . . .  </P> <P> It's a sign of the times when Jack Clark calls the San Diego Padres' offer of a  one-year, $2.5-million contract, "Disgraceful." . . .  </P> <P> The trade after the 1988 season between Texas and the Chicago Cubs that  included Mitch (Wild Man) Williams and Rafael Palmeiro is looking better for  the Rangers now that Palmeiro is contending for the American League batting  championship. . . .  </P> <P> Too bad Atlanta Brave announcer Skip Caray doesn't have a team to match his  talent. . . .  </P> <P> The Dave Stewart-Roger Clemens matchup Tuesday night was one of the hottest  tickets ever at Boston's Fenway Park. . . .  </P> <P> News item: San Francisco 49ers are fined $500,000 for violating NFL's corporate  ownership policy. Reaction: That's pocket money -- or some Class B free agent's  salary -- to Eddie DeBartolo Jr. . . .  </P> <P> Drink and driving don't mix, but a lot of televised sporting events are  sponsored by beer and automobile companies. . . .  </P> <P> A very thin volume would be, "Strategy in Quarter Horse Racing." . . .  </P> <P> Jerry West wants to acquire a guard to replace Michael Cooper before Laker camp  opens next month in Hawaii. However, it may not be a big name. Donnie Walsh,  the Indiana Pacers' player personnel director, says Reggie Miller is not  available. . . .  </P> <P> Zina Garrison and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario wore virtually the same outfits  Wednesday at the U.S. Open. I don't think Andre Agassi will have that problem  today.  </P></p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Pent-up demand released with wave of new issues A SPATE of Canadian dollar, Ecu and Swiss franc deals led the way yesterday as pent-up demand from issuers finally brought a wave of new paper on to the international bond market after the Christmas period. Investors, though, were generally reported to be waiting on the sidelines rather than rushing to buy the first new paper on offer. Credit Local, with a CDollars 500m issue, dominated the Canadian dollar sector, which has now seen just short of CDollars 1bn of new issues since the end of last week. The largest issue yet by a non-Canadian borrower, the deal, brought by Paribas Capital Markets and Merrill Lynch, was designed to create a large liquid issue for investors with an appetite for the currency but wary of taking on additional Canadian credit risk. The December 1997 maturity was selected to appeal to investors as a long five-year credit, rather than a longer-dated one, given the steepness of the yield curve between five and ten years. It was priced at 45 basis points over the benchmark government 8 1/4 per cent bonds maturing in March 1997 - or 39 basis points over the yield curve. The bonds, swapped into sub-Libor floating-rate dollars, were reported to have met some demand, though coming in the wake of other Canadian dollar issues, a substantial proportion is said to remain with the managers. The syndicate is expected to be broken this morning, after selling in the Far East market. Paribas repeated the long five-year formula for Swedish National Housing Finance, though with less success. The CDollars 200m issue, with a coupon of 8 per cent, was reoffered at 99.85, to give a yield of 51 basis points over the five-year benchmark. The pricing was generally considered tight, and late in the day the bonds were quoted on the bid at 10 basis points below their reoffered price. The third Canadian dollar offering of the day, a CDollars 150m issue from Eksportfinans, the Norwegian export financing institution, was brought with a maturity of five years and ten months. The 40 basis point spread over the five-year benchmark had widened to around 42 basis points in later trading. All of yesterday's Canadian dollar deals are thought to have been swapped into floating-rate dollars, leading to some congestion in Canadian/US dollar swaps, and less opportunity for other issuers to follow, dealers said. Nonetheless, demand for Canadian dollars could bring further issues from Canadian borrowers in the days ahead. By yesterday, the spread over US dollars at the five-year maturity had narrowed to 132 basis points, the tightest since early November. Indigestion was also reported for yesterday's Ecu deals, brought by Barclays de Zoete Wedd (the first Ecu issue lead managed by the British investment bank) and Credit Suisse First Boston. BZW's Ecu100m issue for Swedish Export Credit, fully fungible with an existing Ecu400m of bonds due in February 1994, was widely seen as tightly priced - though it was offered at five basis points above the similar deal from OKB at the end of last week. The reoffered price of 33 basis points over par compared with a premium of around 10 basis points on the existing bonds. CSFB's Ecu200m issue for IBM International Finance, by contrast, was a classic retail issue: a top blue-chip name offering a yield acknowledged by the managers to be anything but generous. Selling got off to a slow start yesterday, as the investors returned from the Christmas and New Year break. Swiss franc issues for Guinness, BP and Rabobank, totalling SFr400m, and a Pounds 150m floating rate note from Bristol and West Building Society, added to the wave of new paper yesterday. With further issues expected today, and global offering from the World Bank due on Wednesday, investment banks were yesterday already pondering how to shift what threatened to a be a glut of new bonds to start the year.</p>

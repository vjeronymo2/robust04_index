			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Nerves slow trading THE UK money market had a nervous and uneventful session, with all attention fixed on today's Budget, and the performance of sterling. Rates eased slightly, but dealers said this reflected little more than the completion of the process of trimming their positions and squaring their books that most operators began last week. Volumes were higher initially as routine rollovers were sorted out at the start of the week, but little remained after this except to cope with the day's funding. Although good sense might militate against it, and the Bank of England and treasury were yesterday reported to be opposed, the possibility of a base rate cut has not, however, been entirely ruled out. 'No government has won an election with base rates higher than 10 per cent since 1974,' said one economist. 'If opinion polls start going in favour of the Labour Party there may have to be just as much intervention to support sterling at 10 1/2 per cent as there would have been at 10 per cent.' The three-month interbank rate eased to 10 7/16 -10 5/16 per cent, from 10 1/2 -10 3/8 , and rates through to one year dropped around  1/16 per cent. The March short sterling contract was three basis points firmer at 89.63, as was the June contract, at 89.82. The daily shortage was estimated by the Bank of England at a comparatively small Pounds 250m. Outflows of liquidity via Pounds 810m of treasury bills and maturing assistance and Pounds 310m for repurchase by the market, along with Pounds 175m below-target bankers' balances from Friday, were partly covered by Pounds 405m of Exchequer transactions, and a Pounds 645m fall in note circulation. The Bank did not operate on the early round, but at midday took out a large part of the shortage - revised up to Pounds 300m - by purchasing Pounds 250m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The forecast was further increased to Pounds 350m in the afternoon, and the Bank bought another Pounds 103m of bank bills to cover the shortage. The overnight rate, which had stood at only 10 1/2 -10 3/8 per cent before the forecast, eased to 9-8 per cent after midday. German call money rates were unchanged from Friday's 9.60/65 per cent, although activity is expected to pick up later this week when tax payments begin draining funds from the system.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: SE-Banken bounces back to profit A sharp drop in credit losses and big capital gains allowed Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading Swedish commercial bank, to return strongly to the black in the first quarter. It posted a SKr1.38bn (Dollars 175m) profit, compared with a SKr608m loss in the corresponding 1993 period. The performance puts the seal on a recovery which has taken the bank from the brink of disaster in early 1993, when it was forced to seek government aid, to a position of considerable financial strength. The group was able last August to withdraw its request for state assistance, largely because of lower interest rates, and recapitalise through a SKr5.3bn rights issue. The main influence on the first-quarter figures was a 46 per cent drop in credit losses to SKr1.55bn. The recovery was also helped by SKr650m in capital gains from the sale of Banque Scandinave en Suisse and parts of FinansSkandic. Problem loans amounted to SKr13.1bn at the end of March - 4.7 per cent of total lending - compared with SKr24.7bn a year earlier. Group income before credit losses was SKr2.93bn, up 22 per cent from a year ago. The disposals helped lift overall income by 19 per cent to SKr4.88bn from SKr4.09bn but expenses were 8 per cent higher due to increased equipment and marketing outlays. Net interest income rose only 3 per cent to SKr2.22bn. The bank was helped by the reduced cost of financing problem credits, but lower lending activity and tight margins limited the benefit. The group said its capital adequacy ratio was 13.6 per cent at the end of the quarter, compared with 8.5 per cent at the end of March 1993.</p>

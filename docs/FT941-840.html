			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (1): Business takes cover - The risks companies face are becoming more complicated. Rising premiums and shrinking protection have forced commercial buyers to rethink their approach and to seek alternative methods of insurance 'Every time there is a disaster people say how could it happen to us. How can we be vulnerable?' Geoff Saunders, risk manager of RTZ, observes when explaining the recent growth of risk management - a combination of loss control, risk financing and self-insurance techniques which is becoming increasingly popular with larger British companies. Mr Saunders points to the growing number of leading corporations backing the British insurance and risk managers' association, Airmic, whose annual conference opens today, as evidence of growing boardroom interest. Mr Saunders, who is also Airmic's chairman, says more and more commercial buyers are examining alternative ways of insuring their property, legal liabilities and other risks. Companies are increasing the amount of risk they retain on their own books by, for example, accepting larger deductibles. Additionally, many are forming 'captive' insurance subsidiaries which are dedicated to insuring their own risks and allowing direct access to the reinsurance market. Figures from Tillinghast, the actuaries and management consultants, show that the number of British captives has more than doubled since 1987, rising from 118 to 325. The number of captives owned by companies in the FTSE 250, the biggest companies in terms of market capitalisation, has nearly tripled since 1987, rising from 52 to 148. Recently privatised utilities have embraced the trend with particular enthusiasm. This trend runs parallel to another development: the rise in popularity of financial risk management techniques such as the use of derivatives to cover interest and currency exposures. Advocates of risk management have long argued that by increasing spending on safety and accident reduction and by setting up their own insurance arrangements, companies can reduce overall spending on insurance and improve their bottom line. 'Companies want to have their own access to the commercial and reinsurance insurance market, without having to pay for the overheads which insurance groups carry,' explains Alan Fleming, risk manager of ICI and executive director of Airmic. 'Why go to these guys when you can go directly to the real risk-takers who have much more capacity. This is the real driving force for captives,' In the UK, these traditional arguments, which helped fuel the initial rise of the captive movement in the 1950s and 1960s, have been reinforced by two recent trends. First, a spate of expensive international disasters in the past 10 years including the explosion on the Piper Alpha oil rig in the North Sea in 1988 and the IRA bomb blasts in the City in 1992 and 1993, have provided graphic reminders of the range of risks to which the corporate world is exposed. Second, sudden and unexpected increases in prices and restrictions in insurance cover, have led many companies to question the traditional answers offered by the conventional insurance market. A number of insurers, for example, have reduced their involvement in classes such as motor fleet and employers' liability, as a result of steep rises in claims costs. The market for employers' liability could contract further early next year if reinsurers go ahead, as expected, with plans to limit the cover they offer. Companies excluded terrorism cover as a standard feature of property insurance policies, after the IRA bomb in April 1992. Business is now largely dependent on terrorism policies sold by Pool Re, an industry-owned mutual whose losses are ultimately guaranteed by the government, and there have been widespread protests about the increased costs. In some cases London-based companies are paying as much for their terrorism policies as they pay for the rest of their property insurance. Mr Fleming concedes that insurers were under pressure from their own reinsurers to withdraw but says: 'It is worrying that the market overreacts to the unusual. A vibrant market would see this as an opportunity rather than a problem.' Another area, pollution, has also been a cause for concern. Insurers excluded protection against gradual pollution from all liability policies in 1991 but there are fears in some quarters that cover for sudden and accidental damage could also be excluded for standard public liability policies over the next few years. Mr Saunders says that the market's stance on pollution reflects a more general unease about long-tail liability risks - in which claims typically emerge many years after the inception of a policy. The withdrawal from the market of the ninth biggest UK insurance company, Municipal Mutual, in the autumn of 1992, and the disappearance of dozens of smaller London companies has highlighted yet another worry  - the security of underlying policies. Municipal Mutual insured relatively small amounts of commercial business but was hard hit by liability claims from the local authorities which owned the company. 'When you think you've laid off risk and you find out you really haven't because your insurer goes belly up it is a concern,' says Mr Saunders. As buyers respond to these developments there are signs that the UK and, to a lesser extent, the rest of Europe are following a well-established North American trend. There, more than a third of insurance premiums have been diverted from the conventional insurance market towards a so-called alternative market populated by captive insurance subsidiaries and other self-insurance facilities, such as risk retention groups. 'Europe is a decade and a half behind the US,' says Joe Smetana, chairman of risk management at American International Group, a company which was quick off its feet in anticipating the risk management trend. As well as selling a range of conventional products, AIG is now a leading provider of claims management, loss control and other services for the alternative or self-insurance market. Mr Smetana says that the contraction of the liability market, initially for product liability and medical malpractice risks in the mid-1970s, fuelled the growth of the alternative market which had begun in the 1950s. Subsequently, further tightening in liability classes in the mid-1980s boosted the development of the alternative market, including the formation of significant Bermudian high-level liability insurance facilities, such as ACE and XL. Most of this business has been lost by the conventional market, a development which could have far-reaching ramifications for North American insurers. The traditional insurance market cycles - in which premium rates fluctuate along with the amount of capital moving in and out of the industry - are expected to become less pronounced, or even, a thing of the past. 'For four years everyone has been saying the hard market is coming. It hasn't. Quite honestly one of the main reasons is because of the alternative market,' says Mr Paul Brown, director of public affairs at the Risk and Insurance Management Society, the US risk managers' association. He says that 83 per cent of the Fortune 1000 top US corporations are members of RIMS and the organisation is now increasing its representation among medium-sized companies. Some analysts expect the US alternative market to absorb 50 per cent of premiums by 2000 and predict that a growing number of European industrial customers will follow suit, especially if deregulation and liberalisation of the European markets lead to increases in premiums for commercial risks. Bigger insurance brokers, especially those whose interests span the Atlantic, are anticipating the trend, increasingly earning fees from risk management advice and services as well commission income on policies. But the trend could represent a further blow for those UK and European insurance companies who are too slow to respond. Some may be losing many of their most significant commercial customers to self-insurance. For an industry already besieged by the banks and new direct telephone-based insurers in areas such as motor, home and life insurance that could be bad news.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guido Azzolini: "New Navy Chief; Mariani Brought </F> In"]    [Text] Rome -- After almost two years, Vice Admiral Guido  Venturoni has transferred his post as Navy chief of staff to  Vice Admiral Angelo Mariani, in order to become Armed Forces  chief of staff. "This transfer," he said at Friday's [31  December] ceremony, "elicits mixed feelings," because it is not  easy to leave the love of your past 40 years.    Taking his leave of the Navy, Venturoni took stock of his  two  years at the top, citing the many tasks -- from Somalia to  Albania and the surveillance in the Adriatic still under way --  that have provided useful confirmation of the service's  promptness and efficiency but that have also highlighted the  need to enhance its amphibian capability. Despite the increased  activity and the reduction of resources, Venturoni said, the  level of efficiency has been very high, and, confident of being  able to maintain it, the Navy has adhered to a number of  international cooperation programs such as that for the  Italo-Franco-British frigate.    "But in the longer term," he stressed, "it will be essential  to bring resources into line with requirements if we want to  avoid not only failing to meet objectives of efficiency but even  irreversibly jeopardizing our operational mechanism."    Admiral Mariani highlighted the importance of the valuable  legacy of history, attitude, and traditions which Navy personnel  both guard and share. "Within society," he said, "there is a  strong demand for principles, following the failure of the  ethics of success. There are expectations of honesty, of a  spirit of service, of dedication to the common good."    But Mariani added that another obligation is that to do your  job properly -- which will not be easy in view of the limited  resources available. It will therefore be necessary to take all  possible measures to make the Navy more "economical," developing  the skills of its personnel, who remain the cornerstone of the  system, in order to have sailors "who are not only capable of  standing international comparison but who can constitute a  professional reference point for other navies."    The tasks facing the Navy, and that it is already carrying  out, Mariani continued, are to stabilize the Mediterranean and  to work for peace in the international field. Hitherto the Navy  has been able to perform them well because it had good ships --  "the result of far-sighted decisions made 20 years earlier. Now  many of them are on the decline." So our ships are becoming  fewer and older, while financial resources are inadequate, thus  preventing the necessary investments. Therefore, "if we want  the Navy to be able to continue to perform its tasks  efficiently, we must promptly draw up a long-term plan based on  reliable hypotheses of availability of financial resources," as  happened with the Navy Law of 1974. "It will not be easy to  achieve a similar objective at a time of economic crisis," he  said. It will therefore be necessary to create broad consensus  around the Navy, to make it understood that it "is part of  everyone's heritage, and that we are merely its custodians."</p>

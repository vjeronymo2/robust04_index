			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] According to Ruben Dario Carles, presidential  candidate for the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement,  National Renewal Movement, and the Civic Renewal Party, Panama  should suspend debt negotiations with private banks. Professor  Carles has said that although the government has stopped trying  to reach an agreement on the foreign debt with commercial banks,  these efforts will now limit the financial actions of the new  government. Therefore, the next president, whoever he may be,  and his team will have played no role in those negotiations. For  this reason, he hopes these negotiations are suspended  immediately.    [Begin recording] [Carles] Despite the goodwill and great  effort made by the negotiatiors -- and I admit that the work  done so far by Delia Cardenas, planning and economic policy  minister, is very commendable -- I feel it would be advisable to  immediately suspend those talks.    [Reporter] Why?    [Carles] The country is not in any condition to take on the  responsibility of paying 3 billion balboas and to obtain, if  possible, a special consideration or adjustment. I think we can  achieve our goal of being in a better position later. [end  recording]</p>

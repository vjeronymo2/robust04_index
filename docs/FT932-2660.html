			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (1): Out of the tunnel - Poland's determination to build a prosperous democracy is vital to the future stability of Europe.  Signs of economic recovery are giving strong encouragement and hope to its watching eastern neighbours A powerful message is radiating out from Poland to the patchwork of newly-independent states to its east. Carried by private traders from the former Soviet states, or discussed at academic and government meetings, the word is that Poles are already living in the post-communist future - and it works. It is a message which gains perspective from distance. Seen from Moscow, or Kiev or Minsk, the achievements of Poland's four post-communist years seem little short of miraculous. Politically, Poland has developed from a one party state with a powerful but illegal opposition, into a fully-fledged parliamentary democracy. Its political parties reflect a wide spectrum of views from the frankly xenophobic right through the Catholic middle to a respectable, former communist, social democratic left. Governments stand or fall according to the parliamentary rules after free and fair elections. Economically, the country is the first in central Europe to resume economic growth after three painful years of deep structural and institutional changes. These have raised productivity and improved both the quality of Polish products and the ability to compete in world markets. What is already the most privatised and entrepreneurial economy in the region is on the verge of a new wave of mass privatisation. The shortage economy has given way, irreversibly, to market mechanisms and vigorous consumerism. Budapest or Prague may look more prosperous. But they were much richer before the war and were always considered part of the west. For millions in what was the European part of the Soviet Union it has always been Slavic Poland - big and close and ruled from Moscow by czar and commissar alike for the best part of two centuries - which has offered a more tangible vision of the future. The emergence of Poland from the trauma of transition to capitalism and democracy gives hope to them all. Seen close up, however, the reality looks less enchanting for many ordinary Poles immersed in their daily lives. Millions of peasant farmers in a country still 30 per cent rural have seen their incomes drop half over the past five years. Nearly 3m Poles are officially unemployed, over 14 per cent of the labour force. Millions of white and blue collar workers have left their former badly paid but secure jobs to become self-employed or be taken on by the rapidly expanding private sector. But low average wages of just over Dollars 200 a month leave many staring at a cornucopia of goods which their low incomes and high inflation keep tantalisingly out of reach. The pain is not only economic. Whole categories of workers - teachers, university professors, doctors, nurses, miners, steel workers, arms factory and heavy engineering workers, railwaymen - have lost their former socio-economic prestige along with their jobs and their former relatively high incomes. Even the heroes of the long anti-communist struggle, the Solidarity union organisers in the big factories and shipyards, have become dinosaurs; doomed remnants of a perverse proletarianism in a new economy where small is good and where economic power is shifting fast to private entrepreneurs and ultimately to the new banks, insurance companies and pension funds. Those who have lost most, or gained least, from the transition processes proved vocal enough and numerically strong enough in a highly fractured parliament of 29 parties to bring down the government on an emotional issue  -by one solitary vote. But they do not constitute a majority. Most Poles are much better off socially, politically and economically than they were under the despised communist system. Even the former communists, now social democrats, are led by young men who support the shift to a market democracy and want to become junior partners in a future centre-left coalition. Seen in this broader framework, Poland's reputation for political volatility is exaggerated, even though Poles are once again between governments and heading for early general elections on September 19. This follows the one vote parliamentary defeat on May 28 of the shaky coalition government of free market liberals, main stream Solidarity moderates, Christian CAP nationalists and peasant parties, which was unexpectedly cobbled together last July by Ms Hanna Suchocka. The no-confidence motion was tabled by the Solidarity union MPs because of the government's refusal to award higher pay and pensions to teachers and other public servants. To do so would have breached the budget deficit ceiling - equivalent to 5 per cent of gross domestic product - agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The budget deficit limit became the main anchor of economic policy for both domestic and external reasons. Lax social policy in the past has saddled Poland, a country of just under 40m people, with 8m pensioners. Many are recipients of more or less fraudulent disability or other special pensions, granted essentially as a form of unemployment pay. Without pension reform, and lower real pension payments, the budget will be hard pressed to finance other programmes. The need to curb social transfer payments is made more acute by Poland's foreign debt repayment obligations. The resumption of debt servicing on Poland's Paris club debt to official creditors, together with the cost of servicing new loans from the World Bank and other institutions, will cost around Dollars 4bn annually by early next century. These repayments will rise further if, as expected, Warsaw negotiates a 50 per cent reduction on its Dollars 12.1bn debt to the London Club of commercial bank creditors later this year and has to service this as well. Until now the legacy of overdue debt left over from the communist past, coupled with unease at the traditions of labour militancy and the perception of political instability, has tended to discourage foreign investors who would otherwise be attracted by the potential of a 40m strong market and a strategic location. This has not been wholly negative. The relative paucity of foreign capital and competition has forced Poles to become more entrepreneurial. They have had to do more for themselves than, for example, the Hungarians, whose economic regeneration is largely based on foreign investment, or in the extreme case, former East Germans who have been effectively re-colonised by west German capital and Bonn's largesse. Before the latest government crisis there were signs that foreign investors were taking a more positive view of Polish prospects. This followed agreement on a Dollars 660m standby loan from the IMF in March, parliamentary approval of a modified mass privatisation programme, and the announcement of new loans and new projects from the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. A slight hiatus is to be expected between now and the elections on September 19. The outcome in party terms is uncertain, especially since the election will be fought under new rules which limit representation in the new parliament to parties gaining above 5 per cent of the vote. It is also unclear just what role President Lech Walesa sees for himself in future. But in broad brush terms the most likely outcome will be a new and probably more coherent coalition, possibly again led by Ms Suchocka, the current caretaker prime minister. Such a government will almost certainly continue the policies of the last four years which broadly correspond with the desire of most Poles for a functioning market economy and a law-based society.</p>

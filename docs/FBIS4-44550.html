			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Chen Xianfa [7115 0341 4099]: "Anhui Is </F> Building an Energy Resource Base Area in China with a Total  Investment of 4 Billion Yuan in New Mining Area"]    [Text] The Chinese Government has continually increased the  intensity of investments during the past several years in  Huainan City, Anhui Province, east China's "Energy Resource  City," to reduce this region's energy resource shortages.    Huainan has always been known as a "motive power granary" of  the east China region, China's most economically vigorous  region. Since implementation of the "Chang Jiang Strategy" of  developing Pudong [New Economic Zone in Shanghai] to spur an  economic takeoff in the entire Chang Jiang river basin, this  city's status has become even more prominent.    Huainan City has a superior quality coal field with the  largest reserves -- the Huainan Mining region -- with projected  reserves of 30 billion tons which include 10.8 billion tons of  carefully surveyed reserves, equal to one-fourth of China's  reserves that have the proper conditions for extraction.    Huainan is about 570 kilometers from Shanghai, China's  economic center, and the railroads that run through the Huainan  City region are connected to China's north-south artery, the  Jin-Pu [Tianjin-Pudong] line, and are just a few 10 kilometers  from the Jing-Jiu [Beijing-Kowloon] line now under construction.  Some 200 kilometers to the south it goes through the Yuxikou  Dedicated Coal Pier and enters the Chang Jiang channel. Thus,  its regional location is superior. Calculations indicate that  transporting coal from Huainan to Shanghai is 1,200 kilometers  closer than hauling it from China's other coal base area,  Shanxi, and that hauling 30 million newly-dug tons from Huainan  to Shanghai could save 1.65 billion yuan in railroad shipping  fees alone compared to transporting it from Shanxi.    Officials in Huainan City said that the city's total coal  output during 1993 was about 12 million tons. Although by the  end of this century the entire city's total coal output,  including central unified distribution coal mines and local coal  mines, will reach 27 million tons, it will still be unable to  satisfy the huge demand for economic growth in east China. At  that time, the Chang Jiang Delta region with Shanghai at its  center will have coal shortages of 80 to 100 million tons. To  alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand, Huainan  has formulated a program to accelerate development in an effort  to surpass 40 million tons in coal by 2010. The Chinese  Government is providing focused support for this program and the  State will invest 5.28 billion yuan in Huainan's unified  distribution coal mines, including 2.04 billion yuan that will  be completed during the next three years. Central authorities  have already invested a total of 4 billion yuan in surveys,  construction, and production in Huainan's new mining regions.    Huainan also holds status in China in power generating  capacity. It currently has an installed generating capacity of  2,300MW and generates 12.3 billion kWh of electricity annually.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Washington] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 7 June that a top-secret document  of the former Soviet Union's KGB shows that North Korean  President Kim Il-song did not participate in the anti-Japanese  struggle before Korea's liberation.    This is contained in a special article of the January 1992  edition of INFORMATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY, a U.S. publication  that specializes in gathering and disclosing secret information.  The article is entitled "International Espionage Activities  Mentioned in Top-Secret KGB Documents: 1975-1985."    This publication notes that a secret cable dated 20 April  1978 and addressed to a Soviet espionage network operating in  Hong Kong says that "even though Kim describes himself as a hero  who liberated his fatherland from the Japanese imperialists in  August 1945 by waging a bold partisan struggle, the KGB  headquarters know very well that he was not in North Korea at  that time."    This cable also says: "When the Soviet forces liberated  North Korea, Kim was serving as a lieutenant in the Red Army and  an agent of the NKVD (KGB's predecessor)." It also says that  the KGB feels a sense of betrayal as well as a sense of contempt  toward Kim."</p>

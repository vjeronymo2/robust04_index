			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Bonds: African Development Bank to re-finance Dollars 800m debt THE African Development Bank (AfDB) intends to re-finance the equivalent of Dollars 800m worth of maturing debt in the Eurobond market next year. It also plans to raise the equivalent of Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m in new funding in 1994. This year, the AfDB has raised Dollars 850m in the Eurobond market and in the Samurai market, the Japanese domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. Mr Kofi Bucknor, AfDB chief treasurer, said the maturing debt was denominated in D-Marks, French francs and Swiss francs and was likely to be re-financed in those currencies or in the dollar. Mr Bucknor, who was in London yesterday to meet investors, added that the AfDB would continue to be an active user of the Samurai market where it was able to obtain favourable funding rates. The AfDB achieved a yield spread of 45 basis points over Japanese government bonds on its offering of 20-year Samurai bonds earlier this year. This was marginally below the yield spread of 48 basis points over US Treasuries on the bank's Dollars 500m 30-year Eurobond issue which was launched in March. Among yesterday's issues, the 1996 Olympic Games in Sydney gave a touch of glamour to the first Eurobond offering from Federal Airports Corp (FAC), the Australian government-owned airport operator. FAC raised Dollars 200m through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. Due to the holiday in the US yesterday, the pricing of the bonds was postponed until today, when they will be priced to yield 65 basis points over the when-issued 10-year US Treasury. Lead manager CS First Boston said the bonds had a good reception among European investors who were keen to increase their exposure to the Australian corporate sector after several years of neglect. Fears that US interest rates could start to rise in the coming months are likely to prompt more corporate borrowers to tap the Eurodollar sector. National Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, said yesterday that it was planning to launch a dollar-denominated Eurobond offering, via Merrill Lynch. The market expects the offering to raise Dollars 300m, have a maturity of 10 years and be priced to yield 65 to 70 basis points over underlying US Treasuries. The German state of Baden-Wurttemberg raised DM500m through an offering of 20-year Eurobonds. However, holders have a put option on the bonds from 2003. Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the put option enabled investors to choose the final maturity of the bonds. Two UK building societies took advantage of continued investor demand in the UK for high-yielding paper to raise capital in the Eurosterling sector. Alliance &amp; Leicester extended the maturity profile of the Eurosterling floating rate note (FRN) market when it raised Pounds 200m worth of senior debt through an offering of seven-year FRNs. Lead manager Samuel Montague said yesterday's issue of FRNs offered investors a yield spread of 30 basis points over Libor, eight basis points more than the current yield spread on Alliance &amp; Leicester's five-year notes. 'Yield spreads on deals at the shorter end have tightened so investors are willing to take on another two years for the extra yield,' said an official at Samuel Montague. Nationwide Building Society raised a total of Pounds 200m yesterday, by launching a Pounds 125m offering of 25-year Eurobonds and by increasing its 13 1/2 per cent Pounds 125m Eurobond issue due 2000 by Pounds 75m.</p>

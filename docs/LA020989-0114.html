			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSPRINT GLUT WIPES OUT NONPROFIT GROUPS' FUNDS FROM RECYCLING  </P> <P> More than a dozen nonprofit groups in Ventura and Oxnard that recycle old  newspapers for extra cash have found that their efforts no longer pay off.  </P> <P> A nationwide glut in the newsprint market that industry experts say may never  be absorbed has almost overnight wiped away any profit to be made from  collecting old papers.  </P> <P> Local groups -- which include half a dozen elementary schools, churches, a  temple and two Boys &amp; Girls clubs -- began the recycling projects at  various times over the last several years as a way of padding their perennially  pinched coffers.  </P> <P> But, by December, the collection bins that had been placed on their grounds by  recycling companies were overflowing with uncollected papers, and many of the  groups contend that they are owed hundreds of dollars for past pick-ups.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Did 'Nice Things'  </P> <P> "It was really too bad," said Helen Alfredson, a fifth-grade teacher at  Montalvo Elementary School. "It's not any huge amount of money, but it did do  nice little things for our school."  </P> <P> Most of the complaints have been directed toward the Community Recycling  Center, a Sylmar-based firm, which supplied bins for at least seven of the  groups.  </P> <P> Mike Alessi, who was acting as the company's spokesman Tuesday, denied that any  money was owed. He said Community Recycling had announced in October that,  because of the plummeting price for recycled newsprint, the company could no  longer pay the groups the $40 or so a ton they were accustomed to receiving.  </P> <P> "We told them, 'If you want to get paid for it -- impossible,' " Alessi said.  "Newspaper has no value now. But they can't comprehend, because they're not in  the business. They just see that they're not getting paid what they used to be  getting, so they think the company is cheating them."  </P> <P> At least four complaints against Community Recycling have been lodged with the  Ventura County district attorney's office, which has referred the case to its  Consumer Mediation Unit. Melodianne Duffy, supervisor of the unit, said she was  awaiting a response from the company before launching an investigation to  determine whether any criminal violation had occurred.  </P> <P> Increased recycling, particularly because of a recent wave of mandatory  programs around the country, is blamed by industry experts for the glut in the  paper market. Increased supply without increased demand, according to economic  axiom, usually results in a price drop. And the price has indeed dropped.  </P> <P> Early last year, a ton of old newspapers could fetch as much as $100 from a  recycling company in California. By last summer and through the fall, it  hovered between $50 and $40 a ton. Then, between December and January, the  bottom fell out, and today, many companies are simply refusing to pay a cent.  </P> <P> "This is the beginning of the end for anybody who wants to make money recycling  newspapers," said Bob Fagan, president of Sun Valley Paper Stock Inc. and one  of the directors of the Recycling Coalition of California. "The supply and  demand cycle has been disrupted forever more."  </P> <P> According to the American Paper Institute in New York, 13 million tons of  newspaper was printed in the United States last year. Of that, 4.5 million tons  were collected for recycling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Higher Demand  </P> <P> Although demand for used paper is expected to increase this year by another  300,000 tons, municipalities desperately trying to conserve dwindling landfill  space are initiating mandatory recycling programs at an even faster rate, said  J. Rodney Edwards, vice president of the institute's Paperboard Group.  </P> <P> "We are in a period of transformation where it would appear that municipal  collection programs are tending to replace charitable group paper programs,"  Rodney said. "I don't know how long this is going to continue, . . . but I  think it will be difficult for charitable groups to compete."  </P> <P> That means several hundred dollars a year less each for some Ventura elementary  schools, including Pointsettia, Loma Vista, Montalvo, Mound and Pierpont. It  also means the loss of a little extra cash for Ventura's College United  Methodist Church, Temple Beth Torah, the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Ventura and  the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Oxnard.  </P> <P> "I really feel badly about it," said Jane Goldschmidt, executive director of  the Ventura Boys &amp; Girls Club. "But we'll just have to readjust our budget  and try to think up new and exciting ways to make up that lost income."  </P></p>

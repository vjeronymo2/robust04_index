			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kanowna Belle formally opened Kanowna Belle, often described as the best gold find in Australia for ten years - with resources of more than 4m troy ounces and an expected mine life of more than 20 years - was formally opened yesterday by Mr Richard Court, premier of Western Australia. Located 18km north east of Kalgoorlie at the old Kanowna mining centre, the mine is expected to produce 150,000 ounces of gold in its first year rising to an annual 170,000 ounces once a refractory (difficult) ore processing facility starts up towards the end of 1994. Joint venture partners, Delta Gold and North Broken Hill Peko, spent ADollars 76m to bring the mine into production after drilling pin-pointed the deposit, well away from old workings, late in 1989.</p>

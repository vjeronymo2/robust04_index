			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> JUDGE ALLOWS PRINGLE TO RESUME FUND RAISING  </P> <P> Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) has won a partial victory in his suit  against the state Fair Political Practices Commission, allowing him to resume  fund raising for his legal defense fund.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs on Monday overturned the FPPC's ruling that  said money for Pringle's defense was subject to provisions of Proposition 68 --  passed by voters in November -- which prohibits raising money in a year when a  candidate's name is not on any ballot.  </P> <P> Pringle's attorney, Thomas R. Malcolm, said Pringle will now resume his  fund-raising effort to pay for his defense against a suit filed by the Hispanic  Political Council. The suit alleges that some voters were intimidated by  uniformed security guards posted by Pringle's campaign at 20 Santa Ana polling  places when they tried to vote on Nov. 8.  </P> <P> The judge, however, upheld another element of the FPPC's ruling that restricts  the amount Pringle can raise for his defense fund to $1,000 per contributor.  </P> <P> Attorneys for both Pringle and the FPPC said they have not decided whether to  appeal.  </P> <P> Pringle was narrowly elected last year and will be on the ballot again next  year. He claims to have already spent $170,000 for his legal defense in the  federal suit about polling guards.  </P> <P> A trial on the issue of intimidation by the polling guards is scheduled to  begin Jan. 16.  </P></p>

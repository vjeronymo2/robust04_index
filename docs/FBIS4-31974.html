			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just learned that the negotiations between  representatives of the Croatian authorities and the Serbs from  the protected zones have been canceled due to the Serbs' refusal  to allow representatives of Croatia's media to attend the talks.  This is what international mediator Kai Aide said at a news  conference which ended a few minutes ago at the UN Protection  Forces headquarters in Zagreb. The international mediators will  try to reach agreement on another date for these negotiations.</p>

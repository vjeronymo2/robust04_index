			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Ernani - New Theatre, Cardiff The point is not lost when one happens to catch Ernani on the day that a general election is called. Like some other Verdi operas, this one involves itself with a period when absolute rulers were in power and the populace waited upon the whim of one individual to see whether that power would be dispensed for good or ill. In the case of Ernani the outcome hangs in the balance and it is only towards the end that Don Carlo, having secured his position in what one imagines to have been a fairly ruthless fashion, turns to magnanimity and forgives his enemies. No doubt some parallel with contemporary politics could be found. The strength of Elijah Moshinsky's production is that it generally leaves making perceptions of that nature to the audience's imagination. It was as long ago as 1979 that this Ernani was originally put on by Welsh National Opera. At the time the company was riding high on a tide of adventurous programming, of which this early Verdi opera played a part, and it seems appropriate that it should be coming back into the repertoire now alongside the highly-acclaimed new Pelleas et Melisande. It was a handsome production to look at then, and still is now. The dark vision of a 16th-century Spain, dominated by grim men of the sword and strict household formalities, has aged extremely well. The chorus, always a strong element in WNO performances, is used to forceful effect and Richard Armstrong conducted with the sturdy feeling for Verdi's dramatic pulse that always marked his work for the company. One regrets only the decision to trim the score by omitting second verses of some arias and cabalettas. If the opera still did not wield a sharp enough cutting edge in this performance, there are a couple of main reasons. One is that the Italian text was rarely delivered with any clarity. All the singers were offenders in that respect and Suzanne Murphy's Elvira in particular, no matter how easily her beautiful soprano sails out in this music, even in the most awkward passages of coloratura. The other is that the characters were never quite projected with the sort of elemental force that these early Verdi dramatic prototypes require. The most successful at generating sparks of electricity off each other were Malcolm Donnelly as Don Carlo and Alastair Miles as Silva. Both had the measure of their roles in a theatre of this size (not so different from the Teatro la Fenice in Venice, where Ernani had its premiere), although Donnelly ideally lacks vocal grace as a singer of early Verdi. In the role of Ernani himself Paolo Kudriavchenko equally preferred generalised force of vocal delivery to niceties of phrasing. One suspects that it is with this character, the outsider and potential revolutionary who turns to the populace for his support, that Verdi instinctively felt his own sympathies to lie and so the role is an important one. Unfortunately Kudriavchenko's lacklustre showing in it would not easily win my vote.</p>

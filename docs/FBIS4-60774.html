			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Guntis Ulmanis and Prime </F> Minister Valdis Birkavs in Riga following visit to Moscow --  live]    [Excerpts] [Ulmanis] Hello, esteemed viewers and listeners.  We have not yet completely recovered from the strenuous day  yesterday. And today, before I came to this meeting, I thought  over what was really done, what the results of that day's work  are,and what conclusion can be made from all that has happened.    I would like to say that in very many aspects this visit was  really a historic one and it was the first in the history of a  free Latvia and a new democratic Russia. We were going to  Moscow with certain doubts and it would be needless to say how  carefully we were preparing. Perhaps, not everyone knows that  the last three nights both Mr. Birkavs and myself spent in  continuous consultations with various political forces and  members of our government in order to work out this final  version before going to Moscow. [passage omitted]    As soon as the talks began, the anxiety concerning certain  imperialistic thinking and possible pressure from the Russian  side in fact to a certain extent disappeared from our minds.  And the dialogue proceeded in a free, unforced and I would even  like to say democratic form. [passage omitted]    President Yeltsin, as far as he was able and willing, firmly  and openly stated to me that now Russia does not have  aspirations to have Latvia in its sphere of interests, that  Russia does not think of any kind of regaining the governorship,  and that Russia thinks that Latvia has to become a stable, free,  and sovereign European state. During the whole course of the  talks I did not feel that there was any tendency which would  make me considerably doubt or reconsider what had been said.    In discussions with President Yeltsin, at the beginning we  touched on the issues of the fate of the two peoples, the fate  of the Russian people and the Latvian people, about the huge  deportations which affected the Latvian people, about the  deportations of 1940 and 1949. And remembering this, President  Yeltsin categorically condemned personally and on his  government's behalf those mass deportations and said that he  would also publicly state this everywhere where it could be  heard and where one would be able to find out his views. It  should be said that he kept this promise and with certain  satisfaction I was listening to him when he was addressing the  press and reporters. [passage omitted]    We agreed that the agreements signed were a theoretical  part,  a part on paper, of the agreement, and practical steps have to  follow now. These steps should be such that they do not offend  either Latvia's honor or the honor of Latvian citizens, or the  wrong done to the deported, or the principles of Latvia's  sovereignty and independence. We agreed that the number of the  military, the amount of pensions paid to them and their future  fate will be strictly controlled.    An agreement was reached with the Russian side -- the  minister of defense and the minister of foreign affairs also  took part in it, their names, Grachev and Kozyrev, are widely  known to you -- about the creation of a repatriation fund and  both Russia and Latvia, as well as other European states, will  participate in the fund.    Speaking about the withdrawal of troops from Latvia, I  expressed doubts on whether Russia is ready to withdraw its  troops by 31 August and I wondered whether their promises will  not be fulfilled. A statement by the minister of defense said in  response that they will do everything possible to have the  troops withdrawn much earlier than 31 August. Although 31  August was left in the agreement, a verbal agreement was reached  between us that the troops will be withdrawn before 31 August.  Various figures and various dates were mentioned. I think that  we can safely say now that this to a certain extent depends on  both our Ministry of Defense and other ministries, whether they  are able to get actively involved in this process. The  agreement provides the foundation on which they can get to work.  I got the impression that the troops will very soon leave  Latvian territory.    We have received full guarantees from the Russian side and  once again a verbal assurance from Mr. Yeltsin that the issue of  the status of a military base was an unfortunate erroneous  process and that it is a lesson not only for Latvia to be more  careful, but also a lesson for Russia itself to follow more  carefully the drafting of its documents and the work of its  executive and its corresponding departments. Once again an  agreement was reached that that facility should be a military  facility under civilian control [as heard]. There was no  difference of opinion as to who and how controls it and that  that site should never become a military base on Latvian  territory. And it was also added that the Russian side does not  have at the moment any grounds, any plans or any activity aimed  at creating military bases in Latvia. [passage omitted]    [Birkavs] Hello, esteemed viewers and listeners. Whether  yesterday will be a historic day and whether it will stay in the  people's consciousness as a significant positive step now  depends on us. Practically today we can go to the new Skrunda  facility and begin to dismantle it. But let us not perhaps  hurry in this way, that involves considerable work. And for  this purpose, the state coffers will immediately receive $3  million. These are practical matters, however, which we can  easily tackle in the short term.    We need long-term favorable economic relations with Russia.  I therefore consider the signing of a protocol, which states  that most favored nation status in trade comes into effect for  Latvia and Russia on 1 June 1994, as one of the greatest results  of yesterday's talks. In order to fully settle this issue and  to sign corresponding documents, Russian Premier Chernomyrdin  will come to Latvia in the second half of May and the  corresponding documents will be signed.    I would like to say to the residents of Skrunda and all the  residents of the surrounding villages and rural districts who  are affected by the Skrunda radar that my request from Russia on  the issue of how much should the rent payment for Skrunda be is  very simple: Pay the sum that is worthy of Russia. The sum on  which we agreed may be assessed differently. It is two and a  half times bigger than was initially promised by the Russian  side, but it is considerably smaller than what I would like it  to be -- it is $5 million a year. I promise that this money  will be granted to the residents who will still be suffering  from the radar for four years. [passage omitted]    We are facing a new historic period and we should not look  back so much, we should look forward. I invite all the critics  of the agreement to carefully follow whether the clauses of the  agreement are complied with. We will try to do everything  possible to improve relations with Russia in the course of  compliance with the agreement, but so that Latvian people do not  suffer either. Thank you.

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> BLACK SEA BASS NUMBERS SURGE  </P> <P> Hopes for black sea bass are rebounding.  </P> <P> Juvenile giant black sea bass are making appearances again.  </P> <P> The fish were in danger of extinction until the state Department of Fish and  Game put them on the prohibited keeper list in 1982.  </P> <P> Not a day passes but that someone on a party boat catches a bass and releases  it.  </P> <P> When these fish come to the surface in a bloated condition and are unable to  submerge, there is a safe method to deflate them. The fish suffer from bloating  of the gas bladder. Fish and Game personnel have deflated bloated rockfish  successfully during tag and release programs.  </P> <P> Anglers on private boats who hook black sea bass can penetrate the skin just  behind the pectoral fin with a thin blade. The gas will be removed and the fish  can submerge unharmed.  </P> <P> These fish can grow to 500 pounds and live 70 years if they can evade a hook.  </P> <P> There could be a full return to fishing these giants if the small ones are  returned to sea.  </P> <P> Paul Gregory of Fish and Game said fishermen should remember the survival of  the sea bass or any undersized fish is an important factor to the fishing of  the future.  </P> <P> The King Harbor Marlin Club held its 16th annual awards banquet Saturday night.  A club record was set in 1989 when club anglers caught 40 marlin, releasing and  tagging 28.  </P> <P> Trophy winners were Jerry Austin for largest marlin, Ray Hawkes for first  albacore and Stan Austin for junior-member award.  </P> <P> A special award went to Syd Whitaker for catching a 6-pound, 4-ounce halibut  using two-pound test line.  </P> <P> Gary Klein, 31, the 1989 bass angler of the year, has won $300,000 fishing for  bass.  </P> <P> Klein, from Montgomery, Tex., has been called the "Fishing Professor" because  of his analytical approach to the sport.  </P> <P> While most anglers have a special technique -- spinner baits, flippin, etc. --  Klein has adapted a number of techniques into his game plan. He has gained a  reputation as a proponent of flippin. He has proven he can catch bass on deep,  clear lakes as well using plastic worms and grubs as part of his arsenal.  </P> <P> He has been a "bassmaster" finalist seven times.  </P> <P> Klein will be sharing techniques with participants in a bass institute at El  Camino College on Saturday and Sunday. For reservations and information call  (213) 715-3116.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Bob Walford of Torrance, fishing aboard the Blackjack at  Cherry Bank, caught the whopper of the week, a 28-pound cow cod.  </P> <P> Mike Burke of Long Beach, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Southern Cal,  caught a 19 1/2-pound lingcod.  </P> <P> Mike Lewis of West Los Angeles, aboard the Freedom, won the jackpot with a  15-pound sheepshead.  </P> <P> Rick Ladoman of West Los Angeles, fishing on the Monte Carlo for calico bass,  landed a 12 1/2-pound silver salmon.  </P> <P> Fish Reports: Only a few bass and bonito have been caught locally as most boats  are concentrating on shallow rock cod fishing.  </P> <P> Two-day trips to Cherry Bank have resulted in limit catches of rock cod and big  cows.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire worked the Venice reef area and  returned with 180 sculpin, 18 sand bass and one halibut.  </P> <P> The Betty O rock cod special chalked up 160 rock cod and four lingcod.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished Redondo Canyon and anglers sacked  360 rock cod and five halibut.  </P> <P> The Blackjack tried Cherry Bank and returned with 285 rock cod and 10 cows.  </P> <P> The Redondo Special on a half-day trip scored with 160 rock cod.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The Monte Carlo headed to Catalina Island and anglers  sacked 51 rockfish, 28 sheepshead and 25 calico bass.  </P> <P> The Diawa rock cod trip to San Clemente Island produced 300 rock cod and 11  sheepshead.  </P> <P> At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Shogun fished San Clemente Island and anglers  caught a variety, sacking 386 calico bass, 101 perch, 94 rockfish, 71  sheepshead and 35 whitefish.  </P> <P> The Annie B barge had a weekend count of 620 croaker, 325 jacksmelt, four  sharks and one halibut.  </P> <P> At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Southern Cal half-day trip to the Rockpile  resulted in a catch of 36 sculpin, 31 rock cod and 12 calico bass.  </P> <P> Anglers on the Toronado rock cod trip to Cherry Bank sacked 450 rock cod, 19  cow cod and six lingcod.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] With the emergence of the first  manifestations of an armed conflict on the territories of former  Yugoslavia, Bulgaria declared that it would never, under any  circumstances, try to take advantage of the disintegrating  federation's difficulties, and our country has kept its word to  this day. That is what Prime Minister Lyuben Berov pointed out  in a statement about the Bulgarian Government's stand on the  NATO ultimatum related to attacks from the air against positions  of the Bosnian Serbs near Sarajevo. Let us hear part of the  statement:    [Begin Berov recording] Bulgaria regards the request to lift  the arms embargo imposed by Resolution No. 715 of the UN  Security Council of 1991 as an element of the military balance  in the Balkans which has not been disrupted so far, as a matter  of fact. The lifting of the embargo is not only likely to  disrupt the balance, but would also cause an escalation and  expansion of the conflict. The warning about air attacks  according to the NATO Council ultimatum adopted on 9 February  1994 deserves particular attention. It confronts  Bosnia-Herzegovina and presumably other Balkan countries with  the menace of an escalation of the conflict accompanied by great  material damages and the loss of human lives. Any external  military interference whatsoever cannot be a solution for the  Bosnian conflict as such, as long as the three sides involved in  the conflict do not manifest sufficient good will for a peaceful  solution. The interest of Bulgaria and of all Balkan states  demands that they should contribute to such a solution.</p>

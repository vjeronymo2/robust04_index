			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--Germany has responded favourably  to the Indian request for greater access to German technology  and to its middle-level industry for partnership.    The Germans have also reassured the Prime Minister, Mr P.V.  Narasimha Rao, during his just-concluded visit to Germany of  clear political support for German programmes aimed at expanding  Indo-German economic cooperation. The German Chancellor, Dr  Helmut Kohl, has conveyed his intention to nominate one of his  ministerial-level colleagues to monitor the progress of economic  cooperation and to remove obstacles, if any, in the process.    Both the countries have also agreed to synchronise their  efforts for further democratisation of the United Nations, to  reflect the existing ground realities, including expansion of  the Security Council by increasing the number of permanent  members with veto. Both India and Germany are keen for a place  in the extended Security Council with veto power.    In the next few months three high-level delegations from  Germany, each headed by a minister such as the Minister for  Development, Minister for Economic Cooperation and Foreign  Minister are slated to visit India to provide fresh impetus to  growing Indo-German cooperation in various fields.    According to official sources in the External Affairs  Ministry, in the context of German view of playing an important  role in world affairs, Bonn has formulated a priority programme,  "Asia concept policy," for opening itself up towards "high  growth" Asian countries like Japan, China and India. The market  in Russia and Europe was not considered to be sufficient to meet  the growing German capabilities in fields like science,  technology, economic, investment abroad.    These sources are quite optimistic that in the near future  large-scale German investments could be expected in various  spheres of cooperative economic interaction for mutual benefit  and advantage, though it is "very difficult to quantify" the  outcome of the visit so early.    However, Mr Rao himself said that he was satisfied with the  outcome of his German visit.    These sources further pointed out that the reception the  Prime Minister received in Germany was much warmer and greater  than the one he received during his first visit in September  1991.    These sources asserted that during the Prime Minister's  talks  with German leaders at no point the issue of nuclear  non-proliferation treaty (NPT) figured. Thus a report circulated  by some news agency to say that the issue figured during the  talks was totally baseless. The sources further stated that the  German official sources also denied having given any such  briefing at all.</p>

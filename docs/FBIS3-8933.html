In an interview with the Independent, Mr Jeszenszky said  that  membership of the union remained the central aim of the ruling  Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), which has headed the  government since 1990.    But with general elections less than two months away, the  minister warned that victory for the Socialists -- successors to  the former Communist Party -- could lead to a weakening of  Hungary's drive to realign itself with the West, and even to a  revival of the more traditional ties with Moscow.    "When one considers the backgrounds of the people in the  (Socialist) Party, one has to have misgivings," said Mr  Jeszenszky. "Many of them spent years studying in Russia and  know the Russian mentality better than the Western one. If a  situation arose in which the position of Central Europe was  called into question, I am not sure they would stand up for  continued commitment to the West."    In their official election programme, the Socialists,  currently heading the field in opinion polls, pledge firm  support for Hungary's application to join the EU, which is due  for formal submission next month. The party, which reformed and  renamed itself in 1989, also promises to maintain the process of  economic reform. On Nato, it is less forthright. While not  opposed to membership, the party believes there should be no  rush to join and that the issue should be put to a referendum.    "Unfortunately, too many (Socialists) have trained for too  long to view Western countries as enemies," said Mr Jeszenszky.  Although Hungary's attempts to join the EU and Nato are  unlikely to form the main issues in the electoral campaign, the  Socialists may be able to tap an undercurrent of disillusionment  towards the West which has been growing since the anti-Communist  revolutions of 1989.    That disillusionment, born from the reluctance of Western  institutions to roll out the red carpet to their newly liberated  East European cousins, has been fuelled by what are perceived to  have been the West's confusing and inadequate policies in the  former Yugoslavia.    In Hungary, which claims to have sustained direct losses of  more than US$1.5bn (1bn pounds) as a result of the imposition of  sanctions against Serbia, criticism of the government's  pro-Western stance has grown. Indeed, instead of kow-towing to  Brussels and Washington, some even suggest that the country's  true interests would be better served by re-kindling ties with  Russia and neighbouring Serbia.    That is not, however, the majority view, with most  Hungarians  still convinced that their future lies within the EC and Nato.  "We have lost our illusions over the past four years, but we  still have our hopes," said Mr Jeszenszky's spokesman, Janos  Herman. "We have discovered that not everything under the sun  is perfect. But there are some things that are less imperfect  than others."</p>

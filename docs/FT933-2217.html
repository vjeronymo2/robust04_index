			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Markets aground on a reef of cautious results: The UK interim reporting season has caused concern about the speed of recovery The gathering confidence that UK economic recovery is under way appears to have been a dealt a blow by the cautious tone of many of the companies reporting during the interim results season. Forecasters hoping that a strong earnings growth would underpin the recent rise in the Footsie index were first given a nasty shock by BTR, the industrial conglomerate. It said that there was no evidence to suggest that recovery was translating into significant increases in corporate profitability and warned the outlook remained uncertain for any 'meaningful upturn' in the second half. A similar message came from Williams Holdings, another industrial conglomerate. Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said the pace of the UK recovery was slow and warned that in the low inflationary environment it was proving very hard to increase prices. Both conglomerates increased pre-tax profits but their shares fell on the back of their less-than-ebullient trading statements. A week later the Footsie followed suit, falling below 3,000 less than a month after it reached an all-time high by breaking through the 3,100 mark. Mr Jerry Evans, strategist at NatWest Markets, believes recent falls in the market reflect concern about the prospects for profits. Though he is not changing his earnings forecasts after three weeks of results, Mr Evans says it is clear UK earnings would have to pick up significantly to sustain the Footsie index above the 3000 mark. Some chairmen who have been unable to deliver such an increase have been unable to hide their anger at the expectations which had been created. Lord Sterling, chairman of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which disappointed the market with lower than expected profits before disposals, said: 'It would have been abundantly clear to anyone who read our annual report that the UK recovery is slower than anticipated.' Another chairman blamed economists and politicians for talking up a recovery 'beyond the realms of reality'. But how much weight should the market be attaching to the reservations of companies about recovery prospects? Mr Mark Cusack, conglomerate analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, believes many industrialists during the recession made the mistake of calling the upturn too quickly. 'It is possible that they are now being too cautious,' Mr Cusack says. This view is reinforced by Mr John Thomson, senior investment manager at Standard Life. 'Companies are always cautious at this stage of the recovery. They have been through hell and are not about to scream from the rooftops when things get better. The market may be a hundred points off its high but it is still good value.' Regardless of whether companies are exaggerating the slow upturn, forecasters take comfort from the fact that the gloom about the UK's recovery prospects is not universally shared. Some of the housebuilders, such as Blue Circle Industries, have become more upbeat. There have been some surprisingly generous dividend increases. Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, reported a 17 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the year and increased the dividend by 29 per cent. Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurance company, raised its interim dividend almost 10 per cent. Some fund managers believe the outlook for dividend growth may be better than many forecasts, irrespective of the slow recovery in earnings. However, even if there is a delay in the earnings recovery it does not necessarily mean that the benefits of sterling leaving the European exchange rate mechanism last September, and the interest rate cuts which have followed, will not materialise. It could be that they have just been postponed. Whether that postponement is temporary or longer-term, Mr George Hodgson, strategist at Warburg Securities, believes earnings disappointed the market because people failed to take account of the fact that the UK is virtually alone in enjoying rising confidence about prospects for recovery. Mr Hodgson explained: 'While economists in the UK were throwing their hats up in the air at the prospect of a strong recovery mainland Europe was going down the tubes, Japan was in serious trouble and the rate of recovery in the US slowed.' The significant slippage in world growth forecasts for 1993 - they have nearly halved since the beginning of the year - has gone unnoticed in a UK market pre-occupied with domestic issues. Mr Christopher Miller, chief executive of Wassall, a small conglomerate, concurs. 'In the UK, the ingredients for a sustained economic improvement are in place. But a full recovery may have to wait for further falls in Continental interest rates. You cannot have the one without the other.' It is hardly surprising, therefore, that companies with an international spread of activities are starting to sound more cautious about second-half earnings. Notwithstanding last week's inflation figures, showing the year-on-year increase in the RPI - excluding mortgage interest payments - edging up to 3.1 per cent in August from 2.9 per cent in July, most companies remain confident the outlook for low inflation is good. With falling bond yields investors may have no other option but to put their money into equities. 'That is one of the best reasons to look for the exit door,' says Mr Hodgson, who argues that deteriorating world growth makes it highly plausible that multiples will come under increasing downward pressure. This may explain why many analysts assume that the FT-SE Index will move back into the trading range established in the first half of the year - around the 2,900 level.  -------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO ANALYSTS' FORECASTS  -------------------------------------------------------------- (Companies reported)                 Whole Universe (114*)                               Before interims    After interims  -------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-exceptional eps growth: To Dec 1993                               24%             26.3% To Dec 1994                             23.2%             17.4%  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: SG Warburg Securities *Excludes BT and Glaxo  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Risk-Based Capital Treatment of Senior Securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the ratings-based multi-level approach, a senior security could qualify for a 20 percent risk weight, regardless of the risk-weight of the underlying assets, if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The securitization involves a large, well diversified pool of assets,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All prior credit enhancement is limited to the permissible forms, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The security has received the highest possible rating from the same rating organization that provided the credit rating (if any) associated with the second dollar loss enhancement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This preferential risk-based capital treatment for qualifying senior securities would apply regardless of whether a second dollar loss enhancement for the same transaction also qualifies for preferential treatment under the ratings-based multi-level approach. Senior securities that do not meet all of the specified conditions would be required to hold capital at the risk-weight appropriate to the pooled assets, in accordance with the current risk-based capital standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``senior security'' would mean that no class of securities has a prior claim to payment from the underlying assets. Securities that do not have the first claim to payment would be treated as first or second dollar loss enhancements under the ratings-based multi-level approach (regardless of their credit rating). <FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Senior securities that are not paid out until after another class or classes of securities from the same issue is completely paid out would be considered ``senior securities'' for purposes of the ratings-based multi-level approach, provided that they do not provide credit enhancement for another class of securities and that losses are shared on a pro rata basis in the event of default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Question 12) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agencies request comment on whether a class of securities that receives the highest investment grade rating but is not the most senior class in a qualifying transaction should also be eligible for the 20% risk-weight category under the ratings-based multi-level approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Question 13) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agencies request comment on whether the ratings-based multi-level approach should be further adjusted to reflect the reduced risk of loss associated with positions rated above the minimum investment grade rating but below the highest investment grade rating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed favorable risk-based capital treatment of senior securities would be restricted to transactions in which all of the credit enhancement, including all second dollar loss credit enhancements, is either completely free of third-party performance risk or is provided internally through the securitization structure. Thus, to be eligible for the reduced risk-based capital assessment, a senior security would have to be supported solely by cash collateral accounts, subordinated interests (including middle level subordinated positions), spread accounts, or other forms of overcollateralization. If any part of the total credit enhancement provided is subject to third-party performance risk, then the senior portion of the issue would not be eligible for a reduced risk-based capital requirement under the ratings-based multi-level approach, regardless of its rating. <FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>  For example, if a financial standby letter of credit provides second dollar loss enhancement for an asset securitization, then the senior portion of that securitization would not be eligible for the 20% risk-weight. Risk-based capital would be held against the amount of the standby letter of credit and all portions of the transaction that are senior to the standby letter of credit in accordance with the current risk-based capital standards. See Example 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS would continue to apply the 20% risk-weight to any SMMEA security regardless of the type of credit enhancement provided in the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Maintenance of Minimum Ratings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed favorable risk-based capital treatments for second dollar loss enhancements and senior securities under the ratings-based multi-level approach would be contingent upon maintenance of the required minimum ratings. If second dollar loss enhancement is downgraded below investment grade, if the senior securities are downgraded below the highest possible rating, or if either rating is withdrawn by the rating organization that provided the initial ratings, then the capital requirement would be adjusted accordingly. <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation of the ratings-based multi-level approach into the risk-based capital standards would also not affect the Agencies' authority to require banking organizations and thrifts to hold additional capital beyond the minimum regulatory requirements, when warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agencies believe that this preliminary proposal for a ratings-based multi-level approach could eliminate or reduce many of the concerns with the current treatment of recourse and direct credit substitutes. This approach would:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Incorporate the proposed low-level recourse rule, so that an institution's capital would never exceed the contractual maximum amount of its exposure;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Equalize the treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes that present equivalent risk of loss; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Add flexibility to the regulatory capital requirements for recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes by taking into account the different degrees of credit risk associated with first dollar loss and second dollar loss credit enhancements and senior positions for those asset securitizations where formal credit ratings are provided for the various positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of credit ratings would provide a way for the Agencies to use market determinations of credit quality to identify different loss positions for capital purposes in an asset securitization structure. The use of ratings could also enable the approach to be applied to large, well diversified pools of non-homogeneous assets, such as small business loans, because the market would determine the level of credit support necessary to obtain the various credit ratings. This may permit the Agencies to give more equitable treatment to a wide variety of transactions and structures in administering the risk-based capital system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The flexibility of such a system would be particularly apparent in transactions that use overcollateralization to provide first dollar loss credit enhancement because the amount of the excess collateral will vary based on factors such as the quality of the underlying assets. One pool of assets may require 5% overcollateralization and another may require 20% overcollateralization to raise the credit quality of the pools to the investment grade level. Even though the second pool in this example has a greater amount of overcollateralization, the provider of second dollar loss enhancement for this transaction would not necessarily be in a safer loss position than the provider of second dollar loss enhancement for the pool that required only 5% overcollateralization. The use of credit ratings to determine the amount of first dollar loss protection could provide the Agencies with an inherently flexible method for identifying when an adequate first dollar loss position has been reached and when the second dollar loss position begins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

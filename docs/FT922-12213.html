			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Mills rejects criticism of SFO policies A STRONG defence of the record of the Serious Fraud Office has been made by Mrs Barbara Mills QC, its director, as she leaves to become director of public prosecutions. Mrs Mills, who takes over as DPP today, rejects criticism of both the use of the SFO's powers to compel people under investigation to answer questions and its overall prosecution policy. Mrs Mills denies in Law Society Gazette that the operation of the SFO's powers has proved draconian. During her 17-month tenure as director, no complaints were received about their use. Of the notices issued last year, 73 per cent were issued to willing interviewees, she writes. In such cases, often involving bankers and accountants, the notices enabled them to talk freely to SFO investigators. Mrs Mills also denies that SFO adopted a 'scatter gun' approach in its prosecutions, charging defendants with too wide a range of charges. 'In the last 18 months, there have only been three SFO indictments which contained more than 12 counts considered by a jury', she continues. 'In about half of the cases, there were fewer than six counts for the jury's consideration.' The SFO's policy remains to prosecute only central allegations and defendants, she adds. Mrs Mills also points to the steep rise in the SFO's workload. The number of cases tackled by the SFO over the last 18 months has remained unchanged at 60, but the value of the alleged frauds has increased from Pounds 1.3bn to more than Pounds 5bn, she said. Mr George Staple, a former partner with Clifford Chance, the City law firm, succeeds her as SFO director today.</p>

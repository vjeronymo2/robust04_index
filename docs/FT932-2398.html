			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises despite fears of early election EQUITIES moved within a narrow range on fears that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, may have to call a snap election, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Late afternoon support by public funds, however, helped to prop up the Nikkei average, which rose by 23.09 to 19,925.51 after a day's low of 19,647.42 and high of 19,950.01. The index initially weakened on reports that opposition parties had submitted a motion of no confidence against Mr Miyazawa. However, it rebounded on buying by public funds, triggering index-linked demand from investment trusts. Volume fell to 300m shares from 368m. Declines led advances by 593 to 383, with 173 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 6.55 at 1,593.59, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.08 to 1,208.90. The lower house will vote on the no confidence motion today and, if it is passed, Mr Miyazawa must resign within 10 days or call a general election. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister of international trade and industry, voiced his concern yesterday over the current political situation. He acknowledged that the recent fall in the stock market stemmed from political uncertainty, adding that the business community was worried about the effect it might have on the economy. The political developments affected the yen as investors sold the Japanese currency against the dollar, which closed Y0.65 firmer at Y107. Leading exporters were higher on the yen's fall: Matsushita appreciated Y40 to Y1,250 and Honda Motor by Y20 to Y1,390. However, electric power utilities were lower on the currency movements, with Tokyo Electric Power retreating Y40 to Y3,690. Foreigners took profits on bank holdings: Chugoku Bank receded Y90 to Y1,570 and Kita Nippon Bank dipped Y300 to Y5,600. Communications were the day's top losers, falling 2.15 per cent. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shed Y14,000 to Y905,000 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 51.18 down at 21,989.06 in volume of 18m shares. Roundup THERE WAS considerable activity among the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG ended sharply lower on disappointment over the lack of progress in the Sino-British talks. The Hang Seng index declined 115.73, or 1.6 per cent, to 7,189.10 in moderate turnover of HKDollars 4.75bn. Prices lost ground throughout the day, with the fall accelerated in the afternoon by rumours that mainland companies might sell assets in Hong Kong to repatriate funds and boost the yuan. The Chinese currency reached a low of Yn10.9 to the US dollar on the Shanghai swap market. Among the actives, new listing Shangri-la Asia closed at HKDollars 6.00, up HKDollars 1.10 from the issue price, on its first day of trading. HSBC relinquished HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 73. KUALA LUMPUR closed broadly weaker, although light bargain hunting in the last hour lifted prices from the day's lows. The composite index was finally 16.05, or 2.2 per cent, down at 720.46, the lowest level since May 17. Some brokers said the market was undergoing a correction and that a further retracement was likely after the bull run which had started in April. Volume was 299.8m shares, against Wednesday's 385.9m. SEOUL was higher for the second consecutive day, with buying interest concentrated on low-priced shares. The composite index rose 3.28 to 762.54 in turnover of Won814.6bn. TAIWAN finished lower on disappointment following comments from the central bank that there would be no further easing in interest rates. The weighted index fell 59.05, or 1.4 per cent, to 4,129.85 in turnover of TDollars 16.7bn. MANILA saw bargain hunting lift the composite index 7.90 to 1,576.30 in turnover of 105m pesos. BANGKOK remained firm, the SET index moving forward 7.27 to 880.66 amid turnover of Bt9.2bn. Finance and securities firms led the gains in the afternoon, while property stocks eased. AUSTRALIA was led higher by gold issues and selected blue chips. The All Ordinaries index ended 2.5 up at 1,727.2 in turnover of ADollars 279m, and the gold shares index put on 26.1 at 1,743.2. Plutonic advanced 39 cents to ADollars 5.40. BOMBAY moved lower on the kerb on rumours that Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao may resign. This followed allegations made by Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of the securities scandal, that he had made a Rs10m payment to Mr Rao. The BSE index closed 62.65 lower at 2,229.00. KARACHI was higher, helped by strength in the car sector after the government said it would review new taxes on vehicles. The KSE index rose 4.38 to 1,205.31.</p>

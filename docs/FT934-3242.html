			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead smelter to close because of low prices Mount Isa Mines, the Queensland-based metals operation that is part of the Brisbane-based MIM group, yesterday announced that it was closing down the smaller of its two lead smelters because of low metal prices. The company said that there was now insufficient feed from the Mount Isa mine to utilise fully its conventional smelter and the Isasmelt plant, which employs newer technology. Earlier this year, MIM reduced zinc-lead ore production from the Mount Isa and nearby Hilton mines to 85 per cent of the increased capacity of the mines. However, the lead smelters were able to maintain output by feeding off stockpiles of concentrate. These have now been exhausted. As a result, the Isasmelt smelter, which had achieved its planned capacity of 60,000 tonnes a year, will close down for an indefinite period. The remaining plant will produce a rate of 3,300 tonnes a week. The company said that it was aiming for total annual lead production of about 180,000 tonnes, compared with just over 206,000 tonnes in 1992-93. Mount Isa Mines declined to say how much closing down the smelter would cost, but said that the 40 people employed there would be offered jobs in other parts of the organisation. Signet Engineering, a Perth-based engineering company, and the West Australian's government Gold Corporation have won a contract to establish a new gold and silver refinery near Chengdu, in south-west China. The contract was negotiated with the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, and announced yesterday by Mr Richard Court, the Western Australian premier. The two organisation will provide technology, equipment and staff training for the plant over the next 18 months.</p>

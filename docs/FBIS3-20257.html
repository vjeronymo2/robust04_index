By sending 2,700 Turkish and 500  Greek soldiers, for the first time "a UN principle is broken  that says that neighboring states or countries with historically  burdened relations do not send troops," Austrian General  Guenther Greindl says. Greindl strictly opposes Austrian Blue  Helmets for Bosnia: "Germans and some other nations should stay  out of Bosnia. Austria was not asked by anyone to send  soldiers." Instead, Austria has successfully provided equipment  and humanitarian aid.    In Greindl's view, the UN mission in ex-Yugoslavia will drag  on for decades "until the crisis is settled." In no case may  borders be changed. "As soon as one border is redrawn, the  entire Balkans begins to slide." One will probably have to  tolerate ethnic cleansing within the republics. In every other  respect, however, autonomy, the protection of human rights, and  the further cooperation of the United States, Russia, and the  European Union are the only way out of the crisis, Greindl noted.</p>

The amendments to parts 264 and 265 are proposed under RCRA sections 3004 and 3005.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 9, 1991, the Agency promulgated revised criteria for municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs), which established minimum Federal standards to assure that MSWLFs are designed and managed in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, taking into account the practical capability of the MSWLFs ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  56 FR 50978). The minimum Federal standards include location restrictions, facility design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action, financial assurance, closure, and post-closure care requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency proposed the MSWLF criteria, including financial assurance requirements, on August 30, 1988 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  53 FR 33314). The purpose of the financial assurance requirements of the MSWLF criteria was to assure that adequate funds will be readily available to cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective action associated with MSWLFs. The Agency believes that these financial assurance provisions are an important part of the MSWLF criteria for two reasons. First, when an owner or operator does not have funds readily available to address the environmental needs at a facility, delays in addressing those needs can result. Second, if the owner or operator does not have funds to address environmental needs at its facilities, those needs are typically addressed under federal or state cleanup authorities, rather than by the party responsible for the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the August 30, 1988 proposal, rather than propose specific financial assurance mechanisms, the Agency proposed a financial assurance performance standard. The Agency solicited public comment on this performance standard approach and, at the same time, requested comment on whether the Agency should develop financial test mechanisms for use by local governments and corporations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters on the proposed rule argued that the proposed performance standard lacked sufficient detail to guide States in the development and implementation of requirements with any consistency among States, and that the Agency should develop specific mechanisms that could be used to demonstrate financial assurance. Commenters also supported the development of a local government financial test and a corporate financial test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to comment, the Agency promulgated several specific financial mechanisms in the October 9, 1991, final rule. Those mechanisms include trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance, and State assumptions of responsibility (&sect;258.74). In addition, to retain States' flexibility in implementing the subtitle D program, the Agency promulgated the financial assurance performance standard of &sect;258.74, which allows approved States to use any State-approved mechanism that meets that performance standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters on the August 30, 1988, proposal also supported the development of financial tests for local governments and for corporations. The Agency agreed with commenters but, at the time the final MSWLF criteria were promulgated, the Agency had not completed the analyses necessary to propose those financial tests. Thus, in the October 9, 1991, preamble, the Agency announced its intention to develop both a local government and corporate financial test in advance of the effective date of the financial assurance provisions. The Agency then proceeded to conduct the necessary analysis, and develop a local government and corporate financial test for MSWLF owners and operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To allow time to develop financial tests, the Agency promulgated an effective date of April 9, 1994, for the financial assurance provisions in the July 1, 1991 notice. In doing so, the Agency believed it had allowed adequate time to promulgate the local government and corporate financial tests in advance of the effective date. However, those financial tests are taking longer to develop than the Agency originally anticipated. As the April 1994, deadline approached, the Agency recognized that it would be unable to promulgate final financial tests by that time. Thus, on October 11, 1993, the Agency extended the effective date of the financial assurance provisions until April 9, 1995 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  58 FR 51536) to allow additional time to develop the financial tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

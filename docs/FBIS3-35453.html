Sa'id Leylaz, head of the public relations office and an  expert of the Organization for Expansion and New Building of  Iranian Industries, who spoke in the opening ceremonies of the  Management Seminar for the Planning and Control of Cash Funds,  made this statement and added: Hence, from foreign currency  revenues alone, calculating 1,750 rials[R] to the dollar, the  figures in the government budget proposed to the Majles will see  a deficit of more than R6,600 billion.    He added: Also, tax revenues for 1373 [21 March 1994-20  March  1995] have been projected at R6.4 billion. However, considering  the decrease in revenues, at least R1 trillion of the projected  tax revenues will not be attained.    Leylaz described a significant part of the proposed  government budget for the government companies in 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] to be questionable and said: Of the total  R7,313 billion projected as banking loans to the government  companies, about R5,630 billion (that is, 77 percent) is  allocated to 15 giant government companies active in oil,  natural gas, petrochemicals, steel, meat, and the Tavanir  sectors, and the remaining R1,683 billion is set aside for about  2,000 other government companies.</p>

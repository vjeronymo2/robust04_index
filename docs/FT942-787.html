			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / California to discuss cover for quakes Governor Pete Wilson of California was yesterday due to meet representatives from some of the country's biggest insurers to discuss the gathering crisis over earthquake insurance in the state. The meeting was prompted in part by a decision two weeks ago by Farmers, the Los Angeles-based insurer owned by the UK's BAT, to stop writing new homeowners' insurance policies in the state. Under Californian insurance rules, earthquake cover has to be made available on all homeowners' policies. Farmers, which puts its losses from the January earthquake at more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 658m), said it wanted to reduce its exposure to such catastrophes. Twentieth Century, another of the state's biggest insurers, has also stopped offering cover since the January earthquake, which is estimated to have cost the insurance industry Dollars 6.6bn. Its move was part of a plan agreed with Mr John Garamendi, the state's insurance commissioner, to return it to financial health. The meeting with insurers follows a move by Mr Garamendi last week to extend the so-called Fair Plan - an insurance scheme adopted after brush fires in Southern California rendered many homes uninsurable - to homes exposed to earthquake risk. Under the Fair Plan arrangement, uninsured risks would be pooled, and spread between the insurers according to their market share in the state.</p>

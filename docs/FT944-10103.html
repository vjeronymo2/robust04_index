			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Da Vinci papers sell for Pounds 19m A 72-page scientific manuscript written around 1507 by Leonardo da Vinci, and decorated with over 300 illustrations, sold for Dollars 30.8m (Pounds 19.24m) at Christie's in New York yesterday. There were just two bidders for the manuscript, the last substantial written work by Leonardo remaining in private hands. One was a representative of a Milanese bank, who was in the room; the other was an anonymous telephone bidder who was ultimately successful. The price was well ahead of the pre-sale estimate of Dollars 10m-plus - and the Pounds 2.4m which secured the manuscript at Christie's in London in 1980. It was then bought by the oil billionaire the late Armand Hammer and became known as the Codex Hammer. Before that, and for over 250 years, it had belonged to the Earls of Leicester. The manuscript contains original ideas on hydraulics and cosmology. It was sold by the Armand Hammer Museum in Los Angeles to help settle a dispute over his inheritance. The price was the 10th highest sum ever paid at auction, and the highest for any work of art other than a painting - beating the manuscript record of Pounds 8.14m, paid at Sotheby's in 1983 for the Gospel of Henry the Lion.</p>

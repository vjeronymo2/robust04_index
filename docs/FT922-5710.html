			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Observer: Those who teach . . . Where does the world's best known management school look for a leader for its new publishing venture? Not to the august experts on its teaching staff, in the case of Harvard Business School, even though one of them - the famous Rosabeth Moss Kanter - already edits its flagship publication, the Harvard Business Review. Having decided to group its disparate publishing activities into a single enterprise expected to generate Dollars 40m a year in revenue, the school is importing a publishing professional to run it in the shape of Ruth McMullen from Wiley. Kanter, a professor of organisational behaviour, will step down as editor of the review although she becomes vice-chairman of the board of the new unit. While her two-year stay in the editorship has been stormy at times, insiders say the real source of the evident tension is not her management but the hybrid nature of the product. The bi-monthly review is neither an academic journal nor a typical business magazine. Even so, with efforts in train to make it less stuffy and attractive to a wider public, Kanter's departure may signify Harvard's recognition that business academics aren't always the best people to run businesses in practice.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An Israel-PLO agreement on security arrangements in  Hebron, to be signed by the delegation heads this morning, was  reached in Cairo past midnight last night. Our correspondent in  Cairo Arye Gus reports that under the agreement, an increased  international force will be deployed in Hebron in exchange for  the Palestinian consent to waive their demand for Palestinian  police there.    PLO officials said that about 160 observers from three  countries -- Norway, Denmark, and Italy -- will be stationed in  Hebron, and as said, there will be no Palestinian police there.    The agreement has paved the way for the resumption of the  Gaza and Jericho autonomy talks and for an early deployment of a  Palestinian police force in Gaza.</p>

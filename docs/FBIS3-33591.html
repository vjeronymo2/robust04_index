He did so on a national radio and television  network in the presence of an audience of guests specially  invited by a [word indistinct] polling company for a question  and answer session.    As is his custom, the president presented the law during a  frank dialogue with the Bolivian people and explained the scope  and benefits this law will bring to all municipalities,  communities, and cantons.    [Words indistinct] of the law, he said that it promotes and  consolidates popular participation by incorporating Indian,  peasant, urban, and rural communities in the political and  economic life of the country. This law will likewise improve the  lives of Bolivian men and women with a fairer distribution of  wealth and better administration of public funds. It will  strengthen the political and economic instruments necessary to  improve democracy and will facilitate and make the participation  of the people possible. [recorded passage indistinct]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Li (7115 0500) and Bai Yushan (4101 3768 1472): </F> "Unify Thinking, Heighten the Spirit, Seize the Whole Situation,  Realistically Conduct Work, and Vigorously Create a New  Situation in Propaganda and Ideological Work"]    [Text] The autonomous regional conference of propaganda  and ideological work opened in Hohhot on 2 March and Wang Qun,  secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, delivered  an important speech at the conference. He pointed out: We  should earnestly study and implement the spirit of the national  conference of propaganda and ideological work, further unify our  spirit, heighten our spirit, seize the whole situation,  realistically conduct work, and vigorously create a new  situation in propaganda and ideological work so as to create a  much better ideological and media environment for the region to  conduct reforms, to achieve development, to maintain stability,  and to continuously boost its undertakings of reforms, opening  up, and modernization.    Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee and vice chairman of the autonomous regional people's  government, presided over the conference. Attending the  conference were Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, Wang Zhan, Yang Enbo,  Wuyunqimuge, Wang Duo, Liu Zuohui, Lin Yongsan, Zhang Zuocai, Wu  En, and Yun Zhaoguang.    The speech of Wang Qun is divided into the following three  parts: 1) On the importance of doing a good job in conducting  the propaganda and ideological work in the new historic period.  2) On several tasks for the current propaganda and ideological  work. 3) On the enhancement of the party's leadership over the  propaganda and ideological work.    Wang Qun said: The fundamental guideline and major tasks put  forward at the recent national conference of propaganda and  ideological work have the distinctive characteristics of the age  and represent a major and important policy decision made by the  CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core for  implementing the principle of "building the two civilizations  simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them," and a  strategic arrangement for ensuring victorious progress in  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Successfully  implementing the spirit of the national conference by bearing in  mind the region's reality has a great, important, and practical  significance on implementing the work guideline made by the CPC  Central Committee with regard to "seizing the opportunity,  deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development,  and maintaining stability;" on promoting the region's programs  of reform, development, and stability; on training from  generation to generation new successors with ideals, morality,  cultural knowledge, and the sense of abiding by the discipline;  on consolidating and developing socialist nationalities'  relationship; and on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    Wang Qun said: In carrying out the grand cause of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, the propaganda and  ideological front occupies an important position and is assuming  the important tasks of providing spiritual motive force,  ideological guarantee, and intellectual support for the cause.  Enhancing the propaganda and ideological work has a specially  important significance on the autonomous region. First, the  region is located in the border area and its economy and culture  are relatively backward. Its ideology is more or less of  closed-door style and its tasks for reform and economic  development are very heavy. Tasks for the region to emancipate  minds and shift its concepts are more arduous than those of  other provinces and regions. Second, 1994 will be the year in  which China will issue most measures for reforms. Therefore,  difficulties encountered by the region will be large and many.  In particular, the people in Inner Mongolia that is being  restricted by various conditions will become relatively weak in  bearing the pressure of reforms and encounter much more  ideological problems. Third, Inner Mongolia is a place to  exercise the regional national autonomy as well as the key  target of the disintegration strategy of today's hostile  international forces. Under such a new situation and new task,  we must all the more attach importance on propaganda and  ideological work. Propaganda and ideological work must be  improved and enhanced without any degree of weakening or  stagnation.    Wang Qun fully affirmed the achievements scored by Inner  Mongolia in propaganda and ideological work, and, meanwhile,  pointed out the shortcomings of the work. He said: To actually  strengthen propaganda and ideological work, we should pay  attention to the following three issues in understanding and  practice: 1) Firmly embracing the concept of paying attention  to both economic construction and political and ideological  work; 2) profoundly understanding the idea that the "most  serious mistake lies in education," and strengthening the sense  of hardship; and 3) conscientiously implementing the measure of  "being tough with both economic construction and political and  ideological work."    Wang Qun pointed out: At present and in the future, the  fundamental tasks of the region's propaganda and ideological  work are: Closely around the overall situation of "reform,  development, unity, and stability," we should arm the masses  with the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, spread propaganda among the masses with the  party's basic line, principles, and policies, educate the masses  with patriotic, collective, and socialist ideas, inspire the  masses with the goal of reaching better-off standards of life  and achieving common prosperity, seek unity of ideas among the  masses, fortify the confidence of the masses, make the masses  more united and enthusiastic, mobilize and give full play to the  initiative and creativity of the masses and to their spirit of  pioneering undertakings through hard work, and provide a good  social and public opinion environment as well as a strong and  effective ideological and political guarantee for realizing the  region's fighting goals at two stages.    Wang Qun dwelt on the major tasks for the current propaganda  and ideological work from the following four aspects:    1) We should pay attention to theoretical study to make the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics strike  root in the hearts of the people. Arming cadres and the masses  with the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the most important task for the current  propaganda and ideological work as well as the key to achieve  success in propaganda and ideological work. In theoretical  study, an extremely important work for Inner Mongolia is to arm  the vast numbers of cadres and the masses with the Marxist  concept of nationalities and the party's policy towards  nationalities. Through the realistic, profound, and extensive  education on the theory and policy towards nationalities, we  should strive to firmly grasp the basic viewpoints to clarify  what is right and what is wrong for some major issues and then  to form a common understanding. 2) We should correctly guide  public opinions and gear public opinions to the work of  deepening reform, accelerating development, and safeguarding  stability. Correctly grasping the orientation of public  opinions is aimed at mobilizing the people of all nationalities  to take an active part in reform and the modernization drive.  We should involve all sorts of propaganda means and media and  do a realistic and effective work to propagate and implement  among the masses the party's theory, line, principles, and  policies during the new period, to tell the masses the current  situation and tasks, and to clearly explain to the masses the  new problems and new contradictions emerging in the process of  reform so that we can provide strong and effective ideological  and political guarantee for reform and opening up and can create  a good public opinion environment for developing the economy,  national unity, and social stability. 3) We should pay  attention to ideological education and strive to advocate good  mental outlook and social conduct. The basic purpose of  intensifying ideological education is to train the new people  who have lofty ideals and moral characters and who are better  educated and self-disciplined. The current priority is to  educate the vast number of cadres, the masses, and youths with  the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly as repeatedly  advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong, the spirit of "having lofty  ideals and moral characters and being better educated and  self-disciplined" as repeatedly emphasized by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, and the 64-character pioneering spirit put forward by  Comrade Jiang Zemin so that these kinds of spirit will become  strong spiritual pillars of the endeavor of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the social conduct of the new  period, and so that the erosion of corrupt ideas, such as money  worship, pleasure-seeking, and ultra-individualism, can be more  effectively resisted. 4) We should pay attention to literary and  art creation and provide healthy and rich intellectual products  to the people of various nationalities. In implementing the  guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work  conference, the literary and art front should particularly do a  good job in producing the outstanding literary and art works  that advocate the main melody and reflect regional and national  characteristics. Meanwhile, it should diversify the works to  satisfy the ever growing spiritual and cultural needs of the  people of various nationalities in the region.    Wang Qun pointed out: Now that the major policies for  propaganda and ideological work have been decided on, the key to  the next step of work is to make sure that the guidelines of the  party Central Committee and the autonomous regional party  committee are implemented to the letter at the grass-roots  levels. This requires that party committees at all levels  further strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological  work, firmly hold the initiative in it, and make it more  fruitful through down-to-earth and effective work. First, they  should attach great importance to the party's propaganda and  ideological work and gain the initiative in leading the work.  While giving close attention to and achieving success in  reform, opening up, and economic construction, party committees  at all levels should conscientiously strengthen and improve  leadership over propaganda and ideological work. They should  include the work high in their agenda, conduct study of it on a  regular basis, define the principles, tasks, and focuses of the  work for certain periods, and devote more efforts to helping  propaganda departments discuss and carry out major work and  improve work level. Second, they should change work styles and  pay close attention to implementation of work. Every  department, unit, and comrade of the propaganda and ideological  fronts should vigorously conduct investigation and study and  seek truth from facts in the process of doing specific work.  Third, they should strengthen coordination to rally forces to  create a vivid situation in which the entire party and all  quarters make concerted efforts to attend to propaganda and  ideological work. Fourth, they should emancipate the mind,  deepen reform, and invigorate the development of propaganda and  cultural work. To strengthen party leadership over propaganda  and ideological work, they should adhere to the principle of  reform and, with reform as motivation, promote the entire  propaganda and ideological work to a new level and new stage.  Fifth, they should conscientiously step up efforts to improve  the leading bodies and the personnel of propaganda and  ideological departments. All the leading bodies and cadres of  propaganda and ideological work departments should maintain  political unity with the party Central Committee. The key to  improving the personnel lies in improving the leading bodies of  the propaganda and ideological fronts and turning them into  leadership nucleuses that are unified in thinking, pure in party  spirit, high-spirited, united, and truth-seeking. Party  committees and governments at all levels should show concern for  the comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts in their  political activities, thinking, work, and life and enable them  to better develop their talents and continuously make new  contributions.    In conclusion, Wang Qun pointed out: Establishment of the  socialist market economy system and the new situation and new  tasks in attaining the two-stage targets defined by the  autonomous regional party committee have set new and still  higher demands on propaganda and ideological work and have also  provided a broad room for the development of propaganda and  ideological work. All leading cadres of the party and all  comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts should bravely  shoulder the heavy responsibility entrusted them by this era,  uplift spirit, enhance confidence, willingly work in a  down-to-earth manner, have the courage in innovation, and strive  to create a new situation in Inner Mongolia's propaganda and  ideological work.    Present at the conference were deputy secretaries of league  and city party committees who were in charge of propaganda and  ideological work; directors of the propaganda departments of  league, city, banner, and county party committees; responsible  comrades of league and city newspapers; directors of the  propaganda departments of large industrial and mining  enterprises and schools of higher learning; responsible comrades  of the departments directly under the region; and relevant  responsible comrades of the Liberation Army and people's armed  police forces. Also present were the comrades attending the  meeting on overseas propaganda, cultural, radio and television,  and publication work; comrades attending the meeting on the  education of party members; and comrades attending the advanced  study class of the autonomous regional party school for leading  cadres of leagues, cities, departments, and bureaus.    At a preparatory meeting held on the evening of 1 March,  Wang  Zhan, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee, gave a speech on the tasks, content, procedures, and  requirements of the conference. Comrade Wuyunqimuge chaired the  preparatory meeting.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Green Germany drags Brussels into environmental arena YESTERDAY'S French government proposals inject a potent factor into EC policy-making on the environment. The packaging industry and several national governments have been concerned to prevent the European Commission from modelling its forthcoming directive on recycling of packaging too closely on Germany's radical legislation outlined last autumn. The hostile reaction yesterday to the French proposals from Incpen, the council representing more than 60 international packaging groups, indicates the gulf between industry and governments which now appears to be opening up. Officials in Brussels see environmental legislation as possibly the most difficult example of framing common rules to bridge the Community's north-south gap. Measures in this field must encompass both the concerns of the rich, 'green' northern countries, such as Germany and Denmark, and those of poorer southern countries seeking to catch up with northern living standards which see much EC environmental law as an expensive obstacle. Unless this circle is squared, achieving a common policy will be difficult. Proliferating national laws on the environment could, Commission officials fear, erect new barriers to competition and trade within the single market. The German packaging law has already raised complaints that products from elsewhere in the EC will face discrimination inside Germany, and that the sheer volume of recycled packaging will overflow German borders to stifle efforts by its neighbours to get recycling schemes under way. Yet the latest versions of Brussels' long-delayed plans - still to be approved by the Commission, much less passed into law by the 12 - are less exacting than Germany's rigid standards. Officials say plans now aim to ensure that, within 10 years, 90 per cent of all packaging is reused, recycled or burnt for energy, and at least 60 per cent would have to be reused or recycled. Earlier drafts set targets of 60 per cent overall 'recovery' of the waste and 40 per cent recycling, but over five years. It also now seems unlikely that Brussels will press for an EC levy on packaging to help fund recycling. The drive for tough waste and recycling standards is one sign of the environmental pressure emanating from Germany, which is well ahead of the rest of Europe in this field. The west of the country alone produces an annual 80m tonnes of industrial waste, and up to 40m tonnes of household rubbish. Britain, by contrast, is taking a totally different approach to Germany on waste disposal, based on deregulation rather than new legal measures. The Environmental Protection Act lays down that local authorities can no longer run a waste disposal site and regulate it as well. The functions are separated and the authorities have to set up companies that operate at arms length to dispose of waste. In fact, many will be putting out the work to the private sector. A much more vigorous approach has been adopted by Bonn. In the past year, Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, has introduced a series of initiatives to force German industry to recover and re-use or re-process increasing proportions of waste. By 1995, German industry will have to collect 80 per cent of all plastic waste produced, and recycle 80 per cent of that. Similar targets have been set for board and paper packages, and higher standards still for glass, tin-plate and aluminium. Last summer, Mr Topfer produced further plans for manufacturers to take back used cars and household electronic appliances. In the autumn, he proposed a new rubbish surcharge of up to an annual DM10 (Pounds 3.40) per head, with special charges of up to DM200 per tonne for industrial waste. In December, he introduced minimum quotas for re-usable bottles for drinks, and for re-usable packaging to put them in. At the heart of the recycling effort is the so-called 'green spot' system, called Duales System Deutschland (DSD), set up by 440 companies to establish the infrastructure needed to recover and re-use packaging waste. Companies pay the DSD to have a green spot attached to their products, showing that they can be returned and re-used. The money charged is supposed to pay for the cost of running the scheme. Ironically, the greatest outcry has come not from German industry, but from foreign companies, fearing they will be disadvantaged on the German market without green spot packaging. Latest reports suggest that the scheme is not working as well as intended, because of a lack of recycling facilities to receive the packaging. More than 3,000 companies have signed up to put the spots on some 6bn packages since the scheme came into effect last autumn. By the end of 1992, the number is supposed to have increased tenfold.</p>

Each of the branch lines acquired by AMR extends from the same North/South UP line in central Arkansas. On one of the branch lines, the Norman Branch, there are five active shippers (International Paper Company, Gifford-Hill &amp; Company, Barksdale Lumber Company, Bean Lumber Company, and G&amp;S Roofing Products Company, Inc.), and one inactive shipper (Cargill). The Norman Branch extends approximately 52.9 miles from its connection with UP at Gurdon, AR, to the end of the line at Birds Mill, AR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 15, 1993, the AMR embargoed 31 miles of the Norman Branch line from Pikes Junction to Birds Mill as a result of storm damage. This embargo affected Barksdale Lumber, Bean Lumber, and G&amp;S Roofing. On February 22, 1994, AMR embargoed approximately 17 additional miles of the line, which affected service to Gifford Hill &amp; Company located at Delight, AR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 28, 1994, the Commission issued Service Order No. 1516 for 30 days pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11123 (a), authorizing the Dardanelle &amp; Russellville Railroad Company (DRRC) and its newly formed non-carrier subsidiary, the Caddo, Antoine, Little Missouri Railroad Company (CALM) to operate approximately 49 miles of the AMR Norman Branch line currently under embargo. The Order also authorized DRRC/CALM to utilize trackage rights over approximately 3 miles of the remaining portion of the Norman Branch, which AMR continues to operate, in order to reach a connection with the Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Effective Date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Supplemental Order No. 1 to Directed Service Order No. 1516 shall become effective at 11:59 p.m., April 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Expiration Date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unless otherwise modified by order of the Commission, Directed Service Order No. 1516, as amended, will expire at 11:59 p.m., October 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Bernard Gaillard (202) 927&hyph;5500 or Melvin F.

AMR has indicated that it is willing to allow continued operations by DRRC/CALM over the Norman Branch line under the Terms and Conditions contained herein. DRRC/CALM has expressed a willingness to rehabilitate the line to the extent necessary and to provide service to shippers and to continue its operations. AMR and DRRC/CALM have agreed amongst themselves as to the terms of the trackage rights arrangement. Based upon these circumstances and the statutory requirements, an emergency service order under 49 U.S.C. 11123 continues to be appropriate, and is responsive to the shippers' service needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of the need for continued rail service over AMR's Norman Branch, and DRRC/CALM's willingness to provide this service and limited track rehabilitation, this decision grants the requests of interested parties for interim service authority to DRRC/CALM on the Terms and Conditions noted below for a period of 180 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The emergency nature of the situation compels us to conclude that advance public notice and hearings would be impractical and contrary to the immediate public interest, and that the modified hearing procedure conducted during the order's initial 30-day term satisfied the statutory hearing requirement at 49 U.S.C. 11123(a)(2). Accordingly, we exercise our authority under 49 U.S.C. 11123(a)(1) to waive further advance public notice in the present circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

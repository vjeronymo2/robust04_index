			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal differs from the current &sect;65.101 in the language of paragraph (a)(6). The proposal would not only require an applicant for an aviation repair specialist certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English language, as is currently required, but also would require the applicant to demonstrate this knowledge by reading and explaining appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect and repair statements. The proposal also differs from the current section in that it would eliminate the issuance of certificates to individuals who cannot meet this requirement and who are employed solely outside the United States by a certificated U.S. repair station, a certificated U.S. commercial operator, or a certificated U.S. air carrier. The language in this portion of the proposed rule corresponds with the language proposed in &sect;66.71(a)(2), which similarly amends the eligibility requirements for the aviation maintenance technician certificate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal adds to this section paragraph (c), which establishes the equivalency of the current repairman certificate and the proposed aviation repair specialist certificate. The proposal also provides for the exchange of corresponding certificates and ratings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 66.103, 66.104, 66.105 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed &sect;&sect;66.103, 66.104, and 66.105 are based on current &sect;&sect;65.103, 65.104, and 66.105, respectively. These sections refer to aviation repair specialist certificate privileges and limitations, the experimental aircraft builder privileges and limitations, and the display of certificates, respectively. There are no substantive differences between these proposed sections for Part 66 and current corresponding sections in Part 65. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements in the proposed amendment to Part 65 and the newly established Part 66 have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1990 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2120&hyph;0022. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations and maintain current regulations only if they are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by a ``compelling public need.'' The order also requires that agencies assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and select the alternative that maximizes the net benefits and imposes the least burden on society. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the order requires agencies to submit a list of all rules, except those specifically exempted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) because they respond to emergency situations or other narrowly defined exigencies, to determine whether any rule is a ``significant regulatory action.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Significant regulatory action'' means an action that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. A ``significant regulatory action'' is submitted for centralized regulatory review by OIRA. OIRA and the FAA have determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section contains the benefits and costs analyzed in the preliminary regulatory evaluation. In addition, it includes an initial regulatory flexibility determination required by the 1980 Regulatory Flexibility Act and an international trade impact assessment. The complete regulatory evaluation, which contains more detailed economic information that this summary provides, is available in the docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule change would revise the regulations that prescribe the certification and training requirements for mechanics and repairmen. The proposal would enhance the professionalism of the aviation maintenance workforce by expanding the means for aviation maintenance personnel to satisfy training, experience, and currency requirements. Employers would also benefit from the increased supply of potential employees who are expected to maintain their currency because of the wider range of options for achieving this objective that would be permitted under the proposal. Another benefit for employers is expected to be an increase in the quality of new hires, thereby lessening the need for initial training to assure that these employees have basic skills and knowledge. Recurrent training is also expected to assist aviation maintenance personnel in staying abreast of the rapid changes in technology that are expected to occur. The expected magnitude of these benefits cannot be quantified with any certainty, however, because of their intangible nature. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only one of the provisions would impose significant costs on the industry. This provision would require mechanics who use their certificates for compensation or hire to receive refresher or requalification training. At present, certified mechanics working under Parts 121, 127, and 135 and &sect;145.2(a) must be fully informed about procedures, techniques, and new equipment in use through participation in maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs. These mechanics are, therefore, already in compliance with the proposed rule. This proposed requirement for recurrent training would primarily affect those mechanics who work on general aviation aircraft rather than aircraft used by the air carriers. The FAA estimates that this proposed rule would affect from 14,000 to 23,000 mechanics of a total workforce of about 145,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Taking an Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) refresher courts, an inspection authorization refresher course, or a series of such courses that are acceptable to the Administrator, would satisfy the requirements of this proposed rule. However, the course or courses taken within a 2-year time period must consist of a total of not less than 16 hours of instruction. This training may be broad based or narrowly focused but must be acceptable to the Administrator. For example, courses dealing with general maintenance practices of regulations applicable to maintenance operations as well as equipment-specific training would be acceptable. Some home study or video courses may also be acceptable for fulfilling this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that the total expected cost of recurrent training over a 10-year period would range between $37.28 million and $66.53 million on an undiscounted basis and between $25.94 million and $46.48 million on a discounted basis. The midpoints of these ranges are $51.91 million (undiscounted) and $36.21 million (discounted). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bulk of the expected benefits are expected to accrue from productivity gains. Productivity is expected to increase because recurrent training in troubleshooting techniques or general maintenance practices should reduce the amount of time required to diagnose problems and lower the incidence of unnecessary repairs, which inflate repair costs. The lack of information regarding the prevalence of inefficient or ineffective repairs makes it difficult to project the potential magnitude of the benefits expected to result from this factor. The adoption of the conservative assumption that productivity would increase by only .5 percent per year, however, would result in an annualized benefit range (undiscounted) of $4.17 million to $6.39 million, the midpoint of which ($5.28 million) would exceed the expected magnitude of undiscounted annual costs, making the rule change cost beneficial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

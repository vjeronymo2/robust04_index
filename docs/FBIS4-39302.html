			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- Relations between Cyprus and  Russia were described as spiritual, as rooted in history, by  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and head of the Foreign  Ministry of the Republic of Cyprus Alexandros Mikhailidhis at a  news conference in Moscow on Monday following the negotiations  between the two delegations. The foreign ministers pointed out  the warmth of relations between the two countries. Mikhailidhis  is on an official visit in Russia.    Kozyrev pointed out the importance of contacts with  representatives of Cyprus, a Mediterranean country, where Russia  has "economic and political interests". Russia is interested in  an earlier settlement of the Cyprus problem on a basis of the  United Nations resolutions with taking into account territorial  integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus, Kozyrev said. He said that  new approaches to the situation in Cyprus and in the region,  especially after the recent report on Cyprus by U.N.  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had been discussed during  the negotiations. "We have coordinated plans for further steps  with taking into account the role of Russia, permanent member of  the U.N. Security Council", the Russian ministry said. There  was also exchange of opinions on interaction of the two states  in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe and the United Nations where the stances of the  parties coincide. Kozyrev noted that the visit by the Cyprus  foreign minister will promote further development of economic,  tourist and other ties which will help speed up the working out  of an agreement of visa-free visits by citizens of the two  countries.    In his turn Mikhailidhis pointed to an important stage of  the  settlement of the Cyprus problem that resulted from the  occupation of the northern part of the insular state over 20  years [ago]. He described the report by Butrus-Ghali as a  manifestation of concern of the world community over the lack of  progress in the Cyprus settlement because of the lack of  political will of the Turkish side. He said the document is of  huge importance for Cyprus as the 35-thousand strong Turkish  military corps with heavy arms is still in the north of the  island and 90 thousand Turkish settlers live there, which  interferes with the demographic structure of the Cyprus  population. "This is the essence of the Cyprus problem", he  said.    "The dialogue with Russia will continue", Mikhailidhis said.  "We rely on friendship with Russia, noting specifically Russia's  important role as permanent member of the United Nations  Security Council and the experience of Russian diplomats in the  Cyprus problem. Cyprus strives for closer cooperation with  Russia in every area, also through CSCE, the United Nations and  soon, I believe, in the Council of Europe", Mikhailidhis said.    The ministers signed a protocol on mutual consultations  between the foreign ministries of the two countries. The Cyprus  minister meets on Monday with leaders of the State Duma and with  Patriarch Aleksiy the Second of Moscow and All Russia.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS FIGHT GOES TO THE PEOPLE  </P> <P> The debate last week on the proposed City of Los Angeles Ethics Act was  unfortunate and disappointing not only because of its result but also because  of its tone and style.  </P> <P> As drafted by an independent commission of distinguished private citizens named  by Mayor Tom Bradley, and agreed to in a slightly revised form by the City  Council's own ad hoc ethics committee, the proposal would have put before the  people of Los Angeles council-crafted charter amendments giving the city tough  new conflict-of-interest regulations and partial public financing of political  campaigns. Together, these steps would have put Los Angeles in the vanguard of  a burgeoning political reform movement that already has enacted such ordinances  in cities like Seattle and New York.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the council majority's decision to kill public financing and to  subject what remained of the proposal to more than 50 amendments left the  ethics act, in the apt description of Councilman Michael Woo, "gutted." Almost  as regrettable was the council's rather mean-spirited discussion of the issue  and its elimination of public financing through an act of parliamentary sleight  of hand that protected the majority from having to declare itself in a simple  "yes-no" vote. These actions introduced a new rancor and furtiveness into a  process heretofore characterized by openness, conciliation and constructive  compromise.  </P> <P> A quick summary of what the council did gives a flavor of the process: It  rejected public financing of campaigns; deprived the proposed city ethics  commission of fiscal independence of the council; narrowed the circumstances in  which a special prosecutor could be appointed, and generally weakened  prohibitions against gifts, honorariums and outside income. On the other hand,  the majority did vote to place on the ballot a charter amendment raising  council members' pay; it imposed new financial disclosure rules on private  citizens seeking to recall incumbent council members, and it voted to extend  its authority over eight city departments, commissions and boards that are  currently protected against council intervention.  </P> <P> When the Ethics Act was put before the council last week, the issue was clear  enough: Either the lawmakers could restore city government to a basic integrity  people could rely on, or the people would have to do it themselves through the  initiative process. Members of the mayor's ethics commission are now drafting a  proposal that will put the key provisions of the original Ethics Act, including  public financing of campaigns, before the voters in November.  </P> <P> The situation created by the council's failure in this matter is precisely what  the initiative process was designed to redress. Some questions of governance  simply are too important to be left to government to decide. The integrity of  the political process itself is one of them. Since the council has declined to  put self-interest aside, the people of Los Angeles have no choice but to make  the cause of ethical reform their own.  </P></p>

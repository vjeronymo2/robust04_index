			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS OK SUPER PRESIDENCY;  </P> <P> SWEEPING VICTORY FOR GORBACHEV  </P> <P> Mikhail S. Gorbachev won a decisive victory today when the Soviet parliament  approved his plans to create a powerful executive presidency and also to end  the Communist Party's 72-year monopoly on power.  </P> <P> The opposition had predicted a very close vote but the Congress passed the  presidential measure by a vote of 1,817 to 133, with 61 abstentions. A  two-thirds majority of the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies was  required for the motion to pass.  </P> <P> The presidency bill creates a chief executive who can propose legislation, veto  laws passed by the Supreme Soviet legislature, declare war or martial law and  overrule Cabinet members. Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov said it also clearly  separates executive and legislative powers for the first time.  </P> <P> The parliament routed opponents of the new presidency, who feared that it might  lead to the re-establishment of a Stalin-like dictatorship.  </P> <P> "We are standing before the greatest, most meaningful step in the history of  our government," Gorbachev told the parliament.  </P> <P> "This is the first step toward a Western political system," Deputy Fyodor  Burlatsky said.  </P> <P> Later today, the deputies were expected to nominate Gorbachev to a four-year  term as president, then decide whether the Congress or the public would elect  the new president.  </P> <P> It is expected that after the initial four years, the term will become five  years and the president would be popularly elected.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has argued that the more powerful presidency is needed to keep the  Soviet Union intact as he presses ahead with his reforms while facing a  crumbling economy and growing independence movements.  </P> <P> Lithuanians had been so dismayed by the proposal on the more powerful  presidency that they rushed to declare independence before it passed on Sunday.  Estonia, Latvia and Georgia have all taken moves in that direction.  </P> <P> To succeed today, Gorbachev backed off some demands that had disturbed  legislators from some republics, who believed that he would have too much  power. Those demands included the president's right to declare on his own a  state of emergency and to suspend the parliaments of the republics.  </P> <P> Lukyanov said the bill allows Congress to recall the president for breaking the  law and restricts the passage of legislation to the Congress and the Supreme  Soviet, the standing legislature.  </P> <P> The vote on scrapping the party's leading role passed in the Congress by a vote  of 1,771 to 164, with 74 abstentions.  </P> <P> The historic change in Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution drops language  defining the Communist Party as the "leading and guiding force of Soviet  society and the nucleus of its political system, of all state organizations and  public organizations."  </P> <P> The new article reads, "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, other party,  trade union and youth organizations, other social organizations and mass  movements, shall participate, through their representatives elected to the  Soviets of People's Deputies as well as in other ways, in shaping the policies  of the Soviet state and in running the state and social affairs."  </P></p>

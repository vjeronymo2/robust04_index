			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Leading Article: G7's Russian roulette A NEW US administration, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's referendum victory, and the messy disintegration of Yugoslavia, appear to have persuaded the G7 that last year's charade cannot be repeated: Russia's reformers need aid and they need it soon. But no western government can be under any illusion. The game is worth playing, but the risks are high. The G7 feels brave enough at last to leap over the International Monetary Fund's orthodoxy and recognise that western aid is a precondition for Russian reform, not a reward. To demand tight budget discipline and low inflation before aid is released, as the IMF did last year, is to risk mass bankruptcy and social unrest. Such a strategy was more likely to impede, rather than speed, the process of privatisation and democratisation in Russia. In the event, it was never tried. Handing over billions of dollars in budget support to a Russian government which, after 18 months of reform, still allows an inflation rate of 20 per cent a month, or more, is a gamble. Handing aid to a government that has still not swung decisively behind stabilisation, over two weeks after a referendum endorsing the president and his policies, is bound to look foolhardy. Yet if there is even a chance of promoting reform and enabling the government to establish financial discipline, the west must grasp it. For it cannot be denied that Russia is special by virtue of its strategic importance. Moreover, the risks of a collapse of reform are great, while the obstacles to economic change - the distorted state of industry and the lack of a technically sophisticated bureaucracy - will take time to remove. It is regrettable that the G7 has chosen to jeopardise the reputations of both the IMF and the World Bank in the process. Both are now bound to lend on terms much looser than they would choose, primarily because G7 governments prefer to hide their expenditures behind an institutional smokescreen. A second Marshall Fund - run, but not funded by the IMF and the Bank - would have been preferable. The G7 owes it to the international institutions, as well as to western taxpayers, to ensure that the minimum standards it sets will be rigidly enforced. Western budget support should be provided on a monthly basis. IMF officials must be stationed within the central bank to ensure that aid is halted if ceilings on credit creation are exceeded. The G7 should also encourage systemic change by biasing aid towards privatised companies. It should ensure that general budget subsidies are cut, while specific subsidies to state enterprises are time-limited and tied to restructuring. Last year's response to Russian pleas for help was torpid. But the G7's new activity is a gamble. The onus now shifts to the Russian government to show that it is, and remains, serious about reform.</p>

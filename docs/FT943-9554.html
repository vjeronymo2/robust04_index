			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: ISDA forms disclosure guidelines committee The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the derivatives industry's trade body, has set up a new committee to develop disclosure guidelines for financial instruments, including derivative instruments. The committee aims to prepare a preliminary report on disclosure by the end of the year, according to Ms Gay Evans, chairman of ISDA and a managing director of Bankers Trust International. 'Since a 'derivatives only' approach to disclosure conveys an incomplete and potentially misleading view of a company's credit or market exposure, disclosure should cover both derivatives and related cash positions,' she said. Ms Gay warned that 'squeezing derivatives into an existing accounting framework', as most accounting guidelines have tried to do, can create a distorted picture. The need to increase disclosure of derivatives activities has been highlighted in a number of recent studies, in particular in a report earlier this year by the US General Accounting Office. ISDA's entry into the debate, and efforts by a number of US institutions to expand their reporting of derivatives, is part of industry efforts to help shape any new requirements for disclosing derivatives, and perhaps forestall the imposition of even tougher rules. The new committee is headed by Mr Brian Crowe, senior vice-president at Chase Manhattan in London, and Ms Hannah Sorscher, vice-president at Citibank in the US, both of whom are ISDA directors.</p>

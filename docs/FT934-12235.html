			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ferranti tumbles The announcement that troubled defence electronics group Ferranti International was in talks that might lead to a bid for it at one penny a share saw the stock undergo a dramatic 73 per cent slump amid record turnover. Although the mid-afternoon news had long been mooted in the market, it nevertheless took dealers by surprise and the group immediately dived 6 3/4 to 2 1/2 p, as volume soared to a hefty 38.9m. The company did not disclose its likely bidder but many in the market pointed the finger at defence electronics group GEC, with one market watcher saying: 'GEC is the most obvious candidate for a rescue. There is no doubt that a rescue is what it would be. We shall now wait to see what can be salvaged from this sorry tale.' There was also a feeling in some quarters that the UK government may be playing a part in brokering an agreement between Ferranti and its suitor. Other candidates mentioned included French defence electronics group Thomson CSF. GEC shed a penny to 341p in trading of 4.9m.</p>

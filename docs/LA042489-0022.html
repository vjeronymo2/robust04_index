			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MT. SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE RELAYS;  </P> <P> BURRELL RUNS 20.40, FASTEST 200 OF YEAR  </P> <P> As sprinter Leroy Burrell settled into the starting blocks for the 200 meter  dash at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays on Sunday, he looked to his left.  </P> <P> Burrell, a junior at the University of Houston, couldn't help noticing Danny  Everett, the Olympic bronze medalist in the 400, who was dropping down to the  200.  </P> <P> "I wasn't really focused on beating Danny," Burrell said. "I was focusing on  running my race."  </P> <P> Burrell ran his race well.  </P> <P> Burrell burst out of the blocks, ran a strong curve and maintained his lead in  the straightaway. Burrell was clocked in 20.40 seconds, fastest time in the  world this year, in beating Everett.  </P> <P> "I'm happy I won the race," Burrell said. "And I'm happy to have beaten someone  of Everett's caliber."  </P> <P> Everett, who was left in the blocks, was timed in 20.53, fifth fastest time in  the world this year.  </P> <P> Everett, who said his legs were tired, got out of the blocks so slowly that it  looked as if he was waiting for a recall.  </P> <P> What happened?  </P> <P> "That's the curse of me not really training for the 200," Everett said. "Once I  get into the rhythm of the race I can try to make up the ground I lost coming  out of the blocks, but it doesn't always work out that way."  </P> <P> It didn't work out that way Sunday.  </P> <P> Carl Lewis was among the first to congratulate Burrell, who plopped down on a  milk crate to catch his breath after the race.  </P> <P> Lewis is an assistant coach at the University of Houston, where he trains with  Burrell.  </P> <P> Was Lewis surprised by Burrell's strong showing?  </P> <P> "I'm not surprised at how well he (Burrell) did," Lewis said. "I've been  talking about Leroy for years. I think he's one of the great sprinter/jumpers.  I'm not surprised at anything he does.  </P> <P> "I see him train every day and he's very talented. He's the best sprinter in  the NCAA and one of the greatest in the world right now."  </P> <P> Burrell said Lewis has been an inspiration. Like Joe DeLoach, gold medalist in  the 200 meters at Seoul who blossomed after training with Lewis, Burrell is  learning from Lewis.  </P> <P> Burrell, 22, a high school sprint star in Philadelphia, said he enrolled at  Houston because he wanted to train with Lewis.  </P> <P> What quality does Burrell admire in Lewis?  </P> <P> "His mental focus," Burrell said. "One thing that I learned from Carl is that  you've got to be driven. When you look at Carl, you see he's so driven in  whatever he does."  </P> <P> Like Lewis, Burrell is a multi-event athlete. Burrell plans to compete in the  100, 200, long jump and 400 meter relay at the National Collegiate Athletic  Assn. championships in June.  </P> <P> What's his favorite event?  </P> <P> "I really can't say," Burrell said. "My best event is whatever event I'm  doing."  </P> <P> Burrell's race was the highlight of Sunday's competition. But there were other  outstanding performances on the final day of the 31st annual meet.  </P> <P>  -- After failing to break the world record in the 800-meter relay because of  an awkward handoff on Saturday, the Santa Monica Track Club recovered to run  the fastest time in the world this year in the 400-meter relay, 38.63 seconds.  It was also a meet and stadium record.  </P> <P> Lewis, who decided to run the anchor leg after Saturday's disaster, said: "We  ran because yesterday was like a semi-joke."  </P> <P> After being hampered by a poor handoff on the anchor leg Saturday, the Santa  Monica Track Club passed the baton smoothly on Sunday.  </P> <P> After strong opening legs from Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard, Mark Witherspoon  ran an extraordinary third leg to vault his team into the lead. Witherspoon  made a nice pass to Lewis, who held the the lead down the stretch.  </P> <P> "We were not sure until the last minute if we were going to run," Lewis said.  "We're just pleased to get it around the track."  </P> <P> Did Lewis feel vindicated after Saturday's fiasco?  </P> <P> "Yesterday is gone," Lewis said. "That race happened and it's over with. We're  just glad to be able to get around without a major problem today.  </P> <P>  -- The men's and women's discus competition also produced some good marks.  </P> <P> Wolfgang Schmidt of West Germany, former world record holder while competing  for East Germany, threw the discus 219 feet to beat Mac Wilkins, the top-ranked  American in 1988. Wilkins, whose best throw was 210-10, edged Mike Buncic  (209-4).  </P> <P> Schmidt had a good series, getting off throws of 217-8, 214-1 and 213-5.  </P> <P> Laci Barnes won the women's discus with a throw of 198-9, best in the United  States this year.  </P> <P> Track Notes  </P> <P> The University of Florida ran the fastest 1,600-meter relay in America this  year, 3:02.51. Florida's team consisted of Dennis Mitchell, Earl Diamond,  Tyrone Kemp and Mark Everett.  </P></p>

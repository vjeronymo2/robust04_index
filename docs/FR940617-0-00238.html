			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) For nonroad engine manufacturers, nonroad engines manufactured for export purposes are exempt without application, subject to the provisions of &sect;89.909.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) For eligible manufacturers, as determined by &sect;89.906, manufacturer-owned nonroad engines are exempt without application, subject to the provisions of &sect;89.906.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) For any person, display nonroad engines are exempt without application, subject to the provisions of &sect;89.907.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.905  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Testing exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Any person requesting a testing exemption must demonstrate the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance with this section;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of control consonant with the purpose of the test program and EPA's monitoring requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section describe what constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each of the four identified elements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an appropriate purpose would be research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, but not national security. A concise statement of purpose is a required item of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited acts under &sect;89.1003. In appropriate circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, but the cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is not a basis for necessity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable number of engines. In this regard, required items of information include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An estimate of the program's duration, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The maximum number of nonroad engines involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate procedures consistent with the purpose of the test and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of information include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The technical nature of the test;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The site of the test;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The time or mileage duration of the test;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in the test;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The intended final disposition of the engines;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The manner in which the engine identification numbers will be identified, recorded, and made available; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) A manufacturer of new nonroad engines may request a testing exemption to cover nonroad engines intended for use in test programs planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent one-year period. Unless otherwise required by the Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section along with a description of the record-keeping and control procedures that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.906  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Manufacturer-owned exemption and precertification exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any manufacturer-owned nonroad engine, as defined by &sect;89.902, is exempt from &sect;89.1003, without application, if the manufacturer complies with the following terms and conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

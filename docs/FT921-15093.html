			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (6): Breathing space after a rough ride - Profile, Continental THE managers of Continental, the German tyre company which is the fourth largest in the world, breathed a huge, collective sigh of relief late last year. Its unwanted suitor, Italy's Pirelli, finally went away after a 14-month campaign aimed firstly at persuading the company and its shareholders to agree to merge and, when that did not work, to enter into a co-operation agreement. Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, Continental's chief executive, did not crow about its successful fight to remain independent. If Pirelli itself had not fallen into financial difficulties, some form of co-operation could well have been agreed. But he did make clear that the way was now open for the German company to concentrate on its own homework, namely eliminating losses, raising efficiency, and speeding up the pace of innovation. After carrying the costs of closing down a loss-making plant in Canada, acquired when it purchased General Tire of the US in 1987, and after setting aside funds for future restructuring, it made a loss in 1991. But it expects to return to profit this year. In 1990, net income slumped by 59 per cent to DM93m (Dollars 59m) and the dividend was halved. No dividend will be paid on last year's result. In view of the rough ride that all tyremakers have suffered, it is hardly surprising that Continental had an uncomfortable slide down the FT500 list. From 301st place in the previous year, it went to number 377. Part of the problem is the dire state of the US market, where recession has blighted demand for new cars. Tyre companies have suffered accordingly. Continental bought General Tire of the US in 1987 to expand its international spread. But because of the weakness of the US automotive industry, GT now makes heavy losses, likely to exceed Dollars 100m in the past year. Mr von Grunberg stressed after Pirelli's withdrawal that turning round GT was a top priority. The German company hopes break-even point can be reached for the US subsidiary in 1993, with GT emerging into the profit zone towards the end of that year. But before that, Continental should benefit from an improvement in Europe. Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker, sees a good chance of better times. 'As a result of cost-cutting and a more disciplined approach to prices, at least for replacement tyres, margins in the European tyre industry will improve considerably in 1992 and 1993.' This will also be pleasant news for rivals such as Michelin of France, now the biggest tyre group in the world with its US interests. It gained 57 places in the FT500 list and now ranks 210th. Sales of winter tyres, in which Continental is strong, have risen by more than a fifth this season; the company has also been able to raise prices. Led by Michelin, the industry has raised prices of replacement tyres generally by around 10 per cent in the past year. But the companies are still subject to an intense squeeze from the motor producers on new vehicle, or original equipment, business. Tyremakers are not earning money on this, with prices down by more than 30 per cent over the past four years. Thus for Continental and its rivals, the going will remain bumpy, though the bumps may start to flatten out.</p>

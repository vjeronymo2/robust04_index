			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Electoral reform hanging in the balance / Assessing the chances of Japan's premier in an upper house parliamentary vote Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister, faces a daunting task this week as he struggles to overcome last-minute obstacles to parliamentary agreement on plans to reform Japan's discredited political and electoral system. The outcome of the upper house vote hangs in the balance, a new experience for Japanese politicians, used to pre-cooking important decisions well in advance. 'I can't tell what will happen until the very end,' Mr Hosokawa said on Friday. Political observers think the seven-party coalition will probably win by a narrow margin, accelerating the upheaval in national politics which began with the collapse last summer of the Liberal Democratic party government. But Mr Hosokawa will have to work overtime to garner the votes needed. The coalition was aiming for a plenary session vote on Wednesday, the final stage before the four bills become law. But procedural delays and splits in its own camp have now forced the coalition tentatively to aim for a vote in the upper house political reform committee at mid-week, paving the way for a plenary vote by Friday. Mr Hosokawa's fortunes have fluctuated almost by the hour during a hectic past week of political activity. If Mr Hosokawa fails to get agreement by January 29, the end of the parliamentary session, he is likely to resign and call a snap general election. Urgent plans to stimulate the economy are stalled as a helpless finance ministry waits on the sidelines for parliament to complete its unpredictable business. This makes a bewildering change from the days of the LDP, when important decisions were prepared in an orderly manner, by committee, and parliament tended not to produce late problems, lamented one official. The lower house passed the political reform bills by a bigger than expected margin two months ago, indicating that all was clear for an accord in the upper house, the final hurdle. In theory, the coalition can count on 131 upper house votes, five more than the 126 needed for a simple majority in the 151-seat chamber. But the voting arithmetic is complicated by the growing number of dissidents on both sides of the house. The coalition's upper house majority is half the size of that in the lower house, making it all the more vulnerable to defections. On the government side, the unity of the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, is shaky, despite a pledge of loyalty to the coalition from the socialists' convention last week. Coalition officials believe five or more socialists might cross the floor and vote against the government, driven by fears that their party will do even worse under the new electoral system - a mixture of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation - than under the present, multi-seat constituency system. Senior coalition officials are working hard to try to pull the potential socialist rebels and undecided independents into line. Until recently, Mr Hosokawa thought he could count on the support of a little known upper house group, the Niin Club, five populist members led by a professional comedian, Mr Yukio Aoshima. That was until late last week, when Mr Aoshima indicated that the club might side with the opposition, through annoyance at the way in which the government was trying to steamroller reform through parliament. Yet the opposition LDP is also divided. LDP members have been instructed to vote against the bills, reflecting older politicians' fears that reform spells the end of their comfortable careers. But the LDP gave its leaders clearance on Friday to negotiate a compromise with Mr Hosokawa, so the opposition could change its mind at the last minute. To achieve this, Mr Hosokawa would have to offer compromises that might offend the Socialists, so the chances are slight. Even if the LDP does oppose the bills, as it did in the lower house, there will be defections. An estimated nine LDP upper house members are said to be ready to vote for the reform bills, which would nearly make up for the socialist defections and the unexpected opposition from the Niin Club. When asked to guess the outcome on instinct, political observers point out that the LDP does not want to damage its already weak popularity by being seen to destroy political reform, for which Mr Hosokawa has a strong public mandate. The LDP's finances are in no shape to fight a quick election. On top of this, the socialists are keen to retain their first experience of power for 45 years, if only because recent polls indicate they would fare badly in an election.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        A JAPANESE CLIFFHANGER  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Predicted vote in 251-seat upper house                (number who could vote against own party)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PRO-REFORM                            ANTI-REFORM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Government parties                    Opposition parties Social Democratic       73 (5-15)     Liberal Democratic     99 (3-9) Clean Government        24                                       Japan Communist        11 Japan New,                            Niin Club               5 Japan Renewal, Democratic Reform       23 Democratic Socialist    11 (3)   Total coalition      131 (8-18) Independents             5 (2) Total                  136 (10-20)     Total                115 (3-9)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Yomiuri Shimbun  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

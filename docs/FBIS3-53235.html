GPC sources said yesterday that a military  transport plane arrived in Aden the night before last and again  last night and was parked in the military section of the airport  where it unloaded its cargo, and that a cargo ship was anchored  at some distance from the coast and its cargo was being  transported to the shore by small cargo boats.    In reply, a YSP spokesman said that these "rumors are part  of  a campaign to poison the dialogue atmosphere and distort the  YSP's efforts to end the country's crisis." He added that the  aim "is to conceal the military movements of the other party  which has intensified its arms import operations through  Djibouti to al-Mukha port."    This comes as the "National Dialogue Committee for resolving  the Yemeni crisis" is preparing to announce the results achieved  today. Observers fear that the committee may have reached a  dead end after weeks of discussions in Sanaa and Aden despite  the fact that a subcommittee has redrafted the final paper on  the basis for building the state, combining the proposals  approved by the members of the tripartite ruling coalition (the  GPC, the YSP, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG]), in addition  to the opposition's National Bloc. [passage omitted]    Dialogue Committee sources have expressed pessimism about  the  possibility of finding solutions acceptable to all parties  because of the sensitive nature of the YSP's demands. They  added that if no such solutions are achieved then the committee  would divulge to the Yemeni people all the phases it passed  through, reveal the secret issues, and expose the party which  caused the failure of the dialogue. Other sources, however, are  optimistic. They say that matters were proceeding "contrary to  people's expectations." They emphasized that if the proposals  -- which are opposed by the GPC and the YRG -- are approved then  the leaders of the parties would be called to an urgent meeting  to sign the agreement documents which would include formation of  a government of national accord to implement what was agreed and  to prepare for new elections within a period not exceeding two  years.

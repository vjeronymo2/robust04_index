			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 17 (XINHUA) -- About half the  state-owned enterprises in northeast China's Liaoning Province,  which is heavily industrialized, have begun to make profits  after reforms and technical renovations were carried out.    Sources from the Liaoning Provincial Planning Committee said  that 500 out of the 600 enterprises that have adopted new  management systems have improved their economic efficiency.    Last year, profits achieved by state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises topped 7.32 billion yuan, 70.6 percent  of all the industrial profits achieved in the province.    A leading industrial center in China, the province now has  1,263 large and medium-sized enterprises, accounting for about  one-tenth of China's total.    Most of those enterprises were built during the 1950s and  1960s under a highly planned economy, and had served as a  leading factor in national economic growth in the past decades.    But many problems in the management systems, plus in many  cases their backward conception of the market, had led to lower  economic efficiency, economic experts noted.    In the transition of the planned economy to a market  economy,  many poorly-run enterprises were plunged into the red, and  outdated equipment rubbed still more salt into the wounds of the  state-owned enterprises.    Zhao Xinliang, director of the Provincial Planning  Commission, said that during the past few years, several new  management mechanisms were introduced into state-owned  enterprises. Reforms in labor, wage and personnel systems were  also carried out.    The provincial government has offered financial help to  them.  More money has been spent on the technical renovation of these  enterprises. More than 33 billion yuan was invested in the  renovation of 1,800 projects during the past three years.    As a result, the renovated projects created an additional  output value of 10 billion yuan last year, compared with the  pre-renovation period.    Tax and profits totalled three billion yuan and export  volume  reached 180 million U.S. dollars.    Zhao said many state-owned enterprises have adjusted  themselves so well that they have even started to March toward  the international market. They include a large zinc mill in  Huludao Island, a tractor plant in Anshan city and an automobile  factory in Dandong city.    "We hope the province will again become one of the most  developed areas in China in 10 to 15 years," said Wen Shizhen,  acting governor of the province.</p>

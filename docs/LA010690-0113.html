			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOND HOLDS OFF LIQUIDATION; NEW INVESTOR RUMORED  </P> <P> Alan Bond's flagship Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. successfully fought Friday an  attempt to liquidate his brewing and media empire, but it now faces new demands  from U.S. creditors to repay $510 million immediately.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, across the Pacific, an investment group emerged Friday with a  possible offer to inject funds in cash-starved Bond Corp. in exchange for a  controlling stake.  </P> <P> Weatherby Investments Inc., based in Beverly Hills, and its Singapore-based  parent, California Pacific International, said in a statement Friday that they  had entered into talks with Bond Corp. to buy an undisclosed majority stake for  up to $196 million ($250 million Australian).  </P> <P> Weatherby and California Pacific Chairman Jeff Reynolds said his companies  hoped to restructure most of Bond Corp.'s debt with equity as well as debt  placements and by selling certain non-core assets. He said further details of  his plans would be available next week.  </P> <P> The possible offer could not be immediately confirmed with Bond Corp.  officials, but some Wall Street professionals were skeptical about the possible  offer.  </P></p>

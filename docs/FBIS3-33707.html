[passage omitted]    A special Jordanian military plane carrying an official  delegation headed by Foreign Ministry Secretary General Nayif  al-Hadid arrived in Beirut this afternoon and transported the  body of the diplomat to Jordan. At the airport to see the body  off were Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz and Jordanian Ambassador  to Lebanon Fakhri Abu-Talib. The ambassador hoped the Lebanese  authorities find the culprits and those behind them. He  stressed that the Jordanian Embassy in Beirut will remain open.  He said:    [Begin recording] [Abu-Talib] I believe the Lebanese  officials have made enough statements about the attack. I  cannot add to what they said. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Do you believe the attack is politically  motivated?    [Abu-Talib] I believe there certainly are political motives.  There are no personal reasons for the killing. Someone is  trying to harm both Jordan's march and Lebanon's security.  Those who planned and carried out the attack do not want  stability and security for Lebanon, nor do they want Jordan to  continue its current political line. But despite all obstacles  and difficulties, we will not change our policy, and we will  take a courageous and responsible position. [passage omitted]  [end recording]    For his part, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz made the  following statement: [Begin Buwayz recording] As I said this  morning, this is a loss for Lebanon. It is a stab at Lebanon  more than Jordan. Those who try to harm stability and security  in Lebanon are also trying to harm Lebanon's credibility in the  political and security spheres. Of course, I will not forestall  the investigations and point accusing fingers at any quarter,  but certainly the tragedy reflects negatively on Lebanon above  all.    I express my condolences to the Jordanian officials and to  the family of the victim, and I stress that the Lebanese  Government will spare no effort in conducting investigations and  finding the attackers.

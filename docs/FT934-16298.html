			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Changes to collection of national insurance recommended THE RULES for income tax and national insurance contributions should be brought closer together to cut the costs to business, a government working group said yesterday. The group from the business community, whose report was published yesterday by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said the two systems should use the same definitions of earnings and expenses, and the Contributions Agency should use the administrative arrangements used by the Inland Revenue. The group also recommended a variety of ways to change the collection of national insurance. Mr Lilley has yet to decide which aspects of the report to adopt.</p>

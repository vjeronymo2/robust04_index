			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour NEC ends wrangling LABOUR patched up its furious public wrangling over responsibility for its April election defeat yesterday by acknowledging that the party had failed to win back the full confidence of voters. A four-hour inquest by the national executive - widely predicted to be stormy - was sobered by devastating post-election opinion poll evidence showing widespread distrust of the party's competence to govern. The surveys of floating voters also confirmed the conclusions already voiced by Mr Neil Kinnock, the leader, that Labour has still to live down its factional in-fighting of the early 1980s, the 'winter of discontent' and its economic record in power. There was some discussion of the detailed conduct of the campaign, run by campaigns co-ordinator Dr John Cunningham, including the 'Jennifer's ear' affair, the Sheffield rally and the controversial role of the Shadow Communications Agency. Nevertheless, Mr Larry Whitty, the general secretary, said the meeting had been 'good and constructive'. In his 58-page report, he explained the defeat as linked to a failure to convince 'suburban man' that it was safe to vote Labour; difficulties in getting the core vote out, especially the votes of older women; an impressive Conservative grassroots machine; and the Tory tabloid press. Mr Whitty also identified some of the campaign's successes, including the shadow budget produced by Mr John Smith and the quality of Labour's election broadcasts. Observing that 11 per cent of Sun readers had switched to the Conservatives in the last week of the campaign, he said that the party would now bring pressure to bear through the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) to tackle biased reporting where opinion was projected as fact. Some 15 members of the 32-strong NEC added their observations about what went wrong but there were no fierce recriminations over what was seen as a hard-fought campaign. Mr John Prescott, the deputy leadership candidate who voiced acid criticism of overbearing unelected 'outsiders' on the campaign team on Wednesday, yesterday expressed appreciation of the work of everyone involved in the campaign. Mr Kinnock appeared to recognise in his concluding remarks that the new leadership must now seek to widen Labour's support. He said: 'If we are to help the have-nots, we have to get the support of the haves and the haven't enoughs.' It was now time for the party to put aside blame and bloodletting, get over the shock of defeat and look to the future. Mr David Hill, Labour's communications chief, said he would be filing a report on media election coverage to the PCC within a month. Labour believed that the recent critical comments of the PCC on coverage of the royal family constituted a precedent that justified an examination of political reporting. Mr Prescott yesterday won the backing of a white-collar rail workers' union in his attempt to become Labour's next deputy leader. He polled 3,190 votes in a ballot of Transport Salaried Staffs' Association political levy-paying members, against 2,652 for Mrs Margaret Beckett and 1,987 for Mr Bryan Gould. In the poll for the party's next leader, Mr John Smith beat Mr Gould by 5,685 votes to 2,111. Only a quarter of the union's members voted.</p>

At the beginning of the meeting Istvan Pasztor, Komarno  mayor  and chairman of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny  Ostrov (ZMOZO), which convened the meeting, assured the audience  that the event was not directed against the territorial  sovereignty of Slovakia. "As citizens we want to help the  functioning of the republic," said Pasztor, the main organizer  of the meeting. Further speeches sharply criticized the methods  used by Slovak authorities towards the ethnic Hungarian minority  and the local government.    Sandor Rozsa, mayor of Kajal, south Slovakia, called the  rights of the local government in Slovakia insufficient. The  relevant articles of the Slovak Constitution are too general,  making it possible to pass "harmful decisions" contradicting the  European Charter of Local Government which, in fact, had not  been accepted by Slovakia, Rozsa said.    Stefan Pasztor, mayor of Kralovsky Chlmec, east Slovakia,  recapitulated the history of the administrative set-up of the  country since 1918 and suggested that the set-up had always  disadvantaged the minority. Istvan Zacharias, mayor of Moldava  nad Bodvou, east Slovakia, rejected the government concept of  the new administrative set-up of Slovakia and called for  extended power for the local and regional governments.    According to Alzbeta Poganyova, a spokeswoman for  Egyutteles,  an ethnic Hungarian party, more than 3,000 persons are attending  the meeting, out of an expected 5,000 deputies, mayors, and  representatives of local government. 400 journalists are  present, she reported. Representatives of the Presidential  Office and the Government Office as well as diplomats from ten  embassies were also there, she added.    Miklos Duray, chairman of Egyutteles which has, along with  the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, 14 deputies in the  150- member Slovak Parliament, rules out the possibility that  ethnic tension in south Slovakia could develop into a  Yugoslav-type conflict. "This does not threaten at all," Duray  told CTK today.    "In Slovakia, no different cultures are opposing one  another," he said. "In Slovakia, it is more a case of political  conflict and, basically, an incomplete political structure," he  added.    Duray believes, however, that the Hungarians are  discriminated against in Slovakia: For example the law on names  stipulates that a change of a Slovak name into Hungarian  requires a complicated procedure, while the change of a  Hungarian name to the Slovak requires a fee of 40 Slovak crowns  ($1.2).    According to Duray, peaceful coexistence between Slovaks and  Hungarians in south Slovakia does not require the direct  territorial autonomy of the minority, but a self-rule system  which would take the ethnic character of the population into  account. "The Hungarians live in Slovakia in a continuous  territory," he said. Duray stated that while no ethnically  homogeneous regions exist in Slovakia, Hungarians constitute a  70-percent majority in the south Slovak region.    The Komarno meeting should formulate a demand that the new  Slovak administrative set-up be suitable for the Hungarian  minority. This would then be discussed further, Duray said.    Duray does not reckon with the election of a 100-member body  of Hungarian representatives at the meeting, as there is no  legal substance for this. The conclusions of the Komarno  meeting should be pushed through in the parliament, in the  political talks as well as through foreign activities, including  at the Council of Europe and the European Union, Duray said.    According to Duray, the timing of the meeting before the  upcoming meeting of the Visegrad Four with U.S. President Bill  Clinton is "pure coincidence," and there is no connection  between the two events. He considers, nevertheless, the  solution to the issue of the ethnic Hungarian minority in  Slovakia to be a precondition for Visegrad cooperation.</p>

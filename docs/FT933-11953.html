			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / St James's makes Pounds 137m cash and paper payout ST JAMES'S Place Capital is to give shareholders its 37.6 per cent stake in RIT Capital Partners, worth Pounds 104m, plus Pounds 32.7m in cash, disentangling Lord Rothschild's two companies. The distribution - subject to shareholder and court approval - was announced by Lord Rothschild and Sir Mark Weinberg, joint chairmen of SJPC, at yesterday's annual meeting. By giving the stake in RITCP to shareholders, SJPC is indicating that it will focus on being a financial services group rather than an investment company, Mr Clive Gibson, a SJPC director, said yesterday. SJPC would look at acquisitions in the financial services area and also be ready to put more capital into its existing businesses, he said. Rises in SJPC and RITCP's asset values since the March 31 year-end were also announced. SJPC's net asset value had risen from 107.7p to 123.4p a share or Pounds 335m, while RITCP's had gone up from 181.1p to 195.6p or Pounds 417m. The RITCP stake is SJPC's largest investment, representing 27 per cent of year-end assets. SJPC's other interests include insurance, through its stake in J Rothschild Assurance; fund management, through J Rothschild Investment Management, and J Rothschild Capital Management - which manages the RITCP portfolio - and a 29.7 per cent stake in Global Asset Management; and investment banking. RITCP is an approved investment trust. It recently sold most of its largest investment, a holding in Newmont Mining, worth Pounds 130m in March. Shareholders in SJPC will receive 0.9895 shares in RITCP and 48p in cash for every four SJPC shares. The distribution is counted as capital and so subject to gains tax. The cash element is designed to cover the tax bills. As a result of the hand-out, SJPC's net assets will fall by more than a third to about Pounds 181m on the March valuation. SJPC shareholders can expect the dividend to be reduced by a similar amount. It has been paying 3p a year. The effect on investors' income should be small as they will also receive the dividends on the RITCP shares and any interest on the cash. The plan aims to cut the double discount which SJPC shareholders suffer on their indirect holding of RITCP shares. RITCP shares fell 4p to 151p and SJPC's shares rose 5p to 140p yesterday.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / French bank group in capital increase Credit Commercial de France (CCF), the French banking group, is the latest company to take advantage of the buoyant state of the Paris stock market by unveiling plans for a FFr1.3bn to FFr1.5bn (Pounds 170m) capital increase. Mr Charles de Croisset, who last year took over as CCF's chairman, said the capital increase was intended to strengthen the balance sheet and finance expansion. CCF, best known in France as a retail bank, has been mooted as a potential investor in Banque Hervet, the medium-sized investment bank the French government has put up for sale. The group yesterday confirmed it was interested in acquiring Banque Hervet. The capital increase, the first by CCF since privatisation in May 1987, will be divided between existing investors and a market placing. CCF said the issue will increase its total equity by between 7 per cent and 8 per cent. CCF is staging its issue at a critical time for the French banking industry which hopes to begin its recovery this year after two difficult years in which banks have come under intense pressure due to the economic recession and depressed demand for credit. However CCF has fared better than competitors and has emerged relatively unscathed. It has already announced a 10.7 per cent increase in net interim profits to FFr541m for the first half of 1993 against FFr489m in the same period the previous year. Mr de Croisset said CCF was on course for continued growth in the full financial year of 1993 and in 1994. He anticipated a 'moderate increase' in 1993 profits from FFr978m despite a sharp increase in provisions. He also forecast further profits growth for 1994 saying that CCF had began the year 'in a healthy position'. Mr de Croisset said the group's traditional banking business should show an improvement over 1993.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Criticism of Whitehall reforms tests ministerial sang-froid Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, was yesterday required to dig deep into the lexicon of Whitehall-speak as he published a critical report on the government's civil service reforms. The report, commissioned by Mr Waldegrave himself, says the creation of agencies to deliver government services has led to fragmentation of the civil service. And it accuses Whitehall departments of interfering excessively in the day-to-day management of agencies. Mr Waldegrave described the report as 'useful and challenging', code among the mandarins for 'embarrassing and very inconvenient'. The author of the report was Ms Sylvie Trosa, a senior French civil servant seconded to the Cabinet Office to evaluate the reforms. Ms Trosa previously worked in the government office responsible for public service reform in France. She appears to have endorsed the central policy in the reforms, the creation of more than 80 executive agencies to deliver services such as the payment of benefits and vehicle licensing. But she found confusion in the relationship between agencies and their parent departments. Agency chiefs continue to complain of interference by civil servants in Whitehall. 'There is a whole bureaucracy set up to monitor us,' one agency chief executive told Ms Trosa. Civil servants in central departments are also critical of the agencies, she found, seeing agencies as increasingly drifting away from them in values and culture. Attempts to ensure that staff move between agencies and departments are 'minimal', according to Ms Trosa. Ministers need to do much more to encourage cohesion in the civil service, she added. The report is based on interviews with senior civil servants, including the chief executives of 26 agencies, half of whom came from outside the civil service. Call for survey of morale, Page 8</p>

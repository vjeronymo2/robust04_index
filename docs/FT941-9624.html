			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Monday Interview: A duty to the public good - and a strong balance sheet / GKN's Sir David Lees tells Lucy Kellaway that his intentions for Westland are honourable The word 'hostile' makes Sir David Lees flinch. The ultra-polite executive chairman of GKN does not like to hear his bid for Westland talked about like that. Images of battle might seem fitting for the unfriendly takeover of a defence company, especially as the last time Westland changed hands two cabinet ministers and their jobs parted company and the government nearly fell in the process. But Sir David presents his attempt to buy the infamous helicopter company rather differently. Watching him as he sips tea out of a fine china cup in his elegant office very near the Queen Mother's London residence, it is clear that aggression and unpleasantness are just not his style. GKN, as he tells the story, has been a loyal and supportive shareholder in Westland for five years. Last week it bought the shares of another long-standing shareholder, and as required by stock exchange rules, it dashed out a bid for the rest of the company. The fit is good, the intentions honourable; there is nothing hostile about it, he says. Yet the fact remains that Westland is fighting hard for a higher offer, and is protesting loudly that GKN does not love it for itself alone, but for its tax advantages. Sir David deals calmly with the allegation of opportunism. His account stretches back through a decade or more, charting GKN's steady, cautious expansion into defence. He talks about tax and about greater stability of earnings, but also underlines some similarities between helicopters and GKN's armoured vehicles. But, a reasonable man, he is careful not to push the point too far. 'I can't pretend that a Warrior can fly or that helicopters can race along the ground.' Some might say that his bid is opportunist, but none could say it was hasty. Sir David is an accountant by training and does not like to rush into things. In the years he has held the Westland stake, he has done a lot of pensive sitting, and quiet listening. 'He takes a long time to make up his mind. But once he makes a decision he's very determined,' says a close colleague. These careful characteristics have stood Sir David, now 57, in good stead so far. In his six years as chairman, and five before that as finance director, he has built up a financially strong company involved in three sectors: motors, industrial services and defence. He has been a master at cutting costs, and at getting rid of all those loss-making businesses that in the old days made Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds great. In all, it has been a defensive operation, turnover has not grown in real terms, but the quality of the businesses is far better, and the balance sheet stronger. 'I've taken the group through a difficult time, cleaned it up. We've maintained the dividend for shareholders, and the balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been. I'm proud of that,' he says. Sir David has a tidy mind, and wants to stick to the discussion in hand. For instance, last summer he was in a car crash in which he broke six ribs and punctured a lung, but he will not be side-tracked into discussing that, and persists in telling me how well GKN is doing in Japan. This vision of a civil, cautious man, who is good with numbers, does not capture the whole of him. 'Really quite jolly,' is how one colleague describes him. He is also a good family man, the sort of bloke who is quite happy kicking a ball about on the lawn of his Shropshire home after Sunday lunch. More than that, he is public spirited. If you read the list of the external positions he has held (which run to two pages on his cv) and hear the high-minded talk about it, you might think him a bit of a prig. Yet he avoids that label. He is both modest and direct, looks you in the eye, and answers the question. He does the extra work, he says, both because he loves it, and because he feels it is his duty. 'If members of big institutions are not prepared to take the lead, you get a feeble institution and have only yourself to blame. People at the top of companies have a duty. Pro bono publico.' His experience at the CBI, where he is chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee and at the Bank of England of which he is a director, has given more insight than most businessmen possess into public life. He is said to be outstandingly good at dealing with ministers and officials: civil but firm. It does not seem to have gone to his head. 'The Bank of England invitation came as a very great surprise. When I was asked to go to see the Governor, I thought there must be some problem somewhere.' His style is distinctly unflashy. He is a member of the sensible school of management - it is no great surprise that he cites Sir Christopher Hogg, with whom he sits on the board at Courtaulds, as a kindred spirit and as someone he admires. He is no autocrat, and has secured some plain speaking heavies, such as Howard Davies at the CBI, as non-executive directors on the GKN board. He believes in the free market but is repulsed by excess. 'I was immensely impressed at how Margaret Thatcher freed up management at the beginning of the 1980s, but possibly society has moved a bit far to the right in terms of materialism.' When invited to criticise his peers for their outrageous pay packets his words are carefully measured. 'I accept that market rates have to be paid to get good people. But on the other side of the equation, that must not lead to an excuse for greed.' Sir David says he runs his car for 120,000 miles before he trades it in, and last year waived his bonus because he did not think the group had done well enough for him to merit it. Moreover, no GKN executives travel first class on aircraft. 'We do not do this to be hairshirt, but we do what is necessary. I know it sounds pious, but we lead from the top and set an example.' As he sits there, urbane and relaxed, discussing the rights and wrongs of corporate excess, you would never guess that for the last week he has been burning the midnight oil in a high-profile takeover battle - sorry, process  -of which he has little experience. Evidently, he is feeling on top of his job. 'If you enjoy it enough, there are bad days. It's like golf. You can play a couple of bad shots, but when you play well, you feel the best in the world.' If he wins Westland, will he feel the best in the world? Once again he is cautious. 'There is strategic rationale there. I look forward to a happy and not acrimonious outcome.'</p>

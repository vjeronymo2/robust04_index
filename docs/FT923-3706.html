			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Chinese threaten US with retaliation CHINA's outrage at the US sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan threatened yesterday to spill over into already testy trade negotiations. Beijing's official media warned that it would slap punitive tariffs on US goods including computers and aircraft if the US carried out its threat to impose tariffs on Dollars 3.9bn of imports from China unless China relaxes its import regime. The US has set a deadline of October 10, and its negotiators are due in Beijing at the weekend to seek an agreement on market access. Chinese officials had previously indicated that they were willing to loosen and clarify import restrictions. China remains furious at President Bush's decision, announced last week, to allow the sale of up to 150 fighters to Taiwan. It says the sale would violate the 1982 Sino-US communique under which Washington undertook to limit and eventually phase out arms sales to Taiwan. It also accused the US yesterday of bad faith in the market access talks. Xinhua news agency said: 'China showed sincerity and made major efforts to reach agreement, but the US side failed to respond positively and instead published the blacklist on August 21.' Xinhua said China could impose tariffs on US goods including computers, aircraft, cars, medical apparatus and instruments, duplicators, pesticides, chemical fibres, timber and wood products, cameras, cotton, petroleum products, medicines and chemicals. Though China is widely expected to take some retaliatory action over the jet sale, its options are thought to be limited by its desire to retain most favoured nation (MFN) status for its exports to the US. It has threatened to withdraw co-operation in global arms control talks.</p>

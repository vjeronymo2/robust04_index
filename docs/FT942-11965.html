			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: More cost-cutting at Continental Continental, the German tyre maker, lifted first-quarter profits slightly but Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, chief executive, said further cost-cutting was needed to pull the company out of 'the deep hole' it fell into in 1993. He said full-year profits were expected to match the DM65.1m (Dollars 38m) of 1993. Turnover rose 8 per cent in the first quarter, due to the incorporation of Barum, the Czech producer, and Benecke-Kaliko, a Hanover-based tyre maker. Despite a 50.1 per cent fall in 1993 profits, the company will pay a DM4 dividend. Mr Wilhelm Winterstein, finance director, said he could not rule out a rights issue this year. High costs in Germany meant 25 per cent of all tyre production would be moved abroad, mainly to Barum and Mabor, the Portuguese unit, the company said. Contitech, the non-tyre division, would also increase its activities at Vegum, the Slovak company in which it holds a stake. Worldwide tyre sales fell by 4.5 per cent to DM4.9bn in 1993 but recession in the auto industry saw European car tyre sales drop by 17 per cent and commercial vehicle tyres by 34 per cent. Contitech saw 1993 turnover fall by 7.6 per cent to DM2.1bn but said that sales had improved slightly in the first quarter. Turnover at General Tire, the US subsidiary, rose 2.2 per cent last year to DM2.2bn.</p>

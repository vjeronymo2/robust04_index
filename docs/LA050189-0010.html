			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY'S ROLE AS PAID ADVISER SHOCKS SOME CITY POLITICIANS  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley's previously unknown role as a paid adviser to a bank doing  business with the city has come as a disappointing surprise to some of his  political colleagues.  </P> <P> "At best, this is the consequence of carelessness," said Los Angeles City  Councilman Marvin Braude, who is one of Bradley's strongest supporters on the  municipal legislative body. "At worst, it is a matter for the city attorney."  </P> <P> Braude and others commented in interviews Sunday as the City Council prepared  to hold a Governmental Operations Committee hearing Wednesday on disclosures  that Bradley and his staff interceded with city agencies on behalf of Far East  National Bank while Bradley was a paid adviser to the bank.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expert Legal Team  </P> <P> The Times learned that Bradley's legal team in the investigation includes a  specialist in conflict-of-interest laws, attorney Ronald B. Turovsky of the  firm of Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Phillips. Also on the team are Mickey  Kantor of Manatt, Phelps, an expert political strategist, and Daniel Fogel, a  civil and trial attorney with the firm of Fogel, Feldman, Ostrov, Ringler &amp;  Klevens.  </P> <P> Last year, Far East National Bank paid Bradley $18,000 to serve on its board of  advisers, and he was the only one of 46 advisory board members to receive  payment. Asked why the bank paid Bradley, bank President Henry Hwang said it  was because the mayor was helpful in bringing foreign trade to the institution.  "You generally have to pay people for things . . . for, you know, for services  rendered in the future, whatever," Hwang said.  </P> <P> The committee will hear a report from City Atty. James K. Hahn, who is in  charge of an investigation of Bradley's affairs. Hahn will also investigate  Bradley's tenure as a board member of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn.,  for which he was paid up to $24,000 a year. The thrift had zoning matters  before the city during the years that Bradley was on its board.  </P> <P> The release of documents detailing the role of Bradley and his aides in  contacting city agencies on behalf of Far East has persuaded Braude and others  that Bradley faces serious political trouble when the committee convenes  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Braude said he was shocked by the news. "The mayor is not unethical, venal or  corrupt," he said. "Quite the contrary. The mayor is quite honorable."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Errors of Oversight'  </P> <P> But, he said, "there is a strong tendency (among public officials) to neglect  their personal affairs with the press of official activities. Errors of  oversight are bound to occur and that has caught up with the mayor. But that is  no excuse."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said: "I believe what I've read, but I want to  hear what the mayor says about it.  </P> <P> "It is really too bad that this happened," Flores said. "I don't always agree  with the mayor but I have never had the least doubt that he was a man of  integrity. I really believe the mayor is an honest man."  </P> <P> "I just don't know what led him to do these things. I don't know whether he got  bad advice or just got greedy. But it is so unlike the mayor."  </P> <P> City Council President John Ferraro, who once ran against Bradley, said "we all  (city elected officials) make phone calls for people, but we are not on their  payroll. I certainly would not call if I had a financial interest or served on  a board."  </P> <P> Another old Bradley political associate, and friend, who declined to be  identified, said: "I've never questioned his integrity. I can't conceive of him  participating in any kind of illegal activity. But one can never be too prudent  and sometimes one doesn't think enough and gets involved in things they  shouldn't get involved in.  </P> <P> "It looks bad, the public reaction looks bad," the associate said.  </P> <P> Ferraro, Braude and Flores will be key City Council players as the Bradley  investigation unfolds, and their statements indicate that Bradley will undergo  scrutiny from a council that has shown increasing signs of being willing to  oppose the mayor. That has been especially true since Bradley's surprisingly  narrow reelection victory last month.  </P> <P> As council president, the veteran Ferraro will take a prominent role in shaping  the council's course, advising the chairman of the Governmental Operations  Committee, Michael Woo, who is just finishing his first term. Ferraro has had  an up-and-down relationship with Bradley, running against him in 1985 in a  vitriolic campaign but traveling with him last year to the Seoul Olympics.  </P> <P> Braude is another veteran. While he was angry with the mayor's support of  proposed oil drilling in the Pacific Palisades in Braude's district, the  councilman has always had a high regard for Bradley and has given him key  support in tough political situations. Braude is respected by council  colleagues and is expected to have a behind-the-scenes role in shaping events.  </P> <P> Flores has also won considerable respect on the council, first as an aide to  the late Councilman John Gibson, then as his successor when he retired.  </P> <P> Moreover, Flores and Braude supported Ferraro for council president. They are  all part of an informal leadership cadre that comes together on major occasions  to chart a course for the council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stronger Role Considered  </P> <P> Some council members had discussed the council taking a stronger role in the  investigation by hiring a special counsel and issuing subpoenas.  </P> <P> Ferraro did not rule that out, saying: "If after the committee meets on  Wednesday, and they feel they need expertise, maybe we could get an adviser to  the committee. But I think we ought to wait until the hearing on Wednesday."  </P></p>

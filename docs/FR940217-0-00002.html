The Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestations can cause complete loss of crops, and losses of 25 to 50 percent are not uncommon. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapid development of serious outbreaks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We established the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations (7 CFR 301.78 through 301.78&hyph;10; referred to below as the regulations) and quarantined the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles County, CA, in an interim rule effective on November 5, 1991, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 13, 1991 (56 FR 57573&hyph;57579, Docket No. 91&hyph;155). The regulations impose restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Medfly to noninfested areas of the United States. We have published a series of interim rules amending these regulations by adding to or removing from the list of quarantined areas certain portions of Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Orange, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties, CA. Amendments affecting California were made effective on September 10, and November 12, 1992; and on January 19, July 16, August 3, September 15, October 8, November 22, and December 16, 1993; and on January 10, 1994 (57 FR 42485&hyph;42486, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;2; 57 FR 54166&hyph;54169, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;3; 58 FR 6343&hyph;6346, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;4; 58 FR 39123&hyph;39124, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;5; 58 FR 42489&hyph;42491, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;6; 58 FR 49186&hyph;49190, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;7; 58 FR 53105&hyph;53109, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;8; 58 FR 63027&hyph;63031, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;9; 58 FR 67627&hyph;67630, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;10; and 59 FR 2281&hyph;2283, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;11).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agencies and by inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have revealed that an additional infestation of Medfly has been discovered in the Corona area of Riverside County, CA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in &sect;301.78&hyph;3 provide that the Administrator of APHIS will list as a quarantined area each State, or each portion of a State, in which the Medfly has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that the Medfly is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which the Medfly has been found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with these criteria and the recent Medfly findings described above, we are amending &sect;301.78&hyph;3 by adding an area in Riverside County of approximately 62 square miles. The new quarantined area is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Riverside County  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That portion of Riverside County bounded by a line drawn as follows: Beginning at the intersection of Interstate Highway 15 and Bellegrave Avenue; then southwest along Bellegrave Avenue to its intersection with the Riverside/San Bernardino County line; then southwest along the Riverside/San Bernardino County line to its intersection with State Highway 71; then southeast along State Highway 71 to its intersection with State Highway 91; then south from this intersection along an imaginary line to its intersection with the Corona City limit; then west, south, and east along the Corona City limit to its intersection with State Street; then north along State Street to its intersection with Chase Drive; then southeast along Chase Drive to its intersection with El Cerrito Road; then northeast along El Cerrito Road to its intersection with Temescal Canyon Road; then northeast from this intersection along an imaginary line to the intersection of Magnolia Avenue and State Highway 91; then northwest from this intersection along an imaginary line to the intersection of California Avenue and 6th Street; then west along 6th Street to its intersection with Interstate Highway 15; then north along Highway 15 to the point of beginning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Emergency Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly from spreading to noninfested areas of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

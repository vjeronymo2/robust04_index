			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Print strike halts French newspapers A PRINT union strike yesterday prevented publication of all but one of France's nationally circulated daily newspapers, AP reports from Paris. The General Confederation of Labour (CGT) called the 24-hour strike in its printing branch as a warning to publishers in advance of negotiations that will lead to lay-offs. Only the Quotidien de Paris appeared after using an out-of-town printing plant. The union has accepted a proposal by publishers for the early retirement of about 2,200 printers, but it is opposed to tentative plans to lay off 750 younger printers. The publishers say drastic cost reductions are necessary to maintain the financial health of the industry.</p>

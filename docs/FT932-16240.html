			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Rising yen adds urgency to 'post-bubble' restructuring: Robert Thomson on a 10 per cent appreciation in Japan's currency WHEN the yen surged in recent days, the first shout of pain came from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party. It apparently second-guessed industry concerns by suggesting that the yen's strength would be high on the agenda for the Group of Seven industrialised nations. With G7 countries more concerned about the rouble than the yen, the LDP idea was quickly rejected by Japan's ministry of finance and the Economic Planning Agency, and even by export industries, which have shown surprising calm as the yen has hit post-war highs each day on foreign exchange markets. The Japanese currency has appreciated 10 per cent against the dollar since mid-January, and the trend has gathered momentum over the past week, prompting the Bank of Japan to intervene in the Tokyo foreign exchange market last Friday and on Monday to support the dollar. By the reckoning of the EPA, a 10 per cent yen appreciation will lead to a 0.48 per cent contraction in gross national product. But it will also lead to a 1.3 per cent fall in consumer prices, thanks to lower costs for imported commodities. In the short term, the EPA expects the current account surplus, a record Dollars 117.6bn (Pounds 82.8bn) last year, to rise, but higher export prices should mean a longer-term fall in the surplus. The yen-dollar rate is of most concern to Japanese companies reliant on trade, as about 60 per cent of export contracts and 83 per cent of import contracts were denominated in dollars last year. But the Bank of Japan apparently intervened, not out of concern for the impact on these companies, but more because the bank wanted to stop what it saw as an unhealthy surge of speculative interest in the yen. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank's governor, reflected the desire for calm when he said 'exchange rates should reflect the economic fundamentals of a country and be stable'. Given that Mr Mieno expects a Japanese recovery will come late this year, he saw the volatile movement of the yen, which hit Y113.30 to the dollar on Monday, as way out of line with the fundamentals. For most Japanese manufacturers, yen appreciation is another reason to intensify restructuring programmes begun after the currency's sharp rise in the mid-1980s, inspired by the Plaza Accord in September 1985. Companies are relatively calm because the Y110 level was looming six years ago. Then the dollar rate hit Y120.45 and suddenly retreated, easing the pressure on export industries to find cheaper sites elsewhere in Asia. The yen weakened until April 1990, when it reached a low of Y160.35, and began an ascent that continues. Curiously, the year 1990 also marked the low point, Dollars 35.76bn, for the current account surplus, which more than doubled in 1991 and rose another 61 per cent last year, prompting US officials to call for another strengthening of the yen. EPA officials say the 'bubble economy', the speculative excesses and rapid spending growth of the late 1980s, is to blame for the contradictory figures during that period - weaker yen, lower surplus, instead of the other way around. The bubble era also distorted the investment decisions of manufacturers, who had record increases in profits and miscalculated on forecasts for domestic demand, the cost of capital and return on domestic investment. The result was that car and electronics manufacturers who should have put more low-cost factories in Thailand and southern China instead placed them in Kyushu, the southern island of Japan. Manufacturers are stuck with high production costs and excess capacity at home, leaving them with an operating profit margin of less than 3 per cent for the year ended in March. In 1986, after the 'yen shock' of the Plaza Accord, the average profit margin was 3.2 per cent, while the oil-shock affected low of 1975 was 4.5 per cent. Mr Yutaka Sugiyama, an Asian region specialist at UBS Securities, said manufacturers could easily increase production capacity in south-east Asia at the expense of their domestic facilities: 'But the question they must confront is what production are they going to leave for their workers in Japan? These foreign plants are, technically, very capable, but the companies have to find something for their workers to do.'</p>

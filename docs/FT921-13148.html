			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Accountancy Column: SEC newcomer takes hot seat as tempers rise over valuation HALFWAY through an interview from his Connecticut home, Walter Schuetze breaks off to answer the door. Someone has arrived to mend the hot water, reports the Securities and Exchange Commission's new chief accountant gratefully, as a cold snap engulfs New England. But if hot water has been lacking on the domestic front, Mr Schuetze is facing a surfeit professionally. The 59-year-old accountant, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, steps into his new post at the US watchdog this week - and immediately confronts a furore over current value accounting. For many months, the SEC, under its chairman Richard Breeden, has argued strongly that banks and other financial institutions should carry financial products in their books at current values - not at what they paid for them. Such pressure is more than academic. Ever since the thrift industry debacle triggered a political storm, supervision and regulation of financial institutions has been a highly-charged issue. The SEC, moreover, has a Congressional mandate to set accounting rules for US companies, although in practice it cedes the task of drawing up standards to the Financial Standards Accounting Board. It is easy to see why the SEC is so concerned. Most banks, for instance, currently split their portfolios of stocks and bonds between those held for investment which are valued at cost, and a more limited trading account where securities are indeed 'marked-to-market'. This presents plentiful opportunities for the unscrupulous. Bonds within the investment portfolio which have risen in value can be sold at year-end for a gain, for example, while those that have fallen can be retained within the portfolio, yet valued at cost. The financial industry, however, has hit back with equal ferocity. The American Bankers Association, a trade organisation encompassing many large commercial banks, puts the argument thus: 'Our primary problem is that banks don't use current value accounting for their own purposes, so it is hard to see why it should improve things for investors.' Investment portfolios, it is argued, are held for the longer-term, so short-term price movements have little relevance. Various supplementary salvos back up this central theme. Any meaningful attempt at current value accounting, it is argued, should surely require that liabilities are also marked to market - and there is little consensus on how to do this. Second, even on the asset side, 'current value' calculations may be extremely subjective where there is no ready market for the security in question. Hence the reliability of accounts could diminish, not improve. Third, banks might be obliged to cold-shoulder whole areas of the securities market where valuation is difficult or volatility pronounced. The debate is not confined to the banking industry. Similar controversy rages vis-a-vis the plication that this a state-regulated business, and the politics even more labyrinthine. Mr Terence Lennon, chief examiner at the New York Department of Insurance, put the regulators' case bluntly to a Congressional sub-committee. 'The marking-to-market of the entire asset portfolio of an insurer is not a good idea,' he suggested. 'First of all, it cannot be done without marking liabilities to market . . . and I believe we would be losing a lot of conservatism if we marked both sides to market. In addition, only about one-third of the assets in most companies have a readily obtainable market value . . . Frankly, this (marking-to-market) gives the industry more of an opportunity for subjective analysis than they have now.' Into this heated debate, steps Mr Schuetze. It would be amazing if the new chief accountant was anything but supportive of the SEC stance, but just how much weight does he attach to the issue? Does he, for example, class current value accounting as a top priority? 'Yes, I do,' he replies, choosing his words with meticulous care. 'We need to increase and improve the relevance and credibility of financial accounting, and I think the use of market values, for assets and liabilities, is very desirable. That's especially true for financial institutions.' Confronted with the ABA argument about aptness, Mr Schuetze reels off a list of beneficiaries - shareholders, potential shareholders, employees, potential employees, customers, and so on. When tackled about the potential distortion to investment markets, his response is even simpler: 'If it eventuates, it eventuates.' But Mr Schuetze also knows he is dealing with the real world, and is far from purist about the way in which changes may be effected. He has already been quoted as saying that the profession needs to 'crawl before it can walk, and walk before it can run' in the matter of current value accounting. 'The marking-to-market of financial assets is the crawling part,' he now adds. 'If we have to yield on liabilities, we have to yield on liabilities.' As for current value accounting in non-financial industries: 'I think it may be more difficult with regard to property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. It is both more difficult, and more difficult to move quickly. We will have to work on it over time. You have to get the economic benefits into equilibrium with the relevance of the numbers. This is a first step.' To some observers, it appeared as Mr Schuetze's task became a mite more difficult last week, when the FASB - which has been working for some time on an draft accounting rule requiring investment securities to be marked to market - delayed issuing any proposal until May at the earliest. But the FASB's own account of the vote switch is more ambiguous. It says one member of the six-man board - previously split 4-2 in favour of issuing a proposal - wanted to 'revisit' two crucial aspects of the draft rule. These were the liability valuation question, and the desirability of having unrealised gains and losses reported outside the income statement. He was not, stresses FASB, necessarily changing his eventual vote. Mr Schuetze, meanwhile, notes that the board will be enlarged to seven members in March, and will then need a 5-2 vote in favour of issuing the draft rule. Since the new, seventh member will be critically involved with the proposal, it made little sense to plough ahead with the preliminaries ahead of his arrival. 'FASB did not back away,' maintains Mr Schuetze 'They decided to delay for a while.' That does not stop bank lobbyists from crowing. 'I'm very pleased to see that FASB is equally concerned about this,' remarked one industry supporter, after news of the delay spread. 'The SEC has placed FASB in an awkward position, and it should not be influenced in this way.' One can almost feel the steam rising.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Ingersoll-Rand sees signs of upturn HIGHER US infrastructural spending and hopeful signs in the economy were improving the outlook for construction equipment producers, said Mr Bill Mulligan, executive vice-president of Ingersoll-Rand, yesterday. 'We think the market has turned,' Mr Mulligan said, a 40-year veteran of the US industrial and construction equipment producer. He was speaking at the Bauma construction equipment exhibition in Munich, which opened yesterday amid generally depressed conditions for the Dollars 25bn-Dollars 28bn world market. Mr Mulligan admitted Ingersoll-Rand had seen signs of an upturn eight months ago, although that had proved to be an aberration. But everything now pointed to improving trends for the construction market in the US. Ingersoll-Rand's road-paving and compacting equipment businesses are direct beneficiaries of the infrastructural spending bill signed by US President George Bush last year. Mr Mulligan said the private sector construction business remained quiet. The company's net earnings fell last year from Dollars 185.3m, or Dollars 3.55 a share, to Dollars 150.6m, or Dollars 2.91, reflecting its wide spread of customers in industry and construction. The relatively strong performance - most other large US construction equipment companies lost money last year - was also underpinned by European expansion. Last year, Ingersoll-Rand reached its target of Dollars 1bn of sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa a year early. Sales in this 'European served area' have jumped from 17 per cent of the worldwide total in 1987 to 27 per cent. Mr Mulligan said Ingersoll-Rand was prepared to make further acquisitions in Europe, on top of two in Germany and one in France over the past three years. The purchases of ABG, a German road-making equipment producer, and Klemm, a manufacturer of specialised hydraulic drills, have significantly expanded the company's German presence, although its market share remained relatively small, said Mr Mulligan. Mr Heinz Henrich, ABG's marketing manager, said German demand for road-making equipment was being spurred not only by much-needed infrastructural spending in eastern Germany but by tough German environmental regulations, introduced in 1986 and subsequently strengthened, requiring recycling of road asphalt.</p>

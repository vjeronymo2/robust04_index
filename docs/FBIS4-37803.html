			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by V. Shankar Aiyar and Raghu Nandan Dhar under the </F> rubric "Telecom Policy Mess": "Can the Centre Wriggle Out?"]    [Text] Bombay -- If there is anything clear about the  telecom policy, it is the smoke signals of controversy emanating  from its impending implementation. Also clear is the tact the  lobbyists of every hue and class -- multinationals, mixed breed  companies and pure Indian corporate houses -- are all attempting  to cook the goose their way.    Facing this music is a bewildered Ministry of  Communications,  a confused Ministry of Finance [MoF] and a much-pilloried  Department of Telecommunications [DoT] which believe that the  easiest way out of the mess is to hand over the sector to the  MNCs [multinational corporations] lock, stock and barrel.    In the cacophony of confusion that is currently prevailing,  there are some voices emerging. Like that of D. Sengupta of  ICICI's [Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of  India's] Telecom Group (I-TEL) which has submitted two important  papers -- on the regulatory body where he has stated the need  for immediately establishing the authority before any decisions  are taken and one on the entry conditions.    Highly placed sources in Department of Economic Affairs  [DEA], which is co-ordinating the strategies for implementation  along with Ministry of Communications and MoF, has in principle  accepted I-TEL's recommendations for a telecom regulatory  authority (except for the name...ICICI's I-TEL suggested ORBIT  while the ministry has decided on TRA [Telecom Regulatory  Authority])    Even DoT has along with DEA accepted the broad terms of  reference suggested by I-TEL. Besides, the immediate need for  instituting Telecom Regulatory Authority, the other  recommendation that has been heard, is to allow private firms  exclusive licence for a region for five years. Further, it has  recommended that self-generated proposals should not be accepted  as a rule and even if the proposal is extremely good it needs to  be convened into a tender.    Sengupta's team spoke to AT&amp;T, US West, Telstra  Motorola and  Sprint among others. To start with, it is surprising that an  institutionally-backed cell has not spoken to any Indian  corporate house or industry association. What is even more  surprising is that the Sengupta committee has recommended  foreign equity participation at as high as 49 per cent (51 per  cent with Indians and NRIs [nonresident Indians]) when no  country in the world allows foreigners such a high proportion of  equity.    Even the Gods of capitalism, Americans do not allow equity  of  over 20 per cent. So the question-now to be asked is why  MoF/DEA, and broadly speaking Government of India, are so keen  to offer high levels of equity to the foreigners despite the  clearly spelt out issue of national security? Surely the I-TEL  group couldn't be unaware of the fact that capital markets have  been opened and Indians can now go abroad and raise funds  through the Euro-route. Why should there be an equity  participation to start with? Can't the companies buy technology  with monies raised abroad? What is worse is the manner in which  Department of Economic Affairs has swallowed the recommendations  (over which, thankfully, there has been no decision as yet).    These are but the primary issues. What Government needs to  remember is that there is a waiting list of 3.5 million for  telephone connections and to be able to service. "Telephone on  demand by 1997", Government will need to put through 10 million  lines through the Eighth Five Year Plan which would cost  Government, at conservative estimates, around Rs 23,000 crore.    Very clearly, Government has to adopt some mantras for a  successful implementation of NTP [national telecom policy]. The  crucial route to success is essentially in tackling six basic  areas: They are:    The right service area.    Number of competitors in local and long distance.    Seamless basic services.    Operating expertise.    Swift licensing process.    Independent regulator with a clearly defined role.    Let's take the issue of the right service area. Currently,  DoT services are split in major units (18 circles and four metro  districts) and minor units (321 telecom districts). In this, a  third of the calls are local and two-thirds are long distance.  In short, any company needs this mix to survive.    Even globally, most countries allow a kind of duopoly where  operators are allowed access to areas exclusively while  connecting them to trunk carriers. Particularly interesting is  the UK experience where they franchised the entire country to a  second carrier and allowed a third one recently to build market  share. India should also follow a similar pattern and split the  network into state-wide operating territories and club the  north-east (to make a viable unit) allowing preferably one  operator exclusively in a region.    As for the question of number of competitors, India is  admittedly resource starved and hence there is little point in  duplicating investments. There should be enough revenue  potential to encourage growth and investment while at the same  time competition to help improve service, quality and  productivity. In fact world-wide, most countries allow one  operator in an area (duopoly) and in US, it is just one  operator...obviously aimed at curbing duplication of investments  and counter-productive competition. Like UK, India too could  consider duopoly for five years before reviewing the situation.    The moolah is in long distance as even MTNL [Mahanagar  Telephone Nigam Limited] would agree. Telephone service cannot  be isolated as only local or only long distance as it would be  patently unfair. Witness the deterioration of services in  Thailand where they kept only one long distance operator.    What India needs to do is to first decongest (the jammed)  long distance and international traffic. One or even two more  operators should be involved in augmenting the network (even  through Build and Operate networks) laid by DoT. Secondly it  should allow only one local licencee connected to long distance  carriers with enough scope for customer traffic. Ideally, there  should be one licencee within the state (who could also operate  in another region/circle) but long distance should be allowed to  criss-cross the country through state networks.</p>

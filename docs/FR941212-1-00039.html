A copy of the ``Notice to File Missing Parts'' form mailed to applicant should accompany any response thereto submitted to the Office. If the required filing fee is not timely paid, the application will be disposed of. No copies will be provided or certified by the Office of an application which has been disposed of or in which the required basic filing fee has not been paid. The notification pursuant to this paragraph may be made simultaneously with any notification pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. If no correspondence address is included in the application, applicant has two months from the filing date to file the basic filing fee, cover sheet and to pay the surcharge as set forth in &sect;1.16(l) in order to prevent abandonment of the application.&lt; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)>(1)&lt; An application for a patent >filed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section&lt; will not be placed upon the files for examination until all its required parts, complying with the rules relating thereto, are received, except that certain minor informalities may be waived subject to subsequent correction whenever required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> >(2) A provisional application for a patent filed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section will not be placed upon the files for examination and will become abandoned no later than twelve months after its filing date pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 111(b)(1).&lt; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. Section 1.55 is proposed to be revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.55  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claim for foreign priority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) An applicant >in an application other than a provisional application&lt; may claim the benefit of the filing date of a prior foreign application under the conditions specified in 35 U.S.C. 119>(a)&hyph;(d)&lt; and 172. The claim to priority need be in no special form and may be made by the attorney or agent if the foreign application is referred to in the oath or declaration as required by &sect;1.63. The claim for priority and the certified copy of the foreign application specified in [the second paragraph of] 35 U.S.C. 119>(b)&lt; must be filed: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In the case of an interference (&sect;1.630); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When necessary to overcome the date of a reference relied upon by the examiner; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When specifically required by the examiner; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In all other cases, before the patent is granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the claim for priority or the certified copy of the foreign application is filed after the date the issue fee is paid, it must be accompanied by a petition requesting entry and by the fee set forth in &sect;1.17(i)[(1)]. If the certified copy filed is not in the English language, a translation need not be filed except in the case of interference; or when necessary to overcome the date of a reference relied upon by the examiner; or when specifically required by the examiner, in which event an English language translation must be filed together with a statement that the translation of the certified copy is accurate. The statement must be a verified statement if made by a person not registered to practice before the Patent and Trademark Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) An applicant may under certain circumstances claim priority on the basis of an application for an inventor's certificate in a country granting both inventor's certificates and patents. When an applicant wishes to claim the right of priority as to a claim or claims of the application on the basis of an application for an inventor's certificate in such a country under 35 U.S.C. 119>(d)&lt;, [last paragraph (as amended July 28, 1972),] the applicant or his or her attorney or agent, when submitting a claim for such right as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, shall include an affidavit or declaration including a specific statement that, upon an investigation, he or she has satisfied himself or herself that to the best of his or her knowledge the applicant, when filing his or her application for the inventor's certificate, had the option to file an application either for a patent or an inventor's certificate as to the subject matter of the identified claim or claims forming the basis for the claim of priority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15.

See &sect;1.618 for return of unauthorized and improper papers in interferences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

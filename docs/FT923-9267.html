			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / BMA critical of fees for health advisers THE British Medical Association yesterday strongly criticised the government for employing expert advisers on nutrition and health who accepted payments from food and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The BMA said the practice undermined public confidence in the quality of government advice. The association was responding to the disclosure by the Department of Health that many of its 43 outside advisers on food and health had received personal payments from food and pharmaceutical manufacturers or were responsible for research projects funded by these companies. Dr Fleur Fisher, head of the BMA's professional and scientific division, said: 'The mildest thing one can say is that it looks extraordinarily ill-advised to involve people with links with these industries. It undermines the credibility of the experts' reports in people's minds.' Mr Derek Jackson, director of the Coronary Prevention Group, said experts should be banned from sitting on government advisory committees if they received income from any organisation with a vested interest in the results of the committees' work. The BMA and the Coronary Prevention Group particularly criticised advisers who received personal payments from industry. Dr Fisher said industrial funding of research was unavoidable, while Mr Jackson said such funding should be accepted only if the research was not intended to serve the interests of individual companies. Most of the department's advisers are qualified doctors and academics. Thirteen of them declared receiving personal payments from food and pharmaceutical companies for consultancy and other services, while 15 said they were responsible for research or training projects funded by these industries. Several advisers declared both types of commercial interest. Only 19 said they had none. The advisers sit on the committee on medical aspects of food policy (Coma), the department's main expert body, and on panels dealing with issues including cardiovascular work, diets of the elderly, child nutrition and novel foods. According to the register of commercial interests published by the department, one member of its working group on the weaning diet, Mr RA Hendey, is a full-time employee of Nestle, the world's largest producer of baby foods. Dr Fisher expressed astonishment that he should be employed as a government adviser. The register shows that Dr Roger Whitehead, who chaired a landmark report on diet and nutrition published by the department last year, is a member of the council of the Nestle Foundation. Dr Whitehead, director of the Dunn clinical research centre in Cambridge, is also a paid adviser to the Milk Marketing Board. The register does not give the value of payments. Professor David Hull of Nottingham University Medical Hospital, who received money from Nutricia, a Dutch food group, said the exact amounts were not of legitimate public interest. The department said it required all advisers to register their commercial interests when appointed and to abstain from discussions on topics in which they had a personal financial interest. It saw no need for any changes in the rules. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said publication of the register marked an advance in open government. However, several advisers said the information contained in the register was collected more than a year ago. The department could not explain why the register had not been disclosed until now.</p>

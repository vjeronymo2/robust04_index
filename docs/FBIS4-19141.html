			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "A Few Bombs and No Strategy"] </F>   [Text] Unlike before the ultimatum for Sarajevo, there was  no endless nightly NATO session this time. This time, the bombs  were dropped in passing, as it were, despite the fact that the  attacks on the Serbian ground positions were a more dramatic  precedent than the downing of the aircraft in February. UN  Commander Michael Rose called for air support; his boss in New  York approved the operation; and NATO dispatched two U.S. F-16  fighters from Italy to Gorazde, which were followed by more  attacks on Monday [11 April].    The pilots dropped three normal 250-kg bombs on Sunday,  which  hit two tanks. It was as simple as that. A look at the  tactical side should sober up a little all those who have always  rejected an armed intervention with military arguments. They  claimed that the territory is too broken and that the targets  are too mobile to be discerned and hit. In fact, NATO is quite  familiar with the territory and the targets. During the  shelling of Gorazde, it was not even necessary to use  sophisticated weapons for the minibattle. The attack was  carried out in the same way as that of 1917 -- with aircraft in  the air and UN observers on the ground who determined the  targets and passed on the coordinates.    One should not yet speak of a success after the isolated  attacks on Sunday and Monday. A "real" war is a thousand times  more difficult -- not least because the most stupid opponent  also learns from his defeats and acts in a cleverer way the next  time. Yet the downing of the four Serbian planes at the end of  February and the air strikes at the beginning of the week have  shown that there are military options that may have the desired  political effect if a credible NATO ultimatum alone led to an  easing of the Serbian stranglehold of Sarajevo in February.    Still, one cannot really be happy about what happened -- for  numerous and very different reasons. First of all, it is  obvious that U.S. aircraft took the initiative in both cases.  Are there no F-16 fighters in the European arsenals? Well,  there are large numbers -- which is a sad symbol indeed. In  spite of the fact that Bosnia is not situated in the Rocky  Mountains, the Europeans seem to lack the required courage and  cooperation. The objection is correct that the large UN  contingents of the British and the French on the ground are  facing the biggest risk in the event of a Serbian retaliation.  However, a decision has to be made: Either one accepts the  hostage fate and renounces military gestures -- or one makes it  clear to the Serbs, including those in Belgrade, what they are  facing in the event of such an adventure. The "escalation  dominance" (jargon for the "stronger battalions") does not lie  on the side of the Serbs.    Second: Why, for such a long time, have NATO and the United  Nations allowed the Serbs to gradually conquer the official  "protected zone" of Gorazde? Washington in particular only  acted after pursuing a zig-zag course for months. It was the  Pentagon that conveyed the impression of a "green light" to the  Serbs (as opposition leader Dole pointed out) by making  statements that sounded as though the United States was not at  all interested in Gorazde. However, it was easy to foresee that  the Serbs would do two things after their forced withdrawal from  Sarajevo: Test the resolve of the Europeans again and make up  for their loss.    One must now ask the fundamental question: What is to be  done? The hesitant attitude in Gorazde has shown that the West  does not act, but only react -- at the last minute. We know the  reasons, which are weighty indeed: Differences of opinion, lack  of leadership, the attitude of the Germans who want the others  to take the lead, and the legitimate fear of a "Beirut in the  Balkans." Also, peace cannot be achieved by dropping bombs in  this inferno. But those who issue guarantees that turn out to be  a mere bluff after several weeks -- as happened in Gorazde --  will not achieve anything. Moreover, sudden strikes out of the  blue are no strategy either.    What can the West do now? It can certainly not produce peace  like a rabbit out of a diplomat's hat. Yet it might prevent the  Serbian imperialism from triumphing. It might curb the military  advantage of the Serbs with well-dosed and predictable force --  but no more. Like in Kurdistan, protection zones must really be  protected. In this way, the insight might grow in Bosnia and  Belgrade that the war must after all be transferred to the  negotiating table after two years.    It is a matter of course that the Russians must also be  involved in the talks so that they are not offended and  undermine what is also in their interest: Peace in the Balkans.  (Boris Yeltsin has already complained to President Clinton in a  piqued manner and demanded "consultation between Moscow and  Washington prior to such decisions.") It also goes without  saying that Muslims and Croats must not be free to wage wars of  conquest. The West must not unconditionally support one side or  the other. Washington and its allies may not be able to pursue  such a complicated policy over a longer period. However, a  peace policy based on hesitation and a zig-zag course are not  useful concepts either.</p>

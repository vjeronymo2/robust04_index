			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Muslim Brotherhood Deputy General Guide Mustafa </F> Mashhur: "Brothers, Seek God's Aid and Endure."]    [Text] Islam is not a religion of individuals but a  religion of a united nation, joined by one qibla [direction of  prayer]. It is like one body and for this reason, the form of  address in the Koran is illustrated by God Almighty's words: "O  Ye Who Believe."    The prophet, may God's peace and prayers be with him, said:  "He who shows no concern for the affairs of Muslims is not one  of them."    Now we see Muslims everywhere being persecuted, driven from  their homes, imprisoned, tortured, even killed, and the honor of  their women is violated. No one moves to defend them. Contrast  this with the example of the woman who, facing aggression during  the rule of al-Mu'tasim [Abbasid caliph], shouted "I appeal to  al-Mu'tasim". And the caliph sent an army to defend her. The  cause of today's events is that there is no Islamic state or  caliphate to defend the Muslims. The Islamic nation's union was  broken when the caliphate was overthrown. This caused Imam  [Hasan] al-Banna to form the Muslim Brotherhood and proclaim its  two goals:    First, the Islamic homeland must be freed from all foreign  domination, this being a natural human right that is denied only  by an unjust ruler or tyrannical oppressor.    Second, a free Muslim state must be established in this free  homeland, acting in line with Islam's rules, applying its social  system, proclaiming its righteous principles, and propagating  its wise call to the people. Unless such a state appears, all  Muslims will be sinful, responsible in the eyes of God Almighty  for their failure to establish it.    Al-Banna said: "You are a new spirit flowing in this  nation's heart, reviving it with the Koran. You are a new light  dissipating the darkness of materialism with God's knowledge.  Without exaggeration, it is only right that you should feel  that you are shouldering this burden when everyone else has  abandoned it."    Al-Banna, may God rest his soul, expected the Brotherhood to  suffer ordeals, be accused of the most heinous offenses, and to  be portrayed in a very ugly light by those in power. He said  the time of testing might be lengthy but God has promised  victory and rewards. He pointed out that despite the obstacles,  there were factors of success, as illustrated by the strength of  the call, the world's need for it, and God's support. No  obstacle can face these factors of success.  <H5>  An Unjustified Campaign and False Accusations </H5>   I remembered al-Banna's words when I saw the recent  unjustified security and media campaigns against the Muslim  Brotherhood and the drive to falsely accuse it of crimes. This  is happening even though several officials formerly spoke well  of the Brotherhood and said it was innocent of violence. In an  earlier article, I recounted the Brotherhood's stances since its  establishment and the ordeals and false accusations it suffered,  but which it was innocent of. I refuted many false accusations,  such as our being called terrorists and extremists. I noted the  attempt to blur the distinction between the Brotherhood and  other groups and felt that this blurring was intentional. In  this article I wish to clarify matters and state that we carry  out our activities with moderation and through the state's  institutions. I also wish to remind the brothers of the nature  of their call, which I have already served for 56 years, 20 of  them in jail.    Relying on Imam al-Banna's sayings, I wish to assert to the  brothers that their path is a sound one and the accusations  against them unfounded. I also wish to make it clear to the  public that the Muslim Brothers, who have suffered much for the  sake of Islam and in upholding its principles, cannot possibly  violate its teachings or its methods. In this they follow the  example of the prophet, may God's prayers and peace be with him,  and his companions, may they reside in God's pleasure. The  prophet used to instruct the Muslims in Mecca--who were injured,  tortured, and killed--to endure and remain steadfast. He  carried to them the glad tidings that God would grant victory to  His religion. This actually came to pass when the Arabian  Peninsula was purged of idolatry and false Gods, the Jews were  driven off, Persia was conquered, the Byzantines were defeated,  darkness was lifted, and light was spread.    We must be optimistic. We must preserve the hope that the  future is for this religion, no matter how much time it takes or  how numerous the obstacles. Let us seek God's aid and endure.  This was the commandment of Moses, may God's peace be with him,  to his nation after the world accused them of corruption on  earth to incite people against them.    Moses said to his people: "Pray for help from God and wait  in patience and constancy, for the earth is God's to give as a  heritage to such of his servants as he pleaseth; and the end is  best for the righteous." [Koranic verse]    The promise of victory was fulfilled. "And we made a people  who were considered weak the inheritors of the land in both East  and West, lands whereon we sent down our blessings." [Koranic  verse]  <H5>  Endurance, Steadfastness, and Avoidance of Provocation </H5>   Muslim Brothers: Whether people recognize you or not, you  have performed your Islamic work in response to your God's order  and in compliance with your Islamic creed. Your aim is to  please God, whether people are pleased with you or not, and  whether you are harmed or not. You are not more noble than the  prophet and his companions, who were subjected to harm, torture,  and murder but endured and remained firm. They were granted  victory by God; it is God, the wise and mighty, who grants  victory. Be assured that these materialistic forces that are  trying to impose themselves will fail. It is not a matter of  size and equipment, but one of truth and falsehood. Nothing is  true except that which comes from God, namely, the religion God  accepts: (The religion before God is Islam), and (if anyone  desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted  of him, and in the hereafter he will be in the ranks of those  who have lost all spiritual good), and (it is not ye who slew  them; it was God: when thou threwest a handful of dust, it was  not thy act, but God's), and (Thus doth God show forth truth and  vanity. For the scum disappears like froth cast out, while that  which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth), and  (Nay, we hurl the truth against falsehood, and it knocks out its  brain, and behold falsehood doth perish) [Koranic verses].    Muslim brothers: Endure, stand fast, and be proud of your  affiliation with Islam and of your work to restore its glory,  entity, and mastery. Be careful not to be provoked into an  action that conflicts with the teachings of your God. The  strong ones do not react emotionally, but control themselves  when they are angry. Nothing will happen to us except what God  wants to happen to us. He is our master, and he wants good for  us, although it may look evil (but it is possible that ye  dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing  that is bad for you. But God knoweth and ye know not) [Koranic  verse].    We have been subjected to harm, torture, imprisonment, and  killing, but God helped us endure. The credit for this  endurance does not go to ourselves, but first and foremost to  God. Some of us stayed 20 years in prison under various kinds  of pressure without their resolve being shaken. Among those is  his eminence the current [Muslim Brotherhood] general guide,  Muhammad Hamid Abu-al-Nasr. Here he is, continuing his march  firmly and resiliently, proud of his call, optimistic that the  future is for Islam (and we wished to be gracious to those who  were being oppressed on the land, to make them leaders in faith  and make them heirs, to establish a firm place for them in the  land) [Koranic verse]. Remember the advice imam Hasan al-Banna  gave you: "Believe in God and be proud of knowing him and  depending on him. Do not fear anyone but him, perform the  duties he imposed on you, and avoid what he asked you to avoid."    O people, know that no one is more loyal to the homeland  than  the youths of the Muslim Brotherhood. They regard their service  to their homeland as a religious duty through which they get  closer to God; they are not after personal or material gains.    The martyr imam said: Know, brothers, that your call is  innocent and fair; it goes beyond personal interests and  disdains material gains.    He also said: We would like our nation--and all Muslims are  our nation--to know that they are more dear to us than  ourselves, and that we love to sacrifice ourselves for their  might, glory, dignity, religion, and aspirations. He also said:  We are for you, beloved ones, not for others, and we will never  be against you.  <H5>  "This is Our Religion, and This is Our Policy" </H5>   Imam al-Banna responded to the claim about separation of  religion and politics by saying: If you are asked what you  advocate, say: We advocate Islam, which Muhammad, God's prayers  and peace be upon him, has brought. The Government is part of  Islam and freedom is one of its duties. If you were told this  is politics, say: This is Islam and we do not know of such  divisions. He says on another subject in response to those who  claim that we hide behind religion: "Our kinfolk, we call upon  you with the Koran in our right hand, the Prophet's teachings in  our left hand, and the good actions of our predecessors as our  example. We call upon you to get into Islam, the teachings of  Islam, the rules of Islam, and the guidance of Islam. If you  considered this politics, then this is our policy. If someone  who calls on you to adopt these principles is regarded as a  politician, then we are the most veteran in politics, thank God.  If you choose to call this politics, then call it what you want.  Names will not harm us when the purpose is clear."    Brothers, seek God's help, be patient, and have confidence  in  your Lord and his support and defense. Have confidence in your  course, creed, and program. Know that victory comes with  patience and that relief comes after hardship. Remember what  Imam al-Banna said: "A man is tested by his patience,  persistence, and consistent serious work. Whoever of you wants  to pick a fruit before it is ripe or cut a flower before its  time, he will not be doing the right thing, and it would be  better for him to seek another calling. Whoever maintains  patience with me until the seed grows, the tree matures, and the  fruit becomes ripe for picking, his reward will be with God; and  the reward of those who do good will not be forgotten. Either  victory and sovereignty or martyrdom and happiness."    Brothers, know that God asked us to have sincere intentions  and be well prepared and leave the results of our actions to  Him. Our Prophet, God's prayers and peace be upon him, says:  "This religion is solid, so tread carefully in its path;  overzealousness yields puny results."    Brothers, know that your group is like a tree planted by the  martyred imam and irrigated by his blood and the blood of  martyrs before and after him, making its roots grew deeper, its  trunk grow stronger, and its branches spread farther. It has  become difficult for its enemies to kill, and it has started to  give fruit all the time, God willing.    Remember that Imam al-Banna said that "either you are in the  call or out, and if the call is not in you, it will be in  others, 'and if you turn back from the bath, God will substitute  in your stead another people; then they would not be like you'  [Koranic verse]."    Let everyone who assists in the oppression of others, even  by  a word (as a journalist), by the adoption of a law (as deputies  of the People's Assembly), or by harming and torturing (as a  soldier), let them know that they are responsible before God for  all this, and that those they assist will not be different  before God. Let everyone know that oppression is darkness on  Judgement Day and that God listens to the prayers of the  oppressed. Those who are detained unjustly, their relatives and  children will continue to ask God to punish the oppressors, and  God will answer their prayers. All those who collaborate in  injustice will regret their actions, but at a time when regret  will be useless. God be my witness, I have conveyed the  message. "Think not that God doth not heed the deeds of those  who do wrong." [Koranic verse]</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOSTER-CARE NEEDS IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> We have all read of the critical need for foster-care homes in Orange County.  Children languish in Orangewood for lack of available foster families to place  them with, we are told. My husband and I are licensed foster parents in Orange  County and had a 4-year-old girl living with us in 1987 and '88. After she left  to live with her grandparents, we took a short break.  </P> <P> In January, 1989, we called county children's services to say we were ready for  another placement. We waited and waited but no one contacted us. Over the next  few months, we called again to check on the delay and were told that the social  workers would be in touch. Last month, eight months after our first call, we  gave up and decided to relinquish our license. As I explained our decision to  an official in the licensing department, she was incredulous that this could  happen. So were we.  </P> <P> My husband and I have no ill will regarding this situation. My only purpose in  writing this letter is to alert those in Orange County Children's Services who  are involved in formulating procedures for placement of foster children that  there is a problem. I have no doubt of the real need for foster care, and I  hate to think that there may be other foster homes not being utilized. Perhaps  this letter will spark an interest in finding out what went wrong here, so it  doesn't happen again.  </P> <P> LINDA SNIDER  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

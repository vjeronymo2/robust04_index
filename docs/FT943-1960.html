			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (8): Rise in interest rates stems flow - US corporate issuers have been taking a break After feasting for more than two years on some of the lowest US interest rates since the 1960s, corporate issuers have been taking a break this year from the US equity market. The break, however, has been enforced upon them primarily by circumstances: namely, the rise in US interest rates since February, which has unsettled the stock market and steered many investors away from equities towards cash. Yet the decline in equity offerings has not been as dramatic as some investment bankers on Wall Street may have feared earlier this year, when interest rates were first rising and equities appeared to be heading into a prolonged bear market phase. According to statistics supplied by Securities Data, the New Jersey financial information group, between the start of the year and September 7, just over Dollars 20bn was raised by companies through IPOs in the US market. That compared with Dollars 24.2bn in the same period of 1993. There has been a bigger decline in secondary share offerings, however. Stock worth almost Dollars 22bn was issued up to September 7 this year, compared to almost Dollars 30bn over the same stretch a year ago. Yet the decline in IPOs and secondary offerings is not that worrying if the fact that 1993 was a record year for equity deals is taken into consideration. Taking the IPO and secondary issuance together, the volume of equity sales in the US declined only 22 per cent from its all-time peak last year, a solid performance against the background of a significant reversal in the direction of interest rates and share prices. A lot of the credit for restricting the decline in equity issues this year should go to foreign companies, which have continued in large numbers to tap the US markets for capital in spite of the deterioration in the interest rate climate. In the year to September 7, foreign companies sold Dollars 3.5bn of stock in the US market via IPOs, up from Dollars 3.4bn during the same period of 1993. Secondary offerings by foreign companies, meanwhile, have raised Dollars 4.7bn so far this year, compared to Dollars 2.8bn a year ago. Activity in the non-US sector of the market has been even more buoyant if stock issued in the private placement market under Rule 144a of securities law - which makes it easier for foreign companies to sell their stock to US investors - is considered. According to Securities Data, Dollars 3bn was raised by foreign companies on the 144a market in the first half of this year, up sharply from the Dollars 970m raised in the first six months of 1993. With foreign IPOs, secondary offerings and 144a issues, 'this is a more non-US issuance oriented market than it ever has been before,' says Mr Bob Nau, head of equity capital markets and syndication at Salomon Brothers. The strength of foreign stock offerings has been driven by a variety of factors, including the growing willingness of US investors to diversify into non-US assets, the rush to privatise nationalised industries in Latin America and the former Soviet bloc countries, and a trend toward more private companies from overseas going public. In addition, US investors are becoming increasingly eager to buy stock issued by foreign companies because they believe that the potential for achieving solid returns on their equity holdings is greater overseas than at home. 'There is a perception that you have stronger fundamental growth rates in certain overseas markets,' says Mr Nau. Although some observers say that the heavy volume of non-US equity issues is all the more remarkable because of the weakness of the dollar, the currency's travails did not really have that great an impact upon foreign issuers' plans. This is primarily because the dollar has fallen sharply this year against the Japanese yen and German mark, but held up well against most other currencies. Foreign companies selling their shares in the US have not emanated from Japan or Germany, but principally from Latin America, where local currencies are tied closely to the dollar. While the non-US sector of the equity market has thrived, domestic issuance has clearly taken a knock from rising interest rates and poorly performing share prices. Yet the fact that the past few years have seen such a big rush of companies to the equity market means that some sort of slowdown was inevitable. As one investment banker puts it: 'A lot of companies needing equity got their plates filled in 1992 and 1993.' Investors have also become more choosy. Until this year, the big cash-rich institutions such as mutual and pension funds were snapping up anything that came their way. Now the the climate is less benign, investors are looking for quality. Asked which deals are the easiest to sell today, Mr Nau responds: 'Stocks with a clear cyclical participation, ie where investors can point to factors that indicate they are going to be direct participants in the economic recovery. Also, telecommunications and information company stocks, and, now that the bond market seems to have stabilised, stocks with high yields, such as real estate stocks.' This flight to quality is likely to be a feature of the new issues market for the rest of the year, but Wall Street is cautiously optimistic that activity will pick up steadily in the months to come. One possible source of new business could be the booming mergers and acquisitions market: 'For those companies using cash to make acquisitions, there will be companion but lagging equity deals,' says Mr Nau. Above all, the recent rebound in share prices should instil confidence in those companies considering issuing new equity, and especially those which postponed offerings earlier this year because of unfavourable market conditions. The market's rally has also attracted new money into mutual funds, which will have to invest it somewhere. With the Federal Reserve looking as if it will now put monetary policy on hold and bond prices stabilising, stocks recovering and mutual fund coffers filling, the outlook is brightening almost daily. And if foreign companies continue to raise equity financing the way they have done recently, 1994 could turn out to be a surprisingly good year for the US capital markets.</p>

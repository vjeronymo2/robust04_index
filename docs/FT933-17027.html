			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Edinburgh hotels shut doors on Le Pen MR Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, has been forced to cancel a meeting in Edinburgh next week for 14 right-wing Euro-MPs, after hotels there refused to host it. Mr Le Pen is instead to try to hold the meeting in Dublin. It is one of a controversial series of alleged work meetings of the European Right group in the European Parliament, being financed by EC taxpayers. Parliament officials in Brussels said the Edinburgh Sheraton cancelled the Le Pen group's reservations, and that parliamentary staff had refused to help in finding an alternative. Edinburgh's city council had also denied the group access to its premises. Mr Le Pen was seeking reservations at the Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel in Dublin, they said. The European Right group issued a statement yesterday protesting that the hoteliers of Edinburgh were forced by threats to refuse any meeting in Scotland. Mr Glyn Ford, a leader of the UK Labour party in the European Parliament, said he was 'delighted the people of Scotland have shunned this odious man', and was sure Dubliners would also be outraged. The Edinburgh cancellation follows mounting controversy over the cost and purpose of the Le Pen group's meetings.</p>

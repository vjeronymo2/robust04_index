			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (2): New political landscape emerges - Aftermath of the presidential elections / Mexico's foremost challenge is to build a workable democracy The August presidential election created a radically new political landscape, one which should allow the country's ills to be faced with the strength that only a legitimate government can provide. Even more important, by voting in such huge numbers (almost 78 per cent of registered voters), Mexicans discredited violent attempts to grab power, of which there have been many examples in the last few months. The impressive turnout of voters also indicated that Mexicans want to pursue the change that has taken place over the last decade, but that they want it to deliver benefits to all, right now. The question is whether the government can deliver. The old, authoritarian political system, established in the late 1920s, together with a closed, protected and subsidised economy, hindered Mexicans from attaining higher standards of living, while preventing them from building a political system that would have provided them with a proper system of justice as well as influence over the political decisions that affect their lives. The old 'certainty' was replaced, since the uprising in the southern state of Chiapas on January 1, by extreme uncertainty. The traditional rules and structures had ceased to function and Mexicans suddenly found themselves lacking institutions that could help resolve the newly-found difficulties. While the electoral process was hastily restructured to make it possible to hold proper elections in August  - which were much more successful than virtually anyone had anticipated  - the environment in which these were held was conducive neither to clean electoral competition nor economic development. The task ahead is clear: by the end of the next administration, Mexico should have in place a set of institutions  - or at least strong foundations for them  - which will secure continuous peaceful transfers of power in government, which allow Mexicans to settle disputes in a non-violent way and with full regard for the law, and that, in conjunction with an economic policy that induces rapid economic growth with price stability, make it possible for Mexicans to get closer to the levels of per capita incomes of their richer brethren in south-east Asia. There would be many benchmarks for this process: First, there would have to be, once and for all, local and state elections that are undisputable. This would mean not only that rules and realities are impeccable in terms of the 'level playing field' that they provide, but also that all political parties cease to make every election a contest, at best, of non-institutional strength and, at worst, of reckless self-interest. Second, the government and all political parties would have to come to terms with the new realities of the economy as well as with the need to work together in the process of governing. This would mean that the government, in practice, recognises that the opposition parties represent a significant portion of the population (after all, close to 50 per cent of the electorate voted for them) and that, as a result, they should have a say in the process of government. Up to now, for example, all agencies in the legislature that are supposed to keep watch on the government have been in the hands of the government party. Those should unequivocally be held by opposition parties. As regards the economy, the struggle for power over the last few years has been extended to this arena, even though the three leading political parties, at least formally, vow to pursue similar economic policies. The main case in point is the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The PRD, the left-of-centre political party, launched an extraordinary campaign in Mexico as well as in the US and Canada, aimed at defeating Nafta. This was not so much because it opposed the treaty, but because it wanted to oust PRI from government. If a strong turnabout of the economy is to be reached, all political groupings would have to be party to efforts necessary to transform Mexico's productive base. By the same token, Mexico will probably not experience a long-lasting recovery  - measured in terms of decades as in south-east Asia  - unless it faces up to the dual problem of unequal income distribution and dramatically low levels of education in a manner fully compatible with a market economy. In other words, until Mexicans break away from their past, they will not reach the level of development they desire and deserve. Third, while the dramatic change in the elections was due to the one factor that nobody predicted  - an extraordinary voter turnout  - none of the parties cares that much about what happens to the average Mexican. The absence of re-election at all levels of government means that almost no politician pays any attention to the people, except in either a general way or when targeting individual interests they want to tap. Yet, it is Mexicans at large that will make the difference in the next several years and that will determine whether the economy can experience a strong surge of productivity and growth or not. For most Mexicans, the hard reality of life is that there is no clean and fair judicial system, there are no means to fight corruption, and the most basic rights are too limited to be properly called 'rights.' A drastic change at the level of government and in the negotiations among the political parties should introduce changes that will improve the people's lot. But that will only take place when incentives are in place to drive politicians, the government, and the political parties to cater to popular needs. Given the situation in Mexico, that would probably require a new constitutional framework, one that is clean and non-contradictory; in other words, something that can be turned into reality, as opposed to today's legal framework, which is neither respected nor realistic. When that happens, Mexico will have a working democracy. The writer is the Director of the Centro de Investigacon para el Desarrollo, a development think tank, in Mexico City.</p>

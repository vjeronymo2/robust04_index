			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the </F> National Assembly of the People's Government, ANPP, to the  special session of the ANPP, at the Havana Convention Center, on  2 May -- recorded]    [Text] I believe that not only the discussion of this  special session, but the entire national debate preceding it,  have clearly confirmed the will of our people to persevere in  their chosen path, to continue resisting and fighting to save  our socialist revolution. I also believe that we have to be  fully convinced that the only way out of the special period is  the revolutionary, socialist, steadfast path we are undertaking.  This way out, of course, demands effort, work, and sacrifice.  However, that effort, work, and sacrifice are worthy. Comrade  Estruch [Deputy Luis Estruch Lacano] pointed out several  important things which serve to compare Cuba's situation at the  time of the triumph of the Revolution with the immense  transformation that has taken place, particularly, in comparison  with the reality of today's difficult moment.    I believe that our people have confirmed their commitment to  the ideals of socialism and their rejection of certain dogmatic  ideas being forced upon today's world, and in Cuba's case, from  abroad. Capitalism will not be Cuba's future because capitalism  was its painful and sad past. Our people will never return to  the past.    Listening to Estruch, I remembered certain elements which I  believe our people remember and understand. Our people are a  cultured, intelligent people, a well-educated people as result  of all that effort alluded to by Estruch and other comrades.  Since I agree with Estruch that part of this great battle for  the national economy -- to correct our finances and stimulate  the economy -- is also a political battle, it seems right to  refresh our memory with some information which clearly  illustrates the reality of that capitalist past, and also  illustrates -- and we can not forget this because the special  period irritates us, pains us, and causes daily difficulties for  everyone -- that a special period, a difficult and anguished  living, a true hell, was the life the immense majority of our  men and women knew for most of Cuba's history until 1959.    I have here certain points of reference, not produced by us,  by the revolutionary movement, but by unsuspected sources. This  document, this book, was not published by the Revolution but by  the Batista regime. It is the Population, Housing, and Electoral  Census of the Republic of Cuba of January 1953.    This other book was not published by Cuban revolutionaries  either. It is an official document of the U.S. Government from  that period aimed at U.S. investors and includes a study of the  Cuban economy conducted three years after the Batista census,  and has among other things certain criticisms of results of the  census.    In the study conducted by Batista's authorities, we see  certain data which portray Cuba, as a country difficult to  imagine for today's Cubans. The census partially covered the  issue of housing. There were, nationwide, 1,250,594 houses  ranging from the most luxurious mansions to the most modest  shacks of the most humble of our peasants. I will give some of  the data included in this report. Regarding construction, the  authorities classified it in a list beginning with masonry,  cement slab roof, and floors of a higher quality than plain  cement construction. The list continued down to a humble thatch  hut or something similar and earth floors.    In the Republic of Cuba, according to the 1953 census, 27.8  percent of the houses were masonry and cement construction and  32.2 percent were thatch and earth floors. Of course, in rural  areas, there were more than double the amount in this lower  category. However, in the urban areas, in our large cities, 10.2  percent of the houses, according to the 1953 census, had earth  floors and had no other material for roofs and walls than thatch.    The aqueduct reached only 35.2 percent of the houses and a  little more than half the urban houses. Sanitary service was  available to only 28 percent of the houses, including 32.8  percent of urban houses.    The same happens here. They do a classification ranging from  houses with indoor sanitary service to private latrines, and  communal latrines, and ending with the no sanitary service  category. Some 23.2 percent of the homes fell in this category.  Some 45.6 percent of all the homes in Cuba lacked baths or  shower facilities. Barely 48 percent of the homes had  electricity. However, 75.2 percent of the homes nationwide  lacked refrigerators, iceboxes, or any equipment to conserve  food, including 62.5 percent of the urban homes.    The U.S. Commerce Department study confirms that the  situation remained unchanged three years later. This is  regarding housing. Regarding education, the 1953 census reveals  that 23.6 percent of the population was illiterate.    With good reason, the U.S. Commerce Department study  criticizes the accuracy of the Batista census regarding this  aspect. First of all, it points out that the people who did the  census simply asked the people if they knew how to read and  write. Some 23.6 percent responded no. However, the American  researchers pointed out that more revealing data is found in the  census. Such as that illiteracy was much higher among 10- to  14-year-olds, which was 31.8 percent; that 31 percent of the  entire Cuban population had not had any formal education; and  that only 11 percent had gone beyond primary school education.  The Americans' conclusion was that true illiteracy was much  higher than that reflected in the official Cuban census and that  the republic was regressing given the extremely low school  attendance level. For example, of 2,459,730 youths, individuals  between 5 and 24 years of age, 1,619,535 -- about half -- did  not receive any type of education in Cuba in 1953. From this we  have to deduce that in any event, illiteracy would continue to  increase if we interpret correctly the information provided by  the Batista government.    In 1956, the Americans pointed out other important  characteristics, we can even call them manipulations, of the  1953 census. First of all, it was conducted in the month of  January, in the midst of the sugarcane harvest, at the moment of  the highest economic activity and thus the information on the  workers, the poor would be higher than at any other time of the  year. In addition, in the U.S. study -- Investment in Cuba,  Basic Information for U.S. Businessmen, Commerce Department,  Washington, 1956 -- the Americans point out that in that period,  the first half of the decade of the 1950's, certain Cuban  economic indicators had had their best performance in comparison  with the republican period preceding it, and that the year with  the highest per capita income, at the time, was 1952 -- the year  before the census.    Those who extol the advantages of capitalism, and try to  portray that system as every man's alternative, better not  harbor any dreams because this American document explains that  in 1952 Cuba attained a third of the per capita income of the  states in the southeastern United States. There is something  even more revealing, Cuba's best year in terms of per capita  income, the apex of our capitalist development according to  them, was equivalent to half the per capita income of  Mississippi in its worst year.    In other words, according to them, when Cuba attained its  highest point, it had reached half the level of the worst year  of the poorest and most backward state in the United States,  Mississippi.    What does this top year of capitalism reveal to us?  Batista's  census did not concern itself much -- and this was also pointed  out by the Commerce Department study -- with unemployment and  workers conditions. However, they missed certain indicators.  They, for example, found out the number of weeks worked by the  people covered by the census in 1952 -- the famous apex year of  capitalist development according to the Yankees. Some 36.8  percent of the Cuban labor force had worked every week in 1952,  and the great majority of those who had worked or looked for  jobs in that year of capitalist glory, 48.7 percent of the  workers, had not worked even 10 weeks.    We would have to ask if it was a pure coincidence of history  that at the time when the reality of our country was described  in this manner -- poverty-stricken, lugubrious, painful -- by  the Batista era census, Fidel Castro and a group of youths were  preparing to assault the Moncada Barracks and rekindle the  revolutionary movement of our people. Was it possible to  continue in that lamentable, painful state of the better period,  of the top development of capitalism in Cuba, when that was the  best it did for our people?    Could anyone be surprised if in 1956, when the Commerce  Department issued this study, Fidel Castro and his comrades were  preparing to land in our fatherland and restart the postponed  but never interrupted war of our people to put an end to that  hell capitalism brought for the majority of our people? Can  anyone think that this people could prefer that type of society  which reserved for the majority ignorance, lack of education,  poverty, and misery?    The 1956 study also covers other aspects of the economy  which  the Batista census had overlooked. In its analysis of our  countryside, it reveals that less than eight percent of the  farms occupied three fourths of the arable land in Cuba, and  that less than half of one percent of those farms controlled a  third of the arable lands. That is the phenomena of the  latifundia.    This explains other data, other realities, which other  entirely reliable reports also revealed at that time. I refer to  a third document. This study by the Catholic University  Association of Havana, which was not in any way a radical group,  was conducted in 1957, a year after the U.S. Commerce Department  study. They discovered, regarding the farmers' nutrition, that  the percentage that eat meat was four percent; fish, less than  one percent; eggs, 2.12 percent; milk, 11.22 percent; bread,  3.36 percent; cornmeal, 7 percent; vegetables, zero percent. The  Catholic group also researched the health conditions of our  farmers and found higher percentages than those I just mentioned  regarding food. Tuberculosis, 14 percent; typhus, 13 percent;  intestinal parasitism, 36 percent; and malaria, 31 percent,  among the people polled.    The highest percentage included in this document results  from  asking the peasants what they desire the most, what is most  important for them, what they need the most. Some 73.46 percent  responded with one word: Work.    Can anyone be surprised that our people were at this time,  as  the Catholic researchers were conducting this study, persevering  in the struggle in the mountains and savannas to jostle free  from that regime. Is that society really an alternative for  anyone? Was it or was it not a special period without escape,  hope, justice, or equality endured by those peasants demanding  work, peasants pained by tuberculosis or malnutrition. Was this  not a true hell into which the immense majority of our  population was born, lived, and endured until death? Our people  not only remember but also, because they are a knowledgeable,  informed people, they know that millions upon millions of people  in this world also endure special periods without equality,  justice, escape, or hope. True hells are being experienced by  the peoples in many parts of the world.    This U.S. magazine published by THE MIAMI HERALD features on  the front page an issue of growing concern in the United States:  what they call the homeless. People who as a result of  capitalist measures have found it impossible to continue paying  rent and have ended up on the streets, the only place available.  This young woman on the front page with her two small daughters  is not worried about her salary, taxes, or even the cost of food  or salaries. The sign states that she will work for food. She  offers her labor for food for herself and her two daughters.  Poor woman, she is not thinking about how to pay for school  uniforms for her daughters or their school breakfast or lunch.  There is no school for those girls, nor is there a job for this  woman. She is simply bartering her labor for food -- that is on  the front page.    The inside, features a man whose sign reads: I am 74 years  old and destitute. I am a homeless person but not a bum. I have  worked since I was 14 years old. This is typical in capitalism  where a man, after working for 63 years, has no other  alternative but to stand on a city corner and beg.    There is something else that is very interesting. The text  explains that in 1990, according to the U.S. Census Office,  there where 228,621 homeless people. Certain liberal U.S.  organizations, of course, say that this figure does not reflect  the reality and that there were many more. However, I prefer to  focus on another aspect of this issue. There were over 228,000  homeless in 1990. In 1993, the same source, the U.S. Census  Office, estimates there were 2 million homeless. In other words,  between 1990 and 1993, according to their official data, the  number of homeless -- people such as this old man, this young  woman, these girls -- has increased tenfold. This coincides with  these difficult years we Cubans call the special period. I ask  myself: Is there a special period in the United States? Is  anyone imposing a financial, economic, and commercial blockade  on that country? Have the U.S. main trading partners  disappeared? Have their markets collapsed? Has any madman, any  Torricelli in this world, come up with a law to prohibit and  obstruct trade with the United States? What explains that  instead of improving, there has been a tenfold increase in those  people experiencing the living conditions of a special period in  the United States?    I also have here THE MIAMI HERALD edition of 20 March, right  at the time we were in the workers assemblies discussing,  analyzing collectively, and seeking means and ways to confront  our difficulties. I want to give you the example of financial  measures implemented capitalist style.    One day, a real estate company or some landlord of an  apartment building in the United States decided there had to be  a rent increase to improve the margin of profit and make the  corporation more efficient. Was a workers assembly summoned?  Were the tenants asked how much they ought to or could afford to  pay?    This article describes how the measure was taken. It was  simply this. [Knocks three times on the table] One night --  states one of the two boys interviewed -- there was a knock on  the door and someone told mom that the apartment rent was -- it  most be an extremely modest place because it has been a long  time since you could find anything but a small room for this  amount I am going to say -- $295 a month. This was the rent this  humble working woman was paying. Someone implemented that  measure [three knocks] and told her: From now on the rent is  $325 and that is that.    She had no other choice, stated her son: Mom sat both of us  down and told us that we were going to sleep on the streets  because the rent had gone up.    Measures such as this one, by the thousands, are adopted by  capitalism everyday, and these are the consequences, this  picture. The boys showed the reporter their home. As you can see  it is the underside of a bridge in Miami where they spent last  winter.    The text of the article cites another interesting fact. Not  about the homeless in general, but about homeless children in  Florida in particular. The number of homeless children in the  state, according to a study by a Florida university, was 50,000  in 1993. This is three times the number of children in Florida  living on the streets. [as heard] Are these children or are they  not living in a totally unfair special period because it is not  the result of any external factor upon that society but the  intrinsic characteristics of that society which result in some  living in opulence and dissipation while many others are denied  the most essential rights.    Comrades, we face the challenge of being able to continue to  resist, struggle, and make whatever sacrifices necessary to  preserve a society incomparably superior to the one being forced  upon us by those trying to turn into a universally mandatory  dogma that truly abominable life style and forms of human  interaction that ought to have been abandoned in prehistory. We  have no other alternative but to save this revolution, this  socialist endeavor, to overcome the current difficult period  with a revolutionary spirit, the socialist way because the  alternative is that past reflected by the Batista era census, or  the Yankee study, or the Catholic University Association. That  past is the present of hundreds of millions of people in this  world, such as these Americans I have referred to.    Finally, I have another publication from Florida. There is  great interest abroad regarding what happens in Cuba, regarding  the result of our efforts, our struggle to overcome the special  period. There are people, those who benefited from the misery  and poverty of the majority of Cubans, those who never underwent  any special period yet imposed it on the majority of the people  in the past, who harbor dreams and believe the time will come  again when they can return, regain their privileges, and once  more impose on the majority of the people that past which shall  never return.    I have here a copy of the SOUTH FLORIDA magazine which  contains several articles in this regard. The man on the left is  a former landowner. In the article he describes his mansion, of  course, it had sanitary hook-ups, showers, electricity, and  everything else. The mansion was so luxurious that he now  complains that his backyard is no longer private [word play on a  nursery rhyme]. It is filled with children playing, playing  sports because his large mansion is today a large school. On top  of this, he complains that there are even black and mulatto  children among them, colored people that were not even allowed  on the streets of his neighborhoods during the era of the  Batista census. He explains their plans so that upon their  return, once the revolution is defeated according to their  dreams, that school will be turned into a private mansion once  again. The name of the article is: This land is my land.    The article on the left [as heard] -- those with a good  memory perhaps remember the Cuban Landowners Association which  grouped the owners of the sugar mills. They have a group named  the Cuban Landowners Association in Exile. In the article they  explain their plan. They plan to retake their mills, to return  the lands to the landowners, to once again place our peasants in  the conditions which the Catholic Association mentioned, to make  over 65 percent of the population hope for jobs.    We have to defend this project under the particularly  difficult conditions this country faces because, without a  shadow of a doubt, capitalism would mean a return to that past  we knew. However, it would be amplified by the hate, ire, and  fury which that minority would try to impose on our people, that  minority which today dreams of returning and was responsible for  making life for the majority of us nothing but a perpetual  special period without hope or end.    Of course, in the workers assemblies, in every meeting  held, and in this ANPP session the Cuban people are telling  those people: You shall not pass. [applause]    Recently, our people commemorated the 125th anniversary of  the Guaimaro Assembly, six months after the beginning of our  first war of independence, six months after the beginning of the  only Cuban revolution, the one begun by Cespedes and fulfilled  by Fidel Castro, the patriots, the revolutionaries meet in that  tiny town in Camaguey to find the indispensable patriotic  consensus, to unite ideas and wills, to organize the struggle  under the terrible and difficult circumstance faced by our  people from the beginning. The Cuban patriots and  revolutionaries met without relinquishing the machete, without  relinquishing the struggle against Spanish colonialism, and as  our people were also confronting -- as foretold by Cespedes --  the threat of the U.S. policy seeking to take Cuba over.  Cespedes said that was the hidden agenda of their policy.    The Cuban people were capable of overcoming differences and  putting, above all, the ideal of an independent and just  fatherland, a fatherland rooted in human solidarity and equality.    Today, 125 years later, the Cuban people have recreated  Guaimaro everywhere, have revived the spirit of our forefathers,  and have been able to reason, discuss, and examine frankly our  points of view to unite ideas and wills. We have not held  academic debates, but fraternal discussions, and collective  analysis in the midst of the struggle and on behalf of the  struggle.    May Guaimaro's spirit live eternally among us. May we be  capable of continuing, like Cespedes, Agramonte, and all the men  of that generation, who sacrificed everything, that ideal of  independence and justice. May we continue to develop our  collective wisdom with the combat spirit of the men of Guaimaro,  in the struggle and for the struggle.    I believe and am convinced that this is the required route  for every patriot, and the route we will follow, and through it  we will attain victory, despite everything, despite all the  difficulties and sacrifices we might have to endure. Thank You  very much. [applause]</p>

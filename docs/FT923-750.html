			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Free of CGT I BOUGHT a flat in London in 1985 while working for a US bank in the UK. My employer provided rented accommodation and I bought the flat in case this perk fell away. It has since been let out for most of the time and I have never lived in it. In 1989, I got a job with a French bank and moved to Paris. Since I no longer need a base in London I want to sell the flat and buy something in France. Will I have to pay capital gains tax on any eventual profit? If you are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK at any time in the tax year (ending on April 5) in which the sale contract is made, you will be outside the scope of capital gains tax. The solicitor who acts for you in the sale will, of course, be able to guide you through the tax maze. You may like to ask your last UK tax office (or the Inland revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, UK WC2R 1LB) for copies of the free pamphlets CGT14 (Capital gains tax - an introduction) and IR58 (Going to work abroad). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

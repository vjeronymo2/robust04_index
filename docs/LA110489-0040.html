			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PIANIST SHURA CHERKASSKY RETURNS  </P> <P> Quirky, old-fashioned, highly personal and brilliantly colored, the pianism of  Shura Cherkassky reminds us of an age when keyboard celebrities actually had  distinct personalities, and none of them sounded like another.  </P> <P> Those days -- the early decades of this century -- are gone, but Cherkassky,  now 78, remains. Returning to Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena on Thursday  night, the Odessa-born musician demonstrated again the glory of old times.  </P> <P> It was not as deep, stormy or kaleidoscopic a demonstration as one might have  hoped, or as Cherkassky himself has given here in the past. The petite pianist  limited his repertory to one masterpiece and four charming trifles, adding two  more miniatures as encores after the program proper. He did not deal in  revelations this time around. Or in startling insights into the post-Romantic  era.  </P> <P> For all the wealth of detail and the touching moments Cherkassky brought to  Schumann's massive Fantasy, Opus 17, his cherishable performance fell far short  of the monumental.  </P> <P> Instead of creating dramatic heights, martial thunder and poetic self-communion  in these contrasting movements, the pianist settled for intimations and  indications of such. He did not conquer the territory so much as he walked over  it. Not surprisingly, our handkerchiefs remained unused.  </P> <P> But he caressed the living daylights out of Tchaikovsky's exquisite Theme and  Variations in F, Handel's "Harmonious Blacksmith" (the odd program-opener),  Rachmaninoff's G-minor Barcarolle, and his two encores, a sexy and insinuating  Tango in D by Albeniz-Godowsky and a straight-faced Tarantella of Chopin.  </P> <P> And he romped gamely, if with more than a fair share of clinkers, through the  innocent rhetoric and naive charms of Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody.  </P></p>

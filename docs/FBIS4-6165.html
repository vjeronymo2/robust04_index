			<p>CSO     [Text] MOF Circular Lifts Ban on Issuance of CP by  Life and Casualty Insurers--Goal Is Strengthening Insurer  Operations    The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has issued a circular  notifying  casualty and life insurance companies that the ban applicable to  them on the issuance of CP as a method for raising short-term  capital will be lifted by the 11th. In the report concerning a  review of the insurance industry, dated June 1992, the Insurance  Council, an advisory organ of the minister of finance,  recommended relaxation of capital procurement measures, leading  to the issuance of the recent circular implementing the pending  change. Issuance of commercial paper [CP] will provide life and  casualty insurers with flexibility in raising capital and the  industry views the change as enhancing their operating status.  The first batch of CP will be issued as early as next month.    In the past, the MOF has restricted the means by which life  and casualty insurers could raise capital based on the reason  that there was a need to preserve soundness in their financial  status. However, since cases where operating conditions could  decay because of the need to make concentrated payments to cover  claims in the event of an unforeseen disaster are conceivable,  the industry had stepped up its campaign for the lifting of  restrictions against issuance of CP as a means for raising  capital.    The Insurance Council had addressed the need to study  methods  of raising short-term capital through such means as the issuance  of CP under the condition that care should be exercised in  maintaining the financial soundness of the insurance industry.</p>

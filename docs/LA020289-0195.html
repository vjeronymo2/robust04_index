			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> FLAWS SHOW IN 'DIARY OF ANNE FRANK'  </P> <P> At one point in "The Diary of Anne Frank," a character tells Anne and her  family that they have no real notion of what is happening outside their hiding  place: The Nazi pogroms are in full goose-step throughout Europe, and even  Dutch Jews are being led to the concentration camps.  </P> <P> There's a pause while they reflect on this, a confirmation of their fears. But  soon enough it's back to the practical matters at hand: Where will this new  arrival sleep? Will he eat too much food? How will he get along with everybody?  How long does he have to stay? Survival outside is harrowing, but it can be an  ordeal inside as well.  </P> <P> There are several times when Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett's play, now in  repertory at Rancho Santiago College's Professional Actors Conservatory, seems  to only take an indirect interest in the Nazi nightmare that has forced the  Franks and their friends, the Van Daans, into a cramped Amsterdam attic.  </P> <P> What the writers found most compelling in 13-year-old Anne's diary were the  ways that 3 years of self-imprisonment affected those involved, how the  apparently normal, good people revealed their worst under the strain, and how  the truly noble remained noble.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, along with food and creature comforts, patience becomes scarce  -- for the audience as well as the characters. There are times when the play is  trivial: Flare-ups over sleeping and smoking habits, Anne's gabbiness and Mrs.  Van Daan's flirtations with Mr. Frank veer things into the cramped confines of  the mundane.  </P> <P> Sure, a young girl's mind would gravitate often toward the ordinary, but the  emphasis here -- even if it's meant to contrast with the terrible reality on  the outside, or to underscore how few people realized the extent of the German  threat -- is drastic. Jerry McGonigle's direction makes matters worse: He tends  to dwell on the daily doings and, in fact, amplifies them.  </P> <P> McGonigle does move to a higher level in a few poignant passages that feature  Susan Hamilton as Anne. When Anne is unable to burn the yellow Star of David  patch that the Germans have forced her to wear, we feel her religious  commitment and steadfast personality. When she giddily presents homemade  Hanukkah presents to everyone, we see her joy, her wit and her love.  </P> <P> But Hamilton, who looks at least 20, is hampered by having to play such a young  girl. She tries to compensate with hyperactive bounding about, coy looks and an  adolescent lilt to her voice, but most of the time it is all too arch. Not  surprisingly, she approaches the later scenes, when she begins to have womanly  feelings for 16-year-old Peter Van Daan, with more ease.  </P> <P> The rest of the cast varies in ability. Robert Allan Gray is a leaderly but  gentle Mr. Frank, and Chuck O'Connor delivers as the not-so-gracious new  arrival, Mr. Dussel. Brian Hickman is best of all as the shy, achingly  introspective Peter. A sense of low-key struggle is generated by David C.  Palmer's somber lighting, which complements Scott Nielsen's correctly confining  set.  </P> <P> 'THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK'  </P> <P> A Rancho Santiago College Professional Actors Conservatory production of the  Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett drama.

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Milk turns sour It did not require a profound knowledge of game theory to predict that the new mechanism for setting prices in the UK milk market could go badly wrong. After three rounds of a blind auction by Milk Marque, the co-operative that controls two-thirds of the country's milk production, the dairy industry was still bidding for more milk than was on offer. By stopping the process at that point, Milk Marque has in effect admitted that the auction process was flawed. Whether, as it argues, it called a halt before much of the industry bid itself out of business remains to be seen. Not only were milk purchasers prepared to take the bidding higher, the big dairy groups have offered a premium above the Milk Marque price to farmers prepared to supply them directly. But, in itself, this does not undermine the industry's claim that serious damage will be done by the new prices. The liquid milk business, where the likes of Northern Foods and Unigate make good returns, faces the smallest price increase, though it will be difficult to pass on much of the rise into the declining doorstep market or the price warring supermarkets. It is butter and cheese producers who will be hit hardest because their milk price was artificially low under the old regime. Returns here are already fairly meagre and the price rises proposed are likely to hasten a reduction in overcapacity. The banks have just decided to pull the plug on the Scottish Milk Marketing Board's Galloway Cheese Company. Unless Milk Marque is forced to relent, an early flotation of Dairy Crest looks out of the question.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRISON GUARDS GET CAPTIVITY COVERAGE  </P> <P> A union representing state prison guards said Friday that it has purchased  "captivity coverage" from Lloyd's of London that will pay benefits if a  corrections officer is taken hostage during an uprising.  </P> <P> The insurance, believed to be the first of its kind, was spurred by a rebellion  at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility last summer in which five guards were  held hostage.  </P> <P> Lloyd's is underwriting the coverage for Council 82 of the Security and Law  Enforcement Employees union. It told the 22,000-member council that it had  never seen such a policy, union spokesman Chuck Booth said.  </P> <P> Union members taken hostage by prisoners will be compensated for mental strain  and injury, and their families will receive a death benefit if they are killed  in captivity, Booth said.  </P> <P> Benefits range from a one-time payment equal to half of a guard's annual salary  if he is held captive at least 12 hours without injury, up to a single payment  of twice his salary to a beneficiary if he is killed, the spokesman said.  Corrections officers who suffer injury or disfigurement would be compensated on  the same scale.  </P> <P> The plan, which covers all officers in Council 82, including policemen and  sheriff's deputies, is financed by the union and entails no increase in union  dues, Booth said.  </P></p>

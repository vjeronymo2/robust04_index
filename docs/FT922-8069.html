Astronauts from the space shuttle Endeavour were scheduled to make a final effort to rescue it last night. Lloyd's underwriters insured the rescue mission on behalf of a number of Intelsat's 122 partners. The policy, 45 per cent if which is placed in Lloyd's, covers dollars 44m of the dollars 147m cost of the rescue mission.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY?;  </P> <P> WHY 'ROSEANNE'S' CREATOR LEFT HIT SHOW AFTER DISPUTE WITH ITS STAR  </P> <P> The new TV series was going to be called "Life and Stuff," or so its creator,  head writer and co-executive producer, Matt Williams, thought.  </P> <P> He even put the title on the cover of the pilot script. "I wanted to establish  it as an ensemble piece," he recalls.  </P> <P> So when the star, Roseanne Barr, insisted that the sitcom should be named for  her, Williams balked. The fear, he says, was that by calling the series  "Roseanne," it was going to be a star vehicle from the outset and put the  comedian in too powerful a position to influence the show's creative  development.  </P> <P> In the end, Barr got her way. And Williams' fear was borne out -- ultimately at  his expense.  </P> <P> That flap was just one of many that have plagued "Roseanne" during its first TV  season, which is unusually early for any show to be so troubled, let alone one  that jumped into the Top 5 of the Nielsen ratings so quickly.  </P> <P> More importantly, however, the situation at "Roseanne" spotlights what happens  behind the scenes when producers, writers and actors battle for control over a  series -- a scenario that seems to be replaying itself more now than ever  before.  </P> <P> In the last two years alone, Valerie Harper and Lorimar went to court over her  removal from "Valerie"; creator and executive producer Glenn Gordon Caron was  forced off "Moonlighting" because of wrangling with star Cybill Shepherd, and  co-creator Terry Louise Fisher was ousted as a producer and writer on "L.A.  Law" because of differences with executive producer Steven Bochco.  </P> <P> In the case of "Roseanne," the owners of its production company, Marcy Carsey  and Tom Werner, resolved the ruckus by bowing to an ultimatum Barr delivered in  December: that she would walk off the series after only 13 of the 22 episodes  ordered for this season had been made unless Williams was thrown out. On Jan.  6, the Carsey-Werner Co. announced that Williams had "elected to move on"  because of "creative tensions" with the comedian.  </P> <P> Carsey, whose company also produces the megahit "The Cosby Show" and its  spinoff "A Different World," declined in an interview this week to explain the  reasons behind the decision.  </P> <P> "Matt is a fabulous talent, and Roseanne is a fabulous talent, and it would be  wonderful if they got along famously, but it didn't happen that way," she said.  "But I don't want the subject of anyone's interest in the show to be who is  staying and who is going, and creative tensions and stuff like that. It's wrong  for us and it's wrong for the show for that to be the focus of anyone's  attention."  </P> <P> Williams, however, sees his ouster as "symptomatic of an industry disdain for  writers in general. The feeling is that writing isn't important, that what's  important is the star. And to me, that's very, very sad," he said in his only  interview since his ouster.  </P> <P> "The problem was who was going to have the final say on stories, scripts and  the overall thrust of the show. As the creator and executive producer, I  automatically assumed, rightly or wrongly, that I would have the final say.  And, obviously, Roseanne thought she had the final say. And that, in essence,  was the central conflict."  </P> <P> Barr, through a spokesman, declined repeated requests to be interviewed for  this article.  </P> <P> But others associated with "Roseanne" said in interviews that Carsey-Werner  executives considered dumping her from the show last November because of the  production problems she was causing, which included throwing temper tantrums,  screaming at co-workers, locking herself in her dressing room, storming off the  set and threatening on several occasions to quit.  </P> <P> Carsey denies this. Yet one Carsey-Werner associate explained at the time, "I  don't know that she's indispensable."  </P> <P> Looking back, one writer said that "the feeling among the writers and producers  was that we (still) had a show with John Goodman (who plays Barr's husband).  But ultimately ABC owned the show and had the final say. And to them it was  keep the star at all costs."  </P> <P> Carsey says that Barr has not been difficult to work with this season. "Of  course, she's passionate about what she does and she cares very deeply about  the character that she had created in her stand-up routines. And for whatever  part of that she's using in this show, she cares very deeply about that. After  all, she spent years on it."  </P> <P> Last week, ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard acknowledged that he  was "keeping an eye" on the turmoil at "Roseanne." But he also noted that  following Williams' departure, "I think the problems have been resolved. . . .  And I think things seem to be going along very well right now."  </P> <P> Stoddard's comments did not sit well with Williams, especially since ABC wants  him to do another series. "The impression that's been given by everyone  involved is that  </P> <P> I just quit. I did not just walk off the show. I reluctantly stepped aside,"  said Williams, whose agent negotiated a sizable financial settlement for him --  reportedly seven figures a year for several years -- as well as a substantial  interest in the series' profits.  </P> <P> It's not, Williams contends, that he didn't want Barr's input. After all, he  readily admits that "the show truly was a collaboration with me, Marcy, Tom and  Roseanne, a blending of ideas."  </P> <P> But quickly, he said, the normal give-and-take that exists between the writers  and the star, or the producers and the star, on prime-time series deteriorated  into a day-in and day-out struggle for control over the tone, texture and  content of every script.  </P> <P> "In a bizarre sort of way, it helped the show because you're constantly  challenging each other to back up your ideas," he explained. "But ultimately it  depends on how tense the creative tensions get as to whether you can function  that way year in and year out. And it finally just got to the point where it  was, 'Are we going to have a series or not?' "  </P> <P> Williams maintains that he didn't want to simply hand Barr the reins to  "Roseanne," "because I believe that for a TV series to run successfully, you  need someone at the top who is objective and can stand back and maintain an  overview of the entire series. And I think it's very difficult, though not  impossible, for an actor who is in the midst of working within that show to  maintain that overview."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, before the first airing of the series Barr publicly began to  claim credit for what was good about the show and to blame everything that was  bad on Williams. And, by December, at the height of the comedian's power  struggle with the series' creator, Carsey-Werner was no longer offering  reporters any interviews with Williams so as "not to upset Roseanne."  </P> <P> "Matt was not to be either in the limelight or to be given credit for  anything," said one insider.  </P> <P> Rick Leed, vice president of the Agency for the Performing Arts and the talent  agent for Williams and two of the show's other writers, believe that Barr is  typical of some stars "who by the nature of their personality don't want to  trust other people and who see the show only through their vision. And what  they try to do is make everybody bend to their vision and they destroy the most  important aspect of TV shows, which is collaboration."  </P> <P> Williams tried to prevent that from happening, Leed said, but found little  support. "Because, when a production company and a network have a hit show, and  when the show is named 'Roseanne,' and when the star takes off in the media as  the darling of this season's television season, it became pretty clear the show  was hers," he explained.  </P> <P> Carsey, however, maintains that "it's only natural to want Roseanne's input as  much as possible. Because you have to love the talent you're using, and we do  with Bill (Cosby) and we do here. You have to have a great admiration and  respect for it. And therefore you incorporate it."  </P> <P> Barr reportedly went to ABC and to Carsey-Werner even before her series had  premiered and asked them to choose either her or Williams as boss. But both the  network and the production company backed Williams.  </P> <P> Then, after eight episodes, Barr went back again, with no success. "And that's  when there was a major thrust by her to get Matt out at all costs because Matt  was the one who had the final say," according to one writer.  </P> <P> Then, just after the 13th episode was completed on Dec. 16, Barr reportedly  told Carsey-Werner that her husband Bill was in the hospital and that she  "didn't know if she could continue the series because she was feeling a lot of  stress," said one insider.  </P> <P> At first, she didn't mention Williams directly. "But then she said there would  be 'less stress' if Williams was no longer with the show," the source related.  </P> <P> And, for the first time, Williams said, hewas not included in the production  company's talks. By the end of the month, he was out.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Barr has increasingly claimed credit for both the creation and the  writing of the show. In October she told Newsweek that she wrote much of the  pilot episode herself. One month later, she told Time magazine that she was  rewriting scripts.  </P> <P> Williams, however, maintains that while Barr's input has always been "unique"  and "important," especially in melding the "domestic Goddess" of her stand-up  comedy routine with the blue-collar working mother she plays on the show, she  has considerably overstated her writing contributions.  </P> <P> "We have a great staff of writers, the best I have ever worked with, who would  stay there until 6 a.m. making the scripts right," Williams said. "Roseanne  obviously helped shape and form the show, but that staff writes the scripts."  </P> <P> Insiders said it wasn't always easy for the writers to know exactly what  changes Barr wanted to make because she seemed to flip-flop from day to day and  week to week. For instance, they said, the comedian would tell the writers she  "didn't want any jokes" in the scripts anymore, and then "complain why there  weren't any jokes." Or she would accuse the writers of making her character  "too mean" and then charge them the next day with writing scripts that didn't  give her "any kind of edge."  </P> <P> For their part, some "Roseanne" employees complained that Barr often wouldn't  learn lines or memorize blocking. "I think she read somewhere that Jackie  Gleason never rehearsed for 'The Honeymooners,' and so she didn't want to,  either," said one staff member. "She had a preconceived notion of what it was  to be a star but never what it was to be an actor. And there's a big difference  in terms of hard work and discipline."  </P> <P> Carsey, however, describes Barr as "an amazingly quick study" as an actress.  "We were amazed at how much she learned and how quickly she learned about what  she didn't know. And I think she's just going to get more and more comfortable  with the medium and with the format."  </P> <P> Currently, insiders describe the mood on "Roseanne" as "very calm."  </P> <P> Jeff Harris, whose TV credits include "Diff'rent Strokes," was brought in as  chief writer, and Williams smoothed over the transition by meeting with his  hand-picked team of writers and persuading them to stay on the show at least  until the end of the season.  </P> <P> As for Barr, neither her public image nor professional career seems hurt by the  reports on her show's turmoil. Journalists are still beating down her door for  interviews, and she finally hired a PR agency last week. When she's done on  "Roseanne" in April, she begins shooting her first feature film, "She Devil,"  in which she co-stars with Meryl Streep.  </P> <P> Plus, with a season of TV experience already under her belt, she will be in a  stronger position than ever to call the shots on her series next year. Already,  since Williams' ouster, she finally has the rewrite power she has sought. "If  she comes up with something, there's now more inclusion of what she wants,"  said one writer on the show.  </P> <P> Will the American public notice any difference? Even Williams says probably  not, at least this season. "Maybe not until the second season will they really  notice the difference, because a lot of the stories and what we had worked on  are intact for the rest of the year. But people say that if you can keep a show  in the Top 10 for one year, then it's going to run five years just on that  alone. Because it becomes a habit."  </P> <P> For his part, Williams is more than ready to put "Roseanne" behind him as  quickly as possible. "On the one hand, I'm relieved it's over. On the other,  I've still got that tug. It'll be interesting to see what happens now that I'm  gone. Right now, there's a honeymoon period because 'Matt's out.' And I know  that will not last through the back nine."  </P> <P> Already, he is dreaming up ideas for his next TV series because he believes he  has "at least a couple more TV shows within me.  </P> <P> "I just want to be known for my work," he said. "And I don't want to be known  as the guy that's fighting with Roseanne Barr forever.  </P></p>

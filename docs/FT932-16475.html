			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Concerted action urged on exports MR RICHARD Needham, a trade and industry minister, moved yesterday to encourage exporters to work more closely together in bidding for large projects in foreign markets. The government will aim to pinpoint 'national champions' to take the lead in particular export sectors - including power, water, airports, transport and oil and gas. The action forms part of a wide-ranging effort to boost UK exports and hinges on concern that contracts have been lost because UK companies have been fighting against each other rather than against foreign competitors in their efforts to win a contract. Earlier this year North West Water and Thames Water lost a contract in Buenos Aires to Generale des Eaux of France after competition between them led to neither arranging export finance in time. Mr Needham said he was 'determined to help create a unified British approach to the challenge which the main project markets present. Companies need to work together more effectively.' France and Japan in particular are seen as having been effective in co-ordinating the efforts of local companies to win large international contracts. The change would 'provide focus and strategy and administrative structure to back winners, and stop us murdering each other to the delight of our competitors,' Mr Needham added. The aim was to reorganise the Overseas Projects Board at the DTI, the job of which is to ensure close links between the government and industry in bids for big export projects. New sector groups headed by businesspeople rather than government officials would pinpoint UK export strengths in the sectors concerned, identify priority export markets, seek joint ventures in infrastructure projects, and look for opportunities for collaboration in developing countries in particular as they privatised sectors of their economies. The groups would identify circumstances where 'a single bid will improve the UK's chances of securing major business (and will advise) on the selection of one company or one group of companies to put forward the most effective national bid when several UK companies are competing for a particular project'. Mr Needham said the reorganisation 'signals an important change of focus'. It formed part of a wider aim to boost earnings from large contract exports from an expected Pounds 10bn this year to Pounds 20bn by 2000. Recently the government has taken steps to work with industry to aid exporters. Additional export credit cover has been made available in 'concentrated markets' where UK exporters have been particularly successful  -such as Indonesia, India, Malaysia, China and Hong Kong. A campaign to boost exports to the US, launched a month ago, harnesses proposals culled from industry (such as targeting 20 US sectors in which UK exporters have strength) an education programme for exporters and 'strategic alliances' introducing exporters to prospective US partners.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Poplars and popularity I HAVE 16 mature but healthy poplar trees about 2ft from my neighbour's hedge. His house is about 50ft away from this hedge. My neighbour without notice employed a tree surgeon to have these trees lopped to reduce the height although I had them lopped just a few months before. Can he charge the work to me? If in future there are branches overhanging his land, has he got a right to enter my land and have them cut? Is there any legal precedent or authoritative book? Your neighbour cannot charge you for work which he has carried out to your trees. If the lopping involved crossing into the air-space or coming on to the land on your side of the boundary you would have a trespass claim against him. Although your neighbour can have branches on his side of the boundary cut, he is not entitled to enter your land. The authoritative text-book is Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 16th Edition. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

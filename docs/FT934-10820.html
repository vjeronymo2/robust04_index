			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Weak close after an erratic session WEAKNESS in the New York bond market, quickly reflected on Wall Street, undermined equities in London yesterday and wiped out an early round of share price gains. But City confidence rallied after the official close of the market when the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin took a more positive view of domestic inflation prospects than had been feared. It was an erratic session, with the FT-SE 100 Index gaining nearly 12 points initially after reports that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, was winning the political battle inside the Cabinet for cuts in public spending; this would reduce the pressures for increased taxation in this month's Budget, according to City pundits. However, the early morning Footsie reading of 3,176.2 proved to be the day's best, although a further advance was mounted later on the back of a sizeable trading programme which ranged across the market. All came to naught when the Dow, having closed at a new peak on Monday, opened 20 points down, and the London market retreated into negative territory. After allowing for a mild rally in the final minutes, the FT-SE 100 finished just a net 0.3 points off at 3,164.1. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a broad range of second line stocks, gained 1.8 at 3,522.3, benefiting from the effects of the trading programme from a leading UK securities house. Publication of the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin came too late for equities, but stock index futures turned higher in very late deals as traders considered that the Bank's views on inflation provide underpinning for a base rate cut before the end of the year. Although UK market strategists agreed that it was the New York bond market that unshipped London, several believed that the logic might prove short-lived. US bonds have been leading equities ahead in New York and Europe since August. But yesterday's data confirming growing recovery in the US economy checked the US credit markets and raised fears for global equities - fears immediately reflected in the Dow's fall. However, economic recovery in the US is seen by many analysts as more significant, as well as more positive, for global stock markets than any fears over any revival of inflationary pressure in the US . By the close, market traders sounded more positive than the readings on market indices might have suggested. The Footsie has bounced successfully from the 3,150 area once again and trading volume continues to indicate underlying confidence. Retail business in equities was worth Pounds 1.09bn on Monday and Seaq volume jumped by nearly 43 per cent to 664.4m shares yesterday. On the domestic front, the 0.4 per cent gain in October M0 money supply was in line with market expectations. Attention continued to focus on the prospects for the UK Budget due at the end of the month, with suggestions of changes in pension fund taxation dominating lunchtime converations in the City of London. Banking stocks again attracted strong support, and hints that a large international deal was pending in the telecommunications industry kept institutional dealers on the alert throughout the trading session.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: CLARINETIST'S PUBLIC VALENTINE TO 12 WOMEN  </P> <P> Valentine's Day is set aside for the woman in one's life -- or in the case of  clarinetist William Powell, 12 of the women.  </P> <P> Powell, chairman of the instrumental performance program at CalArts in  Valencia, will give a concert Wednesday in which his Valentine's dozen figure  prominently.  </P> <P> Six of the women composed the pieces he and his musicians will perform. The  other six are women who have influenced his life, and Powell is dedicating the  performances to them.  </P> <P> "It's my mom and her five sisters, who helped put me through music school and  did a lot of wonderful things for me," said Powell, an accomplished performer  who has championed the clarinet for use in both traditional and contemporary  music.  </P> <P> "I picked the pieces according to how I perceive them," he said. "The one for  my mother is a premiere. It's the most romantic work in its instrumentation."  </P> <P> Called "Quintet," the piece was written last year by Joelle Wallach, winner of  several international competitions for composers. The work is for clarinet and  string quartet. Wallach flew in from New York to help with rehearsals. She, and  the other five composers, probably will be on hand for Wednesday's concert,  Powell said.  </P> <P> Powell is known for his eclectic repertoire, so it no surprise that the  Valentine's Day selections represent a wide range of music. "Shakti III," by  Beverly Grigsby, uses a clarinet, tabla and a Fairlight III, a computer that  plays music. "Shakti" in the Hindu religion is divine light. The piece is  dedicated to an aunt of Powell's who died last year.  </P> <P> Composer Grigsby is a professor at Cal State Northridge, where she founded the  Computer Music Studio in 1976.  </P> <P> Listeners unfamiliar with the experiments of modern composition will find  something new in "Through the Lullaby," a piece by Sally Lamb for clarinet and  piano. Powell said it "explores meter through gestural displacement and a  humorous relationship between consonance and dissonance."  </P> <P> Portions of "Ningana" have a decided show-biz air, he said. The work, by Jane  Brockman, is for clarinet, electronics and tape. The name comes from a Maori  word for "resting place."  </P> <P> Other works on the program are "Nocturne" for solo clarinet, by Deborah  Kavasch, and "Harlequin" for clarinet, viola, harp and percussion, by Kathleen  St. John.  </P> <P> Powell is a specialist in music by modern women composers. He performed at the  International Congresses of Women in Music at USC in 1982, in Paris in 1984 and  in Bremen, West Germany, in 1988. He said there are many talented women  composers and he wants to be certain their music is heard.  </P> <P> "Generally women have more difficulty getting performances of their work," he  said. "For that reason, they sometimes give up composing."  </P> <P> Although his Valentine's Day sentiments are decidedly romantic, Powell has an  ulterior motive in his selection of material. He will perform some of the works  in New York in March, which is Women's History Month.  </P> <P>  "Valentine's Day Recital" featuring William Powell; 8 p.m Wednesday, Roy O.

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RECREATION;  </P> <P> SURF AND TURF;  </P> <P> ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE VALLEY, SYCAMORE CANYON OFFERS CAMPERS ACCESS TO  BOTH OCEAN AND MOUNTAIN RECREATION  </P> <P> Sycamore Canyon is home to deer, bobcat, fox, coyote, an occasional mountain  lion, 200 species of birds, 880 kinds of flowers and a member of Homo sapiens  who calls himself "the trudgin' curmudgeon."  </P> <P> On any given Sunday, park visitors can catch a glimpse of Lu Haas, a hearty  septuagenarian from the Sierra Club who leads hikers on flower-sighting  odysseys through canyon back country that hasn't changed much since the Chumash  Indians etched petroglyphs in mountain caves thousands of years ago.  </P> <P> "This was the basic food of the Chumash," Haas says, crushing a leaf of purple  sage in his gloved hand.  </P> <P> But even if nature walks aren't your idea of an outdoor experience, Sycamore  Canyon probably still has something for you. With 55 campsites and hot showers,  it's a full-service park that provides a highly unusual recreational double:  the mountains and the ocean.  </P> <P> But its best virtue may be its proximity. At the eastern edge of 15,000-acre  Point Mugu State Park, Sycamore Canyon is less than an hour's drive from the  Valley. Pacific Coast Highway cuts between the canyon and the surrounding Santa  Monica Mountains on one side and Sycamore Cove and the ocean on the other. An  easily accessible tunnel beneath the highway leads from the campgrounds to the  beach.  </P> <P> Although the basic food in the area is now more along the lines of barbecued  hot dogs, the Chumash would have no trouble recognizing their old stomping  grounds. Sprawling sycamore trees with giant crooked branches reaching out like  tentacles still rise off the canyon floor. The chaparral in the mountains  remains in its natural state.  </P> <P> Man's presence, however, has been felt ever since Portuguese explorer Juan  Rodriguez Cabrillo dropped anchor there in 1542. California live oaks, valued  as fuel, were almost all eliminated from the canyon. And fire roads and  footpaths crisscross the mountains like surgical scars. Brown bears once roamed  the mountainside, but they disappeared years ago.  </P> <P> As L. A.'s neighborhood wilderness, the park suffers from urban fallout. Like  most state parks, it is immensely popular in the summer, booked on weekends  from Memorial Day to Labor Day, but the pressure on Sycamore Canyon is  intensified because of its location. As with a good restaurant, reservations  are necessary, even during the week.  </P> <P> The campground is run by state park rangers, who patrol the campsites that lie  beneath the ancient sycamores. At the entrance to the park, just off PCH,  visitors have to check in at the ranger station to be assigned a campsite.  Prime campsites are Nos. 30, 32, 50 and 52, but they're on a first-come,  first-served basis.  </P> <P> People go to a park for different reasons. Some like to hike and swim. Others  like to sit around a fire and incinerate marshmallows. A few prefer to sip  vodka tonics and enjoy the scenery while listening to music on a portable  radio. To them, Sycamore Canyon probably will be a disappointment. Yosemite it  is not. A lot of campsites are neither very private nor are they pristine.  </P> <P> "It's the retirees who come in with their RVs and leave the place a mess," says  Blake Richard, a park aide.  </P> <P> The joy of staying at Sycamore Canyon is to get out of your campsite and  explore. At the back of the campground is the gateway to the mountains, trails  that lead into the Santa Monicas and other canyons. Most popular is the Scenic  Trail, which ascends the mountains at an angle steep enough to require a rest  on a wooden bench about halfway up. As the climber goes higher, the valley  below disappears along with the hum of trucks on PCH. Only the thundering surf  can be heard, and then it begins to fade, replaced by sounds of the wind  running across the prairie grasses.  </P> <P> Walking to an altitude of 1,300 feet, the climber has his choice of stunning  vistas: To the south, beneath rugged cliffs, the blue Pacific stretches to the  horizon, a ribbon of white foam lining the beaches; to the north is Old Boney,  at 3,000 feet the highest mountain in the range. The intrepid hiker can hook up  with Overlook Trail and make a tough trek to La Jolla Valley, where rock caves  have been chiseled into the hillsides by wind and erosion.  </P> <P> Even though the journey on the Scenic Trail isn't recommended for anybody who  is out of shape, it is really no tougher than walking up the stairs at the  Sherman Oaks Galleria. The sun is a potential hazard -- experienced hikers will  take along a canister of water -- but an even graver threat are the mountain  bikers who sometimes whip around a switchback without regard to their safety or  anyone else's.  </P> <P> "We've had a problem with bicycles," Ranger Brit Horn says. "There have been  accidents and lawsuits with bikes running into and over people in the hills."  </P> <P> Aside from giving nature lectures, Horn and four or five other rangers are  responsible for maintaining law and order. This means enforcing quiet hours  after 10 p.m. and making sure that pets aren't brought into the park; their  scent scares away indigenous wildlife. Occasionally, Horn says, a cooler will  be stolen, usually by kids looking for beer. Cars parked by surfers on PCH  sometimes get swiped or broken into.  </P> <P> Teen-agers, Horn says, like to party in the canyon. "We pour (out) a lot of  beer and either cite for or confiscate marijuana," he says. During Easter  weekend, "We definitely had near-riot conditions" because of "a major  gathering" of kids, perhaps gang members, Horn says. "We've had a little bit of  everything here."  </P> <P> Except the cunning and elusive mountain lion. Although deer are common and  reminders of other animals are found along the trails -- Horn has yet to cross  paths with the big cat. But, he says, "Reliable sources have told me that a  mountain lion or two are in the range."  </P> <P>  Directions to Sycamore Canyon: 101 to Kanan-Dume Road, west to Pacific Coast  Highway, north about 15 miles to ranger station.

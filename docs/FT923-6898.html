			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Aids forces party to confront its contradictions: Republican Party Convention in Houston A SIGN frequently seen at the Republican convention in Houston reads: 'Family rights forever, gay rights never.' Mr Patrick Buchanan, the erstwhile presidential challenger who once said Aids was God's punishment against gays, gave full vent to that feeling on Monday when he attacked the Democratic party for its links with 'militant' homosexuals. Mr Pat Robertson, the television evangelist, drove the point home with warnings that Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was seeking to give preferential treatment to homosexuals by giving them cabinet posts, teaching positions and opening up the military. The Democrats openly endorsed gay rights and had two HIV-positive speakers, one gay, at their New York convention, In contrast the Republican platform implicitly ties the spread of Aids to what it sees as base and immoral conduct. 'Prevention is linked ultimately to personal responsibility and moral behaviour,' the party platform reads. 'We reject the notion that the distribution of clean needles and condoms are the solution to stopping the spread of Aids.' Instead it suggests 'marital fidelity, abstinence and a drug-free lifestyle'. Yet behind the moral certainties, the Republicans seem altogether uncomfortable with the social issues associated with Aids. Ironically at this convention, with a central theme of 'traditional family values,' perhaps the most touching moment came on Wednesday night when an Aids victim spoke to delegates. Ms Mary Fisher, the daughter of a Detroit real estate investor and prominent party backer, said she was a white, wealthy, heterosexual who had contracted the disease through marriage. But she pointedly added: 'I am one with the lonely gay man sheltering a flickering candle from the cold wind of his family's rejection.' The Aids virus was not a political creature, she added, pleading for tolerance. Ms Fisher tried to tie her message to the party's overt theme: 'We do the president's cause no good if we praise the American family but ignore a virus that destroys it.' Indeed, the Republicans, like the Democrats, support considerable funding for research, prevention and treatment of Aids. The Republican platform explicitly endorses 'a massive commitment of resources' for research to stem the tide of the disease and proudly notes that the Bush administration has spent Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.19bn) in the past four years. The Republicans have embarked on a strategy of using gay rights and Aids as a stick to beat the opposition, much as it used the issues of crime and communism in the 1980s. Yet during Ms Fisher's speech, many delegates - perhaps even some of the same delegates who cheered Mr Buchanan and Mr Robertson - burst into tears.</p>

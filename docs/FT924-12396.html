			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Mideast negotiators give peace another chance ARAB and Israeli peace negotiators reassemble in Washington today with two uncomfortable thoughts in mind: in the year since the process was launched in Madrid they have achieved no substantive accords and, in the middle of their latest scheduled round of talks, the US president who brought them together may be voted out of office. Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians are returning for their seventh round of bilateral talks with Israel, apparently no less committed to the Middle East peace process than before. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, has invested much of his political capital since his election last June in the search for a peace agreement and cannot afford to have the account slide into deficit so soon. In the latest round - due to last until November 19 with a break over the US election on November 3 - much will depend on whether Israel and the Palestinians can make real progress towards agreement on an interim period of Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza. At the Madrid conference last October, this was set as a target to be achieved within a year. In the last session in September, the first since Mr Rabin came to office, there were signs that the two sides were getting down to business. But there are still fundamental differences over the scope of the proposed self-government's authority, for example on the extent to which the Palestinians will have control of land in the territories. In the Syrian-Israeli talks, the big obstacle is Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights. The most Israel is seeking in this round is a joint 'statement of principles' by the two sides which would open the way to deeper negotiations. But that in itself would be a breakthrough, given the long history of hostility between them.</p>

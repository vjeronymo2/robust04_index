			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Arts: The best and worst sides of a sophisticated artist / Review of the work of Bill Jacklin Commanding the long principle axis at Marlborough Fine Art and the visitor's immediate attention is a new painting by Bill Jacklin, some 8 feet by 6.5, of an American mounted policeman on a rearing horse. It is a standard image in the long and splendid tradition of the grand equestrian portrait that, in painting, goes back through Goya and Velasquez to Titian and the high Renaissance and in sculpture, right back to the roots of Western art in ancient Greece. The noble beast rears and frets: the rider holds hard to keep control. All is contained, sprung, expressive energy - or should be. Here we must hold hard ourselves, for this is not only a serious attempt at a serious subject, but as seriously bad in the result as it is possible for a painting to be. It is no bad thing for an artist to take on such a subject in the grand manner and, here, the idea to bring the convention up to date and take the policeman as our modern condottiere, is rather good. But if the ambition is admirable, the dangers are obvious. To invite the comparison with the great masters is, well, to invite the comparison. The trouble is that Jacklin all too evidently does not know what the horse is - how it moves, how it is ridden, what it looks like. Certainly he has not worked to find out by any careful study and exact observation. Rather it is as though the idea itself were enough and the expressive reference all that were needed. And what is not known by the artist is, quite simply, left out. The near-fore protrudes arbitrarily from a mysterious dark-brown void in the animal's side: the hind legs are fused and lost together in a brown mist: the rider, dwarfed by his mount yet immensely long in his lower leg, sits impossibly deep in the pit of its back. It is too easy to find specific fault, and I have no wish to dwell on the single work. But, given such manifest inadequacy in the description and realisation of what this particular work proposes, it is natural to visit the rest of the work, at Oxford as in London, with more exacting a scrutiny than might otherwise have been the case. And here an important distinction must be drawn, for it now becomes clear that Jacklin's work, in this his American phase, falls into two camps, not opposed exactly, but markedly different. He is now nearly 50 and has lived and worked in New York since 1985. There he has found his subject-matter, not just in the obvious imagery of Manhattan which forms the generalised back-drop to his work, but in the street life of the city and, latterly, the beach life of Coney Island. In particular he has made the crowd itself his subject, seen on the one hand at a distance and often from a great height - the street parade, the demonstration, the riot, the ant-like swarm of commuters, bathers, skaters: on the other, the closer view of the constant human traffic of the sidewalk, round the cafe table or the chess-board in the open air. Within this broad scope, either he settles upon an image of flux and movement, often generalised and simplified to a point of near-abstraction, or attempts the grandiose and monumental, the figures local and individual, the scene clearly set and characterised. And it is always with this second sort that he gets into difficulties. That rearing horse, pace Verocchio's Colleoni, aspires nevertheless to the condition of the monumental. The vast painting at Oxford, of the summer crowds sitting on the grass in Central Park, looks to Seurat's 'Baignade' and 'la Grande Jatte', so simple and statuesque in the sunshine. But where Seurat resolves even the simplest of his figures to a convincing sculptural presence, securely placed and registered within the worked space and perspectives of the pictorial convention, Jacklin, in this mode, leaves only questions. His figures are but shadows, mere ciphers on the painted surface, and when he seeks more close a description, the drawing is crude and weak, the detail fudged, the anatomy highly improbable. In short, in working the figure in this way, singly and collectively, he cannot sustain what he sets out to achieve - and he sets out to achieve so much. The irony is that, in his other mode, in attempting less and being so much less self-conscious in the doing, he achieves so much more. The skaters whizzing round the rink, or the bathers running into the sea, are shadows still, but more freely worked and positively abstracted. It is not so much that the expectation of them is less, but that their formal function, active elements within the broader activity of the painting and the monoprint, is so very different. With them, the unself-conscious commitment to the expressive image and gesture is all, and it is their salvation. These two exhibitions present us, therefore, with something of a mystery, for they show us a sophisticated, prolific and dedicated artist at his best and worst together. The mystery is that he himself does not see the difference, which lies not in the expressive scope, or scale, or pictorial ambition of the work, let alone its particular content, but in something more fundamental. There, on the one hand, is the naive assumption that the self-conscious importance of the attempt is of itself the guarantee of success. On the other there is the proper modesty of the artist losing himself in the practical engagement with his work and the ideas that grow out of it. Wherever Jacklin begins to forget himself, intrigued by the abstracted movement of a mass of people, or in the close drawing of a girl's head, the work is transformed. The Coney Island monoprints, free, adventurous and unself-conscious, are as good as anything he has done.

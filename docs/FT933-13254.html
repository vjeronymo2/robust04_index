			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Salomon unit to put Dollars 200m in oil project SALOMON'S Phibro Energy offshoot plans to invest about Dollars 200m in a residual fuel oil upgrading project for its two refineries in Texas, Reuter reports from Houston. Completion of this project, expected by the end of the first quarter of 1996, will allow the Texas City and Houston refineries to produce more than a 90 per cent yield of high value transportation fuels while processing high sulphur heavy feedstocks, Phibro said. As part of this project, Phibro agreed to buy Dow Chemical's 200,000 barrel per day Oyster Creek refinery in Freeport, Texas, and will dismantle and remove all the equipment. Much of this will be used in the upgrading project.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPEAL COURT RULING CLEARS WAY FOR CLOSING MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS  </P> <P> In a stunning blow to Los Angeles County mental health advocates, a state Court  of Appeal has ruled that county officials may proceed with the planned closures  of eight mental health outpatient clinics and sharp cutbacks in service at five  others.  </P> <P> The appellate court, in a ruling county lawyers received Friday, sided with  mental health officials who had argued they had no choice but to act against  the clinics because of a shortage of money for mental health programs.  </P> <P> The closures alone would affect more than 20,000 patients in clinics from the  San Fernando Valley to the South Bay. The closures were scheduled to begin last  summer, but lawyers representing half a dozen mental health patients obtained a  Superior Court injunction in August blocking the move. But in the ruling,  issued Thursday, the 2nd District State Court of Appeal dissolved that  injunction.  </P> <P> "This court appreciates (that) mental health services in many instances can be  as vital as other forms of health care," the appellate court order said.  "Unfortunately, there are insufficient funds available to meet all the  perceived needs, requiring a prioritization of public expenditures."  </P> <P> The court added that state law limits the county's mental health obligations  and that any changes in that requirement should be enacted by the Legislature,  not the courts.  </P> <P> Because the decision cannot take effect until 30 days after the Jan. 26 ruling  date, attorneys for both sides said the earliest the county can begin closing  clinics will be at least a month plus an additional 10 days during which time  an appeal can be filed.  </P> <P> "We believe that the Court of Appeal reasoning is not consistent or logical,  and we're going to seriously consider a petition of review with the California  Supreme Court," said Melinda Bird, a staff attorney for the Western Center on  Law and Poverty, one of the law firms representing indigent mentally ill  patients in the court case.  </P> <P> "If the clinics finally do close," Bird added, "we want to be sure that the  procedures are fair and reasonable and that those who need services will  continue to receive it."  </P> <P> County officials have said that in closing the clinics, only those patients who  are severely and chronically mentally ill will continue to receive treatment at  county facilities. As a result, seriously mentally ill patients at clinics that  are on the cut list would be assigned to other clinics which, in turn, could  jettison patients who require less psychiatric attention.  </P> <P> In the wake of the court ruling, mental health advocates said they fear such a  ripple effect will not only undermine the mental health system but threaten  patients who rely solely on the county for treatment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Devastating Effect'  </P> <P> "If the cuts go through with the magnitude they talked about last August, it  will have a tragic and devastating effect on our clients," said Bryan Jones,  director of public policy for the Mental Health Assn. of Los Angeles County, an  umbrella organization for mental health patients, their family members and  professionals.  </P> <P> "I would hope that the supervisors could find some way to continue to provide  the funding for mental health that would prevent further cuts," said Jones, who  added that many patients forced to transfer to unfamiliar clinics would face  long lines or difficult commutes for treatment.  </P> <P> However, Roberto Quiroz, the county's mental health director, said Friday that  his staff would immediately begin evaluating how to proceed with the clinic  cuts.  </P> <P> "We're waiting for the county counsel to review the wording of the decision,"  Quiroz said. "We will be meeting with county counsel on Monday and then proceed  with whatever decision we have to make."  </P> <P> Quiroz said he hopes to make the cuts, which would also include layoffs, as  painless as possible. "I think it's been a time of great uncertainty for staff,  patients, administrators and board (of supervisors) and somewhere along the  line we had to get a decision made, and this was a responsible decision," he  said.  </P> <P> Other county officials were not so sure.  </P> <P> Paul Schettler, executive director of the San Pedro Mental Health Center, one  of the threatened clinics, said while everyone was relieved that a decision had  been made, his patients and staff are still in limbo.  </P> <P> "We still don't know what the extent of the cuts will be, and we don't know how  much curtailment of staff it will be," he said. (But) it's certainly clear that  there's still going to be a tremendous impact on loss of services to the  severely mentally ill and to the homeless mentally ill," he said.  </P> <P> In addition to the San Pedro clinic, outpatient programs in Wilmington,  South-Central Los Angeles, Arcadia, North Hollywood, Canoga Park, Bell Gardens  and Carson are scheduled to close.  </P></p>

The measure was intended to grant funded pension schemes the authority to invest in a mix of assets which would yield the highest returns. However, several member states which restrict pension investment to the home country's currency or to its own government bonds, objected. Meanwhile, a report commissioned by the EU from a group of pensions experts noted that 'the draft directive has probably helped to reveal and to fuel a latent conflict of interest between EU member states'. Mr Giovanni Tamburi, a consultant with actuarial consultants R Watson and one of the authors of the report, argued that the directive had been far too ambitious to succeed. Because the style of pension investment has little bearing on competition, the EU would be wiser to allow each member state to adopt its own investment philosophy. 'The EU should use the concept of a framework of principles and let member countries decide the matter between themselves,' the report said. However, Mr Golby denied that the EU had been too ambitious, although it may have made some errors. 'With the benefit of hindsight, some issues could have been handled better.'</p>

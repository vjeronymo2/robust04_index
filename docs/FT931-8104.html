			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Cutting the tax bill on foreign income - Expatriates HOW DO you exclude your overseas income from liability to British tax? The answer, in the jargon, is to be classed as not resident and not ordinarily resident in the UK. That is the rule. But as for most rules, particularly tax rules, there are exceptions. One of these is when some of the duties of your overseas employment are performed in the UK. That could result in having to pay tax on part of your pay - but not necessarily, since UK duties which are 'merely incidental to the performance of the other duties outside the UK' can be ignored for this purpose. Work done by an overseas representative when he comes to the UK to report and get new instructions will certainly fall into the 'incidental' category. So will visits for training which involve no directly productive work. In both cases, the UK duties are inherently subordinate to those carried on overseas. The test as to whether duties are to be regarded as incidental is, therefore, concerned primarily with their substance, rather than the time they take. Nevertheless, UK duties extending beyond three months in a tax year will not normally be accepted by the Inland Revenue as incidental. Some of the work carried out by expatriates in the UK is, however, too important in itself to be treated as incidental. The duties performed by directors when attending UK board meetings, and by seamen and aircrew when bringing their vessels and aircraft into UK ports, all fall into this category. In all of these cases, what is done is a fundamental part of the employee's work. Furthermore, to determine what part of their remuneration is taxable, some duties are deemed to be performed in the UK when actually they are not. As civil servants know to their cost, their salaries are always chargeable to UK tax whatever their residence status might be. Aircrew and seafarers also come in for special treatment since, if they become residents of the UK, they are treated as performing there all of the duties relating to any journey, or leg of a journey, which begins or ends in Britain. Unfortunately, such liability is the least troublesome of the disadvantages which can arise from performing duties of substance in the UK. Of much greater significance is the fact that doing so can change your residence status and, hence, the whole basis of your liability to UK tax. Many expatriates retain accommodation for their use in the UK. Visiting the country in such circumstances gives rise to a resident status for the tax year concerned unless (a) there exists at the time a full-time overseas employment (or business); and (b) all of the duties of that employment are carried on outside the UK. This is the rule which often results in working husbands and non-fulltime working wives having a different residence status. Unfortunately, if you perform duties of substance in the UK, you must necessarily fail test (b). As a result, you will be resident for any year in which you visit and, should you do so regularly, ordinarily resident too. This means that if you remain a UK domiciliary, as the great majority of British expatriates do, you will be subject to UK tax on your worldwide income and gains on the same basis as a permanent resident. Well, not quite. Your salary at least might be excluded from liability as a result of the foreign earnings deduction. This applies to employment which is carried on wholly or partly outside the UK in the course of a qualifying period which exceeds 365 days. 'Qualifying period' is defined as any days spent outside the UK (whether working or on holiday) and, in addition, intervening days when you are in the UK - provided that no visit exceeds 62 consecutive days. Nor should the total of them be more than one-sixth of the days in the period. (For seafarers, the limits are 183 consecutive days and one half of the days in the period). The foreign earnings deduction, and particularly the one-sixth requirement, should be approached with caution. The rules are very complex. So, if your employment looks likely to involve you in performing duties of substance in the UK, careful consideration of the tax implications is essential. But if, as a result, you become resident and ordinarily resident, there might be compensating advantages. Foremost among these is the ability to pay personal pension contributions attracting an Inland Revenue subsidy of 25 per cent, whether you pay tax on your salary or not.

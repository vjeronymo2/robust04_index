			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LACK OF WIND KEEPS CHEETAH AT BAY IN CABO SAN LUCAS RACE  </P> <P> Cheetah's sprint to the finish in the 13th biennial race from Long Beach to  Cabo San Lucas turned to a crawl Wednesday night when the wind died near the  tip of Baja California.  </P> <P> The Peterson 66 ultralight, co-skippered by Dick Pennington and Phil Murray of  the Long Beach Yacht Club, held a lead of about 25 miles over second-place  Grand Illusion, a Santa Cruz 70 skippered by Ed McDowell of the King Harbor  Yacht Club.  </P> <P> Cheetah, which has led the race since last Saturday's start, radioed an  estimate that she was two hours from the finish at 8:30 Wednesday night --  still in position to claim first-to-finish honors as well as victory in both of  her handicap classes.  </P> <P> Mitchell Rouse's Taxi Dancer from Long Beach Yacht Club had the previous day's  longest run with 232.3 miles as the wind freshened to 15 knots. Cheetah logged  214.3.  </P></p>

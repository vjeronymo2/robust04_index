A  sampling:  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department presents celebrations Sunday at  many park centers. Mariachis and folkloric dancers will perform just about  everywhere there is a festival, including one of the biggest: Lincoln Park,  3501 Valley Blvd., where food booths, rides, games and continuous entertainment  flavor the day 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Paxton Rec Center, 10731 Laurel Canyon Blvd.,  will feature 20 musical groups along with rides and booths, also 10 a.m. to 6  p.m. During those same hours, Penmar Rec Center, 1341 Lake St., Venice, will  stage a "Kings and Queens Pageant" along with ballet, games and pinatas. Among  other centers feting the occasion will be South Park, Wilmington, Exposition,  Gilbert Lindsay, Algin Sutton and Olvera Street.  </P> <P> In a spirit of ecumenism, Alhambra Park, 500 N. Palm Ave., Alhambra, includes  ethnic groups from all over in its "Festival of Neighbors," today from noon to  10 p.m. Musicians, dancers and singers representing Africa, Scotland, Lebanon,  China, etc. will perform; a "Native Sweet Treat Contest" and a "Native Dress  Parade" are open to all ages.

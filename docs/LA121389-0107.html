			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: INVESTMENT ISN'T A GOOD REASON TO BUY ART  </P> <P> What does it tell you that Old Master paintings have gone up in value twice as  fast as common stocks in 1989? Or that last year, too, Old Masters -- pre-1800  paintings by prominent European artists -- had a greater rise than stocks,  according to Salomon Bros., the investment firm that keeps tabs on paintings  and sculpture as well as stocks and bonds.  </P> <P> One thing it tells you is that there are a lot of rich individuals in the  world, more in the last decade than ever before. But whether art is a good  investment is another matter, despite the fabulous prices being paid for  Picassos and Van Goghs.  </P> <P> First the money. The 1980s has seen an upsurge in individual wealth, as stock  prices have more than trebled since 1982 in the United States and risen more  than that in Japan, where a long boom in real estate has also made land and  property owners extremely rich.  </P> <P> And lately some of that money has been showing up in art sales. "The market for  works priced between $1 million and $20 million is especially strong," says  Bonnie Barrett Stretch, editor of the ArtNewsletter, who calls that the "middle  market."  </P> <P> The higher-priced market has been simply spectacular. At the end of November,  for example, the owner of a Tokyo auto-racing park paid $48.9 million for a  Picasso painting -- bidding through a closed-circuit television link between  Paris and Tokyo.  </P> <P> "It's a global business," says Salomon Bros. art analyst Harvey Katz, who  estimates that Sotheby's and Christie's, the chief auction houses, move about  $4.5 billion in art objects each year. And that amounts to less than half the  total market, because most buying and selling is done privately through  dealers.  </P> <P> It's an exclusive market. Citibank has set up an art advisory service to help  its private banking clients -- net worth $1 million and up -- with valuations  of art works and advice about collections.  </P> <P> Yet in some ways it's a mass market. Sotheby's boasts that while it auctions  300 art works each year at prices over $1 million apiece, it moves 230,000  works at prices under $10,000 each.  </P> <P> So should you try for a killing in art -- inspired perhaps by the example of  Wendell Cherry, the president of Humana Inc., who bought a painting titled "Yo!  Picasso!" for $5.6 million in 1981 and sold it this year for $47.8 million?  </P> <P> No, say seasoned pros in the worlds of art and finance. "With notable  exceptions for particular objects and timing, art has not been a good  investment," says Henry King, who heads Citibank's art advisory service.  Paintings pay no dividends and cost money to hold -- for insurance or storage.  And transaction costs are stiff: Both buyers and sellers pay 10% commissions at  art auctions; dealer markups can be much more in private sales.  </P> <P> And the market is treacherous for the unwary. Forbes magazine recently quoted  an art expert ridiculing tennis star John McEnroe for paying $350,000 for a  second-rate example of Renoir's work. (Yes, there are second-rate Renoirs).  </P> <P> The market can even be treacherous for the wisest collectors. A Rembrandt owned  by Norton Simon is now under a cloud because a Dutch government examination of  the painter's works has cast doubt on its authenticity.  </P> <P> Finally, art values often lag the returns of other investments, and sometimes  don't even keep up with inflation. Bruno Frey, professor of economics at the  University of Zurich, wrote in Art &amp; Antiques magazine recently about the  British Railways Pension Fund, which began investing a portion of its assets in  art in 1974, built up a collection and began selling the art works in 1987. The  fund made good gains: Its art works appreciated 3.5 times. But if the fund had  invested in common stocks, it would have fared better, wrote Frey -- more than  four-fold appreciation in the same period.  </P> <P> Even the "Yo! Picasso!" that brought Wendell Cherry such a profit in the 1980s,  brought a net loss to its owner in the 1970s.  </P> <P> So why do rich folks collect? Many reasons. Art adds class, for one thing.  "It's a way of making new money into old money," observes one expert.  </P> <P> But what begins as a quest for status sometimes develops into true intellectual  interest. The best collectors specialize in a specific style of art, often  becoming scholars. That is how valuable collections are built. In one sense the  spirit that drives collectors, and swells the art market today, is the same one  that is bringing record attendance to U.S. museums -- a seeking for knowledge  so strong and widespread that it amounts to a trend in this country. In fact,  predicts futurologist John Naisbitt in his forthcoming book "Megatrends 2000,"  museum attendance in the 1990s will surpass that of ballparks in America.  </P> <P> So what does all this tell you about investing in art? Buy what you enjoy; if  you want to support a local artist by purchasing his or her work, fine. But  keep in mind that the work's real value may be intangible.  </P></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Net at Leu Holding surges 83% for year Leu Holding, part of the CS Holding financial group, has reported consolidated net income of SFr190m (Dollars 131m) for 1993, an 83 per cent rise on 1992. Leu, which is active internationally in private banking and in the Zurich area in commercial banking, said all subsidiaries contributed to the strong performance, due in part to healthy growth in earnings from commission business and securities trading. Total assets at the end of last year were down 5 per cent, to SFr16.4bn, but shareholders' equity gained 9 per cent to SFr1.9bn. Return on equity rose from 6.1 per cent to 10.4 per cent. CS Holding bought all the shares of Leu it did not already own in a public offer last December. Net income in 1993 at Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss aluminium, packaging and chemicals group, was slightly higher than the SFr80m indicated two weeks ago when a SFr400m rights issue was announced. The group said yesterday its 1993 net income was SFr83m, 31 per cent lower than in 1992. It blamed the fall on dreadful conditions in the aluminium business. The directors anticipate a 'considerable' recovery this year, largely as a result of loss elimination from restructuring, and are proposing a maintained dividend. Sales of the aluminium division were off 7.7 per cent to SFr2.7bn, and its operating income plunged 39.5 per cent to SFr95m.</p>

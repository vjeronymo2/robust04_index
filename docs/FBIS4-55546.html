			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by European Parliament President Egon Klepsch to a </F> joint session of the Romanian Parliament in Bucharest on 17 May  -- live; Klepsch speaks in English with simultaneous translation  into Romanian]    [Text] President of the Senate, President of the Chamber  of Deputies, members of both houses of the Romanian Parliament,  ladies and gentlemen:    It is a great honor and pleasure for me to be able to be  here  with you on the occasion of my official visit to Romania. On  behalf of all my colleagues in the European Parliament, I thank  you most warmly for your invitation. When I assumed my function  as president of the European Parliament in January 1992 I knew  that it would be impossible during my two and a half years  mandate to visit all the countries with which the European Union  enjoys positive European links. Nevertheless, I was determined  to visit Romania. The European Parliament follows closely the  relations with all countries neighboring the European Union and  mainly those in Central and East Europe. Romania is no  exception. Since the crucial events of 1989 and 1990 the policy  of the countries in the European Union and the efforts of their  governments and parliaments and especially of the European  Parliament have been directed toward establishing and building a  new political and economic structure in Central and Eastern  Europe, the Baltic countries, and the CIS.    Developing, improving, and deepening economic and trade  relations between the European Union and these countries has  acquired a particular importance in 1994. On their part, the  countries that were previously locked under Soviet domination in  the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] and the Warsaw  Pact now have the freedom to devote all their efforts to  confront the challenges that the current situation presents.  The architecture of East-West relations are generally  characterized by a new spirit of cooperation. The days of  isolation, confrontation, and mistrust are over. There is a  determined political will of both sides to create relations  based on friendship, partnership, and mutual respect. I hardly  need to remind Romania, of all countries, how difficult and  painful is the transition from the communist regime to a  peaceful multiparty democracy and from decades of planned  economy to a social market economy. This takes time, much  patience, and great efforts.    Romania in particular is confronted with great challenges  and  tries to implement reforms and at the same time to take care of  the painful legacy of the past and the current social and  political realities.    The progress you have already made, in spite of all  obstacles, deserves recognition and respect. The progress that  you have yet to make deserves our understanding, support, and  encouragement. This is why I said that I believed that it is  important for me to come here to Romania, learn about your  preoccupations first hand, and assure you of the European  Parliament's continuous support for your efforts to try and take  your rightful, integrated place in the European family.    Your history is European and I am convinced that Romania's  future is also linked to Europe. I am equally convinced that  Romania and its people wish to confront challenges and wish to  attain their goals. On its part, the European Union has  recognized that it must find appropriate ways and means to help  bring the European countries closer together in a broader  association. This is where association agreements intervene.  The association agreement signed between Romania and the  European Union is a significant step in the right direction.  Its realistic aim is to offer realistic assistance and support  for the future, which is necessary for restructuring and which  enables the creation of conditions for full integration.    Over and above economic and trade policy aspects, the  European accord has a new special characteristic that is mainly  a political accord and dialogue on several issues. It supports  the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights that  each country that wishes to be associated closely to the Europe  must pledge to respect. The European Parliament takes its  responsibility and its role very seriously as far as  restructuring of relations with the European Union and with the  countries in the Central and Eastern Europe are concerned. As  far as all the accords concluded with Central and Eastern Europe  are concerned, we have made a very close and critical assessment  of the results of relations between the European Commission and  Romania. After a thorough debate and a serious assessment, we  approved the European accord with a great majority, while being  perfectly aware of the implications.    Our parliament was the first parliament of the European  Union  which ratified the agreement with Romania. Since then, we put  pressure on other parliaments in Europe as well, to follow our  example. Delays in the ratification can only hinder those who  must support this agreement. All European agreements mean much  more than trade and financial assistance, no matter how  important these aspects are. Full association also involves  cooperation at social, political, and cultural levels. In this  respect, the European Parliament grants special attention to its  formal and informal relations with the parliaments of the  countries in question. We look forward to achieving the  establishment of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that is  stipulated in the association agreement with Romania. Following  one of the existing European delegations [words indistinct] in  relations with Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, I am sure that  this new structure will offer an extremely valuable forum for  continuous discussions and for an increased mutual  understandings between the two parliaments. The integration  process [words indistinct], a strong European Union from the  economic and political point of view, will be able to offer the  countries in Central and East Europe the support that they need  in order to achieve long-term economic stability and political  security.    The European Union has its own internal difficulties which  generally appear on the road of a stronger integration. In  spite of these internal problems that we have, to be a full  member is an attractive proposal for those outside of it. On  its part, the European Parliament has consistently spoken out  for enlargement. This month, in our last session that we had  before the European elections, we took a historical step, we  cast a vote in favor of enlargement of the Union in order to  include our friends from Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria.  This was a vote that confirmed the capacity of the European  Parliament to answer with significant responsibility all the  membership applications. Likewise, it confirmed our sincere  commitment toward the principle of enlargement. At the same  time, the European Parliament welcomed the decision taken by the  Council of Europe on 22 June 1993 in Copenhagen, where the heads  of state and governments showed the possibility for  participation in the European Union of those countries in  Central and Eastern Europe that signed or will sign association  agreements. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled and  the progress the Parliament asked for reported, we see that  there is a possibility for a further enlargement, which is an  positive act and which consolidates the European Union.    The guiding principle in the geographic expansion of the  Union should be accompanied by a corresponding process of  establishing especially fundamental institutions. In order to  be eligible for membership, those who submit the request have to  fulfill a number of fundamental conditions, which are the  following: a state based on freedom and the rule of law, a  pluralistic democracy, a functioning social market economy, and  the willingness to give up sovereignty [as heard]. In addition  to these four basic fundamental preconditions, the following  conditions are also necessary: adoption in full of the [words  indistinct] the existing body of the community legislation,  which came into force through the Rome treaty and [word  indistinct] and adherence to the Maastricht treaty and all its  objectives, which also includes the political goals of the  treaty.    History has taught us that the road forward must be through  cooperation and integration and not through confrontation and  separation. It is completely in our interest to cooperate with  those who share our fundamental values of democracy, tolerance,  and mutual respect. We should build structures that will allow  us to achieve our joint goals, long term peace, and prosperity.    Reaching the necessary agreements for stability with Central  and Eastern Europe and Russia and the other countries in the  CIS, Baltic states, and the Balkans is a precondition to create  a new, broad European security structure. Only if we achieve  this objective will it be possible to ensure that crises and  wars like the one in the former Yugoslavia will not happen again.    Our Parliament has welcomed the initiative taken by the  heads  of states and governments to move toward a European agreement  regarding stability in Europe. The goal is to prevent tension  and potential conflicts in Europe, to consolidate borders, and  solve the problems of minorities in a spirit of tolerance and  cooperation.    Romania occupies a particularly sensitive geographical and  strategic position, which is far from stable. Because of this,  you have suffered directly from the negative economic effects of  the terrible conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Also due to its  position, your country could make a significant contribution to  stability and peace in this region. Therefore, we noted in  connection with Romania that it was the first of many countries  that decided to accept Partnership for Peace made by the NATO  and the Western Alliance at its January meeting. The engagement  of Romania in this respect is clear and I congratulate you on  it. The current conflicts in Europe and in other parts of the  world demonstrate without any doubt that long-term peaceful  coexistence and mutual cooperation is not possible unless the  principles of tolerance, democracy, and respect for human rights  are applied and are preserved throughout the world. The  architecture of Europe will necessarily change to an ever  greater extent as we are advancing toward a greater integration,  a greater political union, and a more comprising enlargement.  However, in spite of these changes, these fundamental  principles and our commitments must remain firm. The future of  Europe will ultimately depend on the success of our strivings.  I am confident that Romania shares this commitment. I am sure  too, that there is a political will in your country to make the  necessary steps and to ensure that the future of Romania and of  its people will be one of peace, democracy, and prosperity in  the heart of an integrated Europe. You may rest assured that  the European Parliament supports you and encourages you in  achieving this goal. I can tell you, Europe needs Romania but  certainly Romania also needs Europe. Thank you for your  attention. [applause]</p>

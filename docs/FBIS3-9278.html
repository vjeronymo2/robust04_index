The chairwoman of the All-Polish Trade  Unions Agreement [OPZZ] sent a fax to the prime minister in  which she asked him to explain whether it is true that the  Council of Ministers is supposed to accept or reject legal  documents prepared by the experts.    "We absolutely reject the possibility of such a situation.  We cannot have decisions that will be binding on everyone but  that will only come out of government-Solidarity talks. We also  have something to say here," Ewa Spychalska told RZECZPOSPOLITA.    Solidarity activists have been saying the whole time that  the  team of experts is supposed to deal with the trade union's  demands, so that they may be referred to the government in due  course.    "The experts will transform the demands into the language of  legal acts, while the Council of Ministers will make the  political decision whether to approve," Piotr Zak, a spokesman  for the [Solidarity] National Commission told us. But the OPZZ  rules out such a situation.    "My feeling is that there is a discrepancy between the  information I received from the prime minister in our  conversation and the way the media reported on the results of  the prime minister's talks with Solidarity," OPZZ Chairwoman Ewa  Spychalska said Tuesday [22 March], during a break in a session  of the OPZZ Council's Presidium.    Spychalska is concerned about the fact that, according to  media reports, the experts for the government and Solidarity are  to work out legislative drafts regarding implementation of the  trade union's demands and then submit them to the Council of  Ministers for approval.    "That suggests a different procedure used by the government  in its talks with my colleagues from Solidarity," Spychalska  said.    The OPZZ chairwoman had been informed that all the experts  were to do was to put the demands of Solidarity in a certain  order and then refer them to multiparty negotiations within  negotiating teams or within the Trilateral Commission because  the "demands apply to all employees, not just to Solidarity  members." So she sent a fax to the prime minister asking for an  explanation.    "In every civilized country, differences are resolved within  trilateral arrangements. Representatives of all trade unions  must be partners for deciding issues that concern all  employees," Spychalska said. She also added that, when it comes  to a point where the government treats various trade unions  differently, the OPZZ will make decisions on what to do next.  But she refused to explain what kinds of decisions these could  be, apart from saying that they will try to get the desired  results "with every legally allowed method."    The OPZZ is waiting for the prime minister's decision  regarding the activity of experts for the government and  Solidarity. When asked to comment on the OPZZ chairwoman's  doubts, Dariusz Jadowski, director of the Government's Press  Office, only cited an excerpt from a joint communique issued  after the Pawlak-Krzaklewski meeting: "Results of the prime  minister's meeting with the chairmen of the Independent  Self-Governing Trade Union `Solidarity' and other trade unions,  like the results of the experts' work, will be presented to a  session of the Council of Ministers and debated there."    --The following trade unions declared that they are joining  the OPZZ: The Polish Bailiffs Trade Union and the  Copper-Industry Employees Trade Union. The latter was a member  of the trade union center as a member of the Miners Trade Union  Federation, which it left along with the ZFFG [expansion  unknown]. In December of 1991, the Copper Industry Employees  Trade Union received the legal status of an all-Polish trade  union. Ryszard Zbrzyzny, its chairman, headed a strike  committee that conducted a 32-day strike in the KGHM SA "Polish  Copper" in July and August 1992. According to Zbrzyzny, the  trade union has 12,000 members.    --The Presidium of the National Commission of the  Independent  Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity" has issued an appeal to  the Brown Coal National Section not to begin an active strike  that was planned for 24 March and to wait until the strike  headquarters issues a decision.</p>

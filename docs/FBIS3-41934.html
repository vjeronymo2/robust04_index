			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] At 1245 on 1 October, Mr.  Phaithun Kaeothong, deputy minister of labor and social welfare,  issued a statement concerning the 1 October announcement by the  United States that it will bomb the chemical weapons plant in  Libya, which could affect the Thai laborers in Libya. He said  that the U.S. report stated that there are 200 Thai laborers  working at that chemical weapons plant. The three employment  agencies that sent the workers were the S.P.C. Suphachok  Company, the W. and M. Associates Company, and the Handle Group  Company. The Ministry of Labor has placed the S.P.C. Suphachok  Company on the black list. The other two companies are illegal  companies that have never registered, and officials have been  ordered to take action against them.    "There is no cause for concern among Thai workers in Libya,  because we have ordered the Thai labor attache in Greece to look  after the laborers in Libya. Officials have information on the  bombing targets and will immediately evacuate the Thai laborers  to safe spots. That chemical weapons plant is located in Rafta.  So far we have not been able to make contact, because Libya has  refused to grant visas to officials. And those that have been  allowed into the country have been restricted with respect to  where they can go, making it difficult to meet with the Thai  laborers. But the Thai-language service of the BBC radio has  contacted those Thai laborers and told them to find a way to  leave the munitions plant. The Ministry of Labor has prepared  evacuation measures and has submitted a request to the cabinet  for 200 million baht to pay for this," said Mr. Phaithun. He  added that Thai workers continue to go to Libya to work. But  employment companies have been told that if they send workers to  work in munitions plants, their permits will be revoked  immediately. The Ministry of Labor has a list of all employment  companies and knows which companies are doing what.    Dr. Bun Wanasin, an adviser to the minister of labor said  that at present the situation in Libya is not serious. That  threat made by the United States is just an attempt by the  United States to put pressure on Libya to turn over the two  terrorists. The United States is not expected to bomb Libya for  at least two weeks, and Libya has not made any preparations  because it is still negotiating with the United States. [passage  omitted]    At 1630 hours that same day at the Labor Skills Development  Department, police officials from the Suppression Division took  a number of suspects and a large number of documents concerning  illegal job placement and turned them over to the  director-general of the department.    After reviewing the documents, Mr. Sinchai Riantrakun,  deputy  director-general of the Labor Skills Development Department,  said that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, minister of labor,  ordered the department to cooperate with officials from the  Suppression Division and special operations units in searching  the offices of the Handle Group Company Ltd. located at 119/265  Sukhaphiban Road. There, they found job applications, pictures  of the workers, money orders that the job applicants had given  to the company, money orders for agent fees, airplane tickets,  119 passports, and labor contracts from Libyan employers. Some  of these documents were fakes that had been copied from the  Labor Employment Department. The officials arrested Mrs.  Sisuphat Hongthong, Mr. Suchat Hongthong, Mr. Suphot Phetmunwai,  and Mr. Narong Yingsap and charged them with placing laborers  without first obtaining permission from the registrar. These  people are all company officials. The owners of this company,  Mr. Chatchai Hongthong and Mrs. Arak Phinrat, managed to escape.  Officials are now looking for them.    Mr. Sinchai said that during the interrogation, the company  officials said that the company had been sending workers to  Libya for 2 to 3 years. Their fee was 30-40,000 baht per person.  On the application, it stated that the workers would be employed  as mechanics, welders, blacksmiths, concrete workers, and  physicians' assistants. But it hasn't been confirmed that this  company was sending laborers to work at the chemical weapons  plant in Libya as American officials have stated. The suspects  will have to be questioned further, and the data on the large  number of disks will have to be studied.    "I want to stress that this action was taken in accord with  the labor employment law. Employers in Libya probably understand  this. This should not have any effect on our international  relations, because this action was taken in accord with Thai  laws. The illegal labor issue is a major problem today. The  Labor Employment Department will take resolute action in  investigating matters. Those who find jobs for people abroad  must do things in accord with the law," said Mr. Sinchai. He  added that these violations are criminal violations for which  people can be imprisoned for up to ten years and fined 60,000 to  200,000 baht.</p>

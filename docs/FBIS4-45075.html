			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, Sudanese al-Ummah </F> Party Secretary General, by Nizar Daw-al-Na'im; place and date  not given--first two paragraphs are AL-HAYAH introduction]    [Text] London--Dr. 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, secretary general of  Sudan's opposition al-Ummah Party and ex-finance minister, has  asserted that "there is no place for a bilateral formula between  the Islamic Front and al-Ummah party" and that his party's call  for civil struggle [jihad madani] and a popular uprising against  President 'Umar al-Bashir's regime continues to exist and "we  have to be more optimistic and have to hope to topple the regime  at the lowest cost." He expressed the opinion that the  government is the party that first raised the issue of self-  determination for the south.    In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Dr. Nur-al-Da'im said that  the  Democratic National Grouping [DNG] "is experiencing  organizational problems and disputes." He criticized the fact  that "some Coordination Committee members engage in executive  tasks and issue statements in the Grouping's name. He said that  his party faults Faruq Abu-'Isa, who headed the DNG meetings  recently, for "holding contacts and making statements in his  capacity as the DNG executive chairman." He also criticized the  Communist Party severely and urged it not to intervene in his  party's affairs. Here is the text of the interview:    [Dar-al-Na'im] What is your assessment of Sudan's conditions  and what is the solution you offer for the country's problems?    [Nur-al-Da'im] To date, we have lived nearly five years  under  the umbrella of the NIF [National Islamic Front], which staged a  fascist military coup and proclaimed specific goals in its first  communique--goals which included achievement of peace and  elimination of the citizens' hardship and of the government's  isolation. But secretly, the NIF's goal was to establish an  Islamic society that would act as a model for the world's  cultural tendency. But the outcome has been collapse in all  spheres of humanitarian activity and the spread of corruption  and maladies. Peace has become inaccessible and a terrorist  autocratic regime has come into existence instead of an Islamic  state. The NIF has committed suicide after 50 years of action.  This is the crisis. The cure is achieved by developing a formula  to ensure the restoration of peace and to liquidate the  tyrannical state established by the NIF. A stable climate is the  basis for a new beginning in development and construction. There  is no magic wand to repair the damage. Sudan's political  movement is aware of the developments occurring in today's  world. Therefore, DNG plans and other parties' and unions' plans  must be presented at a comprehensive conference in which the  Sudanese, who seek freedom, agree on the future.    [Dar-al-Na'im] Does your call for civil struggle against the  regime still exist? What does this call mean? Will you accept a  reconciliation formula that brings the government and the  opposition together to deal with the situation?    [Nur-al-Da'im] Our call for civil struggle continues to  exist  and to escalate. The final outcome will be a popular revolution  similar to the revolutions that the Sudanese people have come to  master and that they have already staged twice. Struggle against  the dictatorship is of two kinds: the first is military and it  is taking place in the south. The second is civil and it is  taking place in the north. We have to be more optimistic and we  have to hope to topple the regime at the lowest cost. The  socialist camp governments were toppled within months by popular  uprisings and by the so-called peaceful resistance. This is what  brother al-Sadiq al-Mahdi (former prime minister and al-Ummah  Party chairman) has called civil struggle. What happened during  'Id al-Fitr prayers, when al-Mahdi led nearly 1 million persons  in prayer, whereas al-Bashir led no more than 1,000 persons less  than three kilometers away, confirms that the Muslim masses  support the al-Mahdi sect and not the NIF, the original and not  the imported. There is no place for any bilateral formula  between the NIF and al-Ummah Party, especially since the base of  al-Ummah Party, which consists of the al-Ansar supporters, has  considered confiscation of Imam al-Mahdi's Dome, al-Khalifah  Mosque, and the al-Ansar Affairs Council building an aggression  against the creed. The NIF is responsible for offending the  Sudanese people's values.    [Dar-al-Na'im] Many speak of points of agreement between you  and the NIF. What are these points and what are the subjects of  disagreement?    [Nur-al-Da'im] The al-Ummah Party is one of Sudan's and  Africa's biggest parties. It is a popular and broad-based  democratic party with Arab, Islamic, and African tendencies. It  has dealt with the NIF as it dealt with SANU [Sudan African  National Union]. But after reconciliation with (former  President) Ja'far Numayri, we disagreed on the future of Islam  in Sudan. The NIF encouraged Numayri and pledged its allegiance  to him as imam, whereas we decided that Islam can only flourish  under the canopy of freedom. We, whether in the government or in  the opposition, have cooperated with the NIF respectfully. Our  party helped the NIF and protected it from communist oppression.  But regrettably, the NIF has chosen the path of coups and of  imposing its will by force. The collapse in the various aspects  of life and the humiliation the citizen is experiencing have  created a deep chasm between the NIF and al-Ummah Party in the  political and Islamic spheres.    [Dar-al-Na'im] You recently proposed a formula for an  agreement with the southerners in which you call for a  referendum on self-determination in four years. Has this formula  been accepted by the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement?    [Nur-al-Da'im] The al-Ummah Party chairman Sadiq al-Mahdi  presented a complete peace plan in the wake of the failure of  the first Abuja talks and when it became evident that the regime  was offering, in the absence of the country's main forces, a  deficient and limited vision that couldn't be accepted by the  southern movement. The al-Ummah Party's plan focuses on a  solution through consent among the Sudanese people. It also  focuses on democracy; political, cultural, religious, and ethnic  plurality; regional decentralism; federalism and confederalism;  and on establishing citizenship as the basis. If war is the only  alternative, then self-determination has to be considered in the  light of permanent peace.    The NIF proceeded to raise the self-determination issue at  the Frankfurt talks that were held at the beginning of 1992  (between the government and the al-Nasir wing of the SPLM). This  was the first time that the self-determination issue gained  weight. Meanwhile, the war continued and the regime proceeded to  touch off the religious and holy war dimension. The southerners  united behind the call for self-determination that was  introduced by the regime into the Sudanese political agenda for  the first time ever. Brother Mubarak al-Mahdi submitted the  al-Ummah Party formula to a session of the British House of  Lords. This formula enables self-determination to proceed in the  direction of Sudan's unity instead of the direction of  separation.    [Dar-al-Na'im] You have said repeatedly that external  opposition is an arm of the internal opposition. What is the  external opposition's task and what has it accomplished?    [Nur-al-Da'im] In light of the domestic oppression, the  fascism established by the regime, and the suppression of  opponents, and even of disgruntled supporters, such as Mahjub  'Urwah, his faction, and his paper, AL-SUDANI AL-DUWALI, it is  normal that the external opposition's voice would be heard  clearly because this opposition is free to move. There is no  doubt that the external arm of the DNG has accomplished several  things, especially in exposing the deceptive image the regime  has used to project itself abroad. This arm has also succeeded  in condemning the regime's escalation of the war in the south  and of its introduction of the religious dimension into this  war, in defending human rights, and in projecting the Sudanese  people's struggle for freedom.    When opposition action escalated and came to be in need of a  strong executive decisionmaking instrument, the DNG decided to  work through a coordination committee to replace its  minimal-level coordination. This led to the talk about  restructuring the DNG abroad. It had been agreed to settle this  issue at a conference, which was scheduled to take place last  November. But the war circumstances prevented its convocation.  The al-Ummah Party has noticed that some coordination committee  members have been recently engaging in executive tasks and  making statements in the Grouping's name. We have already warned  that it is necessary to end such acts. Moreover, the al-Ummah  Party has presented to the Grouping forces abroad a memorandum  that contains specific proposals and observations on how to end  such actions until the structure is completed. This is a  legitimate issue that can be debated. There is no place for  sensitivities in public action.    [Dar-al-Na'im] Why have you called for ousting Faruq  Abu-'Isa  from the DNG leadership and what do you mean by saying that "he  lacks neutrality?"    [Nur-al-Da'im] Nobody slights the role that brother Abu-'Isa  has played within the DNG, especially in defending human rights  and upholding the opposition's banner. But what the al-Ummah  Party faults Abu-'Isa for is that he has made contacts and  issued statements in his capacity as DNG executive chairman. The  fact is that brothers Abu-'Isa and Bona Maloual were selected to  manage the sessions of a meeting held in Addis Ababa. The  al-Ummah Party has decided that since Maloual has withdrawn and  since Abu-'Isa has promoted himself to the position of DNG  executive chairman, then the chairmanship is supposed to be  periodic so embarrassment will be avoided. It isn't surprising  that the external Communist Party would issue a statement  defending brother Abu-'Isa, one of this party's historical  leaders. What is surprising is that the Communist Party would  dish out charges against brother Mubarak al-Mahdi, al-Ummah  Party's representative abroad, and that it would turn the issue  into a personal issue. Brother al-Mahdi and the team that leads  al-Ummah Party's action abroad don't need the Communist Party to  evaluate their performance because they have shouldered the main  part of the burden to strengthen the DNG procession and the  opposition leadership.    [Dar-al-Na'im] Accusations have been made against Mubarak  al-Mahdi because he has firm relations with the NIF.    [Nur-al-Da'im] Mubarak al-Mahdi's relations with the NIF  aren't personal relations. The al-Ummah Party Political Bureau  has assigned Mubarak, along with Dr. Hasan Taj-al-Din and Dr.  Shaykh Mahjub, to take charge of relations with the NIF. The  party has assigned and Dr. Adam Musa Mawbu and me to follow up  on the relations with the [Democratic] Unionist Party. It has  also assigned brother Bakri 'Adil, Sarah al-Fadil, and Dr.  Bashir 'Umar to tend to relations with the Communist Party, the  Nasirist Revival [Ba'th] Party, and the National Party. With  this twisted logic, we can list 'Adil and his team as supporters  of the Communist Party. I urge the Communist Party not to  embroil itself in such issues. We have expected that with the  lapse of five years since the end of internationalism, the  Communist Party would introduce us to its new position instead  of allowing itself to enter into labyrinths that make us suspect  that this party still doesn't believe in democracy.    There is no doubt that the DNG is experiencing  organizational  problems and disagreements on how to deal with newly developing  issues, such as the self-determination issue. However, such  problems accompany every organization and movement. Opposition  action has its numerous channels at home and abroad, and these  channels have never been blocked. Regardless of whether the DNG  is restructured or not, and regardless of whether the ambition  of some individuals or factions makes them play or not play a  role that is not assigned to them, the opposition procession at  home and abroad will continue and will achieve results in  defeating the regime that has begun to collapse and to be eroded  by the power of the Sudanese people.    [Dar-al-Na'im] The al-Ummah Party deputy chairman  Nasr-al-Din  al-Hadi recently made statements in which he criticized you and  the official in charge of external action. What is your opinion?    [Nur-al-Da'im] Brother Nasr-al-Din remained silent for ages  and then opened his mouth only to utter a blasphemy. Like the  Communist Party, he has moved to defend brother Abu-'Isa. We  believe that he departed from Sudan to oppose the al-Ummah  Party, not the regime. He has had no connection with the party's  action at home or abroad. He has tried to dispute legitimacy of  the party's institutions. Nasr-al-Din formed a small team, which  he called the collective party leadership. But this team didn't  survive long because its objective was to impede the role of the  opposition al-Ummah Party and to serve the Front. As for  Nasr-al-Din's talk about my appointment as chairman of the  party's General Secretariat, it isn't true that I was selected.  I won the majority of the votes in accordance with the party  constitution. Responsibilities were divided and I became the  General Secretariat chairman and the official in charge of the  Political Department and Nasr-al-Din became finance secretary.    When organizational performance was affected after most  General Secretariat members entered the Cabinet, a committee  that had reviewed the party performance recommended cancellation  of the general secretariat system and reinstatement of the  general secretary and deputy general secretary system. Party  institutions approved this recommendation and selected me as  secretary general and selected brother Bakri 'Adil as my deputy.  At the time, an advisory presidential council was formed under  the chairmanship of al-Sadiq al-Mahdi and it included previous  secretariat members who hadn't been assigned any executive  duties. Brother al-Sadiq al-Mahdi appointed brother Nasr-al-Din  as his deputy in managing this council's sessions. Therefore,  Nasr-al-Din wasn't the party deputy chairman, as he alleges.  This position doesn't exist in the party constitution. It is  regrettable that brother Nasr-al-Din al-Mahdi has come out to  offend the party and its leaders. I have the honor to support  the position of Mubarak al-Mahdi and his team. This is the least  that the al-Ummah Party secretary general can do.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals put on a spurt Precious metals went through a brief torrid interlude yesterday afternoon as a sudden burst of buying on the New York Commodity Exchange sent prices spurting upwards. Silver lead the way by gaining nearly 4 per cent to touch Dollars 4.62 a troy ounce at one point, gold jumped to Dollars 377 an ounce and platinum reached Dollars 374. Analysts said buying, mainly by New York funds, was prompted by the announcement of economic data showing a surge in construction spending and a big rise in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index. These data suggested a strong US economic recovery, which might eventually cause a rise in inflation, they pointed out. The surge spilled over to trading in London where the shorts - or those who had sold metal they did not own in the expectation of buying it later at a lower price - rushed to cover their positions. However, the excitement died away as quickly as it appeared. One trader suggested that the funds pushed prices up through various important points on the technical charts and, having achieved their objectives, allowed prices to drop back again. Gold closed in London up Dollars 4.45 an ounce at Dollars 375.45, silver ended at Dollars 4.57 1/2 , up 13 cents an ounce, while platinum closedonly 10 cents up at Dollars 366.75.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Yong- sam, a puppet, a few days ago invited the traitors Chon  Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, dictators of the "Fifth and Sixth  Republics", to "Chongwadae" [presidential office] and solicited  their "active cooperation". And the two military dictators  expressed "thanks" for his "magnanimity" and accepted the  request.    The fact that the traitor Kim Yong-sam kissed the dictators  of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" at the beginning of the new  year bespeaks that he chose to openly collude with his  predecessors, say press commentaries here today.    A news analyst of NODONG SINMUN says:    Kim Yong-sam the puppet is a born fascist and traitor. That  is why he, while talking about "liquidation of the past" and  "reforms", has defended and protected the chief culprits in the  Kwangju massacre and is now taking the road of treachery,  fascism, confrontation and war by succeeding to the military  dictatorial system of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" without  any reform.    It is crystal clear that the traitor Kim Yong-sam who came  to  power through his political marriage to the dictators of the  "Fifth and Sixth Republics" can neither part with them nor  enforce reforms in South Korean society.    The puppet Kim Yong-sam is intending to find a way out in  openly joining hands with the military dictators of the "Fifth  and Sixth Republics" who have been forsaken by the people, but  it is a foolish dream.    A commentary of MINJU CHOSON says the traitor Kim who has  been driven to a tight corner, isolated from and rejected by the  people at home and abroad, is trying to prolong his remaining  days at any cost with the help of the successive military  fascist dictators. This is the last-ditch effort of the doomed,  notes the commentary.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Israel will today issue an unequivocal announcement  to the PLO in Tunis that the Taba talks will resume only on the  understanding that the negotiations' starting point are the  understandings already reached in Cairo. Israel insists that  neither of the parties raise any demands that contravene these  understandings.    Speaking at the end of today's cabinet session, the prime  minister said that the draft formulated in Cairo was not an  Israeli position paper, but rather understandings reached at the  most senior level between Israel and the PLO. It is  inconceivable, Yitzhaq Rabin said, not to honor understandings  reached at such a level and to then start haggling about them.  This kind of situation, Rabin said, raised doubts about whether  there was any point at all in reaching such understandings. If  the Palestinians reject the understandings, Rabin said,  everything is open.</p>

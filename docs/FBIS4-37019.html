			<p>BFN     [Text] Just about one month since the withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho, Israel's coordinator in the territories described  the transition as smooth, but said the problem for the  Palestinians remains that of lack of funds. Major General Dani  Rothschild, in a briefing to reporters, said the Palestinian  Authority needs startup funds for salaries and operating costs.  In a meeting in Paris last week, donor countries gave $42  million for operating costs. But the Palestinian budget is  three to four time that of what had been under Israeli  administration. Rothschild said the increase comes from having  to finance the police force. Previously security needs had been  supplied mostly by the Israel Army. Those costs came from a  separate budget. Rothschild also said Israel is continuing to  provide basic services, including electricity, water, and  telephones to the Palestinians in the autonomous areas, but the  Palestinians will recompense Israel when they can.    [Begin Rothschild recording] We didn't leave a paradise  there. With a population as big as in Gaza, with a poor  infrastructure, with lack of jobs, and with a very high birth  rate, it's almost impossible to create a paradise. Having said  that, we ensured that everyone who needs the basic service will  get it. Now, here and there we hear about people who didn't get  the services, and we are dealing every day with exceptions, but  at the end of the day those are exceptions, because the Israeli  Government has the responsibility to finance all those services  which I just mentioned until the Palestinian Authority will have  sufficient resources to finance itself. The answer is no, the  Israeli Government will not finance those services, but having  said that, the Israeli Government will ensure that those  services are going to be given to the Palestinian Authority and  in the meantime Israel will pay for it, and in the future Israel  and the Palestinian Authority, in a joint economic committee  which was decided upon in Paris, will sit and will arrange all  those bills, so eventually the Palestinian Authority will have  to pay.

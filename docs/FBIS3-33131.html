Carles is the  presidential candidate for the Nationalist Liberal Republican  Movement, National Renewal Movement, and Civic Renewal Party.    "Not enough has been done to combat the corruption inherited  from past regimes, since it is not enough to denounce them.  Corruption continues to seriously harm the interests of the  Treasury, government functions, and the majority of the people,"  the former comptroller general added.    Carles indicated that privileges, concessions, pacts,  bribes,  and the "play it smart" attitude are the norm for persons who  corrupt others and for corrupt persons who are bleeding the  state and the people who strive for a better country. "The  multiplication of these illegal and criminal activities that  range from fixing fines and bonds to drug trafficking and money  laundering undermine a citizen's chance to obtain greater  progress and freedom," he noted. [passage omitted]    According to the presidential candidate, "widespread"  unemployment is another consequence of the corruption in the  state bureaucracy, which has tentacles that reach the major  public services and which does not meet the essential needs of  all Panamanians for health, housing, transportation,  communications, electricity, and water.    He said the inefficiency and deficiency of public services  constitutes one of the clearest examples of the "prevalence of  corruption" that feeds on institutionalized immunity through a  series of provisions and laws that allow influence peddling,  something that is a slap in the face of the people and prevents  national and international investments.</p>

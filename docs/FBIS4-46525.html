			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Moscow </F> "Aircraft Engines-94" exhibition by A. Peslyak and M. Fokeyev,  identified by caption]    [Text] [161545] [Peslyak over video of entrance to  exhibition, first sentence partly obliterated by music] In  addition to aircraft engines, car, tractor, and ship engines and  other power plant are on show. Engines produced in Perm, St.  Petersburg, Omsk, Ufa, and Barnaul are by no means inferior to  the output of the world-famous BMW or Pratt &amp; Whitney  companies.    Academician Kuznetsov, for example, is presenting his new  engine developed in Samara -- a unique environment-friendly and  economical engine for large-capacity aircraft. [video shows  movie of engine in action]    The Mozhayskiy Academy, which produces the nuclear-powered  Topaz on which the Americans are so keen, has discovered a new  motion principle. Mikhail Ostrikov, the creator of the miracle  magnet, sees a great future in the skies and on earth for this  essentially everlasting engine.

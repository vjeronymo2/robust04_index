DUMA has learned from a well-informed Rakovski  Legion source that the Defense Ministry and the General Staff  are behind these cuts.    The massive cuts were expected to take place on the eve of  the Rakovski Legion Second Congress, which will take place at  the beginning of June. The Legion's officers assume that  Minister Valentin Aleksandrov and highranking officers from the  General Staff, among them, P. Petkov, Z. Iliev, P. Shushkov, and  others, were behind the attack against the legion. The first  announcements of the cuts are expected any day now. Major  General Denev, commander of the 2d Army, has personally banned  the distribution of Rakovski Legion documents.    It is assumed that the settling of accounts between the  chiefs of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff began after  the meeting of the dismissed Rakovski Legion spokesman, Captain  Second Rank Vasil Danov, and President Zhelev, at which Danov  reportedly expressed the Legion's indignation with the fact that  the General Staff payroll was inflated, viewed against the  background of the meager Armed Forces' budget.    According to Rakovski Legion sources, the General Staff is  trying to split their organization through persons the General  Staff planted in the Legion's leadership. It is expected that  in the next few days the Legion will convene an extraordinary  confederative council, at which it will formulate its tactics  regarding behavior in contacts with the ministry and General  Staff. The Legion will also inform EUROMIL, of which it is a  member, about developments. High-ranking active service and  reserve officers assume that persecution of the Legion will  exacerbate relations between junior officers and high-ranking  commanders, and between the various army branches. Major  General Mikho Mikhov, Air Force and Air Defense commander, has  already said he objects to the envisaged cuts.    Despite the announcement of the Defense Ministry Press  Center  that there will be no cuts as an end in itself, the officers  complain that Ground Forces Commander General Totomirov has not  intervened in favor of any Rakovski Legion officer who has been  cut.    In response to a National Assembly member's question on 11  March Minister Aleksandrov said that the Legion members who had  been dismissed had violated the regulations and the principle of  one-man command, and therefore their penalties were totally  justified. He pointed out that he will preserve the spirit of  partnership between the ministry and the Legion.    After his return from Brussels, Army General Lyuben Petrov,  commander of the General Staff, expressed almost the same  position to DUMA. According to him the dismissals were a  correct sanction, and that personally, he has nothing against  the Rakovski Legion officers, as long as they observe the  regulations. The officers have the right to present their  social claims, but they must do so through established  procedures and not through petitions, the General Staff  commander said.</p>

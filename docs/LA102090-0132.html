			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA'S DOMINANCE OF CAL IS IN JEOPARDY TODAY  </P> <P> Streaks can be burdensome, not only for the teams on the losing side, but also  the winners.  </P> <P> Take the UCLA-California football series, for example. The Bears haven't beaten  the Bruins since 1971, a string of 18 games.  </P> <P> There's pressure to end the streak -- and also to maintain it.  </P> <P> Today at Memorial Stadium in Strawberry Canyon, the Bears probably have their  best opportunity in many years to beat the Bruins.  </P> <P> The game is rated a tossup. Cal has a better overall record than UCLA, 4-2 to  3-3, and the Bears have won three consecutive games.  </P> <P> The teams have identical Pacific 10 Conference records, 2-1, so it's an  elimination contest. A school is virtually out of contention in the Rose Bowl  race with two losses.  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Terry Donahue says the streak is highly unusual, but also plausible.  </P> <P> "In some years we just had better players and, in other years, we were lucky on  occasion," he said. "However, last year and this year we're a lot more  vulnerable to the streak (ending) than we have been in the past."  </P> <P> After beating Cal last season, 24-6, the Bruins won only one more game the rest  of the season.  </P> <P> Bruce Snyder, who is in his fourth season as Cal's coach, says that his team  has closed the talent gap against UCLA to some extent, adding, "That gives us  some hope."  </P> <P> At this point in the season, the Bears are usually out of the Rose Bowl race.  </P> <P> "That we're in the seventh game and still talking about the conference  standings is real refreshing," Snyder said.  </P> <P> Cal's improvement is mainly due to its running game, which ranked ninth in the  conference in 1989.  </P> <P> With the addition of Russell White, a former Encino Crespi star, alternating at  tailback with Anthony Wallace, formerly of Pasadena Community College, the  Bears' rushing game is formidable on the ground.  </P> <P> It ranks third in the conference, averaging 196.2 rushing yards. Wallace, the  league's No. 2 rusher, is averaging 96.8 and White, No. 4 in the league, is  averaging 81.8.  </P> <P> White has scored 10 touchdowns, one of them on a 99-yard kickoff return against  Miami.  </P> <P> Of the 6-foot, 200-pound White, who had to sit out a year because of academic  restrictions, Cal quarterback Mike Pawlawski said: "He's one of the great ones.  He has speed, natural instincts and great moves."  </P> <P> White, Wallace and fullback Greg Zomalt operate behind an offensive line led by  290-pound James Richards and 295-pound Ernie Rogers.  </P> <P> The Bears are averaging 29.8 points, but their defense has given up an average  of 31.3 points.  </P> <P> UCLA has similar statistics, averaging 26.2 points while yielding an average of  30.3. Today's game could be one of those 40-35 affairs, either way.  </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> In 1977, the Pac-10 required the Bruins to forfeit a 21-19 victory for using an  ineligible player. However, the NCAA didn't adjust the record to include a  forfeit. . . . Rushing update: Cal has averaged more than 3.2 yards a carry  only once in the last 14 years. The Bears are averaging four yards a carry  through six games this season.  </P> <P> UCLA center Lance Zeno, who has been inactive because of sprained foot  ligaments, is expected to start today. However, guard Vaughn Parker is  sidelined because of an ankle injury and will be replaced by Mike Linn.  </P></p>

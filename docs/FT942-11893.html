			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Nagorno-Karabakh toll rises The International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday said that recent fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh had caused hundreds of casualties and 50,000 people to flee their homes. ICRC spokesman Pierre Gauthier said most of the dead and wounded were soldiers. The agency was awaiting word from staff on the front line on exact numbers. The ICRC said it had sent tents, foods and medicines to the area but was stretched by the sheer numbers of people who had fled their homes in Azerbaijan over the past three weeks. Before the latest exodus there were about 600,000 displaced people in Azerbaijan as a result of the six-year civil war. In a statement, the ICRC said it was 'seriously concerned about the serious turn of events in the northern and eastern fronts in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict'. Nagorno-Karabakh is populated mostly by ethnic Armenians.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Elite and silky pleats ELIZABETH HALWAS does wondrous things with shimmering lengths of Indian silk. She starts by pleating it, Fortuny-style, and then she turns the results into accessories. Most desirable are probably her bags in gold, bronze, silver, green, purple, or almost any other colour - each one different. Many come embellished with beads - either antique Indian silver, onyx and hermatine, tiger eye or any semi-precious stone. Others are embellished with fresh water pearls or oyster shell and real pearls. She is willing to make to order. Plain silks come in all colours but there is a heavier metal and silk mixture which comes only in silver, gold, green or purple. Sketched here are just two examples of her designs. They are almost works of art in themselves and are clearly for nothing more practical than an evening out to dinner. Prices range from Pounds 90 to about Pounds 140. Lucienne Phillips, at 89 Knightsbridge, London SW1, has a good selection. Otherwise they can be bought directly from Elizabeth Halwas, 34 Cornwall Gardens, London SW7 (by appointment only, tel: 071-937-4703). She is also happy to dispatch by mail. Halwas also does beautiful scarves - a sliver of pleated gold or bronze at the neck does wonders for the most boring black dress. For those who fall in love with the fabric she can do larger garments. She would be happy to discuss designs by telephone.</p>

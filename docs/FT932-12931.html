			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Bond traders take over the reins of Wall Street / A look at a shift in power as takeover experts lose status WALL STREET'S bond traders are on a roll. Not only have they been bringing in billions of dollars of revenues for their employers in recent years, and millions of dollars in salary and bonuses for themselves, but they have also taken a firmer grasp of the reins of management on Wall Street. Their rise is a turnround from the 1980s, when the investment bankers from corporate advisory and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) departments, who put together the multi-million dollar transactions and earned the multi-million dollar fees, ruled the roost. Revenues from the M&amp;A business have tumbled over the past few years, and with them the status of corporate advisers and dealmakers. Recent managerial changes at big firms illustrate how the power base on Wall Street has shifted. In the most interesting move, Morgan Stanley surprised Wall Street in early March by announcing that Mr John Mack was replacing Mr Robert Greenhill as president of the firm. Mr Mack emerged from the bond trading side, having run Morgan Stanley's fixed-income securities operations for six years. His predecessor was a veteran investment banker, and one of the top M&amp;A advisers of the 1980s. Later the same month, a management shake-up was announced at Merrill Lynch. After the firm had created two management committees and moved executives, analysts labelled Mr David Komansky, the head of Merrill's bond operations, as the winner in the reshuffle. He was given charge of both debt and equity trading and sales, and was promoted to the new office of the chief executive. Finally, at the end of March the investment bank Lehman Brothers named Mr Richard Fuld, a former bond trader, as sole president of the company. Mr Fuld's appointment left his former co-president, the M&amp;A veteran Mr Tomilson Hill, out in the cold. Mr Hill promptly resigned. As Mr Michael Flanagan, an analyst at Lipper Analytical in New York, says: 'Just from the examples we've seen over the past few months, the emergence of the bond trader as a manager on Wall Street is more than a coincidence.' Mr Perrin Long, securities industry analyst at First Michigan, agrees. 'Bond traders, and traders in general, are getting more power. We saw that, for example, with the recent shifting around of the second- and third-tier levels of management at Morgan Stanley. And to some extent it's the M&amp;A people and the dealmakers who are losing out.' Mr Long, however, says there is nothing unusual about this power shift on Wall Street. 'If we go back to May Day (the abolition of fixed brokerage commissions in 1975) and the 1970s, the big guns were from the research department. They then went away, and in came the M&amp;A people during the 1980s, and they had their day in the sun. Now it's the bond people who are having their day in the sun. They will be in the driver's seat for the next couple of years, at least until interest rates come back up.' Low US interest rates and the steepening of the yield curve (the widening in the differential between yields on short- and long-term government securities) have been key elements in the traders' success. Low rates have reduced firms' total interest costs, which despite large debt loads are now shrinking to 1987 levels. And the steep yield curve has allowed traders to borrow cheaply at the short end and use the money to buy longer-term assets that not only earn higher rates of interest, but which also have been appreciating considerably in value because of the booming bond market. In this favourable climate, bond traders have thrived. According to Mr Long, trading revenues at Wall Street firms reached Dollars 16.3bn (Pounds 10bn), up from Dollars 9.9bn in 1988. Over the same period, however, revenues from the M&amp;A business have tumbled. In 1988, at the height of the M&amp;A boom, Wall Street's investment bankers brought in Dollars 1.37bn of fees from M&amp;A transactions. By last year, fees were just Dollars 217.3m. Trading revenues now account for a much bigger percentage of total industry earnings. In 1988, earnings from trading accounted for about 19 per cent of industry revenues, while investment banking revenues (which include M&amp;A, underwriting and corporate advisory fees) accounted for about 10 per cent of the total. By 1992, trading contributed 26 per cent of revenues, while the share taken up by investment banking had risen to only 12 per cent. Now that they play a greater role in generating profits, it is no surprise that traders are assuming more power on Wall Street. Yet does this mean that firms will now concentrate their energies more on their trading businesses, and less on the traditional work of advising corporate clients? Such a strategic shift would make the industry's earnings, already very volatile, even more prone to sudden swings. An emphasis among Wall Street firms on trading for their own account, however, is not a particularly new development. Since the mid-1980s securities houses and investment banks have increasingly pursued the shorter-term rewards of trading profits more rigorously than they have the longer-term returns from client relationship banking. The arrival of the traders at the top of the management tree can be seen as the culmination of that process. As for the danger of increased earnings volatility, Wall Street firms are well aware of the potential pitfalls. In the past few years many of the biggest players in the industry have added a new dimension to their earnings profile by aggressively building up a presence in asset management - an area traditionally dominated by the big mutual funds and money managers. The asset management business has grown quickly. In 1985 the fees Wall Street firms earned from managing client accounts totalled Dollars 947m. Last year, the business brought in more than Dollars 3bn. So does this mean that executives from the asset management will eventually take their turn at the top, perhaps after the traders? It is unlikely, says Mr Long, who adds, only half joking, that asset management 'just isn't a sexy enough business for Wall Street'.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                  WHERE WALL STREET EARNS ITS MONEY  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Revenues from              1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Commissions                12.6    8.8   10.2    8.9   10.6   11.6 Trading                     9.9   11.3   12.3   13.2   16.2   16.3 Investment Banking          5.2    5.2    4.1    3.2    6.1    7.5 Mutual Funds                2.2    1.4    1.6    1.7    2.1    2.8 Fees                        1.8    1.9    2.2    2.2    2.5    3.1 Other*                     19.0   23.2   29.1   24.8   23.8   21.5 Total revenues             50.7   51.8   59.5   54.0   61.3   62.8 Pre-tax profits (loss)      1.1    2.5    1.8   (0.2)   5.9    6.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: First of Michigan  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

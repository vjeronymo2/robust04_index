These reshuffles are causing a  great deal of debate. Today we have the opinion of Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy. Here's what he thinks about the new-look government.    [Begin Yavlinskiy recording] As far as the current  government  and its sentiments are concerned, then I can say that it is  typical of the governments that the Soviet Union had. It's a  typical government, consisting of absolutely different people,  most of whom have no legitimacy whatsoever because they're not  elected and didn't even run for election.    The second factor is that this is a government that has no  policy program. The problem, however, lies not in this but  elsewhere: the fact is that I am very concerned over what the  current government represents in the basic situation that today,  this year, is beginning to emerge. [end recording]    Those words were said by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy at a news  conference. My colleague Vyacheslav Osipov was there, so over  to him.    [Osipov] To continue our discussion about the government:  when Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed the decree on the  new composition of the government-cabinet, he had already  received several days earlier a letter from Grigoriy Yavlinskiy  in which the member of the State Duma set out a new concept for  structuring the government. On the basis of it, Yavlinskiy  proposed making the government responsible for inflationary  processes. At his news conference, the parliamentary faction  leader set out the reasons for the country's economic recession.  One of them, he believes, lies in mistakes made during  privatisation: using miscalculations in the way this is  implemented, workforces are directing all profit into  consumption rather than production, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy thinks.  He dwelled in particular on the complete refusal to extend soft  loans. This only fuels inflation and causes further decline in  the ruble rate of exchange. As regards this, Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy commented as follows:    [Begin Yavlinskiy recording] The falling exchange rate is  without doubt an inflationary factor, but bringing the rate into  line could have a positive impact for a while on our industry.  Therefore, if you hear gung-ho claims in February that things  are getting rather better, then that will be a temporary  phenomenon linked to the fact that the rate of exchange is  falling and imports are becoming less profitable than they were  before.    My last remark: You know of the Belarus agreement on  currency union. Even the sharpest critics of this agreement,  those who are most dissatisfied with it, reckon that the cost  comes to about 1.5 trillion rubles, a sum we cannot afford. I  want to say that this sum cannot even compare to the debts, for  example, that have built up to agriculture, the  military-industrial complex, and others. [end recording]</p>

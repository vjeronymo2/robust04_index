			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Support slips for coal power plants The electricity generating companies in England and Wales are unlikely to clean up more than two of their coal-fired power stations because the work is not economic, the chief executive of National Power said yesterday. Mr John Baker said that desulphurisation was 'yesterday's technology'. Apart from Drax in North Yorkshire which National Power, the largest generator, is currently cleaning up at a cost of Pounds 700m, and PowerGen's nearby station at Ratcliffe, which is also slated for desulphurisation, coal plants were 'withering assets', he said. By the time they had been cleaned up, they would be more than 30 years old with little useful life left. Coal stations were also much more vulnerable than other types of power station to tougher environmental measures, including a carbon tax. However, National Power was participating in research into clean coal technology which might provide an answer as long as coal was competitively priced. Mr Baker, who was addressing the Coal Industry Society, said that power generated from gas cost the same as power from cleaned-up coal plants, but was more attractive commercially because it burnt more efficiently and produced much less carbon dioxide. That was why environmental controls were among the strongest forces behind the progressive reduction in coal-fired power generation, Mr Baker said. Mr Baker forecast that coal's share of power generation would fall to only 30 per cent by the turn of the century, down from 75 per cent five years ago, yielding mainly to growing output from gas and nuclear stations.</p>

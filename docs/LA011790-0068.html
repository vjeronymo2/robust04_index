			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR SAYS FINGERPRINTS TIE GRANDSON TO MAN'S SLAYING;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE TRIAL BEGINS IN THE CASE OF A STRUGGLING ACTOR AND MUSICIAN CHARGED  WITH A 1983 KILLING.  </P> <P> More than six years after his grandfather was found beaten and shot to death in  North Hollywood, Noel P. Scott, 27, listened Tuesday in San Fernando Superior  Court as a prosecutor argued that Scott had committed the crime.  </P> <P> Opening statements began Tuesday in the trial of Scott, a struggling actor and  musician.  </P> <P> Scott was charged last February with murder in the October, 1983, slaying of  Louis Fox, 70, after Charles Berkowitz, a childhood friend of Scott's,  implicated him while in custody on suspicion of burglary.  </P> <P> Scott of Hollywood has denied the killing. He has said that he was at a  Hollywood club on the night of the slaying.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Sidney D. Trapp Jr. said Tuesday that fingerprints on a  flashlight found near the body indicates that Scott committed the Oct. 16,  1983, slaying in Fox's home.  </P> <P> Other evidence suggests that Fox knew his killer, Trapp said. Although the room  was not ransacked, Fox's jewelry was stolen from a hiding place, indicating  that the killer knew where the jewelry was kept, Trapp said.  </P> <P> Trapp said the testimony of Berkowitz, 26, and Scott's former girlfriend will  suggest that Scott planned and executed the crime.  </P> <P> Trapp said Scott's former girlfriend will testify that several weeks before the  crime, she rejected Scott's proposal of marriage because he was "a bit of a  loser" with no future prospects.  </P> <P> He told her that his financial difficulties would soon be over because he was  going to inherit his grandfather's estate, Trapp said.  </P> <P> In October, 1988, after he was arrested on suspicion of burglary, Berkowitz  gave investigators information that prompted them to reopen the investigation  into Fox's killing.  </P> <P> During a preliminary hearing last June, Berkowitz testified that two days after  the slaying, Scott asked Berkowitz how to change fingerprints and how to beat a  lie detector test.  </P> <P> Scott later asked his help in pawning a large diamond, Berkowitz testified.  </P> <P> Trapp said Tuesday that the diamond came from one of Fox's rings.  </P> <P> Shortly after he contacted police about the Scott case, Berkowitz accepted a  plea bargain with the district attorney's office and pleaded guilty to two  counts of burglary. He was sentenced to three years in state prison.  </P> <P> Three other counts against him were dropped.  </P></p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Jail for executive who stole Pounds 13m MR JOHN Ferriday, the former chief executive of Eagle Trust, was jailed for six years yesterday for stealing Pounds 13m to cover losses in the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash. At Wolverhampton Crown Court Judge Malcolm Ward described Mr Ferriday as 'totally unscrupulous' and disqualified him from being a company director for 10 years. Mr Ferriday, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was found guilty by jury earlier this month of five theft charges after a 10-month trial. He denied stealing Pounds 12.25m and 1.7m shares belonging to Eagle Trust. The court heard Mr Ferriday syphoned off money from the company to cover losses he suffered in the Black Monday stock market crash in 1987.</p>

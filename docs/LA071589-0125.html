			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: DO ANGELS HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS?  </P> <P> Fifty-three questions to ponder (one for each victory) as the Angels attempt  the unlikely: a second-half as good as the first.  </P> <P> 1) Is this the sequel to "Damn Yankees?"  </P> <P> 2) Was Minnesota Twins Manager Tom Kelly serious when he said the Angels were  the team to beat in the American League West?  </P> <P> 3) Has Kelly been reading too many of Gary Gaetti's batting gloves?  </P> <P> 4) If American League Manager Tony La Russa needed a left-hander to pitch to  Von Hayes in the All-Star game, why didn't he use Angel Chuck Finley rather  than Milwaukee's Dan Plesac?  </P> <P> 5) What's more important: complete games or keeping reliever Bryan Harvey  sharp?  </P> <P> 6) There hasn't been an injury to a member of the Angel starting rotation yet,  has there?  </P> <P> 7) When does the Doug Rader Temper Tantrum Watch end?  </P> <P> 8) Why do we get the feeling that the Aug. 21-Sept. 3 trip (Kansas City, Texas,  Boston and New York) will make or break the Angels?  </P> <P> 9) Is 1990 the year some major league team hires the other Lachemann (Hint:  Marcel) as its manager?  </P> <P> 10) How long can the Angels succeed with Wally Joyner as their cleanup hitter?  </P> <P> 11) What's more annoying at Angel games: beach balls, video instructions on  when to clap or the sound of breaking glass every time a foul ball falls into  the crowd?  </P> <P> 12) Do you think Nolan Ryan regrets signing with the Texas Rangers?  </P> <P> 13) If the Angels don't fade like watercolors, does that mean Mike Port earns  Executive of the Year honors?  </P> <P> 14) Will all those who said Jim Abbott wasn't ready for the majors please stand  up?  </P> <P> 15) Is this the place where I apologize for saying that Bert Blyleven wouldn't  make a difference?  </P> <P> 16) If Rader can have his contract extended halfway through the season, why  can't Blyleven, whose agreement ends at the end of the year?  </P> <P> 17) Is it too late to find a true leadoff hitter?  </P> <P> 18) Will Skippy the Lobster be voted an honorary playoff share should the  Angels make it that far?  </P> <P> 19) Why won't Port say the Angels went after Rickey Henderson?  </P> <P> 20) Whatever happened to Mark McLemore?  </P> <P> 21) Just a thought, but couldn't the curators of the Angels Hall of Fame bend  the rules a bit to include the jersey of Mr. Jimmie Reese, a keepsake if there  has ever been one?  </P> <P> 22) At what point will Harvey's lack of consistent work catch up with the  Angels?  </P> <P> 23) Now that Bo Jackson has snapped a bat over his head, what will Chili Davis  do next in response?  </P> <P> 24) Does Mike Witt finally have his act together?  </P> <P> 25) Can the Angels possibly end the season first in home runs and earned-run  average?  </P> <P> 26) Will shortstop Dick Schofield's dismal batting average ever see the light  of the .240s?  </P> <P> 27) Can the Angels afford another losing streak like their first, when they  dropped 11 out of 14?  </P> <P> 28) Will reliever Greg Minton be able to give Rader 30 more appearances this  season?  </P> <P> 29) Does Tony Armas actually lead the team in batting average?  </P> <P> 30) How is it possible that Jack Howell has nine more homers than Joyner?  </P> <P> 31) What happens if the Rangers complete a rumored deal that has All-Star  designated hitter Harold Baines leaving Chicago for Texas?  </P> <P> 32) Did you know that the Angels led the division at the All-Star break in  1979, 1982 and 1986? And that in each of those three years they ended up  winning the AL West?  </P> <P> 33) Did you know that none of that means a single thing in 1989?  </P> <P> 34) Do you think Bruce Hurst regrets signing with the San Diego Padres?  </P> <P> 35) Which 1989 Angel baseball card do you think is worth the most on the  collector's market these days?  </P> <P> 36) Did you say Abbott's?  </P> <P> 37) How is it that Angel pitchers have been selected for three of the past four  All-Star games and not one of them has played?  </P> <P> 38) Has anyone noticed that Angel left-handers have a 21-11 record this year,  as opposed to 11-16 in 1988?  </P> <P> 39) Can you believe that Abbott has a better record than Witt?  </P> <P> 40) Why did the Brewers trade Bill Schroeder?  </P> <P> 41) If Devon White's batting average continues to slide, will the same thing  happen to his place in the order?  </P> <P> 42) Will Jim Eppard ever get to stay in Anaheim long enough to establish a  mailing address?  </P> <P> 43) Will someone remind me not to let the Angels' Quad Cities affiliate book my  hotel reservations?  </P> <P> 44) Who has bigger arms, Brian Downing or Bo?  </P> <P> 45) Is it possible to reduce the size of the Angel halo on the caps? It looks  like a doughnut.  </P> <P> 46) Why is it no one is talking about the Kansas City Royals?  </P> <P> 47) Can it be true: The Angels don't miss Bob Boone?  </P> <P> 48) Do you think Gene Mauch regrets his decision not to return as Angel  manager?  </P> <P> 49) You know those miniature toy figures of major league baseball players that  are the rage? Is it true the Jose Canseco model shows him signing a speeding  ticket?  </P> <P> 50) Did Ronald Reagan really say that Anaheim Stadium was the most beautiful  ballpark in America?  </P> <P> 51) Do you think Reagan might have forever cost his party the Republican  precincts in the Fenway Park and Wrigley Field area?  </P> <P> 52) Can we expect one more Angel trade before season's end?  </P> <P> 53) Is this where I'm allowed to amend my preseason prediction of an Angel  fifth-place finish to third, behind the A's and Rangers?  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The Song and Dance  Ensemble of the Korean People's Army is giving performances at  the February 8 House of Culture in Pyongyang amid the interests  of the People's Army soldiers and the working people.    The colorful program includes the chorus "Our General Is the  Greatest," the male vocal solo "Wherefrom Come Exploits", the  dance "We Are a-Match-for-a-Hundred Soldiers" which present in  strongly appealing artistic depiction the great appearance of  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as a brilliant commander,  the loyalty of the People's Army soldiers who resolutely defend  him with arms and their optimistic life.    The ensemble is the first stage art group of Korea formed in  March 1947.    Since its foundation it has created more than 1,000 stage  pieces of high ideological and artistic plane which cater to the  requirements of the times and given 25,800 performances. During  the fatherland liberation war (1950-1953), it put on stage "Song  of the Defence of the Country", "To a Decisive Battle" and "My  Song in the Trench" and other famous songs, rousing the People's  Army soldiers to heroic feats.    The ensemble greeted the heyday in its development in the  1970s. In that decade Comrade Kim Chong-il indicated the  orientation and ways of creation so that it might conduct art  activities in keeping with its mission and gave a meticulous  guidance to it.    Under his energetic guidance, it completed the creation of  the revolutionary opera "A True Daughter of the Party", a  people's prize laureate, in December 1971. The opera portrays  heroine of the republic An Yong-ae, a nurse of the Korean  People's Army who fought courageously during the Fatherland  Liberation War with unfailing loyalty to the party and the  leader. The opera has been performed on more than 1,100  occasions at home and abroad. It is still acclaimed by the  audience for its high ideological and artistic level.    The ensemble has writers Sin Un-ho and Choe Chun-kyong who  are "Kim Il-Song Prize" winners, people's actor Choe Chang-nim  and people's actress Kim Ok-son, who are singers, dancers Pak  Ae-na and Hong Chong-hwa who are people's actresses and other  veteran actors and actresses and promising new faces.    It has produced a merited male chorus and a merited  Kayagum-accompanied singers group and it is playing a leading  role in creating a new form of the song and dance performance in  the country.    Vivid artistic presentation of the reality and militant  dignified and grand style are what distinguish it from others.    The song and dance ensemble was awarded the Kim Il-song  order, the supreme order of the DPRK, for its meritorious  services in art creation.</p>

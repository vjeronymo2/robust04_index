			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: Astra calms health fears over its anti-ulcer drug Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday insisted there were no scientific grounds to justify a threat by the German authorities to bar an intravenous application of its anti-ulcer drug Losec, the company's biggest-selling product and the world's fifth-largest selling prescription drug. News that BGA, the German health agency, was considering withdrawing approval of the intravenous injectible form of Losec on the suspicion that it was linked to hearing and eye disorders sent Astra's share price lurching downwards by 7 per cent on Friday. Astra A shares recovered later to end the day down 3 per cent at SKr171, but the company will be watching anxiously today to see if investors react further. The German action followed the appearance of vision and hearing impairments in patients being treated intravenously with Losec for bleeding ulcer conditions. The BGA said it was concerned that omeprazole, the active substance in Losec, caused the condition. In a letter to Astra, the agency gave the Swedish company three weeks to respond. Mr Staffan Ternby, investor relations chief at Astra, said the company had been aware of the problems in the bleeding ulcer patients since last autumn. Investigations by the group and by outside specialists had since found no evidence to link Losec to the conditions, he said. Astra believed they were caused by the underlying disease affecting the patients, not the drug. 'We are confident we can show scientifically that there is no connection. We are not too worried by this letter from the German authorities,' he said. Intravenous injection accounts for only a small percentage of Losec sales. But total sales of the drug were SKr127bn (Dollars 16.1bn) in 1993.</p>

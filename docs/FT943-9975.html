			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Microsoft signs up ICL for servicing Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has chosen ICL of the UK to service its products and customers across western Europe. The agreement is the first pan-European deal Microsoft has signed under its recently announced policy of concentrating on software development while seeking business partners to service and support large customers. Service and support includes maintenance, systems integration, consultancy and training. ICL, based in the UK but owned by Fujitsu of Japan, becomes an 'Authorised Support Centre' with the responsibility for servicing Microsoft software products, including the new large-scale operating system 'Windows NT', in western Europe and the Nordic countries. Discussions are under way on similar agreements for eastern Europe and parts of Africa. The deal underlines ICL's increasing commitment to computer services at the expense of computer making. Once Europe's only mainframe manufacturer, ICL has increasingly diversified into software and services as a defence against shrinking profit margins in the hardware business. Last year ICL was marginally profitable on revenues of Pounds 2.6bn, of which more than half came from computer services. Neither company would speculate on the value of the deal, but ICL is expected to benefit substantially. There are some 40m personal computer users in Europe. Mr Tony Rees, ICL's product support manager for Europe, said the company already has 5,000 staff in its support group turning over about Pounds 500m annually. Microsoft has found it increasingly difficult to support its larger multinational customers. The company's success was founded on software for stand-alone personal computers, in particular the MS-Dos and Windows operating systems now used on more than 90 per cent of PCs. Increasingly, however, companies want to link their PCs into networks. The networking market leader and Microsoft's direct competitor is Novell of the US. Microsoft's networking software, Windows NT, is large and complex and companies installing it need considerable consultancy and support. Microsoft, however, with its emphasis on software development, is ill-suited to providing computer services. Rather than risk diluting its development efforts, it decided last year to seek partners to support its customers.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Merry Maggie May BLITZ] in 1990, and now Maggie May; the National Youth Theatre is making hay with Lionel Bart. Can Oliver] be far behind? Since 1986, when Michael Croft, the NYT's founder, died, this is the second year in which their repertory has included no Shakespeare. They might ponder upon Kenneth Tynan's ironic proposals for new Bartifications of Dickens: Bleak] - or, perhaps, Great] Up to a point, Maggie May suits the company very well, and in fact the show is enjoyable beyond expectation. Alun Owen's script is about the eponymous whore, sure enough, but more about Liverpool dockers. Its heart is in the right place, that is Left, which means that the goodies are ur-Militants of 30 years ago. The large, eager NYT cast brandish their Liverpudlian accents with a will, and David Toguri has drilled them in energetic Sixties dancing  -more than knees-up, if not all that much more - to infectious purpose. Youthful high spirits carry the day. The plot is amiably simple and unconvincing. In a 1946 prologue, we find little Maggie already attached to young Pat Casey, and figuring in a Christmas pageant which is interrupted by the death of Pat's father, a union hero, amid an angry strike. The 'real' story begins 18 years later; when Pat returns from a sourly enlightening stint in the Navy and Maggie is already a professional on the game. Her problem is self-explanatory; and Casey's is partly hers. Their liaison shocks his decent workmates, and in particular his union chum Judder (Peter Collins) is seized by a jealous homoerotic fury - which Owen leaves rigorously unexplored, though it is the ground for the fatal denouement. Before that, Pat has been trying to organise a high-minded walkout over a gun-shipment to South Africa, while fighting shy of election to his father's old role (song: 'I'm Me]'). There are confused signals here, but the message seems to be that eventually, congenital Left virtues will out. Maggie May is chock-a-block with musical numbers - folksong or nursery-rhyme style (with sentimental waltzes, barely disguised), which may probably explain why Owen's text seems so thin and schematic. It needs serious help from the actors, in the form of a battered world-weariness which neither of the principals here is yet of an age to convey. Likewise Simon Bowen's smooth, unprincipled union heavy: nice character-details, too little gravitas. Nonetheless, Liz King's Maggie is inventive, volatile and brassy, James Barriscale's Pat clean-cut and honest (if slightly unmanned by uncertain pitch). Their heartfelt ballads grow strident, with a lot of amplification and no mollifying strings. Otherwise Timothy Higgs draws lively playing from his small band and enthusiastic singing from everybody. Royalty Theatre, off Kingsway, London WC2, until September 19. Sponsored by National Power.</p>

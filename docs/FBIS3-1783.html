At a meeting with the managers of 40 large state enterprises  from all over the country, Zou urged the managers to set great  store by study which involves Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, new laws and  regulations, new policies and new technology.    He said that at present the State Council was selecting 100  enterprises for pioneering the reforms.    He noted that the new measures for the reforms adopted by  the  government aim at helping the state enterprises transform their  operating system, enabling the enterprises to take part in  market competition.

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (14): Keeping in style in the harsh 1990s - David Churchill looks at how hard-pressed executives can get the best from their travel REMEMBER the British Airways television commercial of a few years ago that had an executive flying on the 'red eye' to New York and arriving in top shape - much to the consternation of the people he was doing business with who thought he would arrive tired and bedraggled? That commercial neatly summed up the benefits of flying Club Class in a world where the high-flying executive was king. In the heady days of the late 1980s, nothing was apparently too good for the business traveller as he (or she) forged new business overseas. But in the harsher business world of the 1990s, business executives are increasingly told by their companies that they must fly at the back of the aeroplane, stay in a (not that convenient or comfortable four-star rather than five-star hotel, and drive a smaller hire-car. Yet, all is not lost. The savvy business traveller knows how to get the best of a bad deal; how to exploit the opport- unities for travelling in style at an economy price. Here are a few of those ways. 1. Accept the company diktat to fly economy - but get an upgrade. Easier said than done, but with the mass of coach class travellers on budget tickets, full fare-paying economy ticket holders are usually first in line for an upgrade to business. It is essential, however, for men to wear at least a jacket and tie (preferably a suit) and for women travellers to be smartly dressed. 2. Ask politely at the check-in desk if an upgrade is available - hint at wanting to do some serious work aboard. If no luck at the check-in, ask the chief purser when on board the aircraft: he has the authority to upgrade you if space is available. An alternative is to fly Virgin Atlantic which has introduced a new Mid Class service on its flights. This gives full-fare paying passen- gers the equivalent of a business class seat on any other airline; Virgin's Upper Class seats (which sell at business class prices) are the equivalent of first class seats on other airlines. Downgrading from upper class to mid class will, for example, save the travelling executive over Pounds l,500 on a round trip to Tokyo. The drawback to the mid class service is that the food is the same as in economy, although there are separate check-in counters and priority baggage handling. 3. Join an airline club which provide a range of extra services and facilities for frequent flyers. Most airlines will either charge a fee for joining or limit membership to executives who have flown a certain number of miles with that airline. British Airways, however, has adopted a diff- erent approach: everyone who flies on a paid-for ticket with BA can qualify for member- ship of the first tier (blue) of its executive club. This provides few real benefits - no access to lounges, for example - but puts you on course (according to how many Club Class flights you make in a year) for silver or gold membership where the real perks are. Apart from lounge access, silver or gold members are usually first in line for an upgrade. 4. Use a specialist business travel agent to organise your business travel needs, rather than just asking the local agent - who primarily handles holidays - to make the booking. Specialists buy a lot of travel, not just for you but for their other clients as well, and this gives them access to some of the best discounts and special offers available. Using a recognised business travel agent (most are members of the Guild of Business Travel Agents) can also help get an upgrade: the airlines are willing to do this on occasion for their best customers, but obviously not always as this would discourage business and first class bookings. 5. Small companies and individuals who want the benefits of bulk buying and other perks can join a special- ist members-only travel club, such as Wexas or the Internat- ional Airline Passengers Association. Wexas Gold Card membership at Pounds 148.53 a year, for example, offers personal travel consultants, discounts on business and first-class fares and access to the cheapest economy fares, and free ticket delivery in central London. IAPA, whose membership costs a basic Pounds 45 without any travel insurance or upwards of Pounds 59 depending on the level of insurance cover, also offers substantial discounts on car rental and hotel prices. (Wexas: 071 589 3315; IAPA: 081 681 6555). 6. Hotels, squeezed by the recession, have been looking for ways of offering better value to business travellers. Hyatt, for example, allows all guests to enrol as members of its Gold Passport programme - after that they accumulate points according to how much they spend in the hotel. These points can then be used to obtain room upgrades and discounts on accommodation and meal costs. The Conrad Hotel in Hong Kong has introduced a 'Business Bonuses' prog- ramme: those paying the pub- lished room rate (as opposed to a heavily discounted price) get a free limousine to and from the airport, room upgrade, and other benefits including a free laundry service. Even some of the Savoy Group of luxury London hotels - including Claridge's, Berkeley and the Savoy - are wooing Aus- tralian and American guests with car transfers and free golf at the Wentworth Club. 7. Car rental companies have been having a pretty torrid time with the recession and rates have become very competitive. But if you want a better service, then join a club such as the special Avis Club, membership of which is free. This guarantees members the best possible deal around, along with extra discounts in certain circumstances plus an upgrade. These are some of the tips to make the best of the current squeeze on business travel. However, Mr Ron Spiers, publishing director of the ABC World Airways Guide, who is a frequent business traveller clocking up an average of 120,000 miles in travel a year, believes the savvy traveller should look for some of the hidden drawbacks of international travel as well. 'With trips to the Far East, for example, I have found it really pays to check total elapsed time carefully, as a number of cheaper long-haul flights include multiple stop-overs which can add several hours to the journey, and in effect lose you a whole working day,' he says. His main cause of frus- tration, however, is the inflexibility of some tickets. 'There can be few things more aggravating than to rearrange your flights and to find you have to pay a significant premium to change your flight,' he says.</p>

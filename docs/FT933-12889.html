			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brussels cocktail circuit wonders if Major will stay the course 'WHEN will Mr Major go?' a senior Scandinavian diplomat inquired recently. 'And who will replace him?' The fate of Mr John Major's premiership has generated much talk on the Brussels cocktail and caviar circuit. The advantage of speculating about Mr Major and potential successors is that it diverted diplomats' attention from some unpleasant truths. The first is that less that two months after Danish voters gave new life to Maastricht the treaty is again in difficulty. Whatever the outcome of today's Commons votes, Lord Rees-Mogg's High Court challenge could delay final ratification until late autumn. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, hinted at further delay after a routine meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels. But he also pointed out that Britain was not alone. Germany also faced legal problems with the treaty. Most EC leaders have been too polite to allude to the hearing before the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe on whether Maastricht conforms with Germany's constitution. Many preferred to ignore it. Yet it is slowly dawning on the European Commission that the legal challenge in Karlsruhe is serious. Perhaps the most important question is how Article 20 of the Basic Law, which says that 'all state power is rooted in the people', can be reconciled with a treaty which transfers some of this power  -the part dealing with economic and monetary policy - to new European authorities of limited democratic accountability. Assuming that the treaty is not derailed in the UK or Germany, Brussels has a new deadline for ratification: January 1 1994. This coincides with the second stage of economic and monetary union as set out in Maastricht. Nevertheless the date is a full 12 months after Maastricht was originally due to come into force. Earlier threats that the UK and (then) recalcitrant Denmark risked being cut loose by the rest of the Community unless they completed Maastricht ratification by July 1 1993 now look rather empty. What is striking is how the recrimination of 1992 has evaporated in 1993. A mood of sullen resignation permeates Brussels, best captured by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. Laid low with sciatica, he has been unusually subdued, though this week's dawn deal on regional aid with the member states shows his appetite for the big occasion. Finally, there is the social chapter. Many Europeans wonder how Mr Major can ignore a Commons vote in favour of an amendment which supporters claim would nullify the treaty opt-out won by Britain in the Maastricht negotiations. All EC member states believe that ratification of the treaty is more important than Britain accepting the social chapter. But if Maastricht is ratified, Britain's absence from the social policy table would become highly contentious. Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, the European employers confederation, argues that Britain's absence could mean the 11 pressing far ahead of what business wants or needs. Mr Tyszkiewicz wonders whether Mr Major's social chapter opt-out will look so smart in say, five years' time, when a future UK government might decide to return to the table, and would then have to accept a body of EC social legislation on which it had no influence.</p>

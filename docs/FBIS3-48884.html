Following this  development, moves toward further regrouping of political  parties are now expected to take a complicated course. LDP  President Yohei Kono has suddenly moved closer to Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, as the former has started to clarify that he  intends to cooperate with the Hosokawa administration regarding  economic and diplomatic issues. Since Hosokawa plans to respond  positively to Kono's advances, it is expected that the framework  of the coalition government would be drastically altered should  the LDP in fact provide the administration "support from outside  the cabinet." The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  which is split over the issue of electoral reform, is facing a  serious crisis. It is expected that drastic political changes,  such as a restructuring of the coalition alliance due to a  possible falling apart of the SDPJ, may inevitably occur in  time. Prime Minister Hosokawa, who has strengthened the  solidarity of his administration, plans to entrust the steering  of the Diet to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. At  the same time, he plans to give due consideration to the LDP.  Thus, he will apparently take a "tandem" approach toward running  the government.    At a 29 January joint press conference with Prime Minister  Hosokawa, Kono said: "From the standpoint of protecting the  livelihood of the people, I think we can make suggestions to the  prime minister in terms of our knowledge, experience, and  personnel." This was an outstanding stage performance by Kono  that impressed the people with the "intimacy" of the two leaders  since Hosokawa had already revealed that he plans to hold  meetings with Kono again to exchange views on the Japan-U.S.  summit meeting and on economic issues.    Asked for advice by the Prime Minister's Office on the issue  of revising the political reform bills prior to the top-level  meeting between Hosokawa and Kono, a senior LDP official  belonging to the Miyazawa faction said: "Regarding political  reform, all you have to do is throw a strike. What is important  instead is to build a relationship of trust under which the  leaders can mutually open up their hearts and hold discussions."  This signaled that "Kono's LDP" is prepared to support the  prime minister in view of the possibility that in the future,  the SDPJ may break away from the coalition government over the  issue of a consumption tax hike and other disputes.    Internal strife within the SDPJ over the political reform  bills has shown further signs that the party may split. Party  members who insist on preserving the party's independence may  break away from the coalition, possibly turning the Hosokawa  administration into a ruling minority. Hosokawa reportedly  acknowledges that, sooner or later, the coalition must  inevitably be reshuffled. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura hopes the LDP will split again so he can challenge  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. He hopes to secure  his influence in the administration by joining hands with LDP  members who support electoral reform. Various speculative views  intertwine around the issue of "regrouping" as a result of the  splitting of the SDPJ as well as further splitting of the LDP.    Shinseito has aligned its sights on the next general  election. It plans to gain political leadership straight out by  forming a new party through such means as recruiting members  from Komeito, the Japan New Party, and the SDPJ who support  maintaining the coalition government. On 29 January, Shinseito  leader Tsutomu Hata, who is deputy prime minister and  concurrently foreign minister, held a press conference at the  Diet building. Regarding the "Hosokawa-Kono partnership," Hata  praised it, saying: "It means they plan to straightforwardly  discuss the domestic and foreign issues that have accumulated."  But, regarding its effect on the regrouping of political  parties, Hata said: "It (regrouping of political parties) will  happen through elections."    However, the fact that the political reform bills were  rejected in the upper house plenary session due to a  considerable number of SDPJ dissidents voting against the bills  clearly indicates it will not be easy for both the ruling  coalition parties and the LDP to gain a majority in the upper  house. To promote regrouping of the political parties, it will  become necessary to work out a framework which takes this  situation in the upper house into consideration. Parties will  have to reconstruct their original strategies which have been  based on a "LDP versus non-LDP" concept.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of  Russia's Navy, stated at a news conference in Vladivostok that  Russia has not sold any submarines to North Korea and does not  intend to sell any, the RIA agency reported. He said that four  old, obsolete diesel submarines, which were incapable of moving  under their own power, were sold as scrap to a Japanese  commercial firm. Therefore, the fuss whipped up by the Japanese  and South Korean media is totally groundless.    The Navy's commander in chief added that the press published  another untrue report, of unknown provenance, that the Pacific  Fleet is to supply 40 submarines to the DPRK via a dummy  Japanese firm. The Pacific Fleet simply does not have this many  old submarines, Feliks Gromov said.</p>

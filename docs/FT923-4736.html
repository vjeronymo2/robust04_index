			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Renewed squeeze pushes zinc price to 23-month high ZINC'S PRICE touched its highest level for 23 months on the London Metal Exchange yesterday but some traders said this was because of a long-running, options-related technical squeeze rather than any sudden pick-up in demand. There is concern that a small number of zinc producers and one trader, who are reported to control about 1m tonnes of annual refined zinc output - or about 15 to 20 per cent of the western world total - and who previously squeezed the market in June, are behind the looming supply tightness in the final quarter of this year. The LME board is 'closely monitoring' the situation which has once again put its zinc market into backwardation - where there is a price premium for metal for immediate delivery. 'The recent intense price volatility is clearly damaging for most suppliers and users of zinc because of the uncertainty it generates,' said the Economist Intelligence Unit, in its recent World Commodity Forecasts report. However, Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, said that, apart from the squeeze, zinc's price was being supported by a 'cocktail of stimuli'. These included: labour contract negotiations in North America this month and next; the fact that zinc consumption had outpaced production in the first six months of this year; a potential strike at Centromin in Peru: and, even though LME zinc stocks were at record levels, producer stocks had fallen by 10 per cent since the end of January. Mr Moore suggested that there would be only a small supply surplus of zinc this year - about 60,000 tonnes compared with 140,000 tonnes last year - and a deficit of 70,000 tonnes in 1993. Zinc for delivery in three months traded up to Dollars 1,395 a tonne on the LME yesterday before closing at Dollars 1,394.25, up Dollars 23.75. Cash zinc closed Dollars 41 up at Dollars 1,445 a tonne. Traders said the next target for the three-month zinc price was likely to be the resistance between Dollars 1,400 and Dollars 1,420 a tonne.</p>

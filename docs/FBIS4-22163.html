			<p>CSO     [Text] It is difficult to imagine a state would not  be concerned about its internal security.    The fundamental reforms that established the  organizational bases of the entire internal service on the scale  of the Russian state date back to the time of the reign of  Alexander I, who on 16 January 1811 signed an edict on the  establishment of a special kind of troops--the internal guard  including local military commands, which previously were under  the jurisdiction of the civil authorities and along with the  police were responsible for the "preservation of peace and  calm." "...the provincial companies and regular commands,"  stated a document from the "highest" level, "should be better  organized and made to conform to their current service function  and to the general order and we order that all these commands be  transferred from civilian to military authority...."    The emperor's edict from 27 March to the military  minister ordered the regular provincial companies and commands  to be redeployed in the capitals of the provinces [guberniyas]  and internal guard battalions to be formed from them. At the  decision of the Military Collegium a month later, these  battalions were brought together in 20 brigades. On 3 July 1811,  the "Statute for the Internal Guard" was affirmed at the highest  level.    In comparing the tasks of Russia's contemporary  internal troops with those of their predecessors, one can find  much in common. And there is perhaps nothing surprising about  this: There have been changes in the political situations,  social foundations, and nature of crime and violations of the  law but the essence of military service in defense of the  interests of the state, society, and individual, the  "preservation of peace and calm," has remained as it was.    A special page in the history of the internal troops  was the participation in the Great Patriotic War in 1941-1945.  Not many people know that on that memorable June morning the  fascist forces first hit not only our border troops but also our  troops at small garrisons guarding railroad bridges and other  structures along the western border. In the first weeks of  military action, the internal troops sent to the fighting army  large and well-trained forces, forming 15 rifle divisions, which  operated in the most dangerous sectors of the front. All of them  fought courageously and some subsequently received honorary  names.    The manner in which the internal troops fought is  shown, among other things, by the fact that an individual  special-purpose motorized rifle brigade that was formed in 1941  and became an educational center for the training of  reconnaissance-subversion groups for actions in the enemy's rear  trained 22 Heroes of the Soviet Union. Among them were the  commanders of partisan formations D. Medvedev (the legendary  scout N. Kuznetsov operated in his detachment), V. Karasev, F.  Ozmitel, and others.    Altogether more than 200 servicemen trained by the  internal troops were honored with the lofty title of Hero during  the period of the Great Patriotic War.    The soldiers and sergeants, warrant officers and officers of  the internal troops perform an entire spectrum of the most  varied missions: They perform guard and convoy duty, they  support the public order in cities and towns, and they  participate in the elimination of the consequences of  earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as the freeing  of hostages from the grip of terrorists.... For several years  now, servicemen of the internal troops have been providing for  public security at so-called "hot spots" in regions where states  of emergency prevail.    The troops have all that they need to handle such complex  and  multifaceted missions. They include not only combined units and  operational units but also special motorized, air, and naval  units. The internal troops have a solid base for the training of  junior commanders and various kinds of specialists.    Those wishing to tie their fate to the troops may do so  by signing a contract for three or five years. Men 18 to 40  years of age are accepted for contract service on a voluntary  basis. For some positions, women from 20 to 40 years of age are  accepted.    Questions involving contract service in the troops are  resolved in the military units of internal troops of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia and also by the military  commissariats of the republics in the Russian Federation,  autonomous okrug, kray, or oblast, and cities of Moscow and St.  Petersburg.    The officer corps is formed from graduates of higher  military educational institutions of the internal troops. Here  are their addresses:    Vladikavkaz Higher Military Command Red Banner School  imeni S.M. Kirov--362005, g. Vladikavkaz, 5;    Novosibirsk Higher Military Command School--630114, g.  Novosibrisk, 114;    Saratov Higher Military Red Banner Command School imeni  F.E. Dzerzhinskiy--410023, g. Saratov, 23;    St. Petersburg Higher Military Command School--198075,  g. Sankt-Peterburg, 75;    Perm Higher Military Command-Rear School--614108, g.  Perm, 108    The schools accept inducted personnel, reserve personnel  with  a military service obligation, service personnel in extended  service at the end of two years of extended service, and warrant  officers at the end of two years of service in positions of  warrant officers or officers no older than 23 years of age; also  civilian youths 17 to 21 years of age.    Service personnel wishing to enter a school present a  request  to the command prior to 1 April and those with a service  obligation and civilian youths submit an application to rayon  (city) military commissariats or internal affairs sections in  their place of residence prior to 1 May.    The graduates of higher military educational institutions  are  assigned the rank of lieutenant and are given a diploma of the  Russian type with conferment of the qualification of jurist (for  higher military command schools) or engineer of a particular  profile (for the Perm Higher Military Command-Rear School).    Both officers finishing higher troop schools and contract  personnel among those accepted for service on a voluntary basis  have good opportunities to improve their education.    You can be certain that when you enter into service in  the troops you obtain guarantees of your social protection!    Persons performing service in the internal troops are  assured monetary remuneration in the manner and in accordance  with the standards set by the Government of the Russian  Federation for service personnel.    Service personnel of the internal troops are granted  certain privileges guaranteed by the laws of the Russian  Federation on the internal troops of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs of the Russian Federation and on the status of service  personnel:    --payment of monetary compensation instead of a food ration,  the amount of which changes as prices rise, being equal to 1,445  rubles [R] a day beginning 1 February of this year;    --payment at the end of the year of a monetary award for the  conscientious performance of duties in the amount of three  salaries for the duty assignment and military rank;    --payment of an award for class qualification of up to 7  percent of the salary for the duty assignment;    --payment of a bonus for special service conditions up to 60  percent of the duty salary;    --provision of material assistance once a year in the amount  of one salary for the duty assignment and military rank.    In set cases at the request of the service personnel,  they are issued an interest-free loan in the amount of 12  salaries for the duty assignment and military rank over a period  of up to three years for the initial provision of a  household.    Those entering service in the troops are freed from the  payment of income tax on monetary compensation, monetary awards,  and other payments that they receive in connection with the  performance of the obligations of their military service and  also from the payment of the land tax and property tax.    Provision is made for the compulsory state individual  insurance of the service personnel of the internal troops;  for free transportation on all kinds of public  transportation in the cities, suburbs, and localities (except  taxis), and also--in utilizing basic leave to the site of  their leisure activity and back, including by air; a free  one-way trip once a year for family members of contract service  personnel--to the place of leave and back.    To this one must also add the following  possibilities:    --free medical assistance in military-medical subunits,  units, and institutions and the possibility for service  personnel and members of their families to rest and improve  their health in the rest homes and sanatoria of the internal  troops and Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia;    --aid to the wives of servicemen who do not have the  possibility of finding work at the place of service of their  husbands;    --provision of places in children's preschool institutions  for children of service personnel with payment under favorable  conditions;    --provision of monetary compensation for cadets undergoing  schooling at military educational institutions of the internal  troops beginning with the second course at the norms for  personnel serving under contract. And this is despite the fact  that they are provided other kinds of allowances (food, personal  property, medical services, and others) free of charge.    The Law of the Russian Federation on the Status of Service  Personnel also provides for:    --payment of monetary compensation with the departure of the  serviceman for leave in the amount of six minimum payments for  labor as set by law (as of the time of departure for leave) for  the serviceman himself and three minimum payments for labor as  set by law for his wife and for each minor child.    It is also worth knowing that service personnel without  permanent living quarters or in need of improving their living  conditions are provided free financial aid for the acquisition  of housing:    --not less than 75 percent of the cost of living quarters  for  those with a total service time of 10 to 25 years and 100  percent for those having served 25 years or longer;    --payment of living space, municipal services, and the  installation and use of apartment telephones amounts to 50  percent of the cost.    If the service personnel of the internal troops serve  in remote places or places with severe climatic conditions, they  are paid more for the performance of their duties (up to 100  percent more) and also a bonus for uninterrupted service in  these places (up to 100 percent of the salary for the duty  position and military rank).    The service personnel of the internal troops are  granted additional privileges for the performance of missions in  defense of the constitutional rights of citizens under the  conditions of a state of emergency and under the conditions of  armed conflicts:    --payment of additional salaries and salaries twice the  standard for the military rank;    --one month of military service in these regions counts as  three;    --mission expenses are paid for the entire period of the  performance of the tasks;    --additional leave amounting to 10 calendar days is granted  for each 3 months of military service in these regions.    [Boxed material] So, you have been given some information to  think about.    Your choice depends on you and you alone.    BUT IF YOU are dreaming of the romance of military service,  are not afraid of difficulties, and do not consider yourself a  weakling and if you want to participate directly in the building  of a law-governed state, are prepared in the role of a soldier  of peacemaking forces to act where your help is needed, and are  not averse to fighting for the right to wear the red beret of  the special forces, then you will have made the right decision!    The internal troops are waiting for you!    [Additional boxed material under the heading "In One  Paragraph"]    The elite of the internal troops is a special-purpose  formation. They are always prepared to tackle on short notice  any military mission thousands of kilometers from the place of  their deployment. By no means everyone has the right to wear the  red beret of the special forces. It must be earned through  outstanding performance in special training and through flawless  execution of the soldier's duty.    856 officers and warrant officers of the internal troops  took  part in combat operations in the Republic of Afghanistan as  military advisers. 522 of them were given state awards.    In the last two years alone, operational and special  motorized military units carried out more than 50,000 service  and combat missions. 2,142 firearms and 236,000 pieces of  ammunition of various kinds were confiscated by front-line  details together with internal affairs agencies or  independently; they confiscated 2,165 grenades and explosive  devices and 24 pieces of armored equipment.    In eliminating the consequences of the 1988 earthquake in  Armenia, troop personnel saved 659 people and confiscated from  plunderers and turned over to the state money and material  assets valued at R9,157,150. Patrol details arrested 203 robbers  and marauders and confiscated 44 firearms and a large quantity  of ammunition. The fund to help the population suffering from  the disaster collected R531,237 and 3,154 liters of blood were  given.    More than 14,500 servicemen of the internal troops  participated in the elimination of the consequences of the  accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station, whereby 276 of  them were awarded orders and medals for self-sacrificing actions  and 162 officers were given military ranks one level higher than  is foreseen for the position that they hold.    Altogether more than 4,300 servicemen of the internal troops  were given state awards in the period from 1989 through 1993.</p>

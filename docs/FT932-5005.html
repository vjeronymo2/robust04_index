			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Protest fishermen defy court FISHERMEN yesterday ignored a court order to leave government fisheries offices in Plymouth, Devon, which they began occupying earlier in the day. About 60 fishermen locked themselves in the offices in protest at new fish conservation laws which limit their days at sea. They said they would remain until the government suspended and reviewed its Sea Fish Conservation Bill. An injunction was granted to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at Plymouth Crown Court yesterday and served on the fishermen by a bailiff. They greeted his efforts with jeers and ringing bells, and refused to leave. The ministry said it was up to the court to decide what action to take next. The fishermen's leader, Plymouth Trawler Owners' Association chairman Mr Dave Pessel, said they would only leave if implementation of the bill was delayed 'indefinitely' while a complete review was undertaken. Mr Pessel said: 'Our jobs and livelihoods are at stake. We are here to embarrass the ministry.' Office staff stood helplessly outside as the fishermen crammed into the building which now bears a banner saying 'Plymouth Fishermen's HQ'. The fishermen said they expected colleagues from Brixham, Looe, Padstow and Salcombe to take over the protest in the days to come. The action is the latest in a series of protests against the bill. Mr Michael Jack, the junior agriculture minister, said he was disappointed the fishermen had occupied the offices. He had asked fishermen's organisations to meet him, and he would listen carefully to what they had to say. He said: 'They have made their point and I hope they will allow the office to get on with its job.' The region's fishing leaders, who recently gave evidence to a Commons committee on the issue, have warned that the legislation would lead to bankruptcies among the region's 2,400-strong fishing fleet. They are taking legal advice about fighting the issue in the European Court.</p>

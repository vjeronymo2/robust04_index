			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Office block built to be destroyed AN eight-storey office block is being built in a former airship hangar at Cardington, Bedfordshire. When complete it will be set on fire, vibrated until it starts to collapse and blown up in one of the world's largest construction research projects, being carried out by the British Building Research Establishment, Andrew Taylor writes. The hangar is one of the world's biggest single enclosed spaces. It once housed the R100 airship and its neighbour contained the ill-fated R101. It could house the Statue of Liberty, Nelson's Column and the Leaning Tower of Pisa and still have room for a couple of jumbo jets. The building will cost Pounds 1.25m, of which the government is providing Pounds 1m. Private companies seeking to test their products and building techniques are providing some labour and materials. Private institutions from other countries wanting to conduct tests will be expected to pay rent for the space they occupy in the building while research is carried out.</p>

The  withdrawal, which begins on 15 April, will be carried out under  the supervision of a commission made up of 25 Libyan officers,  25 Chadian officers, and five officers selected by the United  Nations, the Presidency explained in the communique carried on  national radio. The official turnover of the Aozou Strip to  Chad would take place on 1 May, the Presidency further stated,  making sure it used the conditional tense throughout its  release.

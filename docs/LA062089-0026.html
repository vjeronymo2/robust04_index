			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STALKER DEFENSE STRIVES TO CREATE DOUBT ON JURY  </P> <P> Defense lawyers in the Night Stalker trial rested their case Monday, clinging  to the hope that they have persuaded jurors that the wrong man is being  prosecuted for the serial murders.  </P> <P> "I sure hope so," Ray G. Clark, a lawyer for defendant Richard Ramirez, said  when asked if he believed that the defense effort has created a reasonable  doubt in the Los Angeles Superior Court jury's mind.  </P> <P> Toward that end, Clark and co-counsel Daniel V. Hernandez since May 9 have  elicited much testimony regarding unidentified blood, hairs and fingerprints  found at some of the 15 scenes of the so-called Night Stalker crimes that may  not have belonged to either Ramirez or his alleged victims.  </P> <P> Among those who testified on Ramirez's behalf was his father, Julian  Ramirez-Tapia, who said his son was in El Paso, Tex., visiting relatives at the  time of two of the alleged attacks.  </P> <P> The father's surprise testimony contradicted that of a Burbank woman, who  identified Ramirez in court as the man who robbed and raped her May 30, 1985 --  a day that the suspect, according to the senior Ramirez, was in Texas. The  Burbank woman also identified as hers pieces of jewelry taken in the predawn  attack that police later recovered at the El Paso home of Ramirez's sister.  </P> <P> Another defense witness, Sandra Hotchkiss, a convicted burglar, told the jury  that she had committed up to 25 residential burglaries in and around Los  Angeles with Ramirez and found him to be amateurish and nonviolent.  </P> <P> The defense lawyers have also elicited testimony intended to persuade the panel  of seven women and five men that eyewitness identifications of Ramirez had been  made under less-than-ideal circumstances -- including the intensive news media  coverage immediately after the suspect's arrest -- thus allowing witnesses to  focus on Ramirez at the police lineup and subsequently in court.  </P> <P> For example, one defense witness, Elizabeth F. Loftus, a University of  Washington psychologist who studies memory and eyewitness identifications,  testified that academic research shows that stress or extreme fright can often  cause impairments or mistakes in eyewitness recall.  </P> <P> Loftus also said cross-racial identifications are often more error-prone than  in cases where both parties belong to the same race. (Of the eight prosecution  witnesses who have placed Ramirez at a Night Stalker scene, three are Latinos,  as is the suspect. The others are either Asian or Anglo.)  </P> <P> Loftus conceded under cross-examination that eyewitness identifications are  typically more accurate if a victim had more than a fleeting encounter with an  attacker, as did several of the survivors of alleged Night Stalker attacks.  </P> <P> In all, Ramirez, 29, faces 13 murder charges and 30 other felony counts --  including attempted murder, burglary and assorted sexual assaults -- all  stemming from a series of brutal night-time attacks throughout Los Angeles  County, mostly in the spring and summer of 1985.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Attys. Phil Halpin and Alan Yochelson said they  plan to take about three court days in calling prosecution witnesses during the  rebuttal phase, beginning this morning.  </P> <P> The opposing lawyers are then expected to spend most, if not all, of next week  meeting with Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan to hash out the wording of  jury instructions. That will be a crucial phase because, according to Halpin,  more than in any other phase of a criminal trial, unsatisfactory jury  instructions are a major reason for appellate court reversals.  </P> <P> Also on the agenda is a long-scheduled vacation for the first full week of  July. It thus appears that it will be July 10, at the earliest, before closing  arguments are made and the case goes to the jury.  </P> <P> During the trial, which began Jan. 30, Halpin and Yochelson called 137  witnesses. They sought to tie Ramirez to the Night Stalker crimes by presenting  eyewitness identifications, fingerprints, shoe prints, firearms evidence and  the defendant's own incriminating statements.  </P> <P> "I think we've presented a case that is clear and straightforward," Halpin  said. "I'm satisfied."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRUSTEES DEBATE STARTING, ENDING TIMES FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The controversial question of whether starting and ending times should be  rotated in the interest of fairness among 137 of the 152 schools of the San  Diego Unified School District came before trustees Tuesday in the first of  several public hearings.  </P> <P> Schools Supt.  </P> <P> Tom Payzant proposes rotating times every three years to allow all schools  periodically to have desired early starting and ending times.  </P> <P> Because the district has a plethora of special integration and special  education programs that result in bus transportation of students all over the  city, schools now must start and stop at different times based on the limited  number of buses available to deliver students at any given starting times. They  range from 7 a.m to 9 a.m.  </P> <P> Payzant's proposal would keep all senior highs on a uniform 7:30 a.m. starting  time because of afternoon athletic schedules. But the rotations proposed for  every other school encountered rough sailing during initial public testimony  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Several parents complained of the difficulty in rearranging child care and car  pools every three years. Teachers and parents at the School of Creative and  Performing Arts -- a grade four-through-12 facility -- said its placement with  elementary schools on a rotating schedule would wreak havoc with after-school  rehearsals during the years it would be on a late schedule.  </P> <P> Trustees will continue with public hearings April 17.

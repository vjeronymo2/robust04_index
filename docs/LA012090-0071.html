			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MOLLE LEADS IRVINE PAST DANA HILLS  </P> <P> John Molle's domination of the third quarter helped lead Irvine High School to  a 55-50 South Coast League victory over Dana Hills Friday night at Irvine.  </P> <P> Molle, the only Irvine player to score in the third quarter, had 13 of his  game-high 30 points in the quarter. Dana Hills had five.  </P> <P> After being held to seven points and making only two of nine shots in the first  half, Molle, who averages about 23 point a game, made his move.  </P> <P> Trailing, 26-24, the Vaqueros (10-11 overall and 2-3 in league play) were led  back by Molle, who made four of four shots in the third quarter. Molle drove to  the basket, pulled up for jumpers in the lane, made two free throws and hit a  three-point shot.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Dana Hills (14-6, 2-3) was stuck in low gear. With 3 minutes 8  seconds remaining in the quarter, the Dolphins finally scored when guard Keith  Barnett made one of two free throws. Dana Hills' made its first field goal, a  jumper by Jason Hinchman to cut the Irvine lead to 37-29, came with 50 seconds  left in the quarter.  </P> <P> "We just just totally lost our poise for a minute or two and they got the  lead," Dana Hills Coach Tom Riach said. "When they get the lead, they are a  really good ballclub."  </P> <P> Trailing, 37-31, at the start of the fourth quarter, Dana Hills rallied. But  again it was Molle, a 6-foot-5 junior forward, who held fast. Molle, who is 88%  from the free throw line (second in the county), made all 10 of his attempts in  the final quarter.  </P> <P> "He certainly wasn't the guy we wanted to foul," Riach said.  </P> <P> But few other Irvine players were missing, either, as the Vaqueros made 16 of  18 free throws in the quarter to hold off the Dolphins.  </P> <P> Molle also finished with seven rebounds. Jason Spizuco, a 6-4 forward, and  Chris Swenson, a 6-8 center, each had 12 points for Dana Hills.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo 51, San Clemente 36 -- Mission Viejo opened a 6-0 lead and San  Clemente never got closer than three points. Forward Greg Amaya had 14 points  and guard Mark Wright had 10 for the Diablos (14-5, 4-1). Center Eddie Morgan  scored 10 points and had 11 rebounds for host San Clemente (6-13, 0-5).  </P></p>

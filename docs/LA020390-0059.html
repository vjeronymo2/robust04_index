			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS PROTECT MCELROY, PICKEL;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: SAFETIES HARDEN AND CARTER CONSIDERED MORE EXPENDABLE THAN  BACKUPS WRIGHT, HORTON AND TURK.  </P> <P> Since they're Raiders and march to their own drummer, nothing they do comes as  a surprise.  </P> <P> Thus it wasn't a stunner Friday when their protected list for Group B free  agency included not only the names of running back Marcus Allen and linebacker  Jerry Robinson -- Coach Art Shell had said it would -- but safety Vann McElroy  and defensive tackle Bill Pickel.  </P> <P> Nor was it shocking that they are dangling both their strong safeties, starter  Mike Harden and Russell Carter, thereby showing that they deem backup  journeymen Steve Wright, Dan Turk and Ethan Horton more valuable than Harden.  </P> <P> Here are the cases that might normally be termed upsets:  </P> <P>  -- McElroy. He's 30, made $595,000 last season, became the first Raider in  known history to be asked to sign an injury waiver on his contract, did in fact  get hurt, missed all but five games and lost his free safety job to Eddie  Anderson. His contract is up and he wants a raise or a trade.  </P> <P> Why did they protect him?  </P> <P> Either because Shell still wants him, or they think he has trade value and want  control over his movements. They don't need him in Seattle drawing a bead on  Tim Brown's ribs.  </P> <P>  -- Pickel. He's 30, will make $585,000 this season, has gone downhill after  his fine 1983-86 seasons and was used sparingly last season, although he still  tries hard. They attempted to trade him last summer but couldn't land a premium  draft choice. Either Shell wants him, or they want to get a No. 5 pick for him  or think they're already too thin on the defensive line.  </P> <P>  -- Harden. He was impressive after coming from Denver, where he had refused to  move to cornerback to accommodate rookie Steve Atwater. He was all the more  valuable to the Raiders in that he called the defensive signals, taking that  burden off Anderson.  </P> <P> The Raiders must be gambling on sliding him through because of his age and  salary. He is reportedly in the $400,000 range but won't be 30 until Feb. 16,  and the fact that Carter is also unprotected makes this risky.  </P> <P> Left unprotected, along with Harden and Carter, were cornerback Mike Haynes;  guard Dale Hellestrae, who was just signed as a Plan B; linebacker Ricky  Hunley; tight end Trey Junkin, made dispensable by the rise of Mike Dyal;  linebacker Linden King, called out of retirement last season; linebacker  Emanuel King, whom they don't have to worry about losing because he is a backup  with a $475,000 salary, and center Bill Lewis, the '88 outstanding lineman by  his teammates' vote who already has gotten two calls, including one from the  Rams.  </P> <P> Also left unprotected were safety Stefon Adams, an old Al Davis favorite who  shouldn't have fielded that punt in the Meadowlands finale at his three-yard  line; kick returner Bobby Joe Edmonds; defensive end Mark Mraz, an  exhibition-season sensation for registering a few sacks who didn't pan out;  running back Kerry Porter, running back Steve Strachan, guard Newt Harrell and  ex-Trojan wide receiver Timmie Ware.  </P> <P> A year ago, the Raiders signed 14 Plan B free agents.  </P> <P> Of the 14, eight have been cut and two aren't being protected. The survivors  are defensive tackle Bob Golic, linebacker Tom Benson, wide receiver Sam Graddy  and kicker Jeff Jaeger.  </P> <P> RAIDER FREE AGENTS  </P> <P> Player Position  </P> <P> Stefon Adams DB  </P> <P> Russell Carter DB  </P> <P> Bobby Joe Edmonds RB  </P> <P> Mike Harden DB  </P> <P> Newt Harrell T  </P> <P> Mike Haynes DB  </P> <P> Dale Hellestrae G  </P> <P> Ricky Hunley LB  </P> <P> Trey Junkin TE  </P> <P> Emanuel King LB  </P> <P> Linden King LB  </P> <P> Bill Lewis C  </P> <P> Mark Mraz DE  </P> <P> Kerry Porter RB  </P> <P> Steve Strachan RB  </P> <P> Timmie Ware WR  </P> <P> *Mike Alexander WR  </P> <P> *Marcus Allen RB  </P> <P> *Steve Beuerlein QB  </P> <P> *Mike Dyal TE  </P> <P> *Ethan Horton TE  </P> <P> *Vann McElroy DB  </P> <P> *Vance Mueller RB  </P> <P> *Dennis Price DB  </P> <P> *Jay Schroeder QB  </P> <P> *Steve Smith RB  </P> <P> *Greg Townsend LB/DE  </P> <P> * Restricted.  </P></p>

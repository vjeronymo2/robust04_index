			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US signals flexible stance on finance The US has signalled a more flexible stance in negotiations on financial services left over from the Uruguay Round, a move which trade diplomats say could help clear the path to a wide-ranging trade liberalising deal. US officials formally confirmed this week that Washington has dropped its contentious 'two-tier' approach to opening US financial services markets such as banking, securities and insurance. The US is also willing to give developing countries time to phase in liberalisation commitments. Addressing the first meeting of financial services negotiators in Geneva since the Uruguay Round global trade accords were concluded last December, Mr Todd Crawford, a US treasury official, said Washington was no longer pursuing the two-tier approach and did not intend to reintroduce it. Disappointed by poor market-opening offers from Japan and a number of east Asian and Latin American nations, the US last year said it would open only part of its financial services market on a most-favoured-nation (MFN) basis  -that is, equally to all trading partners as fair trade rules require. Access to the remainder, including new market opportunities created by easier inter-state banking, say, would be granted only to countries which reciprocated. This stance provoked an outcry among trading partners and came close to wrecking the Uruguay Round deal. At the end of the negotiations in December, it was agreed that talks on financial services would continue into 1995. By then, the US had already conceded defeat on the two-tier idea. This was confirmed in September when the 'Quad' trade ministers from the US, EU, Japan and Canada met in Los Angeles. But Wednesday's ann-ouncement in Geneva was the first formal statement to partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Crawford also said the US did not expect immediate liberalisation of developing countries' financial services markets. 'We do not expect liberalisation to take place overnight. We can accept temporary phase-in arrangements,' he was quoted as saying. The demise of the two-tier approach does not mean the US will necessarily open its financial services markets fully to foreign competitors. Like any other nation it can take MFN exemptions on particular services, enabling it to offer better bilateral terms. The extent of the exemptions will depend on how good a deal the US gets from others in the current negotiations. However, there will be no category of 'conditional MFN' written into the Uruguay Round agreements.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Two per cent inflation and slow recovery In last Monday's Economic Viewpoint, I argued that the only way to discover whether, and how far, British interest rates could move below German interest rates within the constraints of the ERM was to 'suck it and see'. That is, the Bank of England should move them down gradually and be prepared to go into reverse if sterling came under pressure within its ERM band. Why has not the Bank of England so far attempted this? One answer is that these are early days. It is only since the April 9 election that there has been this room to experiment; and there has already been a half point cut in base rate to 10 per cent. A further reduction of half a point - or two further cuts of a quarter point - would take the UK rates a shade below German rates and into the experimental zone. There are also, however, domestic arguments for caution about cutting basic rates, which need to be discussed, but not necessarily endorsed. In line with my usual practice of leaving the heavier economics to the second half of my articles, I shall start off with the partisan political case. The chart shows UK output in relation to the trend of productive capacity. The numbers just give an order of magnitude. The trend line is meant to give an idea of where output might be if inflation is not accelerating, and production is growing in line with capacity. During the period in the late 1980s, when the thick line, indicating actual output, was above the dotted trend line, there was pressure on productive capacity, with inflation rising and the balance of payments gap widening. Somewhere towards the end of 1990, output reached a sustainable level, as overheating was giving way to recession. Since then, output has been well below the sustainable level, recession has been prolonged, but inflation has fallen. The Bank of England expects a slow recovery. This means not merely that output will stay below the trend line, but that the gap shown by the shaded area between output and productive potential will continue to widen. Indeed, according to some definitions it would not be a real recovery. The prospect is nevertheless quite pleasing to some in government. The logic of the case is this. The upturn in the late 1980s came too early and went too far. Therefore, the 1992 election had to be fought under the handicap of a corrective recession. If output can be kept comfortably below capacity for a couple of years, there can be a growth spurt in the pre-election period without any inflationary overheating. The GDP line would then start to move up smartly towards, but still not reach, the trend line. Thus there could be a pre-election boom without too much inflationary danger; and after the next election the government will try to stay nearer the trend line. I am perhaps over-rationalising a desire to do in this parliament the opposite of what was done in the last; but the proposition should be discussed. There are two objections to this approach. First, it is immoral to have recessionary conditions unnecessarily prolonged and unemployment unnecessarily high to arrange a pre-election boost. Second, it will not work politically. The errors of the late 1980s were honest lapses and arose from policies such as credit deregulation, which were worthwhile for their own sake, and were corrected when they were diagnosed, despite the political risks. The electorate sensed this and still preferred the Conservatives to the alternative. If, however, they sense that they have gone through unnecessary years of stagnation and are then being bribed by a deliberate and unsustainably rapid expansion, the government will be out on its ear, however weak the opposition. Now let me turn to the economic case for preferring a slow recovery. I had described the subject of this article to colleagues needing to know in a rush as 'the Bank of England's case for continuing the recession'. This served as shorthand, but may be unfair in view of the May Bulletin's statement that 'high interest rates in Germany have obliged other countries in the ERM, especially those in the narrow band, to maintain higher interest rates than domestic considerations would, for the most part, have dictated'. I defy anyone to tell me whether or not the Bank of England is saying that UK interest rates are higher than it would like. What then is the domestic economic case for maintaining a substantial and widening 'gap' between output and productive capacity? It is to achieve an inflation rate which the chancellor, Norman Lamont, has described as 'not only below the European average, but as low as the best in Europe, measured on a comparable basis'. He quantified this objective as '2 per cent'. When UK output fell below the trend line near the end of 1990, the underlying inflation rate was still much too high, even allowing for lags. If this is to be reduced, output must fall below the trend line and stay there until a sufficient improvement in inflation is in the pipeline. And if the amount of slack is not merely high, but increasing, inflation will come down that much faster. The case for continuing to pile on the agony is that UK inflation is still a good deal higher than it appears in the headline rate, which is distorted by the timing of mortgage interest reductions. The underlying rate is still about 5 1/2 per cent, a good deal higher than Germany's, for all the Schadenfreude. UK producer price inflation, which is now running at 2 per cent to 3 per cent a year, is doing much better; but in leading competitor countries it is below 1 per cent. How strong are the arguments for suspending this aim until something like 'stable prices' has been entrenched? Common-sense observation suggests that it is much more difficult to squeeze out the last few percentage points of inflation than to get down to 4 or 5 per cent. An inflation rate of 2 per cent is less than the creeping inflation that prevailed in the Bretton Woods period and less than anything known in the lifetime of most of the population. To achieve it would involve a clampdown on the costs of the half of the economy that is sheltered from international competition such as construction, property rents and other services. We have moved a long way from the traditional economic objective, which would have been to stabilise the movement of output as near to the trend line as possible. As this is well beyond the half-way point of my article, I can add that some might have described this objective as 'minimising a quadratic loss function' - or flattening out booms and slumps. Even if the Treasury wants to forget about stable growth rates, it may simply not be able to maintain the margin of slack required for inflation to fall as low as it would like. For if demand remains slack for too long, capacity can be retired and workers become so discouraged that they leave the labour force. Such people have little disinflationary influence. It is reasonable for the chancellor to seek to publicise a lower rate of inflation than he expects to get. If he becomes a 'Stormin' Norman' for 2 per cent, he may be able to lock in 4 per cent. But serious disinflation objectives are best stated in terms of internationally traded goods and services; and the reluctance of the sheltered sectors to follow suit is best treated by competition and other supply-side activities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Halting dollar transfers to  North Korea may hurt Japanese banks' business operations, the  industry leader cautioned Tuesday [31 May].    With the loss of dollar-denominated remittances, "one cannot  say it is no hindrance to operations," said Toshio Morikawa,  chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan.    Morikawa was addressing a regular news conference a day  after  government sources said Japan may halt all remittances to North  Korea if the United Nations imposes sanctions on Pyongyang for  its refusal to permit inspections of its spent nuclear fuel rods.    Private banks have already stopped sending dollars to the  country after Utsunomiya-based Ashikaga Bank, which handles most  North Korean remittances, decided not to serve as an  intermediary for other Japanese banks, informed sources told  KYODO NEWS SERVICE earlier this month.    On measures to deal with the mountain of bad debts that  Japanese banks hold, Morikawa said he was "quite cautious" about  suggestions that banks accept one-time losses, a postwar taboo,  in order to write off the loans more quickly.    Saying he could only speak for Sumitomo Bank, of which he is  president, Morikawa said it is necessary to consider how society  would accept such a move and how it would affect operations.    Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry leaders have said they  support active loan writeoffs but they have avoided the direct  question of going into the red to clear the problem loans, a  legacy of the late 1980s lending spree.    Japan's 21 leading banks said late last week they slashed  their profits for the business year through March to write off  3.61 trillion yen in bad loans, up 2.6 times from fiscal 1992.    The bad loan total at the 11 leading commercial banks, three  long-term credit banks and seven trust banks was 13.58 trillion  yen as of March 31, up 801.6 billion yen from a year before but  down 184 billion yen from six months earlier.    On the postponed signing of a planned merger of three  second-tier regional banks in northeast Japan, Morikawa said  banks must "get sufficient understanding from their employees  and clients" but that mergers remain "an important option" for  restructuring.    Officials at Sendai-based Tokuyo City Bank, Kita-Nippon Bank  of Morioka and Shokusan Bank of Yamagata said the indefinite  delay of the signing, originally scheduled for Tuesday, resulted  from a procedural delay.    But banking sources said the merger ran into stiff  opposition  from employees' unions and customers of Kita-Nippon Bank.    Morikawa also expressed support for continued corporate  political contributions.    "I do not think corporate contributions are completely bad,"  he said. "As things are now, making appropriate contributions  to groups aiming to promote a free economy cannot be helped."</p>

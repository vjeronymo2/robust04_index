			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Polish airline secures financing THE biggest aircraft financing deal yet for an eastern European carrier has been secured by Bankers Trust, writes Daniel Green. The bank will act as adviser to Lot-Polish Airlines in arranging a Dollars 264m, 12-year financing deal guaranteed by the Export Import Bank of the US (Eximbank). The figure covers 85 per cent of the cost of nine Boeing 737s to be delivered over the next two years. The balance of the financing will be raised separately by Lot. The structuring of the deal allows the Polish carrier to pay interest at a floating rate with an option to fix at a later date. Mr David Flitterman, of the Bankers Trust's eastern European group, said that working with Lot was straight forward because it had been among the first east European airlines to purchase US-built civil aircraft and therefore was known to western financial institutions. 'Lot bought two Boeing 767s two years ago,' he said. The Eximbank-guaranteed funding will be used to finance the purchase of five Boeing 737-500 and four 737-400 aircraft. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in November.</p>

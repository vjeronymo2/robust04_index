			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Seoul cabinet survives censure The South Korean cabinet yesterday survived a no-confidence motion in parliament that had been tabled by the opposition to protest at the government's alleged mismanagement in connection with the collapse of a Seoul bridge last week. The accident, which killed 32 peeple, is blamed on poor maintenance of the 15-year-old bridge. The parliament supported Prime Minister Lee Yung-dug by a vote of 174 to 116. The result had been expected since the ruling Democratic Liberal party controls 177 seats in the 299-member National Assembly.</p>

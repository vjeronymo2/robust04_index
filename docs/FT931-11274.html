			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Kalon expands in Europe with Pounds 20m French deal KALON, the paints group, has expanded into the Continent with the acquisition of Novo Holdings and Novodec, its main trading subsidiary and the largest private label paint supplier in France. The consideration amounts to FFr161m (Pounds 19.8m), including Pounds 2.2m of debt. The acquisition comes five months after Kalon failed to acquire Manders (Holdings), its rival paint maker, in a hostile all-share offer valued at Pounds 106.1m at the launch of the bid. Some Pounds 14m of the French acquisition is to be funded by the allotment of almost 12m new ordinary shares at 117p apiece and the balance in cash. At the December 31 1992 year-end, Kalon had net cash balances of Pounds 12.3m: the pro forma effect of the acquisition will reduce that figure to Pounds 6.5m. Mr Mike Hennessy, group managing director, said that the deal and the price had been 'well received' in the City. The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 123 1/2 p before the announcement and remained static since. Kalon accompanied the news of the acquisition with a forecast that 1992 profits - after interest and before both the Manders bid costs of Pounds 1.5m and tax - would be not less than Pounds 13m, an advance of at least 41 per cent on last time's Pounds 9.2m. It added that it intended to to pay a final dividend - for which the newly allotted shares would rank - of 2.2p to make a total of 3.2p (2.2p). Mr Hennessy said the acquisition of Novodec was 'a perfect fit'. He said it was in the same position as Kalon in 1988: 'strong in private label paints, but without any trade paint or decorative sundries business'. Founded in 1975 by Galeries du Papier Peint and Windeck Paints - which ironically was acquired by Manders in December 1991 for Pounds 5.66m - Novodec was managed by Mr Graham Burke, who in 1982 became the majority shareholder. The French arm of 3i acquired a 22 per cent stake in 1990. Under Kalon's ownership, the management will remain the same with the exception of Mr Burke, who is retiring and will be replaced as chairman by Mr Hennessy. He said Mr Burke had sold to Kalon, because it knew the business and its management and because Mr Burke wanted to preserve what he had created. Novodec employs 140 people. Its paints sell throughout France, mostly in hyper- and supermarkets and DIY sheds. Post-tax profits for 1992 are expected to be FFr12m.</p>

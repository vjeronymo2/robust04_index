			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / US Money and Credit: Hopes rise of cut in interest rates by Fed HOPES that the Federal Reserve might ease short-term interest rates once more in this economic cycle are on the rise again following a batch of ostensibly helpful statistics. Yet a strong case can still be made for the Fed keeping its monetary policy on hold, at least until early July, just before the presidential election campaign gets under way in earnest. Those arguing in favour of easing maintain the slow recovery in the economy remains too fragile for comfort and that a further cut in short-term rates will help to ensure that the revival is sustainable. Some support for this line came from last week's statistics. Robust consumer spending is vital for the recovery yet retail sales showed a tiny two-tenths of 1 per cent gain in May, while April's figures, originally reported as a robust 0.9 per cent, were revised down to 0.4 per cent. This was substantially below analysts' expectations. However, the weather across the US was atrocious during these two months. And car sales have been relatively healthy over the past few weeks, suggesting a cautious willingness to spend on even big ticket items. The behaviour of M2, the monetary aggregate tracked most closely by the Fed, which consists of currency, checking accounts and some savings accounts, has also provided ammunition to the easing school. It was virtually unchanged in May, and its growth so far this year is far below the Fed's target range. Yet there is lively debate among economists as to just how relevant M2 should be for Fed decision-making, in view of the markedly different behaviour of M1, the more narrowly defined aggregate, which has been growing extremely rapidly. The main weakness in M2 has been in small-time deposits and money market mutual fund shares. This may be due in part to depositors shifting savings into higher earning areas, taking advantage of the large disparity between the yield on short and long - term instruments. Mr Elliott Platt, at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, suspects that 'the strength of M1, coupled with the strength of the savings deposit component of M2, represents a shift of funds by consumers into forms which can be readily used for transactions purposes.' Inflation statistics released on Friday have also given comfort to the easing school, which argues that they allow the Fed to cut rates without fear of fuelling inflation. Consumer prices rose a mere one tenth of 1 per cent in May, the smallest rise since January. But a key question is the likely effect of a rate cut on the long end of the credit markets, which influences corporate investment decisions and over which the Fed has no direct control. Rates here have remained stubbornly high over the past two years of short-term easing, producing an extremely steep yield curve. This may be due in part to international competition for capital and to the US budget deficit, but residual fears of inflation have also played a substantial role. Opinion is divided as to whether another Fed easing would be positive for the long end, causing yields to fall in line with the short end, or negative, making yields rise amid fears of higher inflation. Whatever the case, the Fed seems unlikely to consider moving until it has substantially more statistical evidence to digest, with the publication of new unemployment figures on July 2 a possible trigger date. Thereafter, the presidential campaign will be hotting up, and historically the Fed has been reluctant to change its stance and give ammunition to the politicians.</p>

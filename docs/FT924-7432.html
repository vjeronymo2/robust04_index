			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Credit surge poses threat of inflation CHINA'S rush to develop a market economy is fuelling a surge in credit to fund inefficient capital investment, the People's Daily has said, Reuter reports from Beijing. 'The call for faster economic development does not mean that everyone must jump to the fore,' the Communist Party's official newspaper said. 'We must not take the old road of neglecting efficiency, stressing and competing only for production value, blindly launching new projects and expanding production. While proud that their economic policies are working, China's communist leaders fear that mismanagement may bring a repeat of the economic turbulence of the late 1980s, when spiralling inflation helped to spur the pro-democracy protests in the spring of 1989. China's economy grew by 10.6 per cent in the first three quarters of 1992, down from rates of up to 12 per cent earlier this year. Inflation remains at about 5 per cent, according to official statistics, but urban areas are posting rates closer to 10 per cent, which diplomats say are still underestimated.</p>

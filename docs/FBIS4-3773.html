			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] China has put Taiwan's air links with the rest of  the world in question by trying to limit transit routes through  Hong Kong. This emerged during Sino-British talks on Hong  Kong's aviation agreements.    Taiwan's post-1997 aviation links with Hong Kong have been  at  stake in the course of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group  (JLG) talks on renewing Hong Kong's aviation agreements with  individual countries. Talks on air service agreements (ASAs)  have made little progress at the JLG because of Britain's  refusal to disclose details of agreements with foreign airlines  which fly from Hong Kong to Taiwan.    Before 1984, all 24 ASAs in Hong Kong were an extension of  Britain's agreements with other countries. The main purpose of  the JLG negotiations is to take Hong Kong's aviation routes out  of the original UK agreements, officially known as a "separation  programme." This programme does not cover air services of Hong  Kong airlines running flights to Taiwan, which is a separate  issue. Direct flights from Hong Kong to Taiwan are handled by  Cathay Pacific and China Airlines under commercial arrangements.  The Hong Kong Government promised the Taiwan Government that  the continuation of these services would be discussed by the JLG  before the end of this year. At the moment, most foreign  airlines' ASAs with Hong Kong contain the right to run flights  between Hong Kong and Taiwan.    This is a point of contention with China.    It is reliably understood that China has refused to approve  seven ASAs unless the following conditions are met:    -- The Government must disclose details of agreements which  allow foreign airlines to fly between Hong Kong and Taiwan.    -- China wants to know what privileges have been demanded  and gained by Britain from the governments where the airlines  originate in exchange for the right to fly between Hong Kong and  Taiwan.    -- Countries currently enjoying the right of transit to  Taiwan will have to renegotiate directly with the Chinese  Government to continue this practice after 1997.    All Beijing's demands have been rejected by Britain on the  grounds that the Joint Declaration guarantees that only Hong  Kong's Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government, not  China, has the right to conclude ASAs with third countries,  excluding aviation routes through mainland China.    The Hong Kong government has told China that Hong Kong will  suffer economically if foreign airlines lose their right to fly  between Taiwan and Hong Kong. These foreign airlines, the  government fears, will then demand a unilateral increase in  flights to Hong Kong to compensate for the loss of flights to  Taiwan. The seven ASAs China is now delaying cover airlines in  Germany, Italy, Singapore, Korea, Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia.    It is understood that China overlooked the Taiwan factor  until 1990 when Taiwan's China Airlines started using Amsterdam  as its aviation base in Europe. Government representatives are  now in Europe for more talks about separating Hong Kong's ASAs  from those of Britain's.    Out of 24 ASAs, those signed with Kuwait, Lebanon, Portugal,  and Kenya have not been in operation for a long time. The  government has decided to put them aside temporarily.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / MPs call Hurd to explain aid for Malaysian dam Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is to be called before a Commons committee to explain the government's decision to give aid to Malaysia's Pergau Dam project in the late 1980s. Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday agreed to summon Mr Hurd and Baroness Chalker, the Minister for Overseas Development, to answer questions on the decision to give Pounds 234m to the Malaysian government in 1988 for the construction of a dam on the Pergau river. The committee has asked several departments - including the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry - to draw up a 'comprehensive memorandum' outlining details of the dam project, which was recently described by Whitehall accountants as a 'very bad buy'. The committee has also drawn up a list of questions for officials. One of these is whether the offer of aid was linked to the sale of Pounds 1bn of defence equipment to Malaysia which took place at about the same time. Lady Thatcher and Lord Younger, the former defence secretary, took the original decisions relating to the deal in 1988. They signed a protocol with the Malaysian government which mentioned aid. Mr Hurd and Mr John Major took the final decision in 1991 to 'sign the cheques' triggering the donation of aid to the Malaysian government. Mr Hurd will be asked why, in February of that year, he over-ruled Sir Timothy Lankester, the former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, who opposed the proposal. Sir Timothy recently described the deal as an 'abuse' of the administration's budget, amid indications that the dam has pushed up the retail cost of electricity in Malaysia. An official at the administration said last night there was nothing in British legislation prohibiting the linkage of arms deals with aid. However, he also said officials have traditionally abided by a set of guidelines - called 'Restrictions on the use of the aid programme' - which prohibit linkage between arms deals and overseas aid. In addition, guidelines on development assistance drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - to which the UK is a signatory - specifically exclude 'any kind of military assistance'. The official said these guidelines are regarded as a 'bible' by desk officers.</p>

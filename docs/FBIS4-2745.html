			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi arrived here this  afternoon at the invitation of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald  H. Brown.    Wu is in Washington to co-chair with Brown the Eighth  Session  of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade to be  held Wednesday and Thursday [13 and 14 April] and to conduct  consultations on how to further expand bilateral trade and  economic cooperation and other related issues.    A 37-member Chinese Government economic and trade delegation  led by Wu took part in a Sino-U.S. trade and investment  opportunity conference in Los Angeles before flying to  Washington, D.C. and will attend a similar event in New York  next week.    As she arrived at Washington's Dulles Airport Wu said that  the "considerable progress" made in Sino-U.S. trade and economic  ties had "brought enormous benefits" to both nations since the  two countries established diplomatic relations.    However, she noted that bilateral trade and economic  relations are still plagued by some problems and difficulties,  whose solutions require the joint efforts of the governments,  statesmen, business communities and people in all walks of life.    Wu was hopeful, she said, that the Sino-U.S. Seattle summit  last November could be used as a starting point to maintain and  boost high-level contact and exchanges between the two countries  in all fields, strengthen mutual understanding, expand common  interests, reduce and eliminate differences and bring bilateral  relationships, including trade and economic aspects, back to  healthy development.</p>

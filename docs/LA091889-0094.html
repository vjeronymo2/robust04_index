			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOKYO EXPERT TELLS HOW U.S. FIRMS FAIL IN JAPAN  </P> <P> American firms doing business in Japan demonstrate a lack of total commitment  to that market by dispatching second-rate foreign managers to Tokyo and by  hiring unqualified Japanese nationals, according to the president of Johnson  &amp; Johnson (Japan).  </P> <P> Masami Atarashi recently took American firms to task, criticizing their largely  unsuccessful approach to Japan and advising them on how to make inroads there.  </P> <P> "To the extent you do your homework, a foreign company can be successful,"  Atarashi told a recent gathering of U.S. and Japanese businessmen in Los  Angeles. He is one of a growing number of Japanese executives who have taken an  uncharacteristic high profile in admonishing American businesses about their  poor showing in Japan.  </P> <P> Atarashi suggested ways that U.S.-based firms could take the offensive in the  Japanese market. He described how small packaging and design changes for  Johnson &amp; Johnson products made significant differences in Japanese sales.  </P> <P> Since 1959, Atarashi, 53, has worked for Shell Oil Co., Coca-Cola (Japan), then  joined Johnson &amp; Johnson's Japanese unit in Tokyo in 1978. He said American  firms face five common problems in Japan:  </P> <P> * Absence of a corporate philosophy in the head office that spells out a "value  system" for the entire company. "Typically," he explained, "no corporate  philosophy is communicated to the Japanese subsidiaries."  </P> <P> * Ignorance in the head office. "American business executives have tended  historically not to have much knowledge about Japan."  </P> <P> * Poor foreign management. He said that American firms tend to assign to Japan  second-class executives or those passed over in home-office politics -- the  "losers."  </P> <P> * Frequent changes in top management because of short-term expectations for  profit and sales. Atarashi advised that companies wait at least three years to  evaluate an individual manager's performance in Japan.  </P> <P> * Difficulty in attracting and maintaining high-caliber Japanese employees.  "With the exception of IBM, foreign companies have had difficulty in keeping  Japanese staff" because of compensation, management standards and opportunities  for overseas experience.  </P> <P> "Japanese consumers are exceptionally demanding of product and packaging," he  explained. "You need to adapt a product (for the Japanese) regardless of its  success in the home country." Such adaptations should take into account the  Japanese perceptions of value, appearance, availability and service.  </P> <P> When Johnson &amp; Johnson introduced its Reach toothbrush in Japan in 1981,  designers shortened it by 5 millimeters and gave it a thinner handle with a  hook for hanging and offered three bristle types instead of two, as in the  United States. The Japanese model came in a transparent package; the U.S. model  was in a solid pack.  </P> <P> "We spent one year and significant money to make sure the product met specific  needs," Atarashi said of the Reach toothbrush, which has 9% of the $400-million  toothbrush market in Japan and is the No. 1 seller in the premium toothbrush  category.  </P></p>

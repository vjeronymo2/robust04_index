			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEIGHBORHOOD  </P> <P> The article "Living Downtown" (by Myrna Oliver, March 22) really caught my  attention. But I am angry that the term Latinos was used in such a way as to  classify them as "undesirables" for the upper-middle and upper classes to  interact with. I'm offended, and I believe an apology to the many Latinos whom  you have offended is in order.  </P> <P> And don't be too surprised if some of those residents of that beautiful  skyscraper land are Latinos.  </P> <P> VALERIE RAYAS  </P> <P> Gardena  </P></p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Dublin coalition in law job rift Ireland's coalition appeared on the point of breaking up last night after a row over the appointment of a new president to the country's high court. Labour walked out of a cabinet meeting called to discuss the appointment of the attorney general, Mr Harry Whelehan, to the country's highest legal office. The larger Fianna Fail party of prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds then moved to endorse the new appointment in Labour's absence. The crisis highlights the growing disagreement between the coalition partners over many areas of social policy. Mr Whelehan is a conservative judge, criticised for his rulings on several social issues, notably his handling of a case of a paedophile priest, where his office is accused of sitting on an application for extradition from Britain for nine months. Labour party leader and foreign minister Dick Spring said last night Labour MPs would meet tomorrow to discuss the row. Last night, most observers were forecasting that Labour, already weakened by losing another seat in yesterday's by-election in Cork, would seek a compromise rather than force an early general election.</p>

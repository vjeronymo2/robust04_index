			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: A son of Tokyo appeals to voters' sympathy - Family reputation may not be enough to save Ishihara junior NOBUTERU Ishihara, a young candidate from the Liberal Democratic party, is appealing to to voters' compassion rather than convictions in the last days of his campaign to allow him to remain a member of the House of Representatives. At 36 - he is the youngest running on the LDP ticket in Tokyo - Mr Ishihara has more going for him than most of his rivals when it comes to appealing to the hearts of the electorate. Yet he is struggling. He is the son of a famous and popular politician, Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a former transport minister. Mr Ishihara senior shocked the world but enthused Japanese with his outspoken views in The Japan That Can Say No, a book co-authored with Mr Akio Morita, the founder-chairman of Sony. Just as important in winning the sympathy vote, perhaps, is the memory of his late uncle, Mr Yujiro Ishihara, a legendary actor whose movies still regularly draw the crowds. As the general election on Sunday draws near, Mr Ishihara, who is battling for political survival in one of the country's most hotly-contested constituencies, is making a final plea to voters to let him keep his seat. 'There are only three days left, and I need your help,' he called out to the small but enthusiastic audience that has gathered in front of Eifuku-cho station, a residential district in western Tokyo. His desperation is palpable. Although he was elected 3 1/2 years ago with the highest number of votes in the district, the polls say Mr Ishihara is running sixth out of 12 candidates competing for five seats. Among those ahead of him are an older LDP candidate who has a popular following, a candidate in the Komeito who has the support of Soka Gakkai, a religious order, and a 35-year-old member of the Japan New Party. His actor uncle passed away seven years ago, but Mr Ishihara was able to enlist the support of his aunt, Yujiro's wife Mie Takahara, herself once a famous actress. 'My husband loved Nobuteru as if he were his own son,' Ms Takahara reminisced through the microphone as elderly women nodded in approval. 'Nobuteru's mother calls me every day and asks me to support him because he is in trouble. Please call your friends, anyone you meet on the street. We need your help,' she pleaded. That Mr Ishihara is having to rely on such emotional appeals is a sign of his plight in spite of a record which shows that he is just the kind of new conservative many voters are looking for. With a 10-year career as a television journalist, and an ostensibly faultless track record as a member of the Diet, Mr Ishihara speaks the voice of the politically informed, urban middle class. His views on political and tax reform, his calls for the need to deregulate Japan's markets and to debate openly the liberalisation of the rice market strike a markedly different chord from the traditional rhetoric of LDP diehards who have either opposed any change or shied away from facing those issues and clung to power on a cosy votes-for-favours arrangement with their constituencies in rural Japan. On political reform, the issue highest on voters minds, he reminds his audience that the aim of reform is to do away with money politics and not just to revise the electoral system. 'Everyone talks about political reform but what do they mean? Politics should not be based on a mood,' Mr Ishihara says, suggesting that his rival candidates from the new parties are merely riding on a wave of enthusiasm for political reform. He accuses them of having no political ideology to support their claims of being the country's best chance to reform a political system that breeds corruption. Neither is Mr Ishihara shy to criticise the LDP, the party to which he has chosen to belong. 'The LDP may be bad. Mr (Kiichi) Miyazawa (the prime minister) may be a liar, but now is the time to reform politics from within,' he says. Mr Ishihara's outspoken views on the need to reduce the tax burden on those who work the hardest and pay the most, his call for a change in policies to enable a lifestyle that reflects the economic status of Japan, and his flexible view on rice liberalisation should be attractive to the people of Suginami, Nakano and Shibuya, the three wards which comprise the constituency. The district has a relatively young population, with about 20 per cent of residents in their 20s, and is known to be one of the more politically aware constituencies in the country. Many residents are salaried workers, living in rented accommodation. So in theory, Mr Ishihara's calls for tax reform and for market deregulation to bring down Tokyo's prices - the highest in the world - should win the minds, of many. 'Unlike most politicians he has been willing to spell out what his policies are and that is rare. I hope he wins,' said a young housewife listening to Mr Ishihara. The difficulty Mr Ishihara faces is that the constituency is also known for being fickle in its political choices. The young population means that voter turnover is relatively high and the district tends to vote in line with the prevailing trend of the day. In the elections for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly earlier this month, for example, Suginami ward alone voted in two candidates from the increasingly popular Japan New party. In the last general election, when the popularity of the Social Democratic party was riding high as voters turned against the LDP in anger over the introduction of a consumption tax, the district sent two SDP members to the Lower House. Mr Ishihara is counting on this to reverse his fortunes. But his decision to stay in the LDP, on the grounds that reform is now possible from within and that to splinter off as some former LDP members have done is irresponsible, is his biggest gamble.</p>

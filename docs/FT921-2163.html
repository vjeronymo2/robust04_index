			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: BMW pegs payout despite 12.5% gain NET PROFITS of BMW rose last year by 12.5 per cent to DM783m (Dollars 475m), but the German luxury car company decided to keep its dividend unchanged at DM12.50 per voting share and DM13.50 for the preference stock. The Munich-based company gave no further information about its progress in 1991 ahead of its annual press conference on April 1. It has already said that deliveries to customers in 1991 rose by 5 per cent to 552,660 cars and that turnover advanced by 10 per cent to nearly DM30bn. Much of BMW's improved performance stemmed from the success of the latest generation of its 3-series model, the smallest car in its range. Despite some disruption caused by the changeover to the new model, car production was 6.5 per cent higher at 553,000 units. BMW is now working on a version of the 3-series to compete with the powerful six-cylinder model at the top of Volkswagen's latest Golf range. The company said nothing about this yesterday, but recently confirmed a statement by Mr Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW's research and development director, that such a car was being planned.</p>

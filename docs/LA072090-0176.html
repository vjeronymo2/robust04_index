			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORMAN AND FALDO TIE FOR LEAD AT MIDPOINT OF BRITISH OPEN CONTEST  </P> <P> An 80-yard wedge shot for an eagle-3 by Greg Norman and a seven-birdie round by  Nick Faldo left the world's top two golfers tied for the lead midway through  the British Open today, where even par didn't make the grade.  </P> <P> The two champions finished the 36 holes at 12-under-par 132, Norman shooting a  second-round 66 and Faldo tying surprising James Spence of England for the  tournament's low round of 65.  </P> <P> They led a record low-scoring field into the final two rounds of the world's  oldest golf tournament. With the last golfers finishing up, it looked as though  the cut for the last two rounds would be 141, 1-under par.  </P> <P> The previous record-low cut at the Open was 2-over par 146 at Royal Troon a  year ago.  </P> <P> If the projection holds up -- and most of the golfers were finished for the day  -- then lost in the cut will be defending champion Mark Calcavecchia, five-time  champ Tom Watson, three-time winner Seve Ballesteros, 1988-89 U.S. Open winner  Curtis Strange and 60-year-old Arnold Palmer, the two-time Open winner making  his last appearance in the championship.  </P> <P> Norman, the 1986 Open champion, had a round that featured six birdies in  addition to the eagle at the par-5 14th. He bogeyed two holes.  </P> <P> He needed every stroke he could muster. Faldo, the Masters champion who  succeeded Norman as the Open champion in 1987, birdied the 15th and 16th, both  par 4s, to tie, the later with the help of a wedge shot to three feet of the  flag.  </P> <P> The co-leaders were four shots ahead of PGA champion Payne Stewart and  Australian Craig Parry. Both had second consecutive rounds of 68 and were a  shot ahead of Ian Woosnam, Nick Price, Mike Reid and Spence at 137. Woosnam had  a second-round 69, Price and Reid 67s.  </P> <P> Starting the day tied for the lead with American longshot Michael Allen, Norman  dropped a stroke at the par-4 second hole. But he quickly made that up, taking  birdie-3 at the fourth, and then birdied four in a row -- the par-4 seventh,  par-3 eighth and par-4s nine and 10 -- to take the lead at 10 under.  </P> <P> A bogey-5 at No. 13 dropped him a stroke behind Faldo and Woosnam. But then  came the shot of the tournament so far.  </P> <P> On the 567-yard par-5 14th, Norman lifted his third shot from the left fairway  80 yards out. The ball landed about three feet past the hole, spun back and  plopped in the cut.  </P> <P> Allen, a virtual unknown on both the U.S. and European tours, dropped three  shots on the front nine, birdied the 10th but dropped another shot on the 14th  to stand 3-under.  </P> <P> Calcavecchia and Ballesteros both started the day 1-under par. But Calcavecchia  bogeyed the 10th, 14th and 15th, and took a double-bogey 6 on the 13th to  finish at 2-over 146, with a second-round 75.  </P> <P> "Idiotic," Calcavecchia said. He needed two shots to get out of one bunker,  "and I fell asleep over a three-footer."  </P> <P> Ballesteros, meanwhile, was 1-over 145 with a double-bogey 7 at No. 14 and  bogey-5s at 10 and 15, in a round of 74.  </P> <P> Watson, starting the day even par, also finished 1-over with a second-round 73.  </P> <P> Spence, inspired by his father's recovery from a major heart attack last  Christmas and playing in the Open for the first time, was the first player out  on the Old Course and had an 8-birdie, 1-bogey round of 65, the lowest of the  tournament to that point.  </P> <P> Other early finishers included three-time winner Jack Nicklaus, 3-under for the  tournament after a second-round 70; Raymond Floyd and Ben Crenshaw at 1-under  143, Floyd with a second-round 71 and Crenshaw a 69.  </P> <P> "I'm in position on the Old Course to win the tournament with two good rounds,"  he said. "You just never know what's going to happen."  </P> <P> Palmer, in at even-par 144 after a 1-under round of 71 in what will be his last  Open.  </P> <P> Conditions were much different from the balmy sunshine of Thursday, but scores  continued to plummet. The winds off St. Andrews Bay were light and the home of  golf was being attacked, with Stewart doing the best with the early damage.  </P></p>

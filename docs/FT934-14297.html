			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / 11 1/2 years not for turning into only 900 pages of memoirs: Malcolm Rutherford finds omissions in Thatcher's book, which is published today THE DOWNING STREET YEARS By Margaret Thatcher HarperCollins, Pounds 25, 914 pages MARGARET THATCHER is a born-again Conservative in the same way that some people are born-again Christians. She was converted by Lord Joseph, who told her around 1974 that he had only recently become a Conservative himself. For his first 20 years in politics, many of them at the top, he had been almost a Fabian. Mrs Thatcher then saw the light and it never left her. One of her first acts as prime minister was to abolish the Central Policy Review Staff, or 'think tank', because 'a government with a firm philosophical direction' had little time for 'detached speculations'. There is another revealing comment in the early pages of Lady Thatcher's memoirs. She drew a different lesson from the second world war than many of her contemporaries, whether British or Continental, left or right. Mrs Thatcher concluded that the war demonstrated the need for strong nation-states. Her hostility to the European Community was there from the start: some of it extends to personal dislike of those who think otherwise. Detachment is not the book's strong point. It is not meant to be a mark of disrespect to say that the volume it most reminds one of is Harold Wilson's memoirs of his 1964-70 premiership, though without some of Wilson's excellent set-pieces. Lord Wilson, like Thatcher, wrote rapidly after leaving Downing Street. The impression he left of his stewardship was of moving from one meeting, one subject, one crisis to another. Policies were governed by events. Lady Thatcher likes to think it was different in her period; she has not demonstrated it. Possibly this is because the formula of the book is wrong. After the mildly personal introduction, she simply rattles on in more or less chronological order - from steel strike to coal strike through whatever happened in between. At no stage is there an attempt to step back and look at a subject as a whole: (say) British defence policy, Ireland or education. Education indeed is the book's biggest gap, just as it was probably her greatest failure in office. She had after all been education secretary, her only previous cabinet post, before she became prime minister. Better teaching, better training was essential to everything she wanted to do to turn Britain round in the long term. Yet in the forming of her first cabinet, the education post is not mentioned, and it is not much thereafter, though we learn that she did once offer it to Lord Gowrie. There is another fault in the formula. A book of over 900 pages may seem long. In fact, it is very short to cover 11 1/2 years in Downing Street. The result is that practically every episode is told in truncated fashion, frequently omitting key details such as who gave advice. Many civil servants, to whom Lady Thatcher has reason to be grateful, receive no mention. Thus the tone becomes one of self-vindication: the message that she was betrayed grows stronger as the book goes on. Not all her comments are entirely accurate. I doubt if John Moore, once an heir-apparent, would agree with her claim that he insisted on returning to work too early after illness. He thought he was being harried back. Sir Leon Brittan might also complain that he has been treated less than generously. The prime minister strongly suggested there would be an early invitation to return to the cabinet after his resignation over the Westland affair. The suggestion has been written out of her history. Other omissions may stem from pressure of time. It would be good to have had more of her impressions of foreign leaders. When they come, as on Jimmy Carter, they can be perceptive, but are desperately short. About Giulio Andreotti she is not only short but plain rude. The foreign hero is Ronald Reagan, whom Lady Thatcher thinks Britain failed to appreciate, but here again one would have liked a bit more. Lady Thatcher has always been a better speaker than writer and naturally she required research assistance for these memoirs. Yet there are times when her own distinctive voice comes through. For example, when she sacked Lord Soames from the cabinet she had the impression he 'felt the natural order of things was being violated and he was, in effect being dismissed by his housemaid'. On former Labour leader Michael Foot she remarks: 'If I did not think it would offend him, I would say he was a gentleman.' These flashes, however, are rare. Many of the most savage are reserved for Lord Howe and, to a lesser extent, Lord Lawson towards the end of the book. Another volume is promised on her first 50 years. It should be more interesting because less is known about the subject. One hopes that it will also be more relaxed and less egocentric. Lord Howe's review of Lady Thatcher's book will appear in next Saturday's FT. Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Observer: Repair job Putting a couple of bankers in charge of the Housing Corporation, the government's biggest quango, is going to ruffle a few feathers. Midland Bank boss Sir Brian Pearse, the new chairman, is not a housing man and Peter Cooke, his deputy, made his name as the Bank of England's first proper bank regulator. What do they know about housing poorer people? True, Cooke has been on the Housing Corporation board since 1988 and Pearse knows a bit about the business since he's been lending money to house-builders for a very long time. Pearse, a Liverpudlian whose face never fitted in the patrician corridors of Barclays, has more of a social conscience than some big banking types. Even so, the arrival of Pearse and Cooke suggests that the government may be more interested in pandering to the City than to the social housing lobby. With government housing handouts set to fall, the City is being required to fill the increasing shortfall. Meanwhile, having an ex-bank regulator as a deputy chairman may help calm fears that the Housing Association movement may be becoming a hotbed of financial hanky-panky with unpaid volunteers handling vast sums of money.</p>

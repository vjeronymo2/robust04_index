			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR PARLAYS SKILLS INTO RADIO NETWORK ON HEALTH  </P> <P> When it came to keeping his patients fully informed about their health, Dr.  Nelson Kraus used a method of communication that might have made some  physicians bristle.  </P> <P> "I used to sit down at a round table beside the patient," Kraus said. "I'd put  a tape recorder in the middle of that table, put in a 60-minute cassette and  we'd talk. Then I'd give the tape to the patients so they could take it home  and replay it.  </P> <P> "They loved it. They said they played it several times and each time they heard  something they hadn't heard before. And they played it with other family  members."  </P> <P> Kraus, a former family practitioner working in medical communication for the  past 10 years, says other doctors may not agree with the way that he  communicated with his patients.  </P> <P> "Some doctors would have said the first place the patient goes with that tape  is to the lawyer," he said, but noted that such openness between patient and  doctor could cut down on the malpractice suits.  </P> <P> "The more information the patient gets, the more involved the patient gets with  the care, the less likely the patient is to sue," he said. "The doctor becomes  a partner, but the doctor is not responsible. The patient is responsible for  his own health."  </P> <P> Kraus parlayed his communicating skills into the Health News Network, a series  of health vignettes that air on 31 radio stations in four states and a Columbus  television station, but he acknowledged that there are difficulties on both  sides for that communication.  </P> <P> "Patients are intimidated by a person who knows a lot of things they don't," he  said. "There is a fear on the part of the patient that if he becomes angry or  upset, the quality of care may go down."  </P> <P> Doctors are busy, often seeing as many as 85 sick people a day, he said. By the  nature of their training, some doctors can be egocentric and arrogant, and some  don't know how to communicate.  </P> <P> "They know how to ask questions, they know how to interrupt answers, and they  know how to give orders," he said.  </P> <P> But he's a firm believer that the patient needs to be the aggressor when it  comes to talking with the doctor.  </P> <P> "There's a difference between talking to and talking with," he said. "Talking  with means the doctor has to do a lot of listening."  </P> <P> He suggests that the patient try and talk to the doctor on an equal basis.  </P> <P> "Here's someone with a high school education or less, looking at someone who is  speaking a foreign language to him," he said.  </P> <P> To complicate matters is the dynamics of the situation. The patient usually is  sitting on an examining table, wearing a flimsy gown and shivering. The doctor,  wearing a white coat, is standing there holding the patient's records.  </P> <P> Kraus suggests that the doctor and patient try to talk when the patient is  fully clothed and that the doctor not sit behind a desk.  </P> <P> "The patient should position himself between the door and the doctor," he said.  "The doctor would have to go over, under, around and through the patient to get  out of the office."  </P> <P> He also suggests that the patient jot down questions between visits and have  that paper in hand when facing the doctor. The patient should also write down  things that the doctor says in the office.  </P> <P> "One reason patients don't hear or retain is that they are nervous and they are  scared of what they don't want to hear," Kraus said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE NOTES: CHIANTI IN RIVERSIDE?  </P> <P> Mt. Palomar Winery in Temecula harvested a small quantity of Sangiovese grapes  in September, and will make a red wine out of the grape of the Chianti region  of Italy.  </P> <P> Peter Poole, general manager of the winery in southern Riverside County, said  the winery crushed 1.5 tons of the variety, yielding just more than four  barrels of wine. Mt. Palomar grafted somewhat over an acre of vines to  Sangiovese in 1989 and got a small crop in 1990.  </P> <P> Very little Sangiovese is planted in California. Trentadue, Robert Pepi and  Atlas Peak are among the few California producers who have made a Sangiovese in  the past, but interest in the variety is increasing.  </P> <P> Haywood Winery in Sonoma announced it will relocate in Kenwood at the Kunde  Estate Winery, which is nearing completion, and that Ravenswood Winery has  signed a lease-option to acquire the Haywood property.  </P> <P> Peter Haywood said his principal source of grapes would continue to be Los  Chamizal Vineyard, in which he retains ownership.  </P> <P> Responding to a new law passed by the European Economic Community restricting  certain terms in wine bottles, Italy has adopted the term classimo to designate  sparkling wine produced by the French methode champenoise.  </P> <P> The term methode champenoise has appeared on some bottles of Italian sparkling  wine, but EEC rules now restrict that term to sparkling wine made in France.  </P> <P> EEC also restricts the term Champagne from appearing on any wine other than  those made in the Champagne region of France.  </P> <P> Nestle Enterprises said Walter Klenz, formerly senior vice president of  finance/operations, was chosen to be president of Wine World Estates, parent  company of Beringer Vineyards and other wine brands, replacing E. Michael  Moone, who was promoted to president of Stouffer Foods Corp. in Solon, Ohio.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wine of the Week  </P> <P> Bouvet Rubis Excellence: ($13.50) -- This is a delightful change-of-pace wine  and one that recalls a story of an old friend who went to his mother's house  each Thanksgiving and was served a red Cold Duck. "It was a headache in a  bottle," he said. "Sweet and yucky. I'll never drink another red, sweet, bubbly  wine." He might drink this one. It is red; it is sweet, to be sure, but it's  well balanced. Rubis is a blend of 60% Cabernet Franc and 40% Gamay, made from  grapes grown in Anjou and Touraine. The bubbles are fine and persistent and the  taste is rich. Pair it with sweeter foods (duck in orange or cherry sauce,  sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce) or serve it after dinner with slightly sweet  cookies for a rare treat. DAN BERGER  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN DEFEATED BY ALUMNI, INELIGIBLES IN FOOTBALL SCRIMMAGES  </P> <P> Bob Shoup called the Cal Lutheran football team's Saturday scrimmages a "dress  rehearsal," and, unfortunately for the Cal Lutheran coach, the Kingsmen looked  like "Les Miserables."  </P> <P> Not only did they lose to the Alumni, 6-0, but the regulars also dropped a  short scrimmage against players who are currently ineligible, 14-7.  </P> <P> About 30 Cal Lutheran players were unable to participate against the alumni  because of academic eligibility question marks, but Shoup expects nearly all of  them to be ready for the opener next Saturday at Sonoma State. So he scheduled  a scrimmage between eligible players and ineligible players preceding the  alumni game.  </P> <P> "We decided not to treat that as an intra-squad scrimmage," Shoup said. "The  assurance that (school administrators) gave me is that first thing next week  they'll focus on this area and get it taken care of."  </P> <P> The difficulties resulted from an administrative logjam that developed in the  rush to determine the eligibility of all athletes in Cal Lutheran's fall  sports.  </P> <P> A few players, such as linebacker Kenny Steward, have more serious problems,  but most have only to resolve such matters as recording summer-school grades  and filing high school information.  </P> <P> The wave of eligibility problems has created problems in Cal Lutheran's  preparation for Sonoma State. By splitting his squad, Shoup was able to give  everyone playing time, but it also stretched the Kingsmen thin and highlighted  their shortcomings.  </P> <P> "We're a little behind on defense and a lot behind on offense, and we're way  behind on our kicking game," Shoup said. "I wish we were a little further  along. . . . I think it was important for us to do this today. Now I feel like  we can really get down to work."  </P> <P> There were some standouts among the stand-ins on the ineligible team. Junior  Darnell Mitchell dashed for 81 yards in eight carries. Mitchell, a Cal Lutheran  baseball player who only recently joined the football team, tore down the right  sideline on a 61-yard jaunt, the longest play of the day.  </P> <P> Although he is eligible, freshman quarterback Eddie Hoffman directed the  ineligible squad's offense. Hoffman threw a three-yard touchdown pass and  impressed Shoup with his poise.  </P> <P> Sophomore Tim Zeddies hit junior tight end David Deisinger with a seven-yard  strike over the middle for the eligible team's touchdown.  </P> <P> Only 20 alumni showed up for the featured game, but they nonetheless had enough  manpower to beat the varsity in a 30-minute game. The alumni didn't have an  experienced quarterback, so former receiver Greg Harris took the helm. Harris,  who played football in England after leaving CLU in 1986, put enough English on  the ball to complete 13 of 18 passes for 103 yards and a touchdown.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE;  </P> <P> TO EXTEND CONSUMER AGENCY  </P> <P> By a vote of 375 to 41, the House sent to the White House a bill to keep the  Consumer Product Safety Commission alive with budgets of $42 million in fiscal  1991 and $45 million in 1992. President Bush was expected to sign the measure  (S605).  </P> <P> The agency has been slowed in its mission by battles between consumer and  business interests over how far it should go to keep hazardous products off the  market. This bill makes it easier for it to obtain a quorum to conduct  business. Among other provisions, it requires manufacturers to inform the panel  if they lose a threshold number of lawsuits over their products, and mandates  safety standards for a few risky products, including garage door openers and  cigarette lighters that are easily ignited by children.  </P> <P> Supporter Doug Walgren (D-Pa.) said the bill has strong backing from consumer  groups and the agency itself.  </P> <P> Opponent Howard C. Nielson (R-Utah) said, "The bill outrageously mismanages,  micro-manages, this agency."  </P> <P> A yes vote was to reauthorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission.  </P> <P> How They Voted  </P> <P> Rep. Moorhead (R): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Roybal (D): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Waxman (D): Yea  </P> <P> </P> <P> Immigration Reform  </P> <P> By a vote of 264 to 118, the House gave final congressional approval of a bill  (S358) reforming the process of legal immigration to the United States.  President Bush was expected to sign the bill, under which the current limit of  500,000 immigrants annually will be raised to 700,000 between 1992 and 1994,  then drop permanently to 650,000. The majority of the new visas will go to  people with needed job and professional skills or who come from European and  African countries that have had low quotas in recent decades. One innovation is  a set-aside of 10,000 visas each year for investors of at least $1 million in  new, job-creating businesses in America.  </P> <P> The bill eases restrictions based on ideology and sexual preference, gives the  Department of Health and Human Services power to admit immigrants who may be  infected with AIDS, and is more protective than current law of political  refugees from El Salvador and elsewhere in Latin America.  </P> <P> A yes vote was to pass the immigration reform bill.  </P> <P> How They Voted  </P> <P> Rep. Moorhead (R): Nay  </P> <P> Rep. Roybal (D): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Waxman (D): Yea  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clean Air  </P> <P> By a vote of 401 to 25, the House gave its final approval of a bill (S1630)  accelerating federal efforts to make the air healthier to breathe, protect the  Earth's ozone layer against further depletion and curb the damage acid rain  inflicts on lakes and forests.  </P> <P> President Bush was set to sign the first upgrade of the Clean Air Act in 13  years. Supported by much of the business community and environmentalists, the  750-page measure relies on economic incentives and tough civil and criminal  penalties to achieve its goals. The bill curbs toxic emissions from motor  vehicles, power plants, factories, dry cleaners and all other significant  contributors to air pollution. It seeks to cut acid rain by curbing high-sulfur  coal emissions from Midwestern power plants, mandates cleaner gasolines and  tighter exhaust controls on motor vehicles, and requires the more than 100  cities with the dirtiest air to lower pollution to acceptable levels over the  next five to 20 years.  </P> <P> A yes vote supported the bill.  </P> <P> How They Voted  </P> <P> Rep. Moorhead (R): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Roybal (D): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Waxman (D): Yea  </P></p>

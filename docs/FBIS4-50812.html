			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- The "World Outlook  Book Series," compiled by Xu Weicheng, executive deputy head of  the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, recently  brought forth the second series. The five books in the second  series are: "AIDS: The Plague of the 20th Century," "Shadow  Under the Olympic Flame," "the Japanese-U.S. Trade War,"  "Europe's Powderkeg -- A History of the Balkans," and "A Look at  the U.S. Presidential Election."    Xu Weicheng said he compiled this series to help readers  gain  a better understanding of the world. He added that this series  strives for veracity and to expose the truth of the matter.    The four books in the first series, "Colorful India," "China  and the World at the Turn of the Century," "the Rise of Hitler,"  and "Mafia: the Incurable Italian Disease," were compiled  following the afore-mentioned principle. The first series,  published by Sichuan People's Publishing House in the end of  1991, were popular with the readers and sales of the first  series has reached some 25,000 sets. A book reviewer said these  books are of high taste and readable; they are not travelogues  recording customs and conventions, nor are they historical  documents or academic works; they have their own style.    The second series retains the strong points of the first,  but  places added emphasis on readability. "AIDS: The Plague of the  20th Century" is the first book in China which, written from the  perspective of a social scientist, systematically describes the  ravages of AIDS. Presented through a true story, "The Shadow  Under the Olympic Flame" tells how the spirit of the Olympics is  faced with different challenges. Through an analysis of the  rivalry between Japan and the United States, two economic powers  which practice two different modes of capitalism, "The  Japanese-U.S. Trade War" brings forth many issues that give more  food for thought than that from the outcome of an economic  competition. Through a retelling of the incessant wars on the  Balkan peninsula, "Europe's Powderkeg -- A History of the  Balkans" lets the readers look into the deeper reasons that  produce the contradictions and conflicts. Through the many  hubbubs that arose during Clinton's election campaign, "A Look  at the U.S. Presidential Election" traces the origin of the  democratic system in the West and relates some interesting  events during U.S. presidential election campaigns.    It has been learned that the compilation of the third "World  Outlook Book Series" is now in the works.</p>

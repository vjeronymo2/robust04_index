The "Happiness" brand motor vehicles were made by Yichu  Company, a joint venture established ten years ago by the Chia  Tai group of Thailand and Shanghai.    It is the first time for 20 years that Thailand will approve  such imports, according to company officials. Thai laws  prohibit import of assembled motor vehicles.    The vehicles were bought by the Chia Tai group, which will  present them to the Thai imperial house.    It will be a great chance for promotion, said Li Jingai,  deputy general manager of Yichu.    Yichu produced 238,000 motor vehicles last year, which were  all sold, and reported a sales volume of 1.5 billion yuan.    It will produce about 280,000 vehicles this year, with a  sales volume of some two billion yuan, a top company official  said.</p>

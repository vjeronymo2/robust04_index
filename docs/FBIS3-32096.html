According to the weekly [JEUNE AFRIQUE], Senator Dupiton  allegedly accommodated the killers the day before the crime.    Ebrane Cadet, first secretary of the legitimate office of  the  Senate of the Republic, says in a letter to Colin Granderson,  head of the international civilian mission, that he is alarmed  about a document prepared by a special UN unit according to  which Sen. Dupiton allegedly prepared the assassination of  Antoine Izmery. Cadet asks Granderson for an explanation  regarding this document.</p>

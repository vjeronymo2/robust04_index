			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Adult readers lift Dorling Kindersley AMERICAN INTEREST in sex and British enthusiasm for gardening helped boost interim profits at Dorling Kindersley, the publisher of illustrated reference books which was floated in October. However, shares in the group fell 41p to 264p after it said that trading conditions for children's books had become more competitive in America and it would stop sales to US warehouse clubs. Group pre-tax profits rose 21 per cent to Pounds 4.2m for the six months to December 31, after charging Pounds 208,000 for flotation costs. Sales improved 20 per cent to Pounds 38.6m. There was strong US demand for two sex books - Anne Hooper's Ultimate Sex Guide and The Magic of Sex by Dr Miriam Stoppard - which sold 70,000 copies each. UK readers bought 69,000 copies of The Royal Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Gardening in its first season, in spite of the book's Pounds 30 price tag. The companion, RHS Encyclopedia of Plants and Flowers, has sold more than 1.1m copies worldwide and generated more than Pounds 1.1m of turnover in the UK alone. Turnover of the DK Adult division increased by 31 per cent to Pounds 23.9m. However, DK Children's turnover declined 10 per cent to Pounds 11.3m, reflecting a more competitive market and the phasing of main titles. The group has stopped selling books to discount warehouses because it plans to start selling books at full retail price through its Family Library business in the US. Earnings were 4.7p (4.3p). The interim dividend is 1.1p. COMMENT The Dorling Kindersley story was beginning to look too good to be true: after the intermediaries element of its October offer was six times oversubscribed, the share price had nearly doubled and the company was last month voted publisher of the year at the British Book Awards. Yesterday's correction in the share price came because of a drop in sales to the tougher children's market, a gap in the phasing of new reference books, and the decision to stop selling to discount warehouses in the US. That makes sense in the longer term, since it will protect the group's high retail margins, but it will hit sales immediately. Analysts have reduced full-year forecasts to Pounds 9.5m, which puts the shares on a prospective multiple of nearly 20. They are likely to drift until the problems in the children's market begin to recede.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F> Bossi by Alberto Gentili in Rome; date not given: "Bossi: `If  Berlusconi Denies Us the Interior Ministry, He Must Form a  Government Without the League'"]    [Text] [Gentili] Senator Bossi, has the trial of strength  begun?    [Bossi] No, and I do not even know whether there will be  one.  The summit went off very well. We have got down to business.    [Gentili] On what?    [Bossi] On the program. We started with the general outline,  and the choice of ministers will emerge from that.    [Gentili] No names? How come?    [Bossi] Well, we surveyed the scene in general terms. We  shall show our hands next week. For the time being, not even  Berlusconi has the names. But there will undoubtedly be some  cancellations.    [Gentili] Who?    [Bossi] Those probable or potential ministers who are well  known to take a stance that differs widely from the government  interest.    [Gentili] Do you mean Pannella?    [Bossi] Yes.    [Gentili] And Dini as well?    [Bossi] Who? That guy that some people want to send to the  Treasury? Well, as far as he is concerned, what we have already  said holds good: This is a ministry that cannot be given to  someone who has close ties with circles that have already  received a great deal from the privatizations. The Treasury  must have a free market mentality, not work within a monopoly  mindset.    [Gentili] Did the League repeat its usual requests?  Treasury, Industry, and the Viminale [Interior Ministry]?    [Bossi] Yes, although I realize we cannot have them all.    [Gentili] Do you mean you might give way on the Viminale?    [Bossi] I hardly think so.    [Gentili] Not even if [Judge] Di Pietro were minister?    [Bossi] He is an examining magistrate; how can he be  interior  minister? What is more, Di Pietro may well be a point of  reference for public opinion, but he certainly cannot expect the  League to help him.    [Gentili] Can he expect the League to veto him?    [Bossi] No, we shall not exercise vetoes.    [Gentili] [National Alliance leader] Fini maintains that you  are ill-advised to lay claim to ministries. "The League's  electorate attaches no sentimental value to the Cencelli manual  [power-sharing system]," he says.    [Bossi] He is joking. I have no fondness for it either. We  are talking about ministers because the government cannot be  formed with technicians; it needs politicians who meet the  requirements of a political project. If we were to go back to  the era of technicians, it would create a dangerous situation.    [Gentili] What situation?    [Bossi] The technicians would be answerable directly to  Berlusconi, and that would give him enormous power. Anyway, the  issue still remains the same: The League is asking for a number  of key ministries because the League has taken it upon itself to  act as umpire and to ensure that the game is played according to  the rules.    [Gentili] What if Berlusconi were to turn your requests  down?    [Bossi] He will grant them, you will see. He can hardly form  a government all on his own.    [Gentili] What do you mean by that?    [Bossi] That the government will definitely be formed, but  that the League does not necessarily have to be in it. Either  we get the means, by which I mean the ministries, to perform our  umpiring role, or we forget it. However, I think Berlusconi is  willing to negotiate. He, too, knows that the common good, as  of now, is governability, and that failure to form an executive  might even jeopardize the democratic framework. This is why the  League will give the country a government, but the other values  will rise to the surface again immediately after.    [Gentili] Federalism?    [Bossi] Sure. We shall bring the issue up as soon as the  government has been formed.    [Gentili] But Berlusconi is lukewarm, not to say cool....    [Bossi] He is playing his hand, and I am playing mine. But  the federalist change will come about. You can bet on that.</p>

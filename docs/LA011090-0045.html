			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MURDER AT THE HOWARD JOHNSON'S' LIKE A TV SKIT -- A LONG ONE AT THAT  </P> <P> "Murder at the Howard Johnson's" has the feel of a television comedy skit -- a  very long television comedy skit.  </P> <P> This full-length Ron Clark/Sam Bobrick farce is reminiscent of Carol Burnett --  you know, Carol doing her thing while Tim Conway or one of her other leading  men pratfalls all over the place. Burnett could have done the same bit in 10  minutes, but here it's overextended to two hours.  </P> <P> "Murder," now performed by the San Clemente Community Theater at the Cabrillo  Playhouse, gives us Arlene and Paul and Mitchell, slow thinkers whose thoughts  linger on romance and murder.  </P> <P> Arlene and Paul are deadlocked in a bad marriage (she's a hyper-sexed ditz,  he's a monotone bore). Mitchell is their womanizing dentist. He's also Arlene's  lover, an overactive type who wears alarmingly loud clothes.  </P> <P> She wants a divorce, but Paul refuses. That spells trouble, so Mitchell and  Arlene decide to kill him in a nondescript room at the Howard Johnson's. Give  some credit to Douglas Hartman; his modest set has the motel's look down, from  the chintzy lamps to the crummy wall art.  </P> <P> Mitchell and Arlene's plans don't work out, of course, because there are  minutes upon minutes to fill before this baby is put to rest. All three get on  each other's nerves something terrible, and it's safe to say that, at one time  or another, each becomes the murder target as alliances shift.  </P> <P> At the outset, "Murder" is sort of amusing, in a let's-moon-the-audience kind  of way, but it gets weary after the first scene. The humor becomes strenuous,  primarily because of the plot's limitations. The basic premise doesn't leave a  lot of room, and the main gag keeps getting repeated. How many times are we  supposed to laugh at the idea of bumping off a loved one who annoys us?  </P> <P> Anyway, director B.J. Scott does make a few comic impressions here and there.  She has Mitchell put on his starched dentist's smock as preparation to the  actual messiness of murder, and that's funny, as is the wobbly gallows that's  erected on stage for the final scene.  </P> <P> The cast is also game, despite some overreaching. Laura Hoffman's Arlene is  dizzy enough to be influenced by every passing emotion, and Tom Klein's  Mitchell is, as Paul keeps telling everybody, just a big baby. As for Paul, Ron  Lance gives him a befuddled air.  </P> <P> 'MURDER AT THE HOWARD JOHNSON'S'  </P> <P> A San Clemente Community Theater production of Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick's  comedy.

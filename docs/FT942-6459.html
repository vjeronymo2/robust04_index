			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Fresh challenge for users of derivatives - Risk and Reward Just as the world's bank and financial regulators are making a heroic effort to adapt to the new challenges posed by interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives, the world's bankers and broker-dealers are in the process of taking high-tech risk management to another level. Derivatives, particularly the plain-vanilla type of interest rate swaps and options that help mitigate market risk, have become standard tools of treasury management. Once viewed as exotic, they have achieved widespread acceptance, a point underscored last week when Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, asked Congress not to single out derivatives for regulatory reform. Now, financiers are taking the applications of options and derivatives technology they've used to harness interest rate risk and applying them to to another broad area of institutional exposure: credit risk. Managing credit risk has long been the purview of bankers and provided the bread and butter of credit rating agencies. Transfering, or trading the credit risks of a particular instrument or portfolio has, until recently, been difficult or impossible. Managing credit risk required a banker to deal directly with the the cash instrument in question. Now, derivatives experts say transferring credit risk can be as easy as transferring interest rate risk, using tailored instruments written by the likes of Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust and Credit Suisse First Boston. As with interest rate derivatives, these credit risk transfer instruments break down the various aspects of credit risk, repackage them, and make them available for an offsetting trade. If a banker has exposure to senior corporate loans with relatively high yield and high credit risk, Merrill Lynch might offer a choice of three derivatives strategies to manage that risk, says Mr Joseph Arigilagos, head of the firm's investor strategies and credit derivatives group. 'We might write a put option on the price of the debt, or an option on the credit spread between the yield on the loans and a Treasury instrument. It's even possible we could write options on the default risk of the loans,' he says. The options would insulate the banker if the credit risk of the loans rose, while still allowing him to keep the loans and collect the higher yield. Having written the specialised options, Merrill Lynch would reach into its global network of corporate credit dealings and perform trades that would offset its exposure to the deal. These strategies and others are being used to manage credit risks for LDC loans, low-grade bank loans, and junk bond portfolios. As do other derivatives, credit derivatives increase leveraged exposure, in this case to high-yielding debt. The strategies assume that for every person or company that has a natural credit exposure to be managed, there is another party willing to assume that credit risk in return for higher yield. The year-old move into credit derivatives has hardly been a calvary charge, but the bankers who are enthusiastically backing the new products predict that the credit-risk management business could boom into a Dollars 1,000bn market in a matter of years. Some of their early attempts at credit derivatives marketing backfired when an early strategy - repackaging low-grade debt into trust securities that were reissued as top-rated but high-yielding bonds - ran afoul of Standard and Poor's. The credit ratings agency insisted the rating of the credit derivative be linked to the ratings of the component junk bonds, and not to the rating of the derivative issuer.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Wage costs stable WAGES PER UNIT of output across the economy barely changed between the final quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year, underlining the weakness of inflationary pressures. In the second quarter, unit wage costs were down 0.9 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. This was the same year-on-year drop as in the first quarter, according to seasonally adjusted Department of Employment figures. Particularly strong downward pressure on unit wage costs has come from the manufacturing sector, which saw a 1.2 per cent fall in these costs in the second quarter compared with three months earlier. In the second quarter, unit wage costs in manufacturing were 2.1 per cent down on a year earlier, compared with a 2.8 per cent year-on-year drop in the first three months of 1993. Output per employed person throughout the economy in the second quarter was up 4.5 per cent on a year earlier, the same as the yearly rise for the January to March period. Output per head in the second quarter was up 0.4 per cent on the first quarter, continuing the trend towards higher productivity seen over the past year. In the second quarter, manufacturing productivity was up 7.2 per cent on the corresponding period last year. In the first quarter the equivalent figure was 7.9 per cent.</p>

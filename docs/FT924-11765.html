			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Tenneco warns of more losses at JI Case TENNECO, the US conglomerate undergoing a major restructuring, yesterday announced third-quarter net income of Dollars 46m, compared with severe losses a year ago, but warned of continuing losses at its JI Case agricultural equipment subsidiary. The profits, equal to earnings per share of 28 cents, compare with losses of Dollars 693m, or Dollars 5.69, last year when Tenneco took Dollars 427m of after-tax restructuring charges. Revenues were up at Dollars 3.2bn. JI Case, suffering from depressed US demand for agricultural and construction equipment, reported a third-quarter operating loss of Dollars 68m, against a loss of Dollars 169m before restructuring charges last time. The company said Case would cut production by an additional 4 per cent, bringing its annual production cut to 24 per cent. The result would be losses at the subsidiary for the fourth quarter and the full year. Of Tenneco's other businesses, packaging posted profits of Dollars 49m, up from Dollars 23m; chemicals group Albright &amp; Wilson reported Dollars 15m of operating income, against a loss of Dollars 1m; gas pipelines made Dollars 58m, up from Dollars 17m; automotive parts made Dollars 60m, against Dollars 49m; and shipbuilding made Dollars 68m, up from Dollars 61m.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Student loans need improvement It is usually best to avoid saying of any idea - whether socialism, Keynesianism or Christianity - that it has not been tried. Most of these ideas have been tested to destruction by fallible human beings; and there is no point in invoking perfect versions operated by archangels. Where however a scheme is in its very early stages, there is a case for reform before judgement. This applies to Britain's student loans scheme, inaugurated in 1991. One of the pioneers of the idea in a booklet published in 1965 was Professor Edwin West. He has returned to the charge in a paper entitled Britain's Student Loans Scheme in World Perspective: A Critique (Institute of Economic Affairs Pounds 4). The basic case for student loans or their equivalent is unanswerable. Graduates as a group have higher incomes than the rest of the community. The conventional explanation is that they benefit from an investment in human capital which increases their marketable skills. The more heretical explanation is that degrees and diplomas act as a 'filter' which helps employers to choose the abler and more industrious recruits for better positions, irrespective of the value of what they have learned. On either theory the graduate has on average a better lifetime earnings prospect than the non-graduate. If living and tuition costs are completely paid for by the taxpayer the result is a regressive transfer from the worse off to the better off. On the other hand some mechanism is required to assist students who are not easily able to borrow large sums in the capital market. One solution is a state-supported loan scheme, which graduates service and repay when they can afford to do so. Professor West argues that any benefits to the whole economy from the existence of trained graduates should be recognised by a grant element in student support, and that the individual benefit should be recognised by a loan element. The British government has accepted this thinking de facto. As the table shows, public cash expenditure on fees and maintenance is already below what it was last year and is expected to fall further. The gap is being filled by student loans, which should account for some 30 per cent of fee and maintenance expenditure by 1996. The knee-jerk objection to students getting into debt is misguided. Debt is a normal feature of business and personal life, and is encountered by most people when they buy a house. But there are genuine defects in the British model. The government is worried by the exchequer burden and is contemplating another attempt to persuade the banks to finance student loans or to 'securitise' the loans so that the government can sell them to financial institutions. That is, however, largely a matter of budgetary cosmetics. The economic and financial effects are much the same if a student borrows from a financial institution on government guarantee or if the gov-ernment borrows for him. There are more deep-seated defects in the present scheme noted by Prof West. First the graduate repays only the principal, adjusted for inflation, and no real interest. A second criticism, which should appeal more to young people, is that repayments are made in fixed monthly instalments starting the April after graduation - with exemptions for those with less than 85 per cent of average adult earnings. Prof West would like loan services collected through the income tax, as already happens in New Zealand. This would be both easier to enforce and more directly related to ability to pay. Other academics have previously argued for a graduate surcharge on National Insurance contributions, without the mechanics of a loan at all, but involving the same pattern of receipts and payments. Government opposition to these ideas savours of the financial fetishism which Conservatives too frequently substitute for genuine market economics. Finally, a loan scheme serviced via the income tax - or grants offset by a graduate surcharge - would make it easier to finance more generous support for students willing to accept a larger burden after they graduate. Several decades ago Professor Harry Johnson warned that a large student class, living at a sub-proletarian standard of living, was a recipe for trouble. It need not occur with sensible arrangements for shifting the burden of expenditure and payments over a graduate's lifetime.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------            EXPENDITURE ON MANDATORY STUDENT AWARDS AND LOANS                     (ENGLAND AND WALES) POUNDS M  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FY                       1991-92          1992-93           93-94                          outturn        estimated       estimated                                           outturn         outturn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Student loans net            114              166             273 of principal payments Fee expenditure            1,172            1,530           1,649 Maintenance expenditure      813            1,008           1,098 Total awards and           2,099            2,704           3,020 loans expenditure*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FY                         94-95            95-96           96-97                             plan             plan            plan  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Student loans net            470              688             898 of principal payments Fee expenditure            1,171            1.011           1,044 Maintenance expenditure    1,145            1,056             945 Total awards and           2,785            2,755           2,887 loans expenditure*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Totals, based on unrounded figures, may not always equal the sum of the components  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Department for Education, March 1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

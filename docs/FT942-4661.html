			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: EU trade boost for South Africa The European Union said South Africa would be admitted to the generalised system of preferences shortly and a range of other accords with the country, including a formal trade treaty, were likely to follow soon afterwards, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Earlier this week Mr Erwan Fouere, the European ambassador, said he expected South Africa to be added to the GSP, a concept developed by the UN Conference on Trade and Development. Under it developing nations are granted virtually tariff-free access to the European market for manufactured and semi-manufactured goods, within the next month. EU foreign ministers agreed in principle to the move in April but waited until after the elections to formalise it. Mr Fouere also said that the EU had already made representations to the new South African government on a future trade agreement and he expected a final deal to be reached relatively quickly.</p>

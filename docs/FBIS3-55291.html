			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Chelnokov report: "Barkashov Affair Alive in the </F> General Prosecutor's Files and in Anonymous Letters"]    [Text] The first cross-examination of Aleksandr Barkashov,  ringleader of the neo-Nazi "Russian National Unity" [RNU]  movement, who received gunshot wounds at the end of last year,  was held 4 January. In the interests of the investigation the  results of the cross-examination are not being made public.  Information about the arrested man passed on through TASS  channels by the Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] Public Relations Center abounds in contradictions.  Hence the case of Barkashov's gunmen, who played an active role  in the events of October, has become clouded with improbable  rumors.    On Monday the law-enforcement organs publicly stated that "a  detailed report on the RNU affair will follow" as early as  Tuesday. However, at the promised time the power departments'  press centers seemed to have decided to keep mum. What is more,  they refused to comment on the report of the MVD Public  Relations Center that the investigation into Barkashov on the  prosecutor's directive had been...terminated one week after the  suppression of the putsch. Vladimir Tskhay, chief of the team  investigating the Barkashov affair, also refused to clarify  anything on this question. It is known only that Barkashov is  being "grilled" by investigators of the Russian Federation  General Prosecutor's Office.    Meanwhile the circumstances of the attempt on the fascist  ringleader are becoming more and more mysterious. It is not  even known where exactly it took place. Two versions exist: In  Zelenograd, and in Moscow Oblast's Krasnogorsk. In the only  hospital in Zelenograd where the wounded man could have been  operated on -- the Third City Hospital -- the report carried by  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI that Barkashov stayed there 22 through 30  December has been categorically denied. Chief doctor Leonid  Shushelya said that "following the appearance of the false  report many doctors are refusing to go on duty, fearing  reprisals from Barkashov's gunmen."    The "Krasnogorsk version" looks more authentic. Barkashov  could have been operated on in three places in this city -- in  the Krasnogorsk Machine Plant's Medical and Health Ward; in the  114th District military hospital; and in the Vishnevskiy Central  Clinical Hospital. Most likely the wounded man was registered  under an assumed name.    How the attempt itself took place is also, to put it mildly,  a cause of bewilderment. It is known for a fact that the  fuehrer's bodyguard would never leave their leader's side. How  did he come to be on the street in the hours before dawn, and  completely alone? Why did the criminals not "finish off" their  victim at that deserted hour? And finally, a strange  coincidence: Where on earth did the car which took Barkashov to  the operating table at 0400 hours come from...?    A person close to Barkashov told me that it cannot be ruled  out that the incident was staged: that Barkashov shot himself,  or received the friendly "assistance" of his comrades-in-arms.  Only to what end? Yet another riddle...    Another riddle is the fact that the fuehrer is now being  treated in the Russian Federation MVD Central Hospital,  although, General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazanik said, he has been  charged under a number of articles of the Criminal Code.    The other day many mass media were faxed a "Russian National  Unity statement" in defense of their leader and signed by "the  RNU Council." Another riddle: It is known that on 28 September  last year Viktor Krivov, chairman of the RNU Council, quarreled  with Barkashov and took some of the gunmen with him from the  White House. So that a united Russian National Unity Council  simply does not exist.    The Barkashov affair is turning into a web of unexplained  circumstances. Some RNU members believe that it will never be  untangled. Barkashov, thanks to influential friends in the  power departments, will quickly find himself free, and ordinary  members will take the rap for him on prison bunks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by Thierry </F> Portes and Franz-Olivier Giesbert; place and date not given:  "Primaries: Pasqua Speeds Up"]    [Text] It was at the Chemical Society Headquarters in Paris  on 12 June 1991 in the presence of many deputies of what was  then the opposition, and led by Valery Giscard d'Estaing and  Jacques Chirac, that the UDF [Union for French Democracy] and  RPR [Rally for the Republic], meeting within the UPF [Union for  France], signed the charter for French-style primaries, adopted  by the UPF political office on 10 April. This charter makes  provision for "presenting and supporting a joint candidate at  the next presidential election" and "giving the men and women  who support the UPF's values" the responsibility for choosing  this candidate according to a system inspired by the American  model, in which the Democrat and Republican Parties leave it to  their respective supporters to appoint their candidate before he  runs for the U.S. Presidency.    [LE FIGARO] [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard said just  yesterday that Edouard Balladur was the best candidate for the  1995 election. Are you not pleased that the presidential  campaign has already been launched, given that you like  political contest so much?    [Pasqua] I do not think it is a good thing. The prime  minister reminded the members of his government -- and he was  right to do so -- that he did not want anybody to become  involved in the presidential debate before the end of the year.    [LE FIGARO] He was not heeded, even by his own people....    [Pasqua] He ought to reaffirm this rule. To all, including  those loyal to him. It is too soon to talk of the presidential  election now. But what is more serious is the fact that great  inconsistency is appearing in the majority leaders' political  approach. We have two elections this year: the canton  elections and the European elections.    In the first, in most cantons, we -- the RPR, UDF, and the  government -- will support majority union candidates in the  first round.    In the second, from what I understand, the majority parties  have decided to draw up a single list. This union list will  therefore be supported by the RPR, the UDF, and the government.  But in the following election -- the presidential election --  despite the pledges made by the parties forming the existing  majority, the possibility of presenting several candidates is  being considered! I find it difficult to understand the  rationale behind this approach.    [LE FIGARO] So, you will revive your plan for primaries  enabling the majority voters to decide between the RPR and UDF  candidates before the first round.    [Pasqua] This is a pledge which we made solemnly to our  voters. It was approved by the RPR and UDF, and signed by  Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac. We took this  course because the primaries make it possible to present a union  candidate from the first round. There would be nothing worse  for the current majority than to be divided. However, now, if  nothing is done, we can be certain that there will be several  majority candidates in 1995.    [LE FIGARO] How many?    [Pasqua] Two, three, four... However, this is to  misunderstand the deep-seated feelings of the voters. The  French people want union. Last March, they voted for a united  majority and they want the government to shoulder its  responsibilities for maintaining that union.    [LE FIGARO] So, you will revive the primaries process...    [Pasqua] We who were behind this approach, in the RPR and  UDF, will meet next week and see what conclusions we must draw  from the present situation.    [LE FIGARO] In other words?    [Pasqua] We will revive the idea of primaries. In my  capacity as interior minister, I think my main political  responsibility is to make every effort to maintain and develop  the majority union.    [LE FIGARO] When will you submit this plan?    [Pasqua] This plan will have to be submitted in the spring  session. Everybody will then shoulder his responsibilities.  Those who prefer several candidates, in other words division  and the risk of defeat, will have to say so publicly. They will  not only have to say so, but will have to shoulder their  responsibility in Parliament.    [LE FIGARO] So, you are still in favor of a single majority  candidate for the forthcoming presidential election?    [Pasqua] I always have been. I am more than ever.    [LE FIGARO] Several prominent members of the majority point  out that submitting your plan in the spring session will mean  the majority discussing the presidential election from the  spring, which conflicts with the prime minister's wish for this  debate not to be started until 1995.    [Pasqua] No. We will discuss the election itself, but not  the candidates! My problem is not one of candidates. I am not  deciding in favor of one candidate rather than another. I am  saying that since there is a risk of division, we must provide  ourselves with the means of avoiding that trap. And the system  of primaries is a means of avoiding it.    [LE FIGARO] In a democracy, and especially with a  two-round election, is it not natural for several candidates to  stand for election? Does the first round not provide an  opportunity to distinguish between them?    [Pasqua] In a democracy, it is natural for several prominent  people to feel that they have the abilities required to lead the  country. But, if the current process is allowed to run its  course, we will have two candidates in the majority appointed by  the parties, in addition to those who reject this rationale.    As for distinguishing between them in the first round, the  last two presidential elections -- in 1981 and 1988 -- should  give us pause for thought.    [LE FIGARO] How do you intend to impose this system of  primaries, when you know that its main objective is first to  settle an internal majority problem, between Jacques Chirac,  Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and now Edouard Balladur?    [Pasqua] But this system can also be used on the Left! At  all events, those who do not wish to submit to it, will not do  so.    [LE FIGARO] According to its chairman, the UDF will not  submit to it.    [Pasqua] That is not a problem. The UDF has signed an  agreement with the RPR. If these two parties think that their  signatures are not binding, they will have to say so to the  French people. And everybody will draw their conclusions.    [LE FIGARO] But it is not betraying a secret to say that the  prime minister is not in favor of your plan for primaries...    [Pasqua] The prime minister is neither in favor of it nor  against it. He does not intend to be involved for the time  being. As far as I am concerned, I have already said, and I  repeat that I will not allow a process of majority disunity to  be started without reacting.    [LE FIGARO] What fate do you reserve for people who do not  submit to your system?    [Pasqua] There are two hypotheses: Either this system is  implemented or it is not. If it is not, this system will have  had no negative impact on the majority because we will be back  where we started. If the system is implemented, it is quite  obvious that those who submit to it will accept its rules. This  means that a candidate will emerge and that he will immediately  be supported by millions of French people. He will therefore  have a considerable advantage over those who have not submitted  to the primaries and who would nonetheless like to be  candidates. There will be a union candidate and the others will  be candidates of division.    [LE FIGARO] Do you think there is now a majority in the  Assembly to adopt a system of primaries?    [Pasqua] I do not see why the deputies should be less aware  than the voters of the need for union, of the necessity to have  a single candidate, whoever he might be. I am not saying: It  must be Mr. X or Mr. Y. I am saying: There must be a union  candidate. Just as I said: We must have a union list for the  European elections and, once we reach agreement on a union list,  the name of the person heading the list is not very important.  In the parliamentary, canton, and European elections, we are  united. In the municipal elections, the RPR and UDF are  currently reaching agreement on union candidates in all communes  with more than 30,000 inhabitants. In short, for all elections,  and especially when there is an election based on a list of  candidates and there are 80 places to be allocated, we have a  union. And, for the presidential election, for which there is  only one position, we will have a fight among several  candidates? That is an inconsistent approach! Explain that to  the French people....    [LE FIGARO] What do you say to those who think that a single  majority candidate from the first round of the presidential  election would dry up the reservoir of majority votes?    [Pasqua] You will certainly have Ecologist candidates, a  National Front candidate, perhaps Philippe de Villiers, and  probably others... But, if there is a majority union candidate  in the first round, it is not impossible that there will only be  one round. At all events, to guide the country's development,  and give it the necessary impetus, we need a candidate who has  attracted a large number of votes in the first round.    [LE FIGARO] If a single candidate is needed, should there  not also be a single majority party?    [Pasqua] I am one of those who think that the foundations of  a big single party will be laid in the presidential election --  a party which will unite all those who have decided to support  the new president.    [LE FIGARO] Are you thinking of a merger between the RPR and  UDF?    [Pasqua] I am not thinking of a merger. But given that we  will have presented joint candidates in all the elections, the  single movement will exist. In practice.    [LE FIGARO] What form do you think this system of primaries  should take?    [Pasqua] What is certain is that the studies we have carried  out in the Interior Ministry show that the organization of  primaries is possible, that this system cannot be compulsory,  and that it cannot be imposed on the political parties by law:  The Constitution states that the parties are free to organize  and administer themselves. All we can do is make primaries  possible and ensure that they cannot be attacked at  constitutional level. It is in this framework that we are  examining the question.    [LE FIGARO] When do you think these primaries will take  place?    [Pasqua] At the end of 1994 or beginning of 1995.    [LE FIGARO] Holding them in 1994 would conflict with the  prime minister's wishes.    [Pasqua] If we reach agreement on there being just one  candidate, we can wait until 1 January 1995, or even 1 February  1995. That simply presupposes that the candidates for the  presidential election should be known in the final weeks of 1994.    [LE FIGARO] When will the presidential election be held?    [Pasqua] On 16 and 30 April at the earliest. On 23 April  and 7 May at the latest.</p>

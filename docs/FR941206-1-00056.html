			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining compliance, sources using compliant materials (finishing materials, thinners, adhesives) should include periods of startup and shutdown because startups and shutdowns should not affect compliance with the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owners or operators can also comply with the proposed rule by using a control device. Initial compliance is demonstrated by conducting performance testing in accordance with &sect;63.805 of the proposed standards and the General Provisions to subpart A of part 63. The overall control efficiency (R) that is required by the standards is that which corresponds to E <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> ac <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Equation 2 of &sect;63.804(a)(3) being less than or equal to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) for existing sources or 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids) for new sources. Owners or operators using this approach can demonstrate continuous compliance with the regulation by continuously measuring and recording site-specific operating parameters, the values of which are established by the owner or operator during the initial compliance test. The operating parameter value is defined as the minimum or maximum value established for a control device or process parameter that, independently, or in combination with one or more other operating parameter values, determines that an owner or operator is complying with the applicable emission limitation or standards. The parameters that would be monitored under the control system scenarios expected in this industry are discussed in section VI.G.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owners or operators that choose to use a combination of techniques to demonstrate compliance must follow each applicable compliance technique. For example, if a source uses a control device to control emissions from one emission point (e.g., one finishing step) and compliant finishing materials for the other finishing steps, the compliance provisions associated with both control devices and compliant finishing materials apply. To determine the overall control efficiency (R) that is required to comply at the affected emission points, Equation 2 must be used. However, E <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> bc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will only include those finishing materials and solvents being directed to the control device rather than all finishing materials and solvents as shown in Equation 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission limits for Gluing Operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule also identifies emission limits for gluing operations. The proposed rule would limit the HAP content of contact adhesives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two methods of complying with the emission limits for contact adhesives in the proposed rule as outlined in Tables 3 and 5. These are the use of compliant materials or the use of a control device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An owner or operator that uses compliant contact adhesives can demonstrate initial and on-going compliance with the contact adhesive limits (kg VHAP/kg solids) by recording the HAP and solids content, as reported on the CPDS, for each contact adhesive used by the facility. The owner or operator must then calculate the kg VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for each of the contact adhesives. If a contact adhesive is thinned with solvent after purchase, the HAP and solids content reported on the CPDS must be adjusted accordingly to show compliance with the standards. The owner or operator is in initial and continuous compliance with the proposed standards if the HAP content of each contact adhesive is no greater than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for existing sources or 0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.2 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for new sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The owner or operator of an affected source using foam adhesives (contact adhesives used for upholstery operations), to manufacture products that meet the upholstered seating flammability testing requirements of California Technical Bulletin 116, 117, or 133, the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association's (BIFMA)&times;5.7, UFAC Flammability Testing, or any similar requirements from local, State, or Federal fire regulatory agencies is in initial and continuous compliance with the proposed standards if the HAP content of each foam adhesive is no greater than 1.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for existing sources or 0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.2 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for new sources. The use of any contact adhesive that does not meet the HAP limits specified in the proposed rule during any day is a violation of the proposed rule for that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owners or operators may also comply with the proposed rule for contact adhesives by using a control device. Initial compliance is demonstrated by conducting performance testing in accordance with &sect;63.805 of the proposed standards and the General Provisions to subpart A of part 63. The overall control efficiency (R) that is required by the standards is that which corresponds to G <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> ac <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Equation 3 of &sect;63.804(c)(2) being less than or equal to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) for existing sources or 0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.2 lb VHAP/lb solids) for new sources. Owners or operators using this approach can demonstrate continuous compliance with the regulation by continuously measuring and recording site-specific operating parameters, the values of which are established by the owner or operator during the initial compliance test. The operating parameter value is defined as the maximum or minimum value established for a control device or process parameter, that independently, or in combination with one or more other parameter values, determines that an owner or operator is complying with the applicable emission limitation or standards.

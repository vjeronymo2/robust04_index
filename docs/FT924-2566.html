			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fears of unrest in Russia give boost to oil prices OIL PRICES moved upwards yesterday in a volatile market where fears over unrest in Russia outweighed recent supply and demand concerns. The price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery gained 50 cents to Dollars 18.20 a barrel as President Boris Yeltsin appealed for calm in the streets. Traders fear that a deepening political crisis in Russia could disrupt export supplies from the world's biggest oil producer where output has been slipping dramatically. Russia exports around 2m barrels of oil a day (b/d) to the west. If concerns over Russian supplies persist, oil prices could find renewed strength after the weakness in the market of the past few months which has seen prices drop by over Dollars 3 a barrel to a seven-month low. Oil markets have been weakened by perceived over-supply because of a build-up of product stocks accompanied by low demand and mild weather. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' failure to cut its output has further depressed prices. Iran indicated yesterday that it was ready to cut production below its new allocation if prices remained weak. But at the same time Nigeria confirmed rumours that it had sold several cargoes of oil on a netback basis - cut price deals which in the past have been associated with sharp drops in the oil price. Professor Colin Robinson from Surrey University said the world should prepare itself for the 'significant possibility,' of another oil price shock later in the decade. He told a conference on Oil and Gas Economics in the North Sea that there is very little spare capacity in the world oil industry and, as demand rises, any disruption in Middle eastern or Russian politics could cause sharp rises in price. But an opposite scenario would see the recovery in demand remaining weak and capacity growing, which would keep prices low, he said.</p>

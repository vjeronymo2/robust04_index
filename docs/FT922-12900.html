			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Herring Baker static with Pounds 3.5m Herring Baker Harris, the chartered surveyor, increased turnover by 6 per cent and pre-tax profit by 1 per cent in the year to January 31.

Turnover came out at Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 12.7m) and pre-tax profit at Pounds 3.51m (Pounds 3.49m). Mr Nick Owen, chairman, said: 'The property industry has been a disaster area for unwary investors. Against that backdrop these results are an outstanding achievement.' Benefits came from 'the geographical spread and an exceptionally strong professional work load.' Across the country the first benefits of work from the 1990 rating revaluation had been seen. Earnings per share declined to 19.16p (19.47p).

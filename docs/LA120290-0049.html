			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WALNUT;  </P> <P> CITY PARTLY FUNDS ROADS  </P> <P> The city will pay half the cost of building roadway and storm drains along the  final two unfinished portions of Meadowpass Road between Lemon Avenue and Amar  Road, the City Council decided Wednesday.  </P> <P> Developers of two housing tracts that encompass the remaining links of the  1.1-mile stretch of Meadowpass Road will be responsible for the other half of  the public improvements.  </P> <P> The council set an upper limit of $480,000 on the city's contribution.  </P> <P> City officials estimate the total cost of the street and storm drain  construction will be $800,000. In approving the development agreement, the  council nullified an earlier stipulation that the developers dedicate one lot  to the city for an equestrian park.  </P> <P> Ken Brown, attorney for developers Taleb Sabouni, Robert Salamoni and Adnan  Jouma, had threatened to sue if that condition were not removed. The agreement  still must be approved by the developer.  </P></p>

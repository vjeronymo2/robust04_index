			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa plans to draft new measures to improve foreign access  to the Japanese market in a bid to take the pressure off the  strained trade ties with the United States, government sources  said Wednesday [16 February].    Hosokawa will call top bureaucrats to his official residence  Thursday afternoon to discuss the market-opening measures,  including those to boost government procurements and further  relax government regulations.    Earlier this week, the premier expressed readiness to do  more  to balance bilateral trade, 50 billion dollars in favor of  Japan, after talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the  "framework" trade talks broke down last week.    Apparently frustrated with the stalemate in the framework  talks, the U.S. Government announced steps to impose sanctions  against Japan for what it sees as a closed market for foreign  cellular phones.    Koichiro Matsuura, vice foreign minister for international  affairs, Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and  industry minister for international affairs, and Kosuke  Nakahira, vice finance minister for international affairs, will  attend the meeting Thursday.    The sources said the measures to be worked out by the  meeting  will include a step to make the procedures required for  government procurements of telecommunications and medical  equipment faster and more transparent.    Government procurements are one of the focuses covered by  the  framework trade talks. A pact has almost been completed over  the issue, except for a disagreement over a U.S. demand that  "objective criteria" be set to gauge Japan's efforts to slim its  trade surplus.    The government plans to implement what the two countries  have  so far agreed upon on the matter.    Also envisaged are further deregulations aimed at narrowing  the price gap between home and abroad and a quick enactment of  the budget plan for fiscal 1994, starting in April.    The government is also likely to ask the car and other key  industries to voluntarily make efforts to open their markets to  foreign products.    The sources said Japan will explain its efforts at the  upcoming meeting in Germany on February 26 of finance ministers  and central bank governors of the Group of Seven economic powers.    The government will also have consultations with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, due to visit Tokyo  shortly, over how to unblock the bilateral trade negotiations.    On the U.S. sanctions, the sources said the government plans  to file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade if the U.S. actually imposes them.    Hosokawa said earlier in the day that the government "will  seek a settlement of unilateral sanctions in accordance with  international rules."    The government will also protest a U.S. decision to withdraw  its offer to lower tariffs on electronics parts.    In addition, Tokyo will tell Washington to refrain from  making remarks alluding to its tolerance of a higher yen.    Speculation that the U.S. desires a stronger yen to help cut  the bilateral trade gap has driven the Japanese currency above 5  yen in the last three sessions.</p>

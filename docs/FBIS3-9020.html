Zlenko ends today a two-day official visit to the  Czech Republic.    At a press conference the two politicians appreciated the  importance of the document which is yet to be affirmed on a  higher level. The Treaty, as well as a Czech-Russian agreement  on trade and economic relations and an agreement on scientific  cooperation will be an inspiration for mutual relations.    Zlenko said that Czech-Ukrainian economic relations should  be  developed, as there existed still unexploited possibilities in  this sphere. Ukraine will gladly draw from Czech experience  from the transformation process, Zlenko said.    Zieleniec informed Zlenko that Ukraine was one of the Czech  Republic's significant priorities. Stable Ukraine is also an  important factor of stabilization in Central and Eastern Europe,  he added.    Zieleniec said he was pleased by Zlenko's confirmation of  continuing supplies of oil and gas via the Ukrainian territory,  saying he was glad that the Ukrainian Government saw this  question as an important part of Czech-Ukrainian relations. The  two ministers also discussed sub-regional and regional  cooperation and ways of ensuring security in Europe.    Zlenko also met with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus. After the  meeting, Klaus said that the Czech Republic was ready to send  its economic experts to Ukraine if asked to. Zlenko said that  Klaus had expressed his support for Ukrainian foreign political  activities.</p>

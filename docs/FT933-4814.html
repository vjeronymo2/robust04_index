			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Liberty to grant voting rights, but not just yet A MOVE by Liberty, the family-controlled group, towards the enfranchisement of its non-voting shares has failed to satisfy Mr Brian Myerson, who has so far failed in his attempts to open up the company. Liberty, famous for its prints and its central London store, said yesterday that it had decided 'in principle that enfranchisement would be in the best interests of the company and all its shareholders'. But in view of 'difficult trading conditions' it would not be appropriate 'at this time'. The company also argued that the move would be expensive in terms of dividend because of the need to issue compensatory shares to holders of the existing voting stock. Mr Myerson, whose Concerto Capital Corporation holds 15.78 per cent of the voting shares and about 7.5 per cent of the non-voting, replied: 'This public stance is completely at odds with the view recently intimated privately to Concerto by Liberty. Courage and creativity are needed. If enfranchisement is worth doing, it is worth doing now.' In June 1992, he requisitioned an egm to demand the recruiting of non-executives, the splitting of the roles of chairman and chief executive and the enfranchisement of the non-voting shares. Liberty has acceded to the first two. On the final one, Mr Patrick Austen, installed as chief executive in May, said: 'We think we have made a major step. As far as I know, no other shareholders feel as he does.' Liberty's pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 602,000, from Pounds 648,000, in the six months to July 31 - its weaker half. Retailing losses halved to Pounds 561,000 largely thanks to profits from Japan which rose to Pounds 1m (from Pounds 761,000). In the UK losses grew to Pounds 311,000 from Pounds 244,000. Converting and wholesaling profits fell to Pounds 325,000, from Pounds 869,000. Group turnover was Pounds 37.5m (up from Pounds 36.4m). The interim dividend was held at 1.85p and earnings per share slipped to 0.34p (from 0.46p) on a higher tax charge. Lex, Page 20</p>

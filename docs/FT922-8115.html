			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Technology: Shifting to high gear - Computer-aided design is finding new roles in countless productions across the world Cadcam may no longer be in its infancy, but after the heady growth rates of the early 1980s the market for computer-aided design and manufacturing equipment and software still looks a long way short of reaching maturity. While other sectors of manufacturing technology languish in recession, the world Cadcam market grew more than 10 per cent last year to Dollars 16bn, according to Dataquest, and will reach nearly Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14bn) in 1995 - a compound annual growth rate of 12 per cent since 1990. The importance of Cadcam, and in particular 3D solid modelling, to concurrent engineering - the team approach to cutting product development times and improving quality - makes it virtually a necessity in mechanical engineering. But other applications of Cadcam are now expanding faster, even though huge untapped opportunities remain in the dominant mechanical sector. Meanwhile, the industry is adjusting to much higher predicted growth rates for software than for the hardware that it runs on, and forming partnerships with industrial users to understand their needs better. All these trends are illustrated in current strategy at Matra Datavision, the biggest European-owned Cadcam supplier. And Michel Neuve Eglise, chairman and chief executive, is hoping for annual growth of 20-25 per cent over the next few years at the Paris-based subsidiary of Matra. Achieving that, and pushing Matra Datavision up the US-dominated league table of big players in the industry, will depend on recent initiatives at the 13-year-old company, whose success has been built on its Euclid-IS mechanical Cadcam software which produced the Renault Espace (right). As Cadcam hardware becomes a commodity item, companies such as Matra are trying to boost the share of revenues represented by software. The in-phrase at Matra, therefore, is what Victor Waknine, president and chief operating officer, calls the 'software factory' approach to help penetrate new markets and develop existing ones. A key element is a new generation of Case (computer-aided software engineering) tools designed to build the company's own factory of applications software, help Euclid users change their applications, and provide new application solutions for independent software houses. The product, for complex assembly design, will be available next year. A second initiative is a new entry-level solid-modelling system, Prelude/Solids, designed to attract companies currently using 2D or 3D-wireframe-based systems - surface modelling which is like stretching clingfilm across a wireframe but does not completely define an object in 3D as occurs with solid modelling. The ability, for example, to compute masses and moments of inertia makes solid modelling a powerful tool for reducing product development times. Matra is launching Prelude in the US - a good testing ground, says Waknine, for a mass-market product. It is designed to attack low-cost software such as AutoCAD, the Autodesk flagship product. But Matra also has its eye on the emerging market for 'conceptual engineering,' where the very earliest design sketches can be captured on computer, thus saving more time in the product development process by eliminating the 'back-of-an envelope' stage. Prelude's compatibility with Euclid-IS is an important element here, Waknine believes. Prelude is being launched in the US to correct Matra Datavision's weakness in a market where it sees considerable growth for 3D solid modelling. The US and Asia are the main areas of planned expansion for the company, although other markets have potential. The UK looks encouraging, with turnover up 40 per cent last year to Pounds 1.4m, and expected to rise to Pounds 2.4m in 1992. Currently 80 per cent of Matra's installed base is in Europe, 15 per cent in North America and 5 per cent in Asia, but Waknine hopes to increase Asian and North American shares to 20 per cent each by 1995. According to Matra, European manufacturers have realised the benefits of 3D solid modelling earlier than their counterparts in the US and Japan, because of the need for increased productivity in manufacturing, and education that has made possible a better grasp of the mathematical principles. But US and Japanese demand has been strong in the past two years, says Waknine, and solid modelling is becoming mandatory in Japan. Accordingly, Matra is rapidly expanding its US distribution network, and last year it signed an agreement for NEC to distribute Euclid-IS in Japan. Elsewhere in Asia, the company is negotiating two joint ventures, one in China and another with a big industrial concern outside China. It has begun co-operating with the Chinese space agency, and sees enormous potential even if it can convert only a small percentage of 20,000 engineers to Euclid. Other regions are likely to require more patience, says Waknine. In the former Soviet Union, he says, large companies have realised the potential of solid modelling - helped by the unofficial import of pirated western software - but are restricted by financial difficulties. Matra is exploring barter deals to enable it to sell to the former Soviet Union, and earlier this year took an indirect stake in Mazintergixi, a joint venture distribution company. According to Dataquest figures, Matra is the world's eighth largest supplier of software in the mechanical Cadcam market for workstations, the most important hardware 'platform,' but Neuve Eglise has ambitions to push the company into the top five. That could be tough, according to Petra Gartzen, Dataquest analyst. 'Matra have a very good product and are doing the right things, but the mechanical Cadcam market is not showing the same growth rates as other sectors because of conditions in manufacturing. That makes it very difficult for any company to increase its market share.' However, Matra's greater emphasis on software for the mechanical market, which is forecast to grow twice as fast as the hardware, should help. Matra is also expanding into the faster-growing architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) sector of Cadcam through a system developed by Framatome, the French power plant builder. Unlike many AEC systems, says Gartzen, the Framatome system is targeted towards plant design, where there are big opportunities in the European Community because of environmental legislation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORDLWIDE CADCAM MARKET  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1990   91     92     93     94     95     Compound Cadcam (dollars bn)                                             growth  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All applications all platforms        14.36  15.79  17.95  20.03  22.36  24.96   12% Hardware              7.96   8.50   9.63  10.45  11.41  12.39    9% Software              4.07   7.42   5.44   6.35   7.33   8.49   16% Services              2.33   2.57   2.88   3.23   3.62   4.08   12%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Dataquest  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Ex-director moves to oust Hoskins chairman MR DENNIS Bailey, a former non-executive director of Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer, will today call on shareholders to support moves to oust Mr Barrie Hoar, the company's chairman, and his brother, Mr Robert Hoar, from the board. Resolutions to remove the brothers have been tabled for an extraordinary meeting on November 18. Mr Richard Cattermole, chairman of Ryan Elizabeth, a pubs and hotels operator, and a Hoskins shareholder, and his associate, Mr Jeremy Lea, are seeking election in their place. In a letter to shareholders today, Mr Bailey, who has an 8 per cent stake in the company, says: 'If the resolutions fall, I fear that our investment will be at further risk and the share price may fall again.' Hoskins' profits record and lack of dividends had demonstrated that the Hoar brothers had not been competent managers, Mr Bailey says. 'It is time for change.' In his letter, Mr Bailey says Mr Barrie Hoar was 'running Hoskins as if it were a family business and not a public company'. He adds that 'a misleading and false impression' of his own role at Hoskins was given by Mr Hoar in a letter to shareholders last month. He denies taking any active part in deals involving the acquisition of Netherton Ales, and of Tatlocks, a catering company, both of which resulted in losses, or of proposing the acquisition of Edencorp Leisure, now in compulsory liquidation. In each case, Hoskins had been independently advised, Mr Bailey says. 'It is in my view fair to say that in reality most decisions, both major and minor, affecting Hoskins appear to be made by Mr Barrie Hoar and Mr Robert Hoar,' he adds. Mr Bailey says he resigned from Hoskins a year ago after a series of differences with the Hoar brothers over their business conduct.</p>

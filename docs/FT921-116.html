			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / NatWest chief steps down to work with DTI probe NATIONAL Westminster Bank announced yesterday that Mr Tom Frost had stepped down as chief executive so he could give 'sufficient time to the investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry' into the Blue Arrow affair. Mr Frost was replaced by Mr Derek Wanless, who at 44 is the youngest chief executive of NatWest, which is the second-biggest UK bank on most measures. Mr Frost will remain with the bank as a deputy chairman. The replacement of Mr Frost came only a fortnight after NatWest said that any suggestion Mr Frost should stand down during the DTI inquiry was 'complete nonsense'. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, yesterday said he and Mr Frost had decided the management changes were necessary after their legal adviser, Mr Nick Wilson, had told them that Mr Frost was likely to be very occupied over the coming months with answering DTI inspectors' questions. On March 12, the DTI said it was taking the unusual step of re-opening its inquiry into the Pounds 837m rights issue in Blue Arrow, the employment agency, in 1987. The focus of both the original inquiry and the new one is how NatWest failed to disclose for several months that it had acquired a substantial exposure to Blue Arrow's shares through the rights issue, even though in normal circumstances its exposure should have been disclosed to the Stock Exchange. Lord Alexander had written to Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, on March 9 asking him to reopen the inquiry. He did this after allegations were made - during last year's Blue Arrow trial and in the press - that Mr Frost had misled the DTI inspectors during the original investigation about his own role in the affair. At the time, Lord Alexander said he was asking for the inquiry to be re-opened so that Mr Frost's name could be cleared. When the DTI duly re-opened the investigation, NatWest implied that this was in response to Lord Alexander's request. However, Lord Alexander said yesterday that he thought the DTI might have already been preparing to launch a new inquiry when he wrote the letter. 'The speed of their response tends to support that view,' he said. Lord Alexander stressed that he had not been contacted by 'a single shareholder' demanding management changes in the wake of the new Blue Arrow allegations. A leading investment institution, with a substantial shareholding in NatWest, said yesterday that the position of deputy chairman was 'important' and that it wanted NatWest to explain why Mr Frost had been given this position. Mr Wanless said that as new chief executive he would continue to follow the strategy set by NatWest's board. In 1991, NatWest made pre-tax profits of Pounds 110m, which was its lowest level of profit since 1975. In the previous year, it had made Pounds 504m before tax.

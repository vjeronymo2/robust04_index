Two voluminous documents, which  analyze in detail the situation in Russian science: the ``Base  Report'' (more than 200 pages of text), which was prepared by an  expert group of the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy of  Russia, and the conclusion based on it--what is called the  ``Evaluation Report'' (67 pages of text), which was written by  experts of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD)--were discussed.    The OECD traces its history back to 1948--the organization  was established for the purpose of restoring the war-ravaged  European economy on the basis of the Marshall Plan. Today the 24  most industrially developed countries of the world are the  members of the OECD. More than 20 committees belong to the  structure of the organization. An expert group of one of  them--the Committee for Scientific and Technical  Policy--performed to the order of Russia much evaluation work.    In the summer of last year the Ministry of Science and  Technology Policy addressed to the OECD the request to conduct a  survey. The examination was necessary for the objective  distribution of western financial aid and adjustments of the  scientific and technical policy of Russia.    According to the assessment, which Minister of Science Boris  Saltykov gave at a press conference, the conclusions of the  examination of the OECD for the most part confirmed the  correctness of the policy being pursued by his department, the  ``Evaluation Report'' does not contain any particular surprises  for him, while many of the recommendations of the OECD have  already begun to be used in practice. ``The process is even more  important than the result'' is how the minister expressed  himself.    Thus, what are the basic recommendations of the examination  of the OECD and how did the participants in the representative  world scientific forum (in addition to Russian specialists  delegations of 19 OECD member countries and eight international  organizations participated in the conference) appraise them? For  precisely these recommendations will be of fundamental  importance for western foundations, banks, financial groups, and  firms when implementing various projects for the support of  Russian science.    The first thesis that is heard persistently in the  ``Evaluation Report'' is that the scientific potential of Russia  is its second national wealth after raw material resources. But  the structure of science is extremely distorted and  ``excessively overweighted'' by the defense, space, nuclear, and  machine building complex. This structure is absolutely  unsuitable for a market economy, and for this reason the OECD's  examination concludes that the decrease of the number of people  employed in science and scientific service by two-thirds is  inevitable. Calculating the real possibilities of Russia in the  maintenance of scientific personnel, the report names 300,000  people. OECD experts recommend reductions first of all at the  expense of technical and administrative personnel, as well as  inefficient sectorial science.    The Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Technology  Policy did not agree that there are still too many scientific  personnel in Russia, and specified its policy in the following  thesis:    ``To halt the further destruction of the scientific  potential, to cultivate new structures alongside old ones.''  However, here it was admitted that sectorial science needs  significant institutional reorganization and market  reorientation.    This evaluation was confirmed by data of Russian  specialists.  Thus, the following facts from the ``Base Report'' were cited in  the statement of Nadezhda Gaponenko, chief of the department of  scientific policy and forecasting of the Center of Research and  Statistics of Science: No more than 10 percent of sectorial  science is capable of working at the world level, no more than 5  percent of the assets being invested in it lead to the  development of innovative technologies. At the same time  sectorial scientific research institutes in the number of  personnel and expenditures make up more than 70 percent of the  entire research infrastructure.    The second most important thesis of the ``Evaluation  Report''  is that the mechanism of the management of science, which exists  in Russia, is inefficient due to the lack of unified monitoring  of the distribution of budget allocations. The OECD experts gave  a negative assessment to the removal from the Ministry of  Science and Technology Policy of the functions of the  supervision of the higher school, which took place at the  beginning of 1993, and to the removal of Boris Saltykov from the  post of vice premier. Representatives of the Ministry of Science  and Technology Policy also acknowledged this, having spoken  about the return in 1993 to the old system of the formation of  the budget of science, in case of which the Ministry of Defense,  the Ministry of Atomic Energy, the Russian Space Agency, the  State Committee for Industrial Policy, the RAS [Russian Academy  of Sciences], and so on determine a large portion of it. Under  the conditions, when the Ministry of Science and Technology  Policy actually controls only a small portion of the budget of  civilian science, the monitoring of the effectiveness of the use  of assets is impossible. Consequently, as compared with 1992,  when the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy controlled  the science budget entirely, the chances of Russia to attract  western investments to this sphere have worsened significantly.    Estimating the amounts of foreign investments in Russian  science, the report names a figure of $500 million (of it  approximately half is along the lines of state programs, the  other half is investments of private firms). The OECD experts  rate very pessimistically the prospects of subsequent private  investments in this sphere: ``Russian scientific organizations  understand cooperation as an exercise in the obtaining of aid  that is intended for the maintenance of the existing structure  of science, while private business of the OECD countries is  seeking projects that are of mutual interest.'' So that the  report recommends that the directors of scientific research  institutes (and first of all sectorial scientific research  institutes) seek financing from their colleagues in domestic  industry. For the present the OECD experts have estimated the  contribution of industry to the financing of research and  development in the total amount of expenditures at less than 5  percent. Such a situation, in their opinion, is irrational and  inefficient. In no country of the world will the state budget be  able to provide all scientific and technical financing.    At the same time there are areas that were rated at  top-priority ones for western financing. First of all these are  the acquisition of foreign scientific literature and the  subscription to journals. The report states indignantly that  instead of the allocation of $12 million for subscription in  currency, which were envisaged by the 1992 budget, the libraries  of the RAS received from the USSR Academy of Sciences an  ``heir's debt'' of $175 million.    Other priority spheres are aid to Russian scientific centers  with instruments and equipment, materials and agents for  experiments and the establishment of telecommunications systems.  The state of the scientific museums and libraries of Russia with  unique collections aroused particular concern of the OECD  experts--their affairs are so deplorable that the report demands  the quickest financial aid for urgent rescue measures.    In evaluating the programs of aid to Russian basic science,  the report dwells first of all on the successes of the Soros  Foundation, which is distributing $100 million among 25,000  selected scientists. According to the estimates of the OECD  experts, western investments already come to about 30 percent of  all Russian funds for science, including its military sector,  which is an exceptionally important lever of influence on  research themes.    The OECD experts do not dramatize the problem of the ``brain  drain,'' estimating its scale by the figure of on the order of  30,000 specialists--this is 10-15 percent of the total losses  that have been incurred by the sphere of science in the last  three years. For the solution of the problem the ``Evaluation  Report'' recommends summer seminars of young scientists and  programs of the practical training of thoae with undergraduate  degrees and graduate students at western scientific centers. The  experts believe that given guarantees of regular trips abroad,  talented Russian scientists will remain in the country and will  acquire enormous psychological support, while constantly working  together with western colleagues.    The report rates very critically the situation in the area  of  the social sciences, not seeing prospects of a demand for social  scientists either in Russia or in the West. The OECD experts  believe that the social scientists, who received training in the  USSR, were simply deprived completely of humanities knowledge in  its worldwide understanding, and only a few are capable of  adaptation.    The innovation part of both the ``Base Report'' and the  ``Evaluation Report'' is most poorly developed, which was  repeatedly noted by the speakers: Mikhail Tsimbalov, chief of an  administration of the Committee for Patents and Trademarks,  Dmitriy Piskunov, director of the analytical center of the  Ministry of Science and Technology Policy, and others. This lack  of development is connected in many respects with the lack of  the necessary statistical data on the sphere of innovative  activity, about which Prof. Yuriy Yakovets, head of a chair of  the Academy of the National Economy, spoke bitterly.    As a whole the report notes that, in spite of the  introduction of a package of laws on the protection of  intellectual and industrial property, in Russia the questions of  the reliable protection of the rights of patentees have not been  settled, thus far the Patent Court has not been set up. The OECD  experts note that the resources and finances, which are being  allotted from the budget of the Committee for Patents and  Trademarks, are obviously inadequate for the accomplishment of  urgent tasks and the bringing of the new Russian patent system  ``out of its infancy.''    Among the other obviously undeveloped items of the technical  policy of Russia the OECD experts noted the uncontrolled  destruction of such most important units of the scientific and  technical infrastructure as the system of certification,  standardization, and scientific and technical information. The  process of the privatization of institutions of the scientific  sphere, according to the data of the ``Base Report,'' is at the  initial stage--37 scientific organizations have been privatized.  In the opinion of the experts of both Russia and the OECD,  people are continuing, alas, to carry over mechanically the  forms and methods of privatization from the sphere of physical  production to privatization in science. The procedural questions  of the evaluation of intellectual property in the process of  privatization have also not been settled. The ``Evaluation  Report'' demands that Russia establish precise norms--what can  be privatized in the scientific sphere and what is ``inalienable  public wealth'' that is not liable to privatization.    In evaluating as a whole the recommendations and conclusions  of the OECD experts, it is merely possible to state that Russian  science (with the exception of individual most advanced areas of  basic research) can hardly count on major western investments,  particularly from the private sector. I am certain that the main  benefit of the performed expert work for the team of first-class  professionals, which the leadership of the Ministry of Science  and Technology Policy is forming around itself today, also  consists precisely in this. At any rate, Minister Boris Saltykov  stated firmly and unequivocally: ``The recommendations of the  OECD are very useful, but we are obliged to form our own  scientific and technical policy.''</p>

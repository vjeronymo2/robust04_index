			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Veslo report under the "Cadres" rubric: "Yeltsin </F> Has Been Asked To Disclose Agents"]    [Text] Forty-eight Radio Liberty employees are waiting for  President Yeltsin to answer a letter they sent from Munich. The  letter was delivered through registered mail to the address:  Sergey Filatov, c/o the President, Moscow, the Kremlin.  Therefore, one would have thought, it is at the disposal of  Boris Yeltsin's staff.    This missive is an open letter, that is to say it is  intended  for public consumption. Which is why we feel free to disclose  its contents. Having reminded the president that in August 1991  he lauded "Liberty," several of its employees complained that  this radio station "has been in past years one of the targets of  the KGB," which had infiltrated its agents there. They asked  Boris Yeltsin to emulate Vaclav Havel who "has submitted  information on the agents who worked at one time or who still  continue to work for the Czechoslovak service," and "to  declassify the list of KGB agents infiltrated (or recruited) in  Radio Liberty.    One can appreciate the radio station's employees' anxiety --  that any of their colleagues may turn out to be a secret enemy.  Among those who signed the letter, there are not many names  known to listeners -- but then this too is understandable  because an average employee is often in no position to see who  is who, and some help from the president of Russia, who is known  for his ability to work in the realm of personnel, could be  useful to such an employee.    In the meantime, according to some information, the staff of  the radio station financed by the U.S. Congress may be cut,  especially in the process of the possible move of its  headquarters from Munich to Prague. Most certainly, when  personnel cuts are inevitable, employees not too certain of  their future cannot but do their best to show their political  loyalty while at the same time fingering those bosses who should  be fired in their stead.    Incidentally, some sources report that being discussed in  Moscow is the following version of a reply to the letter -- to  propose to President Clinton to declassify the lists of CIA  agents at Radio Liberty, first in order to compare them with the  Russian list, and second in order that the radio station's  chiefs could see who of their employees are regarded by special  services as pros.</p>

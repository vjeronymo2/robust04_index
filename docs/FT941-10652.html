			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead and nickel remain in surplus Net imports from the former eastern bloc countries helped to keep the western lead and nickel markets in supply surpluses last year, though at reduced levels. Imports of eastern-bloc nickel reached a record 135,000 tonnes, representing more than 20 per cent of western consumption, according to statistics from the International Nickel Study Group. That reversed 1992's deline from 128,000 tonnes to 121,000. In spite of the resurgence of exports from the former eastern block the nickel market's supply surplus fell from 70,000 to 39,000 tonnes, the study group estimates. This was because consumption in the west rose by nearly 4 per cent, from 627,000 to 652,000 tonnes, while western producers cut back output by 3.5 per cent, from 576,000 to 556,000 tonnes. Western nickel mine output last year was down 4 per cent, from 613,700 to 588,700 tonnes, the study group reports. Meanwhile, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group estimates that lead mine output in the western world dropped in 1993 to its lowest level in 30 years. Canada bore the brunt of the cuts and the suspension of production at Curragh Resources' Yukon mines contributed to a drop of 47 per cent in that country's lead mine output. Western lead mine production totalled 2.034m tonnes last year, a fall of 265,000 tonnes or 11.5 per cent from 1992. The study group says the fall in mine output caused absorption of some of the very large surplus stocks of lead concentrate (an intermediate material) that accumulated in 1990 and 1991. This is expected to influence trade patterns with eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union this year, reducing the flow of concentrate for toll smelting in those regions. Last year net imports of refined lead from the former eastern bloc countries slipped from 169,000 to 135,000 tonnes, helping to cut the west's supply surplus from 154,000 tonnes to 84,000 tonnes. The western lead industry compensated for eastern imports by cutting back refined metal output, by 1 per cent to 4.397m tonnes. Meanwhile, consumption moved up by 0.6 per cent to 4.483m tonnes. Stocks rose by 61,000 tonnes to 653,000 tonnes by the year-end, equivalent to 7.6 weeks' consumption.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Pension tax relief proposals rejected The government has rejected a former Treasury minister's proposals for raising an extra Pounds 7bn a year by changing the way pensions are taxed. The proposal - by Mr John Maples, a former economic secretary to the Treasury - was that tax relief be removed from pension contributions, while pension payments should be exempt from tax. Ministers have ruled out incorporating such a change in next week's Budget. Their decision is thought to reflect expected difficulties in selling the idea to voters and overcoming resistance from the pensions industry. Implementing the proposed change would be worth Pounds 7bn a year to the exchequer on the basis of a 25 per cent tax charge. Mr Maples has argued that the incomes of both employers and employees after tax would be unaffected. When the idea was put forward this month, Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, predicted an angry response from pensioners and pension scheme members. 'Could we trust future governments to resist the temptation to reintroduce tax on pensions payments?', Mr Amy asked in a letter to the Financial Times. He said the effect of Mr Maples's suggestion would be to take Pounds 100bn from Britain's pension funds. Mr Maples has acknowledged that the transition to his suggested arrangement would be complex but he believes that technical objections could be overcome.</p>

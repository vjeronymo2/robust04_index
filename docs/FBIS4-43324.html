			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "OECD: EU Single Currency All or </F> Nothing"]    [Text] (ANSA) Paris, June 8 -- "Either everyone or nothing"  must be the rule for the creation of a single European currency,  Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said here today on the  fringe of the OECD ministerial meeting.    "I think the single currency is a problem that must be  treated as indivisible," said Martino, an economist by trade, of  ideas that the currency could be introduced for some European  Union [EU] countries before others. "Either it's single, or  it's not."    Martino was speaking on the eve of a visit to Rome by a  European Commission delegation with the task of reporting on  Italian progress towards the targets set for launching the  single currency.    According to Martino, whose views are generally strongly  free-market, setting domestic finances to right is "obviously  necessary and desirable," but he claimed it was a problem apart  from the single currency.    "I don't believe in gradualism, which can be applied to  divisible problems such as tariffs. These can be reduced  gradually," he asserted. "In my view, the monetary crisis in  September 1992 confirms the validity of the idea. You can't  achieve a single currency by freezing exchange rates; it's  unsatisfactory. My idea is that all those who are in the EU  should be in (the single currency)."    Martino also said he does not agree with the idea that  enlarging the EU may prove a hurdle to extending its political  integration: "But if that were true, I think it is a price that  would be worth paying."    On Italy's economic prospects, Martino said he sees "serious  indications" of recovery and would expect effective government  to be able to boost it without creating inflation.    He also claimed that Berlusconi found the public deficit in  worse shape than expected, though he admitted that, in 1993,  while the public debt had risen to 119.5 percent of gross  domestic product, the public deficit was less than 10 percent  and dropped about half a percent last year. "There is movement  in the right direction," he commented.    According to Martino, the terms of the debate at the OECD  seem to have changed, from considering employment in  macroeconomic terms to a microeconomic approach. He also said  that employment will be a major point on the agenda at the Group  of Seven summit in Naples in July.    In other points, Martino said that, in the next few days,  the  Italian Government would make a linked series of proposals "to  be discussed with our allies" on who should get which jobs at  the summit of a series of international organisations. Due to a  series of changes of the guard, the top jobs are becoming  available at the European Commission, the OECD, GATT, or rather  the World Trade Organisation that is to succeed it, and the  Western European Union. The appointments should be considered  "as a whole, not one name at a time," said Martino.    On the fringe of the OECD meeting, Martino met European  Commission Deputy President, Sir Leon Brittan, one of the  candidates to succeed Jacques Delors as the Commission's  presidency.</p>

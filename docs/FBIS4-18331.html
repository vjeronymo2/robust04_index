			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Schwartzbrod: "Francois Leotard Calls </F> On Arms Industry"]    [Excerpts] Convened at lunchtime yesterday by Defense  Minister Francois Leotard and General Arms Delegate Henri Conze,  French arms manufacturers were treated to a lecture on  cost-effectiveness. This lecture should be followed in the  coming weeks by a series of private lessons destined to examine  with a fine-tooth comb each program included in the military  programming law for 1995-2000.    There were a dozen people around the table, representing the  major contractors and the professional unions: Louis Gallois  (Aerospatiale), Serge Dassault (Dassault Aviation and GIFAS  [Associaton of French Aerospace Manufacturers]; Alain Gomez  (Thomson-CSF), Noel Forgeard (Matra Defense), Jean-Francois  Bigay (Eurocopter), Emile Blanc (SNPE [National Powders and  Explosives Company] and GIAT [Industrial Group for Ground  Weapons] Industrie; Jean Climaud (SPER [Professional Association  of Electronic and Radioelectric Industries]); Jean-Claude  Albrecht (Giat Industries), Herve Cheneau (Directorate of Naval  Constructions), and Herve Ardity (of the Richelieu Committee of  small- and mid-sized companies). [passage omitted]    The industrial representatives yesterday were all given the  opportunity to air their views on the subject and to explain  their working methods. They agreed that a decree should be  passed obliging them to work together to a greater extent , to  avoid overlap, and therefore that they should work more closely  with the military chiefs of staff. Most of them reiterated the  need for orders covering several years at a time. For his part,  the general arms delegate asked the primary contractors to avoid  taking responsibility away from their subcontractors or imposing  cost cutting on them, in order to preserve the fabric of small-  and medium-sized companies.    The discussion, started yesterday by the Defense Ministry,  will continue at a swift pace and should result in the unveiling  of a number of measures by the summer. In the meantime, unless  there is a last-minute change of plan, the military programming  law should be submitted to the president of the Republic at next  week's Defense Council meeting, before being put before the  cabinet on 20 April and presented for parliamentary debate at  the end of May.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 17 (CTK) -- The Slovak National  Party (SNS) is returning to its original national principles  because the young Slovak Republic is a thorn in the flesh of  certain foreign forces and Slovaks nostalgic for the federation,  Party Chairman Jan Slota tells today's edition of SLOVENSKA  REPUBLIKA, close to ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar.    Although entering the elections independently the SNS will  still "cooperate closely" with Meciar's Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slota says. "We decided on  independent candidacy in the elections because with joint  candidacy our party would lose its identity." "In every nation  state a real political force should exist that protects the  interests of the nation. In the case of Slovakia it is the  SNS," he tells the paper.    Slota says he is disturbed by the attempts of Hungarian  politicians to declare the Hungarian minority living in Slovakia  to be part of the Hungarian nation. "From the SNS point of view  we can only talk of Slovaks who speak Hungarian," he says.    Accordingly the party intends to defend the Slovaks living  in  the south, where Hungarians form a majority: pushing for a law  protecting Slovak as the main language in all schools, armed  services, in the population register and other documents. They  also vow to reject an ethnic conception in the envisaged  reorganization of local government.    Speaking of SNS rivals in the run-up to the elections (to be  held on September 30-October 1), Slota denounces parties of the  right as being either manifestly pro-Czech or mere vehicles for  the "personal ambition of bankrupt turncoats from the SNS and  HZDS." The latter, however, will not be able to form a  coalition because "they lack unified political foundations, even  though many have shown that, enticed by a vision of personal  gain, they are capable of selling out." He says the SNS is  united and dismisses rumors he might be ousted from the position  of chairman as disinformation.</p>

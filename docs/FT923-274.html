			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Airline turbulence There is a clear lesson in the plight of Dan-Air for would-be liberalisers of Europe's aviation industry. Here, after all, was a relatively low cost airline which ought to have been a model beneficiary of the open skies policy pursued by Brussels in recent years. Instead its parent company, Davies &amp; Newman, now finds itself in apparently life and death talks with Virgin Atlantic. The reason is largely the dire economic climate and delayed hopes for economic recovery. But Dan-Air's failure to gather momentum as a scheduled carrier highlights the difficulty of breaking into markets dominated by the big national flag carriers. The reality is that BA's hold over slots at Heathrow has provided it with an inestimable advantage in developing its European network. Gatwick has its attractions - and Dan-Air has made an impact with its service - but what the business traveller most wants these days is not so much an extra half bottle of champagne as the flexibility to change his plans. As a hub airport Heathrow has this critical mass - a point which Virgin well understands and which lies behind its growing efforts to expand international services from there. For this reason the flirtation with Dan-Air seems a bit odd. The rationale, though, may lie more in providing Dan-Air flights with customers booked through Virgin Holidays, while the limited opportunities for passengers to switch airlines may explain why Mr Branson apparently does not want to put up much cash, and is not interested in a merger. BA will be a more than interested bystander - not least because Dan-Air's assets include several slots at Heathrow. But perhaps BAA is more concerned. Stansted is one problem, but it would hardly do if one of its biggest customers at Gatwick was allowed to go to the wall.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lately we have been celebrating one holiday after  another, but the complex political situation in Russia and the  numerous uncertainties over how the Federal Assembly and State  Duma will operate are preoccupying us very much. At the moment  all parties and associations are declaring their positions and  suggesting ways of making the work of the legislative body more  constructive before the day the Federal Assembly holds its first  sitting. We share these hopes too. This is what was discussed  today at a press conference held by the leaders of the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord. The press conference was attended by  Olga Vasilenko.    She will tell us about the position held by this party,  whose  leader is Sergey Shakhray. Over to you.    [Vasilenko] The aim of this party's deputies is to revive  confidence in parliament, in the law, and to prevent a  repetition of the confrontation between the legislative and  executive branches. The State Duma's work must be based on  equality of all its deputies, regardless of how they were  elected -- from party lists or single- seat constituencies. In  this connection, the representatives of the Party of Russian  Unity and Accord believe that one of the speaker's deputies --  of whom there should be no more than two -- must definitely be  nominated from deputies who were elected from single- seat  constituencies. Furthermore, there should be a separate vote on  each candidate, not on a package as is being proposed at the  moment -- and the votes must be secret.    The party announces that it is urgently requesting all  deputies to agree that there should be no live relays from  sessions of the State Duma. This is because there is a tendency  for certain personalities to show off before the country  whenever they are at the microphone and this undermines the  parliament's professional reputation. All these points are made  in the party's statement.    Journalists were also given a list of certain legislative  initiatives which the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, as this  party is known for short, is proposing. I wish to draw your  attention to the fact that this party proposes that there should  be a law on state support for the periodical press. As you  know, this has now become a very pressing subject. It is also  proposing a draft treaty on a confederation of states belonging  to the CIS.    Among the answers to questions raised by journalists I think  it would interesting to hear what Shakhray, who is currently a  member of the government, had to say about his personal future  and about his relationship with the president in this respect.  Here is what he said.    [Begin recording] [Shakhray] However the question is  decided,  I consider the question of Shakhray's personal membership or  non- membership of the government as a political side issue.  Irrespective of how this question is decided, I shall not get  hysterical or start shouting anything against the president or  the government. Unfortunately I know this kitchen too well to  behave in such a childish way.    [Vasilenko] Sergey Mikhaylovich, what do you think the  Duma's  first day will be like?    [Shakhray] I think the first day will be quite a calm one.    [Vasilenko] In spite of the pronouncements by certain  politicians and deputies who are saying that all sorts of  commissions of inquiry should be set up?    [Shakhray] Commissions will be set up. However, one should  remember that the new Constitution does not allocate parliament  any supervisory functions. So, these will be commissions for  the preparation of parliamentary hearings on various questions,  on parliament's rights. I have no doubt that there will be very  many of these commissions on parliamentary hearings.    [Vasilenko] You spoke of your intention to stand for the  Duma chairmanship.    [Shakhray] I rated my chances as 50-50. Remember that  seven of the eight leaders of political associations --  Zhirinovskiy, Gaydar, Yavlinskiy and the others [chuckles] --  have agreed that Shakhray should not be allowed to become  speaker. This reduces my chances, of course, but I don't think  it ends them altogether, because work is continuing. I am ready  to discuss this question, the question of my speakership, as a  package with all deputies' associations, including political,  territorial, and independent ones, and to seek a solution. [end  recording]    There was a question about criticism of Shakhray for running  a separate election campaign from Russia's Choice. Here is what  Sergey Mikhaylovich thinks about this.    [Begin Shakhray recording] There are two reasons for the  percentage won by Russia's Choice. The first reason is the  shock economic policy which created the social base for  Zhirinovskiy and his ilk. The second reason is the  unprofessional work with the mass media during the preparatory  campaign. All other political associations -- those of  Shakhray, Yavlinskiy, and some others -- were denied access.  Only three of them -- Russia's Choice, the Communists, and  Zhirinovskiy -- were allowed screen time. Furthermore, they  tried to use the Communists and Zhirinovskiy as a means of  intimidating the electorate, by showing them how bad the  alternative to themselves would be. But this attempt to  discredit them did not work. It only succeeded in giving them  more publicity. [end recording]    Naturally the journalists asked how the votes would be  apportioned in the State Duma.    [Begin Shakhray recording] I think all coalitions in the  Duma will be formed in accordance with each specific question  being debated. For better or for worse, there won't be any  formally organized, block-voting coalitions in the Duma. But,  whenever these questions have come up, I have always called on  people to make a comparison between the present corps of  deputies, with all its shortcomings, and the corps of deputies  in the former Russian Supreme Soviet. According to Vorotnikov,  who was leader of the Russian Federation during that period,  democrats had 22 percent of the seats in that parliament. Now  there are more of them, although they are still less than half.  [chuckles] In other words, some progress has been made, in  spite of everything. [end recording]    To conclude, let me say that Sergey Shakhray was, as always,  calm, confident, laconic and -- judging by everything -- very  constructively disposed towards his return to legislative work.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / OFT attacks copier industry over selling 'malpractices' Unscrupulous selling practices in the UK photocopier industry were condemned yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading after a 17-month investigation. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said the investigation had 'revealed an extraordinary variety of malpractices and excesses'. But he has decided against immediate legislation to clean up the industry, calling instead for greater transparency in photocopier contracts. Business was partly to blame for allowing malpractices to flourish by failing to shop around or recognise the importance of photocopier contracts, he said. The industry had made progress through trade associations towards reducing unacceptable selling practices and deserved the opportunity to show self-regulation could work. He warned that if progress was not maintained he would use his powers to revoke consumer credit licences and could refer the supply of photocopiers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The decision to give self-regulation a chance was welcomed by the Finance &amp; Leasing Association and the Photocopier Suppliers Association, both of which have produced guidelines. The Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts criticised the OFT report for its 'lack of sanctions in dealing with clearly identified problems'. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said he would table a Commons motion calling for legislation to compensate the thousands who had been duped by unscrupulous photocopier and leasing companies. The most common problems identified by the OFT were: contract periods much longer than the lives of equipment; obscure and steep escalations of service charges; and costly settlement terms - not disclosed in advance - when a business wanted to end a contract early. Sir Bryan said lease and service-inclusive, cost-per-copy, contracts with an obligation to pay for a minimum volume of usage, had caused particular problems. Some customers found themselves facing unavoidable escalating service charges. The director-general said he would carry out a further review early next year. In the meantime he wanted to see a number of improvements in practices. Settlements should reflect only losses suffered by the leasing company or dealer from early termination of the contract. Trade associations should also discourage lease and service-inclusive cost-per-copy contracts. Tighter control urged, Page 12 Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

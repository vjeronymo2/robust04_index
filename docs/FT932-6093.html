			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Driver, make my day - The highway perils faced by those who flaunt their wealth THE MOTOR CAR can be a great leveller. You might be a multi-millionaire driving a muscle-bound bauble like the 215 mph (346 kph) Jaguar XJ-220. Or you could be one of the long-term unemployed in a rusty Lada worth less than the price of dinner for two in a good restaurant. In the eyes of the law, however, you are equal. Neither of you can exceed 81 mph (130 kph) legally anywhere in Europe except on the less-crowded stretches of German autobahns. Even there, really high speeds are frowned upon by the police and the insurance companies. Should you be one of the seriously rich, therefore, pause for thought before writing a cheque for a Pounds 415,000 Jaguar, Pounds 343,100 Bugatti EB110, Pounds 177,600 Aston Martin Vantage or Pounds 161,563 Bentley Continental R. Bear in mind that while a parcel delivery driver in an Astra diesel van might get away with 95-100 mph (153-161 kph) on British motorways, your Bentley or Bugatti, Aston Martin or Jaguar will stand out like sore thumb. Don't forget, either, that pinching the seriously-rich owner of a car which is travelling at 120 mph and costs more than he will earn in the next 10 years will make any police patrolman's day. So, we have a problem. Having invested in a car that has been built expensively to be driven safely at between two and three times the legal speed limit, what do we do with it? Take it to Germany? Well, yes; but, often, the only difference between very fast driving on a British motorway and a German autobahn is that in the UK you risk losing your licence and there you will not. Autobahn traffic can be dense. And do not run away with the idea that every driver keeps an eye open permanently for high-speed overtakers and observes lane discipline meticulously. They did years ago - but not any more. The only way you can be sure of letting your 180 mph (290 kmh) speedster off the leash without blue lights flashing is to join the 96 Club (telephone 071-584 9536 or fax 071-581 9429 for details). It rents racing circuits to which members drive or trailer their super-cars and spend an agreeable day wearing out tyres at Pounds 1,000 a set. But what, you might ask, of the hardware of mega-money motoring? One's thoughts turn instinctively to Rolls-Royce because, if any motor car personifies conspicuous consumption, it is a Royce. (Never, please, a Roller; that is like asking the butler the way to the toilet). A Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit II just scrapes under the Pounds 100,000, key-in-hand price barrier and a Bentley Brooklands (the marque's best buy, should you be interested) is about Pounds 10,000 less. The really smart Rolls-Royce product in which to be seen is the Bentley Continental R (say, Pounds 163,000 on the road). Underneath its sleeker coupe body, it is a Bentley Turbo R with a V8 engine of some antiquity, 6.75 litres capacity and undisclosed power ('sufficient' is all RR says, but it must be around 320 bbp). The Continental R and Turbo R saloon leap away from the peasantry at the lights and swoosh along very swiftly indeed in near silence. One would hardly call them an enthusiast's drive, but they combine performance and sheer gravitas like nothing else. For mood music, Rolls-Royce should deliver these jet-propelled Pullman carriages with an endless supply of Elgar CDs. A Rolls-Royce looks quite cheap against an Aston Martin Vantage (close to Pounds 180,000 key-in-hand) which also draws its power from a large and elderly V8. For a two-seater (a four-seater only if your passengers are contortionists), it is wide and unreasonably heavy. I find the V8 Aston Martins elephantine - but there is no denying they are quick. A 186 mph (300 kph) maximum is claimed, although no one says where. That archetypical rich man's sports car, the Ferrari 512 (12-cylinder, five-litre, 422 horsepower boxer-motor) is as embarrassingly obese as an Aston Martin on the road. On a private track, though, you see where the money (say Pounds 127,000) has gone. As you hurtle into corners, you marvel at its grippy nimbleness and forget about such aggravations as a gear lever that grates every time you shift. Ferrari claims 195 mph (314 kph) for the 512. I am sure it is right - providing you gain access to the Nardo proving ground or buy 100 tickets for the politzia ball before venturing on to a deserted autostrada at 4 am on a summer day. The latest monster supercar, the Bugatti EB110, boasts 12 cylinders and four turbo-chargers. It puts 553 horsepower on the road through all four wheels and is alleged to be good for 209 mph (336 kph). I have not tried it, but I did drive three laps of the Salzburgerring circuit in a rather care-worn Jaguar XJ-220 last summer. This is a car in which I would not wish my worst enemy to find himself in a long motorway tailback. The interior is cramped and one would steer it by dead reckoning in town, although it looks rather beautiful and its Pounds 415,000 price tag says a lot about one's personal finances. Originally, it was to have been a V12 with four-wheel drive. It appeared with a V6 engine (which sounds like a cement mixer at low speeds) and two-wheel drive. When Jaguar announced it was going to limit production of the XJ-220 to 350, a lot of punters rushed to put down a Pounds 50,000 deposit. They expected to sell-on their vehicles at a profit and the last thing many wanted was actually to take delivery. Now, a row is in progress between Jaguar, which insists on the contracts being completed, and the recession-hit punters, who will not (for which one might read cannot) come up with the other Pounds 365,000. If you expect your money to buy a high-tech as well as a high-class motor, a V12-engined Mercedes-Benz 600SEL saloon, 600SEC coupe or 600SL convertible is the car to go for. They are built like battleships but, despite their considerable bulk and weight, handle like torpedo boats. In a 600SEL, you are insulated from the outside world by double glazing. Four drop-down vanity mirrors let your passengers apply the finishing touches en route to the palace. The SEC is much the same car although with only two doors; the SL is the ultimate two-seat (well, just two-plus-two) convertible with a soft top. Should you be careless enough to upturn one, a passenger-protecting roll bar deploys in milliseconds. The day of the ultra-costly, ultra-high performing car might well be drawing to a close. For shortish journeys, a helicopter is much quicker than any car and, for long journeys, a private jet will go further in two hours than a Ferrari in 24. Besides which, neither chopper nor Learjet is ever likely to suffer severe damage from a member of the lumpen proletariat armed with a screwdriver.</p>

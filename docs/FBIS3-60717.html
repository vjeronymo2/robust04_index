			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colonel Valeriy Izmalkov, member of the legislative  commission for defense and state security, described as  absolutely ungrounded reports published by THE WASHINGTON POST  that Ukraine will soon decipher the operational codes of nuclear  missiles stationed on its territory. The newspaper cited U.S.  and Russian analysts. Valeriy Izmalkov stated that the nuclear  missile operational codes have a protection system that makes it  practically impossible to decipher. He underlined that the  missiles are launched based on space photographs and not  geographical maps. So retargeting the missiles would require  extremely complex calculations--something that only U.S. and  Russian general staffs are capable of doing. Ukraine is not  prepared for this. The deputy called the allegations about  Ukraine deciphering nuclear codes a small link in a big chain of  provocations against Ukraine. In this connection, Izmalkov also  mentioned energetic actions by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev  in Brussels, who resorted to aggressive pressure against Ukraine  and encouraged other states to do the same.</p>

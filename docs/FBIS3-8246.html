			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Canton"] </F>   [Text] Some people thought that they would not dare do it,  because it is equivalent to trampling upon the freedom of the  press. Some people thought that they do not want to do it. They  have done it. This is the biggest clear-up in the Radio since  1956. The MTI statement "Dismissals at the Hungarian Radio" in  which this was officially published, is a historical document of  this age. The statement formulated by Deputy Chairman Laszlo  Csucs is a rare example of cynicism and hypocrisy. He, who has  been working on, caressing, and polishing up the list of names  for weeks, knows very well how much truth is in this statement:  "The dismissals -- contrary to the published accusations --  were made on the basis of professional and ethical points of  view, rather than political ones." It is enough to examine the  list of names to understand what Csucs -- who with one stroke  "streamlined" and beheaded the "168 ora" program -- means by  professional and ethical viewpoints. Csucs's right to refer to  ethics is well shown by the fact that he justified the  "streamlining" by referring to the National Audit Office's [ASZ]  investigations. The only unpleasant factor is that the chairman  of the ASZ protests strongly against this.    A few weeks ago, Istvan Csurka's Hungarian Justice and Life  Party [MIEP] was ready to support Laszlo Csucs as a  parliamentary candidate. This was the only party he could  definitely rely on. Now it is much easier to understand the  reason: Csucs has indeed implemented Csurka's program in  Hungarian Radio. Presumably, others also encouraged him to do  this. Some people in the Hungarian Democratic Forum would like  nothing better than to build bridges toward the Hungarian Way  Circles, to "prove themselves," and to gain votes from Csurka's  supporters. It will be an expensive bridge but, cost what it  may, there are not any free votes left anywhere else.    The question, of course, is what the cabinet and the biggest  governing party say about the "slaughtering on Friday" [4  March]. So far -- unofficially -- we could hear that the prime  minister is unfortunately in a trap, because, although he could  relieve Csucs, what would come after that? The parties are  unable to agree on a successor.... And: Due to the  circumstances, the government is not responsible for Csucs's  actions. Naturally, it is conceivable that [Prime Minister]  Boross was serious about this. However, this will not improve  his position: Those people, who will demonstrate on the eve of  15 March [Hungarian National Day] -- which is also the day of  the freedom of the press -- people, who are justifiably  concerned about the cleanness of the elections, will not be  writing to Csucs. No one wants to correspond with Csucs, who  wanted to have the police remove his colleagues from the Radio  building in Sandor Brody street. It is a waste of stamps. The  addressee of the protest letters will be Peter Boross. There  will not be many people either in Hungary or abroad who will  believe that he and his colleagues -- the government members --  could not have done anything. Only to mention one factor, if  more than 100 million forints from the tight budget had not been  voted for partly financing severance pay then the dismissed  people could not have been sent away. Naturally, after all  this, we will not have a media law, and we fear that the  consensus on certain issues on which there was a hope for  reaching it, will also be endangered. If it has been difficult  to escape from the trap up to now, it is twice as difficult now:  It is a double trap.    Finally, Csucs's statement also contains the weighty  argument  that the "radio in Canton prepares seven programs with 600  employees for 60 million people." It will be interesting to  observe if the government that so steadfastly advocates joining  Europe will be able or willing to do anything to prevent the  complete cantonization of the public service media.</p>

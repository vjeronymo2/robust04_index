			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / India borrowing curb Indian officials yesterday signed an agreement to cap the government's borrowing from the country's central bank, aiming to curb public sector over-spending. The government is limiting itself to borrowing a maximum of Rs60bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, in the current financial year. It is also accepting a ceiling of Rs90bn on the net amount it can borrow for periods of over 10 days during the financial year. Similar ceilings are to be set in 1995-96 and 1996-97 after which the government will stop borrowing directly from the central bank and will raise funds from the markets.</p>

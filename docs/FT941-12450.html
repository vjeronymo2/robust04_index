			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Gardening: Bring on the predators - Country View The unlikely saviours of British cereal farming may be the humble beetles which prey on aphids, cereal's natural enemy. The traditional response to the threat of aphids has been spraying, usually two or three times a year and at enormous cost. But since 1984, British scientists have been testing ways of stimulating the population of natural predators, such as beetles, ladybirds, hoverflies and spiders. Up to 400 species of useful insect predators live in the hedgerows of southern England and research has been aimed at identifying which are the most useful, and how farmland can be managed in a way that benefits them. Time-lapse videos have shown how efficiently predators thin out pests, how far they forage, and so on. Long mounds called 'beetle banks' were built - higher and therefore drier than surrounding land, and if planted with beetle-friendly tussock grasses also warmer. From these hospitable surroundings, beetles make forays in summer to feed, roving up to 100 yards outwards. The Biology Department of Southampton University has been joined by scientists from the Game Conservancy, which is interested in beetles and natural predators as part of its crusade to dissuade farmers from using 'broad-spectum' insecticides which leave areas of land devoid of small creatures. Dr Nigel Boatman of the Game Conservancy says beetle banks make sound commercial sense. Against the savings on insecticides, he calculates that a beetle bank 400 yards long, big enough for a 50-acre field, would cost only Pounds 90 (a one-off figure which includes cultivation, seed, and an adjustment for loss of the crop in the strip). One must beware of over-simplification. 'Biological controls,' explains Janice Hickman of Southampton University, 'are not totally predictable.' There can be marked differences in annual populations of both pest and predator and 'biological succession' can see some species being replaced by others. Hickman has been working on hoverflies, another excellent aphid predator, but one which needs plenty of nectar and pollen. Hoverflies lay eggs in June and the larvae are ready to munch into action just when needed for summer wheat. Hickman puts predator encouragement into perspective. She believes there will always be a need for pesticides. She thinks now in terms of integrated pest management - a mixture of methods including fungus-resistant plants, phacelias and beetle banks for natural aphid controls, as well as some fungicides (for mildew) and herbicides (for weeds), neither of which natural controls can address. There is certainly huge interest among farmers in encouraging beneficial insects. The idea has caught the imagination of farmers at a time when public concern about chemical inputs has coincided with a political determination to scale down agricultural production. The instinctive fear that uprooting hedges was harmful is being proved right. A well-known and successful Essex farmer who has barely used any insecticides for 10 years, told me his neighbours all agreed their heaviest yields were in the smallest, hedge-ringed fields. The predator insects have been playing their part in pest control all along - when not killed off them-selves. Beetle banks, after all, are a form of substitute hedgerow, but without the sheltering benefits. Phacelias are a substitute for old-fashioned wildflower-infested hedgerows. To advance into the future, today's farmers may need to step back into the past.</p>

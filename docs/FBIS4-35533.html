			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "We Turned Down 'Arafat Offer to </F> Participate with Four Seats in Authority"]    [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A senior Hamas  official has stressed that his movement turned down an offer  from Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to participate in the  self-rule authority.    Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, has said: "I  would like to point out that Yasir 'Arafat sent (Fatah Central  Committee member) 'Abbas Zaki to meet with Hamas officials. And  that Zaki conveyed to Muhammad Nazzal (Hamas representative in  Amman) 'Arafat's offer to grant Hamas four seats only."    But according to Ghawshah, the offer was completely  rejected,  "because we refuse to participate in the authority, proceeding  from our rejection of the self-rule agreements, as they  perpetuate the occupation of Arab territory in Palestine."

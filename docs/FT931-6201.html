			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: BP to sell Australian mining interest BRITISH Petroleum has agreed to sell its 49 per cent interest in the Olympic Dam mining project in South Australia to Western Mining Corporation, the Australian resource group, for USDollars 240m. The agreement follows Western Mining's decision to exercise its pre-emptive option to acquire the stake. WMC, which owns 51 per cent of Olympic Dam, had until tomorrow to decide whether to match a similar offer from Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo-American Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa. The deal to sell the mining project, which includes 450m tonnes of copper, uranium, gold and silver deposits, will take BP out of minerals mining altogether. But BP still has a 50 per cent stake in an Indonesian coal mine which it will retain. WMC said its total outlay would be Dollars 430m after paying Dollars 190m to BP to buy out loans worth Dollars 273m. It said debt would increase by only Dollars 157m because most of the cost would be financed from existing resources. The deal ends an joint venture arrangement which required BP to finance an increase in annual production from 66,000 tonnes of copper to 150,000 tonnes and 1,400 tonnes of uranium oxide to 4,000 tonnes. WMC said it was reconsidering existing plans for a modest expansion to 84,000 tonnes of copper and 1,500 tonnes of uranium oxide over the next three years at a cost of ADollars 75m (USDollars 51.00) But the full expansion programme, which is expected to cost between ADollars 500m and ADollars 750m, was unlikely to proceed until later in the decade unless there was a substantial improvement in uranium prices. WMC said it was 'well placed' to finance the acquisition and future expansion in addition to a commitment announced last week to invest ADollars 440m in the development of the Mount Keith nickel deposit in Western Australia. The group said it expected net debt to increase from zero to about ADollars 600m by 1993-94, equivalent to 20 per cent of equity. 'No equity issue is contemplated or will be required,' the board said. WMC shares fell 5 cents to ADollars 4.71 on the Australian Stock Exchange as investors considered the impact of the deal on the group's ability to finance its future commitments.</p>

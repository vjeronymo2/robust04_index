			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Arts: Tate Gallery - Openings RB Kitaj is an American who came to England in the late 1950s under the provisions of the GI Bill, to study painting.  He has remained here ever since.  At the Royal College in London his contemporaries were David Hockney, Allen Jones and Derek Boshier and their friends in the glory-days of 'Pop goes the Easel'.  Kitaj remains his own man, and his work gives the lie to the thought that the tradition of the ambitious figure composition, dense with implication, was ever irrelevant or moribund.  Shows of recent work and prints are already open at Marlborough Fine Art and the V&amp;A.  The full retrospective, which opens at the Tate on Thursday, is many years overdue.</p>

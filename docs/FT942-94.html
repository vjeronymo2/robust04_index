			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Deal marks latest step in rejig of Wallenberg empire Incentive's sale yesterday of its controlling stake in Esab to Charter is the latest step in a significant post-recession rejig within itskey industrial holdings by Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family. At the same time, Charter's move is the biggest foreign takeover of a Swedish company since the purchase last year of Nobel Industries by Akzo of the Netherlands. Such foreign acquisitions are still rare in Sweden - and were blighted by the shareholder revolt that last December scuppered Volvo's plan to merge its vehicle manufacturing with France's Renault. But Esab, which like Volvo is based in Gothenburg, appeared confident yesterday that reaction would be positive, as it was when Akzo swallowed Nobel. The deal certainly went down well with investors in Incentive, who pushed up the B shares by SKr5 to SKr245 (Pounds 20.77) in an otherwise nervous market. The disposal of Esab follows the completion earlier this month of Incentive's SKr8.4bn acquisition of Cardo, formerly a Volvo offshoot. Both deals were part of a move by Incentive to reshape its holdings, which form the main hands-on industrial arm of the Wallenberg empire. Its activities include power generation, materials handling, and the Hasselblad camera making operation. It bought Cardo chiefly to get hold of Gambro, a large medical technology company, to establish Incentive in the health care industry. The remnants of Cardo are to be sold off or refloated. The disposal of Esab leaves Incentive with two main 'misfits' - its holdings in Asea, the Swedish co-owner of Asea Brown Boveri, the engineering giant, and Electrolux. Both Asea and Electrolux are core Wallenberg blue chip holdings - but no longer sit comfortably within an Incentive group concentrating on wholly owned industrial operations. Meanwhile, Investor, the main vehicle for the Wallenberg blue-chip investment portfolio, holds 100 per cent of Saab Scania, the vehicle and aircraft maker. This has led to much speculation that a larger re-shuffle is likely between Investor and Incentive to rationalise their holdings. Investor has itself made a number of dis-posals over the past two years to cope with a heavy debt burden, but is now signalling a return to a more offensive phase, looking for new investments overseas. So far, however, the firm line from Investor is that it has no plans for radical changes in its existing portfolio.</p>

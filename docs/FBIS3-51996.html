The URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]  Political-  Diplomatic Commission stated that neither the EGP [Poor People's  Guerrilla Army] nor any other guerrilla group is responsible for  the grenade attack on 18th Street and 6th Avenue A, Zone 1, on  17 January. One person was killed and 17 were injured in that  attack.    The communique also denied any rebel involvement in the  attacks that destroyed judicial files in Quiche, blasted the  front of the Legislative Palace, and destroyed GUATEL radio and  television repeater towers in Tecpan Guatemala, Chimaltenango.    In addition, a spokesman for the URNG Political-Diplomatic  Commission explained via telephone that "the URNG's actions have  not gone beyond exploding pamphlet bombs in various parts of the  capital to mark the EGP's anniversary and to extol the struggle  of popular organizations. "    The source added that the URNG attacks have not been  designed  to threaten human lives or damage private property because only  light charges placed have been used. That is why, the spokesman  reiterated, the URNG rejects the government accusations, above  all those made by the military commander in Quiche, who accused  the EGP of burning judicial files.    "The URNG General Command stresses that the terrorist  actions  can be attributed to sectors that oppose a political and  negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and to the  death squads, which, under the direction of the Army Staff, have  been functioning since last 28 November," the URNG spokesman  concluded.</p>

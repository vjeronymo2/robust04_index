			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Shchipanov report under the "Our Commentary" </F> rubric: "They Still Do Not Give Us the Money"]    [Text] It seems that chiefs of the IMF are in fact trying  to deflect any accusations that it was its unreasonably tight  policy with regard to Russia that contributed to the Russian  extremists' parliamentary breakthrough. It is well known that  an aggressive attack is the best defense. Well. The IMF has  announced in its attacking style that it was not going to  release the second part of its long-promised loan to Russia.  The first $1.5 billion was given to us on fairly beneficial  terms as early as last summer. It was expected that after a  pause, approximately by January 1994, the Russians will get the  remaining half as well. U.S. Vice President Albert Gore added  fuel to the fire when he took international experts to task  while in Moscow for their short-sighted rigidity in imposing the  IMF's economic recipes on the Kremlin. It seemed that the IMF  had no other choice given that the United States itself holds a  dominant position in the fund. But the fund men have shown  their mettle.    They continue to set those same conditions for carrying out  reform by the Russian authorities. As if there were no fear  following the breakthrough of V.V. Zh. [Vladimir Zhirinovskiy]  and his ilk. The IMF is not going to compromise its principles  in an apparent belief that there are enduring economic values.  Fund experts are not content with the Russian Government's  commitment to subsidize staple foodstuffs and energy resources.  This is why the money will not come to Russia until it fulfills  the established standards for putting brakes on inflation and  cutting the budget deficit. Our official economists have  repeatedly promised yet more budget "breakthroughs" in the past  few months and cheered those who so wished with optimistic  figures about decreasing inflation. Apparently, neither Fedorov  nor Shokhin were taken at their word as the fund preferred to  continue to exert pressure.    It is another matter that the fund may come under renewed  American pressure following Clinton's visit. The Yankees  account for the bulk of contributions to the IMF budget and are  inclined to make the fund the main channel for infusing at least  some Western assistance into Russia. Hence, even the IMF's  professed resolve looks as if it were a direct threat to  Clinton's course toward propping up Russia's volatile democracy.  So, Washington and the IMF may reach a gentleman's agreement in  the near future -- unfortunately, delays may amount to a few  months -- whereby U.S. officials will no longer question the  wisdom of fund experts (at least in public), and the IMF will  finally agree to release the remaining part of the $3-billion  loan to us.</p>

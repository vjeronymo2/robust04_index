			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  ONE GOOD DEED WORTH $22,460  </P> <P> A retiree who was "just being a Good Samaritan" found $22,460 inside a phone  booth at a Glendale car wash Thursday, then promptly turned in the cash to  police, who returned it to its owner.  </P> <P> Louis Segal, a West Los Angeles man in his 60s, walked into the Northeast  Division station about 1:15 p.m. and handed over two vinyl pouches filled with  cash.  </P> <P> "I found this in a phone booth. It's a lot of money," Officer Tom Okey quoted  Segal as saying. "He was trembling," the officer added.  </P> <P> Police said the money, mostly $100 and $50 bills, had been left on a shelf  beneath a phone outside the California Car Wash by Albert Molina, 26, of  Atwater, who reported he had misplaced it while his Porsche was being washed.  </P> <P> "Lucky, lucky, lucky," Molina said. "This will be the last time I lose  anything."  </P> <P> Molina, who owns a company that does immigration consulting work, said that he  took the money out of a safe to buy furniture for a new business he is opening.  He said he will give a $2,000 reward to Segal.  </P> <P> "I wasn't even going to call the police," Molina said. "I figured, 'Who is  going to turn in so much cash?' "  </P> <P> But Capt. James Whitley said of Segal: "He was just being a Good Samaritan."  </P></p>

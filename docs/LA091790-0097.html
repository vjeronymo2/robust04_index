			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL JACKSON: A SCOUTING IMAGE  </P> <P> He may not look like the quintessential Boy Scout, but apparently singer  Michael Jackson has the right Boy Scout stuff.  </P> <P> Enough to earn him an award in his name: the Michael Jackson Good Scout  Humanitarian Award. It was bestowed upon him Friday night at a benefit dinner  at the Century Plaza as some 700 guests gave him many standing ovations.  </P> <P> "Michael Jackson is a good example to youth, helping us keep kids off the  streets by supporting Scouting," said Ray Martin, chairman of the board of Los  Angeles Area Council Boy Scouts of America.  </P> <P> Yes, but is he brave, trustworthy and reverent? Would he have made a good Boy  Scout even though there are no badges given for glove-wearing or multiple  buckle-fastening?  </P> <P> "Yes, I think he epitomizes what's good about kids," said Martin, also chairman  and CEO of Coast Federal Bank. "He supports what the scouting programs are  doing, giving kids an alternative to street gangs."  </P> <P> Perhaps Jackson represents the change of image that Boy Scouts have undergone.  In Los Angeles at least, the Norman Rockwellesque vision of the freshly  scrubbed Boy Scout in a khaki uniform and kerchief doesn't always hold true.  </P> <P> "We used to be such a traditional organization, dealing only with kids in  middle- and higher-income families," Martin said. "Now we're reaching out to  lower-income inner-city kids. We're modifying, changing with the times. If you  go to a Scout summer camp you won't see kids with kerchiefs on, you'll see kids  who are finding out what it's like to go swimming for the first time."  </P> <P> The evening began with a VIP reception where Jackson posed for pictures in a  corner of the room.  </P> <P> "God, I feel sorry for him," said one on-looker as Jackson appeared trapped by  the crowd around him. "It's like he's in a cage."  </P> <P> As soon as the photo session was over, Jackson -- wearing a studded leather  jacket, silver-tipped cowboy boots and sunglasses that he never took off --  escaped through a narrow passage in the back, and emerged later at the dinner  in the main ballroom.  </P> <P> He was joined there by Chuck Norris, Scott Baio, Telly Savalas, Fred Travalena,  Rick Pallack (who had received his own scouting award a few months ago) and  Barbara Davis with her children. Some of Jackson's family, including his  mother, also were on hand.  </P> <P> Sportscaster Jim Hill (an Eagle Scout) emceed the show, headlined by singer  Stephanie Mills. A Michael Jackson video showed screaming fans interspersed  with concert footage, more screaming fans, video clips, screaming fans,  interviews with celebrities about Michael Jackson, and more screaming fans.  </P> <P> Michael Eisner, chairman of the board and CEO of the Walt Disney Co., was  dinner chairman and presented the award to Jackson, saying, "I wasn't a Boy  Scout but I was an Indian Guide, and we all know that's a whole different  level."  </P> <P> To the delight of his fans, Jackson said more than his usual breathy, pithy  "thank you."  </P> <P> "On behalf of the millions of past, present and future Boy Scouts," he said, "I  will try to abide by your motto of being prepared, and always extending a hand  to others."  </P></p>

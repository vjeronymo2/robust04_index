			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Paper tigers It does not say much for the government's credibility that investors apparently prefer to believe the Sunday press on interest rates than official word from Downing Street. Strenuous denials from Number 10 could do nothing to dissuade the equity market from the view that rates are heading lower. Thanks to further slippage in the pound, overseas earners led the equity market higher. But handsome gains in interest rate and inflation-sensitive sectors - such as banks and property - confirm a strong belief in easier money. Only a poor performance from Glaxo and Wellcome prevented the FT-SE 100 from testing its all-time high. Whether investors are right to view the government's credibility gap with such equanimity is another matter. A lower exchange rate is doubtless part of the government's scheme to help fund the public sector borrowing requirement and promote an export-led recovery. But that is no easy outcome to orchestrate. Sterling's fall could get out of hand, especially when policy is in the hands of a government blown this way and that by short-term policy considerations. Foreign currency borrowing would at least signal intent to intervene if necessary. That might help control the exchange rate as well as fund the PSBR. Lower German interest rates and a weakening D-Mark might eventually help avert a sterling crisis. But without a clear framework for monetary policy - let alone an explicit exchange rate target - the government might still have to tighten before it or the equity market would like.</p>

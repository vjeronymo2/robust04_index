			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YEAR-END TAX-SAVING PLOYS ARE HARDER TO FIND, LESS LUCRATIVE  </P> <P> The government has taken the fun out of the year-end tax dodge.  </P> <P> Years ago, avoiding taxes could be exciting. It caused people to invest in wind  farms, cattle ranches and oil wells. Some would hire their 3-year-olds and pay  them exorbitant salaries. Others might claim their dogs as dependents.  </P> <P> OK, so some of it was shady. At least it was interesting.  </P> <P> Now, because of tax legislation passed by Congress and stricter rules enforced  by the Internal Revenue Service, the choices are less lucrative -- and far less  dicey.  </P> <P> You can give money to charity, prepay a few bills, sell some investments and  put money away for retirement. Still, the chance of dramatically reducing your  tax is slight.  </P> <P> "People who tell you they can solve all your year-end tax problems are probably  going to charge you more in fees than they'll save you in tax," sighed Gregg  Ritchie, partner with the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick.  </P> <P> In fact, because of new tax rules that go into effect next year, you might want  to avoid tax avoidance altogether this year.  </P> <P> "Normally you would want to defer income and accelerate deductions to postpone  tax liability," said Tim Kochis, national director of personal financial  planning at Deloitte &amp; Touche in San Francisco. "But since the top marginal  rate goes up to 31% next year from 28% this year, that logic often reverses  itself."  </P> <P> Some people might at least think about paying more tax this year to pay less  next year, Kochis added.  </P> <P> Given all this, there are still a few things you can do to reduce your 1990 tax  bite.  </P> <P> One of the best options is to put money aside for retirement, Kochis said. How  you do this will depend on a variety of factors, including how much you earn  annually and where you are employed.  </P> <P> If your company has a 401(k) plan, you should consider contributing the maximum  amount allowable, which is $7,979 in 1990. (The allowable amount is indexed for  inflation.) These plans have two advantages: Money contributed is taken out  before tax, and interest earned on the account accrues tax-free until the money  is withdrawn at retirement.  </P> <P> What does that mean in dollars and cents?  </P> <P> Consider a couple earning $100,000 annually. They are in the so-called bubble  bracket, which means that they pay 33% in federal tax for every dollar earned  over a certain amount. If they contribute the maximum amount to a 401(k) plan,  they will save $2,633 in federal tax and $742 more on their California return,  said Phil Holthouse, partner at the West Los Angeles accounting firm Parks  Palmer Turner &amp; Yemenidjian. In other words, the government is paying for  nearly half of their retirement savings.  </P> <P> If you are self-employed, or have at least some self-employment income, you can  also start a Keogh plan, Holthouse added. These plans are similar to a 401(k)  but may allow larger contributions. The IRS limits deductions to the lesser of  13% of self-employment income or $30,000 annually.  </P> <P> And many taxpayers can take advantage of individual retirement accounts. These  accounts allow for tax-deductible contributions of $2,000 annually if your  income is less than $25,000 individually or $40,000 for a married couple. And  taxpayers who have no pension plan at work may contribute to an IRA at any  income level.  </P> <P> Another tax-saving strategy: Pay your January mortgage in December. This allows  you to deduct the interest expense in 1990 instead of 1991.  </P> <P> Some individuals might consider prepaying property and state taxes, too.  However, the advantage of getting a deduction for these payments needs to be  weighed carefully against the disadvantage of losing the use of that money for  the three or four months between the time you pay the bill and the actual due  date.  </P> <P> For example, say you needed to pay $5,000 in state taxes in April. If you paid  that early, you would save $1,400 in 1990, assuming a 28% federal tax bracket.  However, since you are using up 1991's deduction in 1990, you are only  deferring the tax payment for one year, not avoiding it altogether. So in  reality, your only real gain is the interest you've earned on the $1,400  deferral. Assuming an 8% rate of return, you would have earned $112 on your  $1,400. But, had you invested the whole $5,000 for four months, you would have  earned slightly more -- about $133.  </P> <P> If, however, you are now in the 33% "bubble" bracket, accelerating these  deductions could make sense again because your tax rate may drop slightly next  year, said Mark Collins, partner at Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. in Los Angeles.  In other words, this year's deductions are worth comparatively more and next  year's comparatively less.  </P> <P> Of course, if you are like most middle-income individuals and your tax rate is  set to climb next year, the opposite is true. The deduction would be more  valuable in 1991, Kochis said.  </P> <P> Philanthropic-minded individuals can time their charitable contributions to get  the maximum allowable tax benefit, too. Again, if you are currently in the  highest tax bracket of 33%, you might want to consider making these  contributions before year-end. If you are in the 28% bracket, you might want to  wait until next year.  </P> <P> Other tax-saving ideas:  </P> <P> * Consider bunching up business and medical expenses. Because deductions for  these expenses are valuable only if they exceed a certain percentage of your  income, you might want to try to accelerate or defer these expenses to get them  all into one year. That would include having elective surgery in the same year  as you had other large medical expenses or paying for business publications and  union dues up-front. Notably, too, cosmetic surgery will not be deductible in  1991, so get those nose jobs now.  </P> <P> * Pay off consumer debt. Interest paid on credit cards, car loans and other  types of consumer debt are 10% deductible in 1990. But you'll get no deduction  in 1991, Collins noted. Consequently, pay off as many of these debts as you  possibly can this year.  </P> <P> * If you have unrealized investment losses, you might consider selling the  investment to trigger the loss for tax purposes. You can use the loss to offset  investment gains and up to $3,000 of other income. Be aware, however, that if  you repurchase the same security within 30 days, the IRS will won't allow the  deduction.  </P> <P> * If you are planning to buy luxury items or a gas-guzzling car, you might want  to do it before year end. In 1991, the government will impose a special tax on  luxury items that cost more than specific amounts. And the gas-guzzler tax will  double.  </P> <P> </P> <P> YEAR-END TAX TIPS  </P> <P> Determine if your tax rate next year will be higher than this year's. If so,  you may wish to defer many deductions until 1991.  </P> <P> Contribute the maximum allowed to your tax-deferred retirement program, such as  an IRA, Keogh or 401(k) plan.  </P> <P> Make your January mortgage payment in December.  </P> <P> Contribute to charity.  </P> <P> Pay off consumer debt if possible; interest payments on these debts will not be  deductible next year.  </P></p>

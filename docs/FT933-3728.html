			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Books: A nose for news COMPLICITY by Iain Banks Little Brown Pounds 15.99, 313 pages THE VICAR OF SORROWS by A N Wilson Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 391 pages THE FIRST thing you know about Iain Banks's new novel, already at the first page, is that you are going to read it through right to the end. A few pages on, you decide that anything beyond a good compulsive read would be a bonus. The bonuses keep accruing. By the end you feel you have read a remarkable novel. The story is set in Edinburgh, Banks' own stamping ground. Cameron Colley, the narrator, is an investigative reporter with a local newspaper. When he is not working he is drinking hard, sniffing speed, addictively playing upmarket computer games, and carrying on an athletic affair with a friend's wife. He is in the process of investigating a series of unsolved murders. But while this is under way a serial killer is at work. His victims are the powerful and the rich who, for one reason or another, arguably had it coming to them. You get an eerie behind-the-camera view of the unknown killer's attacks which are executed with calculated professionalism. There is a chilling detachment about the killer's mode of operation, curiously enhanced by a seemingly arbitrary last-second relenting in one case. Since the murders - ultimately, and most gruesomely that of his lover's husband too - all occur while Cameron Colley happens to be close to the scene and without a plausible alibi, he gets arrested as a prime suspect. From here, however, the story takes an unexpected turn, echoed by the novel's title. The characters are, to a man and woman, from privileged backgrounds, accomplished, and morally deficient. Their attraction, physical as otherwise, is superficial. Their pursuits, trivial. Yet the novel moves you and makes you wonder why. Perhaps an observation Colley makes about the second central character provides a key to the enigma: 'He's disillusioned,' says Colley. 'He used to have lots of illusions, and now he's got only one: that what he's doing will make any difference.' The expected authorial message is cunningly subverted, thus enforcing the eponymous perception of complicity through a range of human failings, not least among them, apathy. Superbly crafted, funny, intelligent, but cold, this is very much a novel of the time: forget about early social deprivation, child-abuse, unfriendly environment, not to mention native inadequacy; instead, blame Thatcherism for everything. A N Wilson has written some excellent books. Chief among them a biography of Tolstoy which is nothing short of brilliant. His fiction, however, has been generally marked by absence of vigour. His latest novel is no exception. A thoroughly uninteresting clergyman, locked in a loveless, uninteresting marriage, and going through a familiar crisis of faith in a static imaginary English village, improbably falls in love with a rather uncharismatic middle-class girl attached to a band of New Age Travellers who had struck camp by the village. The improbability of the affair flows mainly from the clergyman's own emotional anaemia. It seems that the harder A N Wilson tries to inject life into emotion, the more academic and contrived it appears. That goes for the hero's obsessive grief over the death of his mother as for his love for the girl. In so far as there is fascination in this novel, it lies in its failure: all the right ingredients are present. It is as though a lifelike Golem of a comely aspect has been created. But instead being animated by the living spirit, it had been fitted with an imperfect motor which the author, you feel, is desperately trying to crank up at intervals to make the thing move.</p>

The Labour party leader, Mr Dick Spring, the kingmaker in any future coalition, held separate talks with both Fianna Fail, Labour's partners in the outgoing government, and with the main opposition Fine Gael party in an attempt to break the deadlock, following the collapse of the 22-month coalition between Fianna Fail and Labour and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister. A poll published yesterday suggested 63 per cent of people wanted a new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition. Moreover 49 per cent of those polled wanted Fianna Fail's leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, as prime minister and only 23 per cent supported Mr Spring. The result gives Mr Ahern a strengthened hand in negotiations with Labour. 'I don't think we're a hundred miles away from reaching agreement,' said Mr Ahern before going into yesterday's talks. Fianna Fail officials said Mr Ahern and Mr Spring had agreed to meet again.</p>

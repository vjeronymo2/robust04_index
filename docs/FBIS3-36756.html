That the creation of such a  conservative association was necessary was stated by Shakhray at  a meeting of representatives of regional organizations of his  party on 5 February. The creation of the new political  structure has already begun. Yesterday, Sergey Shakhray held  first talks on this topic with leaders of the Federation of  Independent Trade Unions of Russia.    In the wake of radical democrats' actually having joined the  opposition to the present government, the Party of Russian Unity  and Accord, led by two ministers -- Sergey Shakhray and  Aleksandr Shokhin -- became a loyal ally of Viktor  Chernomyrdin's cabinet. The political weight of this party in  the present parliament, however, is not too great. Its faction  currently is made up of as little as some 30 deputies -- all  members of the party at that. The New Regional Policy faction  is the main political ally of Shakhray's party in parliament,  but so far they have not fully agreed to coordinating their  positions.    Still, Shakhray does not seem to have given up hope that it  would soon be possible to create a coalition of 110 to 130 State  Duma deputies, including members of the Party of Russian Unity  and Accord faction, to form a reliable support for the present  government. At any rate, this was what Sergey Shakhray declared  on Saturday at the meeting with representatives of his party's  regional organizations.    To all appearances, Sergey Shakhray intends to form the  pro-government coalition at a rapid pace both inside and outside  the parliament. Already yesterday, these questions were  discussed in his meeting with chiefs of the Federation of  Independent Trade Unions of Russia. This haste is quite  understandable. Indeed, some leaders of Russia's Choice --  Mikhail Poltoranin, for example -- are on record as having  stated that the fall of the current government is a matter of  months. Last week's meeting of the Democratic Russia  coordination council discussed the possibility of holding mass  actions to demand the resignation of Chernomyrdin's cabinet.    The key task of the new centrist entity is supposed to be to  avert the threat, in the coming spring, of yet another political  crisis. Meeting representatives of his party's regional  branches, Shakhray issued a warning that by spring the readiness  to strike in many regions would create a political background  that would cause a sharper crisis in the government and the  State Duma.    On the other hand, Shakhray thinks, there may develop a  political confrontation between the State Duma and the president  which would most likely pick up depending on the decisions and  laws made by the Duma. All these factors, as well as the  "interethnic situation," Shakhray thinks, are going to create a  "cumulative effect" in May. It is for this reason that the new  centrist pro-government bloc should take final organizational  shape by that time.</p>

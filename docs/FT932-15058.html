			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank acquisition WALKER GREENBANK, the restructured wallcoverings group, yesterday reported higher full-year profits and bolstered its office seating and screening fabrics business through the Pounds 1.6m acquisition of John Hartley (Cowling). The Hartley purchase, which included the assumption of Pounds 700,000 in debt, was financed through a placing yesterday of 4.32m new shares at 70p a share. The surplus Pounds 2.17m proceeds will be used to develop the Hartley business and pay down the assumed debt. The shares closed unchanged at 75p yesterday. Greenbank, which has undergone a substantial reorganisation over the last couple of years under a new management led by Mr Charles Wightman, chief executive, yesterday reported a 4.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.43m to Pounds 5.65m in the year to January 31. The pre-tax growth was held back by higher interest charges of Pounds 520,000 (Pounds 236,000). Earnings per share increased by 3.6 per cent to 4.29p (4.14p) and the final dividend is unchanged at 1.9p for a maintained total of 3.1p. Turnover declined marginally to Pounds 56.2m (Pounds 56.8m) reflecting the sale of businesses, including loss-making Bloom Signs. Turnover from ongoing businesses rose to Pounds 51.9m (Pounds 47.9m) including a significant increase in overseas sales to Pounds 12m (Pounds 8.5m). Operating profits increased 6 per cent to Pounds 6.23m (Pounds 5.88m) before exceptional charges of Pounds 60,000 (Pounds 212,000) including reorganisation and closure costs of Pounds 156,000 (Pounds 1.43m) and a Pounds 489,000 property write-down offset by a Pounds 585,000 (Pounds 1.16m) profit on the disposal of two properties. The property write-down followed a January revaluation which also led to a Pounds 2.2m write-off against revaluation reserves. The results also included an extraordinary gain of Pounds 1.47m comprising the Pounds 3.56m in net proceeds from out-of-court settlement of its dispute arising from the 1987 acquisition of Alkar, partly offset by a Pounds 2.1m loss on the disposal of businesses. Group borrowings at the end of the year were marginally higher at Pounds 1.6m representing gearing of 6 per cent but have since been reduced to 'negligible levels.' COMMENT Greenbank's management team must hope that with the favourable settlement of their Alkar litigation, the worst is behind them. The group is now focused on its core commercial and consumer wallcoverings businesses, the balance sheet is solid and acquisitions like Hartley look sensible. Raw material costs are rising and will probably trim gross margins this year by about 1 per cent but this should be offset by growing exports, particularly to continental Europe. Pre-tax profits should reach about Pounds 7m this year producing earnings of some 5p and a prospective p/e of 15. The shares have risen sharply since September, but could still go higher.</p>

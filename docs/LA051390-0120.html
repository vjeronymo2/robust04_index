			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HUD TO REVIEW DRAW FOR SENIOR APARTMENTS  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has ordered the developer  of a senior housing project in Lawndale to temporarily suspend the results of  the lottery it used to select tenants while the agency reviews the way the  lottery was conducted.  </P> <P> Cooperative Services Inc., the Detroit-based developer that is building  Lawndale's only apartment complex for low-income seniors, violated HUD's  policies by failing to seek the agency's approval before holding the lottery,  HUD officials said in a letter sent Wednesday to the developer.  </P> <P> The developer also may have violated federal guidelines in not holding a  separate drawing for handicapped tenants, the letter said.  </P> <P> But because Cooperative Services did follow federal guidelines to advertise  vacancies and seek applications, HUD officials said in the letter that they are  likely to allow the March 13 lottery results to stand, as long as they  determine that the drawing was carried out in accordance with their  requirements.  </P> <P> HUD's position is disappointing to Lawndale city officials who say the lottery  was unfair to Lawndale residents and elderly Latinos in particular. They asked  the agency, which provided grant money to build the project, to order a new  drawing.  </P> <P> "What we wanted them to say is, 'You will redo the lottery,' " Lawndale City  Atty. David Aleshire said. "What they're saying is that even though they find  problems with the way the lottery was conducted, they're not necessarily going  to make them do it over again."  </P> <P> Mel Atkinson, Cooperative Services' operations manager, did not dispute HUD's  contention that the company failed to seek the agency's approval for the  lottery procedures but said HUD has approved Cooperative's lottery procedures  in the past. He said that a copy of the procedures has been sent to HUD and  that he expects the agency to approve them.  </P> <P> Cooperative Services contracted with the city to build the 56-unit project in  1989. The three-story building on 153rd Place is expected to be finished in  mid-July.  </P> <P> City officials brought their complaints to HUD in mid-April after the lottery  results showed that most of the apartment's tenants will probably come from  outside the city.  </P> <P> "We spent over five years trying to get this development under way," Aleshire  said Thursday. "Yet the end result is that only a small number of Lawndale  residents end up getting a benefit. . . . There's a real error in the HUD  program that there isn't something in this for local communities. It's no  wonder that people end up fighting HUD and that the national housing policy and  office is in such a disaster."  </P> <P> In ordering Cooperative Services to temporarily suspend the results of the  lottery, HUD required only that final tenancy selections be put off until the  review is completed. HUD did not order the developer to cease processing  applications.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, Cooperative Services accused city officials of wrongly  advising elderly applicants that the lottery will be rescheduled and that they  need not comply with requests for information to qualify them for an apartment.  </P> <P> Although city officials adamantly denied the allegations, Joyce Ellenbecker of  Cooperative Services said she heard about them "from several prospective  residents." The city is "doing a disservice to their own residents," she said,  because applicants who fail to provide financial information jeopardize their  chances of getting a subsidized apartment.  </P> <P> Because housing built with HUD grants may not give preference to local  residents, Lawndale officials originally wanted to sell the site to a private  developer to ensure that the city's senior population would get first crack at  the subsidized apartments.  </P> <P> But after negotiations with two private developers fell through, the city  reluctantly sold the site for $436,000 in 1989 to Cooperative Services, a  nonprofit corporation that has built subsidized housing projects nationwide  since 1945.  </P> <P> Company officials assured the city at the time that local advertising about the  lottery usually guarantees that more than half the tenants would be from the  city sponsoring the development, Aleshire said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, city officials planned to send flyers to Lawndale seniors  notifying them about the lottery. However, one week before the lottery was to  take place, officials realized that they needed more time to get the flyers  out.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Carol Norman asked Cooperative Services to postpone the drawing  one week, but the developer refused, saying it was against company policy and  would be too difficult.  </P> <P> When the lottery results came in, 52 of the 306 people who applied were  Lawndale residents; of the first 100 names chosen, 17 were from the city. In  addition, a disproportionate number of applicants who received priority are  Asian, rather than Latino, city officials said.  </P> <P> After the drawing, city officials renewed their request that Cooperative  Services reschedule the lottery. But the developer refused, saying it would be  unfair to those who were selected.  </P> <P> In a letter dated April 16 to the developer, city officials alleged that the  lottery was not fairly conducted and that the "priority tenant list does not  reflect the ethnic composition of the city and the region."  </P> <P> Although Latinos are 28.4% of the area's population, they make up only 15% of  the tenant applications, the letter stated. Asians make up only 6.7% of the  population, but 36% of the applicants are Asian.  </P> <P> "The (Latino) community, which by far constitutes the largest ethnic minority  population in the city and the region, seems particularly under-represented,"  it said.  </P> <P> City officials also objected to the formation of a three-member committee that  interviews prospective tenants. The committee members were chosen from among  the housing applicants, a system which "presents the opportunity for  discrimination," Aleshire said.  </P> <P> But Cooperative Services General Manager Fred Wood said volunteer selection  committees have been successful in other developments and that committee  members are instructed about the "nondiscriminating nature of the interview."  The committee gathers non-financial information on applicants.  </P> <P> To ensure that a wide range of ethnic groups would be aware of the drawing, he  said, Cooperative Services ran advertisements about the lottery in five  different newspapers and sent letters to 10 organizations, including the  National Assn. for Hispanic Elderly and the Plaza de la Raza.  </P> <P> "We feel we have reached all ethnic groups that wanted to apply," Ellenbecker  said. "We tried to reach all the communities. I don't have any idea" why some  ethnic groups chose to apply more than others.  </P></p>

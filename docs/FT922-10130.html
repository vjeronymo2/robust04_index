			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Joint ownership MY HOUSE is registered in my name only. I assume that if the house was shared between my wife and myself, death duties would be reduced. How can this be done? There is no Inheritance Tax (formerly death duties) on gifts made by one spouse to the other. The use of joint ownership to save IT is only relevant where it is intended to make a gift of a part or all of the half share of the first to die to someone other than the surviving spouse. A formal transfer or conveyance into joint names (to hold as tenants in common in equity) can be used, or a declaration of trust followed by the appointment of a new trustee. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Failures to reach 80,000 this year THE TOTAL number of personal and corporate insolvencies in England, Wales and Scotland will be 80,000 for the year, according to increased estimates released yesterday by Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Andrew Jack writes. The firm says there will be 30,000 corporate insolvencies and 50,000 personal bankruptcies in 1992, which assumes that company failures in the second half of the year will not exceed those in the first half. It had previously estimated failures totalling 70,000, but revised the figure upwards after the Department of Trade and Industry earlier this month reported figures for personal bankruptcy that were above expectations. Mr Chris Hughes, managing partner, said there was tentative evidence that the increase in corporate-sector collapses may have peaked. However, he stressed that the outlook on personal bankruptcies may yet worsen. Total insolvencies jumped by 34 per cent between the first half of last year and this year, with personal bankruptcies rising by 60 per cent in England and Wales to 18,389 and by 52 per cent to 5,578 in Scotland. The number of receiverships for all three countries declined during the period, but liquidations in England and Wales rose by 12 per cent to 12,375 in the first six months of the year.</p>

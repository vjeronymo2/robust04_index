			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (9): Coal squeezed between gas and nuclear - Britain is a battleground between rival fuels for power generation Central European countries can only dream of the range of fuels available to the UK for electricity generation. But they are less envious of the political problems which result for a government determined to let the market decide on which fuels should be used. There were times in 1992 and 1993 when the very survival of the government seemed threatened by the furious reaction to its decision to close three fifths of the nation's 50 remaining coal mines because of a lack of markets for their products. With that crisis apparently overcome, the government's difficulties in power generation this year centre on a nuclear review which it promised five years ago but has been reluctant to start. It will have to deal with the demands of Nuclear Electric, which with Scottish Nuclear provides virtually all of the UK's nuclear power, that it be privatised and be allowed to build new power stations. Meanwhile, the growth of the use of gas in power production is continuing. Although changes in prices in the England and Wales power trading pool have delayed the building of some stations, gas could take more than 30 per cent of the market by the end of the century, compared with almost nothing in 1990. Some forecasts see gas taking almost all of the market by the year 2001. Many European countries would rule that out because of its implications for security of supplies. The government shows no signs of doubt, saying that if corrections are needed in the fuel supply balance then the market will have plenty of time to make them. Its confidence in its abilities to sort out any problems will have been immeasurably boosted by its resolution of the coal closures crisis which was politically adept. With the closures programme now largely completed - at least while the industry remains in state hands - Britain now has only 16 deep mines (three fewer than were envisaged in its mishandled plan two years ago) aemploying fewer than 10,000 men. That compares with 50 pits and 50,000 men two year ago. Ministers got away with it because their white paper of March 1993 appeared to offer so much. They indicated that several hundred million pounds were available to keep the mines open, but in the event almost nothing has been paid out. What the white paper did was to buy time. Since then a succession of pit closures have been announced, but because they have closed in ones and twos rather than in one large operation there has been far less publicity. The government's defiance of public feelings about pit closures stems in part from its determination to privatise an industry that it believes would be much better run in the private sector. Privatisation is expected to be completed later this year. At its previous size the industry would have been unsellable; the markets were simply not there. The main reason was that the two largest generators in England and Wales cut purchases from 65m tonnes in 1992-3 to 40m tonnes in 1993-4 and 30m tonnes for the following four years. However, the government's argument that the tonnage decline was dictated by the free market is not wholly convincing. The coal is being displaced mainly by new gas plants which will produce electricity at higher prices than existing coal stations. The coal lobby argues that the 'dash for gas' is due to the way the electricity industry was privatised, with the creation of just two large power generators in England and Wales. This would have been less harmful if the government had created vertically integrated generating and distribution companies as it did in Scotland. But in England and Wales, the 12 regional electricity distributors were desperate to lessen their dependence on what they consider to be a duopoly of the two generating companies. Their participation in the dash for gas, in which they helped to build new stations, was prompted by a desire for alternative supplies. National Power and PowerGen were forced to join the gas stampede or see their markets severely squeezed, the argument goes. In energy markets nothing is ever simple. The coal lobbyists tend to forget that the switch to gas is partly prompted by environmental considerations; gas emits much less sulphur dioxide than coal and without it the UK would struggle to meet internationally agreed pollution targets. Nevertheless the government did no favours to the coal industry when it decided to privatise it after completing a sale of the power industry with a less than fully competitive structure. But perhaps the biggest test of the government's free market principles will come in its attitude to the nuclear industry both in this year's review and over the next few years. If the electricity market was truly free then Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear would be told that that they could never build another nuclear station unless they could produce power from it at fully competitive prices. But that would probably mean the beginning of the end for the nation's nuclear power industry, with two companies retaining an ever dwindling share of the market as they decommission ageing stations. Nuclear Electric acknowledged recently that it could only build Sizewell C, its second 2,600MW pressurised water reactor station in Suffolk, if the state provided it with 'material support'. That does not necessarily mean direct aid. It could, for example, be achieved by the government agreeing to meet unforeseen decommissioning costs. Or the government could decide to set aside a specific proportion of the power generation market for the nuclear industry. Any form of support, however, would require the government or consumers to give assistance that they will not be providing to other fuels after 1998. In the review and beyond, the government will face arguments from powerful lobbies, including some of the country's largest companies who want a share of power station contracts, that nuclear power generation should be supported, and soon. If Nuclear Electric is unable to start work on Sizewell C soon, the expertise gained in building Sizewell B, its forerunner, would dissipate, they say. They also argue that Britain would be unable to meet future environmental targets on sulphur and carbon emissions. If the government accepts these arguments it will be accused of abandoning the free market principles it clung to in the coal debate. An inconclusive result to the nuclear review seems likely.</p>

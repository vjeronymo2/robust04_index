			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Philip Webster report: "Major Hints at Britain in the Slow </F> Lane"]    [Text] John Major turned his vision of a Britain at the  heart of Europe on its head last night when he admitted that the  UK could be in the slow lane of a "multi-track" community.    The Prime Minister raised the prospect of Britain opting out  of the next stages of political and economic integration just a  day after France called for like-minded member states to forge  ahead, leaving stragglers behind.    His speech at a European election rally in Ellesmere Port,  Cheshire, was a clear attempt to reassure Eurosceptic  Conservatives that Britain would never be forced to accept a  single currency or further centralisation against its will.    He insisted that it was "old-fashioned commonsense" that  member states should be free to do some things in their own way  and at their own speed. But he had dearly moved a long way from  his speech in March 1991 when he said: "We want to arrive at  solutions which will enable us to move forward more united, not  less."    Last night, amid clear signs that France and Germany are  planning a joint strategy to keep up momentum for a more  integrated union, Mr Major set out his new vision of a Europe  where countries could move between the fast and slow lanes.    He said he had never believed that Europe must invariably  act  as one on every issue and advocated what he called "a sensible  new approach, varying when it needs to, multi-track,  multi-speed, multi-layered. It is a Conservative idea in line  with the mood of people everywhere. We should be examining how  this can work, not just fighting over the old centralised  prescription.    Mr Major's remarks brought a furious attack from his  opponents, with John Cunningham saying he had abandoned any  pretence that Britain would be a first-rate nation in Europe.  "The Prime Minister has let the cat out of the bag," the shadow  Foreign Secretary said. "He has admitted that his Government  would let Britain fall behind in Europe. He is apparently  willing to offer voluntary relegation to the second division in  Europe and he isn't even prepared to put up a fight.    "I believe that in any two-speed Europe, Britain must be up  with those in the fast lane. Clearly, Mr Major does not."    Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, said:  "This is a negative, defeatist message of a nasty, divided  party. This is not about a multi-track, multi-speed,  multi-layered Europe, but a second-class Britain in a two-tier  Europe. Britain will be condemned to a seat below the salt at  the top table of Europe."    Senior Conservatives said last night that Mr Major was  making  plain his view that beyond the matters that had already been  agreed by the EU [European Union], it did not make sense for  every member state to march in the same direction at the same  speed. On some issues, Britain would clearly be in the fast  lane; on others, such as the single currency, it would reserve  its position.    Mr Major had told his invited audience: "I do not happen to  think that it threatens Europe if member states are free to do  some things in their own way and at their own speed. It is  simply good old-fashioned commonsense.    "If other countries want to slap more costs on their  businesses, then they are welcome to -- if they want the Social  Chapter, they can have it. But we are not having it here."    The experience of the past two years proved that Europe  could  not be taken too far, too fast. Britain was right not to be  pushed into agreeing a single currency in place of the pound.  "It may happen in the future -- or it may not. But in any  event, we cannot make a sensible judgment on it now, and a  future Parliament must be free to say yes or no when it has all  the facts before it."</p>

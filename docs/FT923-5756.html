			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fingerprints on the plant pot DNA fingerprinting is most commonly associated with forensic investigations and paternity suits, but researchers at the CSIRO division of horticulture in South Australia are using it to identify plants. Their work may lead to the establishment of a commercial facility for growers who want to guarantee the identity of their products and protect their rights to plant varieties. If, for example, a winery has produced a successful wine from a new grape variety, it can be positively identified using DNA fingerprinting. CSIRO has isolated small pieces of DNA, called microsatellites, which are characteristic of grapevines but which show minor differences in length between different varieties.

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Independents win seats but no power: Fujimori consolidates grip on Peru's institutions THREE years ago, television presenter Ricardo Belmont was elected mayor of Lima, heralding a period of turmoil for Peru's traditional political parties and marking the emergence of the independent candidate. Last Friday's national municipal elections not only saw Mr Belmont comfortably re-elected but confirmed the political trend he initiated in 1989. Independents swept into office across the country. In Lima, home to a third of the nation's voters, established parties picked up only half-a-dozen of 40 council seats. Former president Fernando Belaunde's Popular Action party and ex-president Alan Garca's Apra party were reduced to a handful of regional strongholds. Both had boycotted November Congressional elections in protest against President Alberto Fujimori's seizure of power last April. Also, the Marxist left suffered a crushing national defeat. The elections were good news for Peru in two respects. First, the level of political violence was sharply reduced. Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) guerrillas, their organisation weakened since last September's capture of their leader Abimael Guzman, threatened voters and killed 20 candidates in the run-up to polling. But, compared to 1989, when elections were postponed in a quarter of the country because of guerrilla violence, Friday's voting was largely peaceful. Second, these municipal elections fulfil the pledge made by Mr Fujimori to the Organisation of American States last May of a full return to democracy. OAS observers appear satisfied with the process. In theory, the way should now be clear for friendly countries to re-establish flows of economic assistance frozen in the wake of Mr Fujimori's institutional coup. But Mr Jorge Camet, the new economy minister, cancelled his trip to Washington this week for talks with Peru's new support group. Peru needs Dollars 410m to cover a 1993 balance of payments deficit. Without it, the letter of intent presented to the International Monetary Fund and arrangements with the World Bank for clearing immediate arrears would collapse, as would prospects for Dollars 1.4bn in fresh credits over the next three years through the IMF extended fund facility. So far, the only firm commitments are from support group co-leaders Japan and the US, which together will put up half the total. Government officials hope Canada and assorted European countries will provide the remainder. Last week's elections, however, have not dispelled international community scepticism, even though Mr Fujimori has earned praise for his speedy transformation of one of the continent's most protectionist and statist economies into one of its least regulated. However, that economic liberalism has been accompanied by political authoritarianism. Several countries, including Germany, expected to be a key member of the support group, remain unconvinced about adequate progress on issues such as human rights. The US State Department recently protested over threats to press freedom and its January report on continuing human rights violations caused renewed concern. Mr Fujimori's abrasive campaign against virtually every Peruvian institution has led to mass sackings of judges, the dismissal of tens of thousands of state employees, and the premature removal of senior army officers who might not see eye to eye with him. Three weeks ago, the presidential axe fell on Peru's widely-respected diplomats, causing widespread rancour. On Tuesday, two lawyers who have acted for Shining Path leaders were convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment for serving as links between their clients and the guerrilla group. Both men belonged to the Democratic Lawyers' Association. Justifying his actions, Mr Fujimori claims Peru's institutions are corrupt and inefficient. In broad terms, he is probably right and his attacks help maintain his approval ratings at an impressive 60 per cent. But, so far, he shows no sign of building on the rubble of the institutions destroyed. Rather, he increasingly depends on the armed forces (now largely purged of dissidents) and the National Intelligence Service which he frequently praises in public. Observers comment that the new constituent Congress is proving to be a simple extension of, rather than a check on, the executive. Also, Mr Fujimori has encouraged the proliferation of the political independents who triumphed last Friday. 'It's the old divide and rule strategy,' commented one senior foreign diplomat in Lima. All winners, whether former left-wingers abandoning the stigma of a party label, opportunists or decent neighbourhood workers, scrupulously eschewed ideology. No-one in today's Peru, even the traditional parties, denies the need for political renovation. But analysts query whether hundreds of independent candidates and ballot papers whose complexity means more invalid than valid votes constitute the 'authentic democracy' Mr Fujimori had promised.</p>

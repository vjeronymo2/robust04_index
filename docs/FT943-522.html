			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US audio-visual industry seeks to woo Europe Mr Jack Valenti, chairman of the US Motion Picture Association, yesterday called on the European film industry to co-operate with its US counterpart and to let viewers 'make their own decisions about what they want to see'. In a speech to be delivered at the American Chamber of Commerce in Paris, Mr Valenti said the US wants to see 'a dynamically successful French audio-visual industry'. The stronger the French industry became, the larger the French audience would be, he said. The US would get a share of the larger audiences. Co-operative efforts between European producers and the US film industry were already under way, he said. Referring to French efforts to limit US television programming in the EU, he said that new technologies 'will defy restrictive regulation. 'Barriers, protectionism, hedge rows are out of place in a world of creative competition and expanding visual choice. He who builds walls to keep others from coming in soon discovers that he has difficulty getting out,' he added.</p>

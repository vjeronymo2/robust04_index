			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Ovcharenko and Leonid Timofeyev under the </F> general heading "U.S. President Has Entered Our House With His  Own Personal Dream": "Moscow: Around the Samovar at  `Spaso-House'"]    [Text] For us simple mortals it is a cinch to invite  around some guests, but take the example of the meeting with  prominent Russians invited to the [ambassadorial] residence  "Spaso-House" on the occasion of the U.S. President's visit,  which is already the subject of criticism and remarks. The  American side acted in the following manner: Of the 170 guests,  100 are well-known for their progovernment views and 70 are  reformers of a whole range of persuasions. The press was also  invited. They decided not to invite Zhirinovskiy. But such an  authority as former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, when  questioned by American television about this, gave a reply to  the effect that the organization of this event already seems to  him to have failed. Instead of this pompous political display,  30-40 genuine Russian political leaders should have been  invited, and should have had a concrete, serious, informal  discussion with him, meeting behind closed doors away from the  press. Incidentally, Zhirinovskiy should have been invited. So  that he would be one among many. And deprived of the political  exclusivity which was created for him after the elections. But  as we learned from American sources, the advisers who prepared  the guest list became fearful lest Vladimir Volfovich might put  the President in an embarrassing position at this informal  shindig with his latest utterance.    In general protocol is a delicate matter. It looks as if we  have the makings of a major incident. The President's  spur-of-the-moment stop-off at Borospil airport [Kiev] has in  the space of one and a half days become an event of state  significance, in the wake of which an agreement between Russia  and Ukraine will be signed. Its aim is to eliminate Ukraine's  nuclear weapons in exchange for a whole series of political and  economic gains. For example, according to THE WASHINGTON POST,  Russia will decline payment from this republic for its enormous  debt for energy resources. Ukraine will also receive nuclear  fuel and economic and technical assistance. We should remind  the reader that Kiev is receiving $5 billion from across the  ocean for the nuclear payload of each missile warhead which has  already been shipped to Russia.    So, what lies in store for Ukraine? What concessions are we  talking about? The Treaty On the Principles for Eliminating  Nuclear Weapons Situated on Ukrainian Territory will be the  title of the document which, it is expected, Presidents Yeltsin,  Clinton, and Kravchuk will sign in Moscow 14 January. What is  more Ukraine will sign it as an interested party which earlier  announced its voluntary renunciation of the possession of this  type of weaponry. Russia and the United States will in this  instance appear as nuclear powers and guarantors of Ukraine's  security.    The document concerns a very sensitive area. However, in  spite of reports in the U.S. press, Ukrainian diplomats working  in Moscow expressed their doubts to us that the treaty will  contain any secret articles. It is not the president's business  to keep secret that in which everybody has an interest and which  one would hardly succeed in suppressing.    They also categorically rejected the above news that Ukraine  had "exchanged" the agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons for a  cancellation of their debts to Russia for energy sources  supplied by it. That is, the draft treaty is about nuclear  weapons, conditions for their elimination, and guarantees of  security, and is not about debts for oil or gas.    True, one ticklish factor does remain in connection with  the Ukrainian opposition's demand to subject the tripartite  document to a process of ratification. The Law on the President  grants Leonid Kravchuk powers to put his signature to such a  treaty. According to representatives of the Ukrainian Embassy  in Moscow, it will become apparent what legal mechanisms to put  into effect in the future.    ...One week before Clinton's departure for Europe, the  journal NEWSWEEK writes, passersby in the vicinity of the White  House ran the risk of being picked up and taken to the President  in person so that they could give him their opinion of U.S.  foreign policy. It was through this quip that our colleagues  conveyed a picture of the frantic consultations which were order  of the day on the eve of his trip. As well as the President's  notorious habit of canvassing dozens of people's opinions --  from cleaners to experts -- before making decisions.    Congress and the American public opinion had been in a stew  for a long time over Kiev's intractability concerning nuclear  weapons. Even if Clinton's visit to Moscow is not crowned with  outstanding success, the signing of the tripartite agreement may  be credited not just to the U.S. President, but also to his  colleagues from Moscow and Kiev.</p>

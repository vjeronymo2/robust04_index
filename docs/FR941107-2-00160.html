			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) give the Participating Insurance Companies the right to disregard voting instructions of contract holders. More specifically, Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide partial exemption from Sections 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent those sections have been deemed by the Commission to require ``pass-through'' voting with respect to an underlying fund's shares.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of it owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund, or any contract between a fund and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Rules 6e2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  provide that the insurance company may disregard voting instructions of contract owners if the contract owners initiate any change in such insurance company's investment policies, principal underwriter, or any investment adviser (provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii), (b)(7)(ii)(B) or (b)(7)(ii)(C) of Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants represent that the application will be amended during the notice period to refer to Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(15)(b)(iii)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ), rather than 6e3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(B), in the discussion under the heading ``Pass-Through Voting.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Applicants represent that in the case of a change in the insurance company's investment policies, the insurance company, in order to disregard contract owner voting instructions, must make a good-faith determination that such a change would violate state law, or would result in investments that either would be inconsistent with the investment objectives of the separate account or would vary from the general quality and nature of investments and investment techniques used by other separate accounts of the company or of an affiliated life insurance company with similar investment objectives. Applicants represent that in the case of a change of an investment adviser, the insurance company, in order to disregard contract owners' voting instructions, must make a good-faith determination that either: (a) The adviser's fees would exceed the maximum rate that may be charged against the separate account's assets; or (b) the proposed adviser may be expected to employ investment techniques that either (i) would vary from the general techniques used by the current adviser, or be used to manage the investments in a manner inconsistent with the investment objectives of the Separate Account, or (ii) would result in investments that vary from certain standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Applicants submit that affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies, principal underwriter, or investment adviser initiated by contract owners. Applicants also state that the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in Rule 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) that the Participating Insurance Company's disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good-faith determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the requested order is granted, Applicants consent to the following conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A majority of the directors of the Fund shall consist of persons who are not ``interested persons'' of the Fund (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, the rules promulgated thereunder, and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission). If this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification, or bona-fide resignation of any director(s), then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a) For a period of 45 days, if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the directors; (b) for a period of 60 days, if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The board of directors of the Fund will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the contract owners of all Separate Accounts investing in the Fund. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretive letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of any Fund portfolio are being managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners and variable life insurance contract owners; or (f) a decision by an insurer to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Participating Insurance Companies and DFA will report any potential or existing conflicts to the board of directors. Participating Insurance Companies and DFA will provide the directors with all information reasonably necessary for them to consider any issues raised by such conflicts and, more generally, will be responsible for assisting the directors in carrying out their responsibilities under these conditions. In addition, each Participating Insurance Company will inform the directors whenever contract owner voting instructions are disregarded. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts to, and to assist, the directors will be a contractual obligation of all insurers investing in the Fund under their agreements governing participation in the Fund. These responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contract owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

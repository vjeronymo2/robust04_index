			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> COUNTRY FRENCH FOOD IS SOMETIMES UPTOWN;  </P> <P> MAX JACOBSON  </P> <P> Though country French cuisine is relatively simple to reproduce, surprisingly  few restaurants do it justice. Overblown dishes suited to fancier dining rooms  often crop up where a simple salad of white beans or a crusty tartine would do  very nicely. And many of these restaurants feature menus that are so impressed  with themselves that they forget to serve plain good food.  </P> <P> The Pleasant Peasant lives up to its name, at least partly. It is a pleasant  place, if self-consciously so, with the type of decor you might be tempted to  call Frilly Cottage -- e.g., knickknack wall mounts, flowery wallpaper, elegant  table settings. The dining room reminds you of a gift store specializing in  fancy imported soaps. As for the Peasant part of its name, it isn't.  </P> <P> Like many restaurants that are supposedly country French, The Pleasant  Peasant's menu gets bogged down in dishes you wish it wouldn't bother with,  such as le canard a l'orange, or supreme de volaille a la creme. And when the  waitress asked me how crispy I liked my duck, I didn't realize that she was  really asking me how long I wanted the thing frazzled in a deep fryer. The dish  arrived sodden with grease, though the duck skin was crisp. And that orange  sauce wouldn't have been out of place over shaved ice.  </P> <P> As for the volaille, why take a perfectly good breast of chicken and smother it  in a cream sauce thick enough to eat with chicken-fried steak? That may be  country American, but it sure isn't country French.  </P> <P> Look past these kinds of excesses, however, and the Pleasant Peasant may win  you over. Prices are very reasonable, especially considering that all dinners  are served with both soup and salad. (The salad is a bit perfunctory, but soups  are especially fine.)  </P> <P> One night there were three soups: a thick lentil, a smooth gazpacho and a homey  corn chowder. Every one was flavorful, simple, and pure. Appetizers like  l'assiette du Bistro (an equally simple plate of cold cuts and cheeses) also do  a credible job. The tonier aubergine Chamonix (an eggplant gratin with ham and  Swiss cheese under a rich, bubbly sauce) is less impressive.  </P> <P> Among main dishes I can recommend are two lamb specialties, le carre d'agneau  (a generous piece of lamb rack sprinkled with herbes de Provence) and le jarret  d'agneau (lamb shank in white wine and tomato sauce). The rack I tasted was  tender and full of flavor. The shank was fragrant with natural juices.  </P> <P> I can't recommend the pot roast with shallots, however. The meat was soft but  tasteless. And the sauce, sort of a thick brown glaze, was so sweet that I  couldn't taste the meat. Don't fool with pastas here, either. Fusilli with  vegetables was downright soggy, smothered in a thick creamy sauce that rendered  it nearly inedible.  </P> <P> La Brasserie in Orange has fewer problems than the Pleasant Peasant in the  kitchen, but its advertised country French style rarely materializes. When it  does, the result is good eating.  </P> <P> It's a dark, elegant sort of place with copper pots hanging from the ceiling  and a clubby, candlelit ambiance. It's also quite a bit pricier than most. The  only informality is provided by some 19th-Century French poster art that  wouldn't be out of place in a brightly lit cafe on the Boulevard St. Germain.  But the menu is considerably more uptown.  </P> <P> You're apt to notice a spate of veal dishes -- 10 to be exact. Marsala, Cordon  Bleu and saltimbocca, for example, and also Continental staples such as lobster  Newburg and caviar. You'll have a better, and certainly less expensive evening,  if you avoid the luxuries here.  </P> <P> I noticed that there were two foie gras appetizers, one advertised as a chicken  liver mousse at $7.95, the other a goose liver terrine for $19.95. So I asked  the cheerful French waiter if the more expensive one was really that much  better. "Mais non," he replied under his breath, "the terrine is from a jar,  and the mousse is made here." Naturally, the chicken liver mousse turned out to  be great -- smoothly rich in a wonderful, homemade aspic.  </P> <P> Similarly, you can have onion soup from the menu at extra charge, or you can  have the soup of the day with your dinner. Mine was a farmhouse vegetable soup  served in a crock that was as country French as anything I had all week. It  beat the onion soup to pieces. Should you prefer a salad (you don't get both  here), it's made of bibb lettuce with a creamy tarragon vinaigrette.  </P> <P> I had to search a bit for what I thought might be real country dishes, but the  effort proved worthwhile. Coq au vin rouge is great here, a half-chicken that  had been gently braised in a burgundy-colored sauce until it fell from the bone  with smoky flavors. Calf's liver is wonderful, too -- pan fried crisp,  luxuriously browned, and buried in butter and shallot. Both dishes are  accompanied by garlicky diced potatoes and broccoli Hollandaise. They are, as  the French say, worth a detour.  </P> <P> The Pleasant Peasant is moderately priced. Appetizers are $3.25 to $10.50. Main  courses begin at $8.50, and go up to $20. La Brasserie is moderate to  expensive. Appetizers are $6.50 to $27.50. Main dishes are $13.95 to $23.95.  Both restaurants have the predictable creme caramel, chocolate mousse, French  pastry dessert menus. Desserts at the Pleasant Peasant run about 50 cents less  than at La Brasserie, averaging about $3.50 apiece, and are not nearly as  well-crafted.  </P> <P> THE PLEASANT PEASANT  </P> <P> 4251 Martingale Way, Newport Beach  </P> <P> (714) 955-2755  </P> <P> Open for lunch Monday through Friday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; for dinner, Monday  through Thursday 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Closed Sunday.  </P> <P> All major credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> LA BRASSERIE  </P> <P> 202 S.

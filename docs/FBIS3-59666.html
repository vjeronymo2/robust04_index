			<p>Article Type:CSO     [Text] A regional technical activities forum on a system  for exchanges between different businesses focusing on machinery  manufacturers in Kansai began discussions on technology exchange  and technical support for small and medium-sized businesses.  (The discussion group was held at 3-6-32 Nakanoshima, Kita-ku,  Osaka-shi. Kensaku Imaichi, Professor Emeritus at Osaka  University and President of Osaka Hoki Seisakujo was the  delegate. Tel: 06-443-4640.) In order to respond with concrete  technical support, a subcommittee was established by industry,  academia, and government, to exchange technical know-how such as  patents held by member companies, between companies, the  collection and publication of the seeds and needs were  undertaken. The objective is to open the door to small and  medium-sized businesses in joint ventures between industry and  academia that overemphasize large companies and to support  improvements in their technologies.  <H5>  Exchanging Technical Know-How </H5>   The joint industry-academia subcommittee established at the  forum examines the best ways to solve the various technical  problems presented by committee members and advises the  requesting company about solutions. Yoshio Miyoshi, assistant  professor of machinery and materials at Osaka University, was  placed in charge of a committee discussion group consisting of  five professors from universities in Kansai and experts in  measurement control, image processing, and manufacturing  processes.    Already the results of automatically measuring fish kept for  food used by breeders have been presented. When a solution was  found, payment for the success, such as research assistance  funds, is paid to the professor in charge.    Furthermore, a publications and information subcommittee was  newly established. It is to link the seeds information of  companies that would like to spread technology by selling it to  the needs information of companies interested in becoming active  in those technologies.    Specifically, the seeds and needs, product introductions,  and  technical information of each company will be collected in an  organizational publication and presented to committee members  twice a year. Information related to seeds and needs is received  regularly by the business office on printed forms. Information  from companies other than committee members is handled in the  same manner. Urgent information is presented to associated  committee members in a timely fashion.    The forum began as a subordinate organization of the Kansai  chapter of The Japanese Society of Mechanical Engineers. It is  composed of the management organizations of leading companies,  small and medium-sized businesses, and public research  organizations, professors from the universities, about 80  businesses, and individuals.</p>

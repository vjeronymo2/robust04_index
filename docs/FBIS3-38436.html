			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Republicans Appear Headed For a </F> Split"]    [Text] Rome, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- Italy's small Republican  Party [PRI] appeared headed for a split Monday [31 January]  after party secretary Giorgio La Malfa failed to reach an  understanding with the Democratic Alliance, to which many  Republicans belong, for a common progressive front in view of  the upcoming elections.    During a meeting of the party's national council yesterday,  La Malfa called on the party to steer the moderate path, by  joining Mario Segni's Pact for Italy, and said that it could  only take into consideration an alliance with the Democratic  Alliance if it dropped from its forces the orthodox Communist  Renaissance [Renewal] and Network [Rete] of Palermo Mayor  Leoluca Orlando. A resolution outlining his position, however,  was passed by a margin of only 6 votes, 65 to 59.    Speaking to the press after his meeting here today with  Democratic Alliance, a meeting he described last night as a  "last ditch" effort to steer them away from the far Left, La  Malfa said his conditions had not been accepted. At this point,  he added, Republicans who feel they must stay with the  progressive alliance were free to do so, but if they joined its  election slate then they would not longer be considered party  members.    Earlier in the day, La Malfa had argued how the decision  adopted at yesterday's national council was binding for all  Republicans. He added how he knew the decision would have been  a difficult one and that it risked causing deep divisions.    In related developments, Valero Zanone, on behalf of the  Liberal Democratic Union, welcomed the move by La Malfa's  Republicans and the Socialists of Giuliano Amato to join the  Pact for Italy. "Around the Pact proposed by Segni" he said,  "there can finally be achieved the goal of these past months to  unite Catholics and the lay parties based on common liberal  democratic principals. The Pact is the only initiative which  has taken shape as an alternative to the unified Left without  striking compromises with the right of [League Secretary] Bossi,  [National Alliance leader] Fini and their like".    La Malfa said that the "parting of the ways" had been "very  friendly" and expressed doubt that prominent members of his  party would leave to form part of a progressive line-up in which  the presence of Communist Renaissance [Renewal] was  "contradictory" and liable to "favour the victory of moderate  forces".    A leading Republican member of Democratic Alliance, Giorgio  Bogi, told reporters that he would continue working in the  centre-left group despite the threat of expulsion, which is "a  matter for party organs and not the secretary to decide."    Giuseppe Ayala, a former anti-Mafia judge who was close to  the Republican party before joining Democratic Alliance, said  the threat did not concern him since he had never taken out  Republican party membership. "I continue to believe in  Democratic Alliance, and I am sorry the entirety of the  Republican Party is not with us," he said.    Ferdinando Adornato, one of the founders of Democratic  Alliance, issued a brief statement saying that "we started off a  project for overcoming the old logic of political affiliation;  it is inevitable that certain members of the old nomenklatura  are resisting this project."    La Malfa -- who, like former Liberal and Socialist chiefs,  has admitted accepting illegal electoral funding from the  Ferruzzi group in 1992 -- confirmed to journalists that he will  not be standing in the coming elections.</p>

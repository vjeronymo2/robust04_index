			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> The caption on the photograph above, published Jan. 26 in Orange County Life,  identified the subject as struggling "to remain awake for his turn in traffic  court." In fact, Horace Shepherd had accompanied a friend to court and was not  a defendant in any action. A driver for a courier service, he says he has not  had a moving violation in 51 years of driving.  </P></p>

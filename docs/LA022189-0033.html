			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> A firehouse's traditional mascot is a dog. But county Fire Station No. 149 had  a problem that 101 Dalmations couldn't have solved -- mice. So the station  recruited Phyllis, a gray and white cat, from an animal shelter.  </P> <P> "No more mice," said Capt. Duane Deever at the station house, which is located  in the north county near Lake Castaic.  </P> <P> Aside from being an effective piece of mouse-fighting equipment, Phyllis is the  only feline mascot of any county fire unit. In fact, firehouse mascots in  general are disappearing. Fewer than a dozen of the county stations even house  dogs.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to get three different shifts of firefighters to agree on  anything, let alone one animal," Deever said. "If you have people on one shift  that aren't interested in all phases of taking care of her, including medical  care, then it won't work."  </P> <P> The 12 firefighters at Station 149 are, however, devoted to Phyllis, even  though she doesn't attend fires.  </P> <P> "When we start up the truck," Deever said, "she runs and jumps in her bed."  </P> <P> Traffic sighting du jour: Three callers phoned KNX radio to say they had  spotted a man walking a camel down Highland Avenue.  </P> <P> Score another victory for Ski Demski, the Long Beach character who flies a  giant American flag on a 125-foot pole in his front yard.  </P> <P> The city has been trying for years, without success, to have it removed for  allegedly violating noise laws (his Old Glory flaps loudly).  </P> <P> In the meantime, Long Beach recently built a Centennial Plaza downtown to  celebrate its 100th anniversary and decorated it with plaques and tiles paid  for, and signed by, residents. Patriotic Ski bought a plaque that immortalizes  his notorious flag post with this message:  </P> <P> "A Tribute to Old Glory, May She Always Fly High and Free in Long Beach, Ski  Demski. The Pole, 1988."  </P> <P> Demski said with a laugh: "I was surprised they let me put it on city  property."  </P> <P> Local Presidents' Day report:  </P> <P> Washington High was closed as were campuses at Kennedy, Garfield, Monroe, Taft  and Grant. Construction continued on the Ronald Reagan State Office Building  downtown.  </P> <P> Duffers flocked to the Eisenhower, Coolidge, Wilson, Roosevelt, Harding and  Ford (par 3) golf courses.  </P> <P> Traffic was lighter than usual on Jefferson, Hoover, Lincoln and Adams  boulevards, as well as on Madison Avenue in Culver City. There was no rush hour  in the Obscure Chief Executives section of Monterey Park, which features Polk  Way, Harrison Road, Buchanan and Pierce places and Van Buren, Tyler, Taylor and  Fillmore drives.  </P> <P> No problems were reported on the Marina (formerly the Richard M. Nixon)  Freeway.  </P> <P> Late Bulletin: The man walking the camel down Highland Avenue was determined to  be an employee of the visiting Circus Vargas.  </P></p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Appointments: Hierarchy at BTR BTR, one of Britain's most successful but more enigmatic corporate giants, has appointed its first chief operating officer and forgot to tell anyone outside the company. Robert Faircloth, 54, the new occupant of the post, will report directly to chief executive Alan Jackson and will be based at BTR's Silvertown House headquarters in London. Edgar Sharp, 58, executive director America, and Mike Smith, 51, executive director Europe, will report to Faircloth. Until now BTR has had a relatively flat corporate structure but the promotion of Faircloth, who held the same European title as Smith, suggests that the company's management structure is becoming more hierarchical. Hanson, for example, has four chief operating officers, two of whom are based in the US. Faircloth's appointment was made on November 22, but word has only leaked out publicly in the past few days. BTR had notified its own staff internally in November, but said that it saw no need to publicise the fact by reporting it to the Stock Exchange.</p>

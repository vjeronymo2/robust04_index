			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>   [Excerpts] The Belarusian Supreme Soviet Commission for  International Affairs and External Economic Relations held a  session on 13 June dedicated to the issue of the railroad  station at Hadutsishki on the Belarusian-Lithuanian border. As  we all know, the station was built by Belarus in 1979, during  the construction of the Ignalina nuclear power plant. Moscow  then subordinated the station to the Lithuanian Railroads.  After the collapse of the USSR, Lithuania obtained possession  of the station. The latter, however, is located on Belarusian  territory and belongs to us, Belarus. Commission Chairman Ivan  Tsyareshka spoke at the session.    [Begin Tsyareshka recording] The negotiations have been  unjustifiable dragging on for too long. It is difficult to  resolve certain issues with Lithuania -- not just the border  issue, but also that of Belarusian property located on  Lithuanian territory. Meanwhile, we are successfully resolving  similar problems with our other neighbors, including Latvia,  Ukraine, and other republics. [passage omitted]    Tension is growing on a daily basis. We have found ourselves  in an absurd situation: Belarusian freight trains are moving  along Belarusian rails, but the Lithuanian side collects all the  payments just because those trains pass through a small station  named Hadutsishki. Sound thinking has always been part of the  Belarusian mentality, but we must uphold our interests. [end  recording]    Deputy Foreign Minister Stanislaw Ahurtsow, head of the  delegation, pointed out that the Lithuanian side is purposefully  raising a hue and cry over Hadutsishki.    [Begin Ahurtsow recording] [passage omitted] It will be very  difficult to resolve this issue at the level of delegations. We  must engage both the legislature and the government. Here I  have the diplomatic note that was sent to the Lithuanian side on  10 June. Let me read it: The Belarusian Foreign Ministry has  learned from competent sources that at the [words indistinct]  maintenance section, the Lithuanian side is dismantling railroad  tracks and embankments and shipping them out of Belarusian  territory. The ministry voices its protest against such actions  by the Lithuanian side and views them as an encroachment on the  property of the Republic of Belarus. The ministry believes that  these actions will be immediately discontinued and the railroad  tracks restored. The Belarusian side reserves the right to take  appropriate measures to protect its property. [end recording]    The commission produced a draft resolution to be submitted  for approval by the Supreme Soviet Presidium. The resolution  envisions that by 1 September 1994 all the tracks on Belarusian  territory, currently used by the Lithuanian side, be transferred  under the jurisdiction of the Belarusian Railroads. It was  decided to suggest that the Council of Ministers consider the  possibility of building a parallel track at this section of the  Belarusian Railroads.</p>

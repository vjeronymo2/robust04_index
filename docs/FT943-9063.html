			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sizeable pay rises for Guinness directors Directors of Guinness, the brewing and spirits group which in March reported an 11.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1993, have been awarded pay rises of up to 13.6 per cent. The rises, which took effect from the beginning of last month but will not be publicly revealed until publication of the company's 1994 annual report next year, coincide with Guinness bowing to shareholder pressure and abolishing directors' three year rolling contracts. Three executive directors, including Mr Anthony Greener, chairman, have been put on three year fixed term contracts renewable every 12 months. However, Mr Brian Baldock, who is within three years of retiring, remains on a three year rolling contract. The move brings Guinness in line with the demands of Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel, the Pounds 25bn fund management institution. Two months ago Mr Ross Goobey announced that PosTel would be voting against the election of directors who have rolling contracts longer than two years. PosTel's initiative was taken after mounting frustration at large pay-outs to directors when they are forced to resign. In its most recently published report and accounts, for the 1993 year, Guinness revealed that it had agreed to pay Pounds 670,000 to Mr Crispin Davis, an executive director until his resignation last October. Mr Davis had been on a three year rolling contract. Guinness said that the move to fixed term contracts came after the company had 'listened to shareholders'. Just four months ago the company stated that it had no intention of amending the rolling contracts. Three Guinness directors have had salary rises although the pay of Mr Greener has again been frozen at Pounds 600,000 - in line with an agreement he made with the company when he became chairman in January 1993. The basic salary of Mr Philip Yea, finance director, rose by Pounds 30,000 - 13.6 per cent - to Pounds 250,000 while the pay of Mr Brendan O'Neill, appointed a director last April, rose from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds 270,000, an increase of 12.5 per cent. Mr Baldock's basic pay rose from Pounds 335,000 to Pounds 360,000 - an increase of 7.5 per cent. The company said that the contract change and salary rises were both decisions made by the committee of non-executive directors. Its members include Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, and Sir David Plastow, chairman of Inchcape. Guinness stressed that accounting changes, including a Pounds 173m charge principally relating to goodwill, were behind the fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 795m to Pounds 702m during 1993. On a comparable basis, however, pre-tax profit fell by 1 per cent - 4 per cent at level exchange rates - to Pounds 908m.</p>

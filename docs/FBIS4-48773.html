			<p>BFN     [Text] The United Nations Security Council has lifted the  arms embargo against South Africa. The arms embargo, the last  of the United Nations punitive measures against apartheid, was  lifted after a unanimous decision at the Security Council  meeting in New York yesterday. The council also rescinded a  1984 resolution urging all states to refrain from importing  products of South Africa's own arms industry.    In an address before the vote South African Deputy President  Thabo Mbeki said the move would show that the body had accepted  that South Africa had become a democratic country. Mr. Mbeki  called for the speedy creation of a nuclear-weapons-free zone in  Africa and he asked for help in converting South Africa's  military technology to civilian uses.    It's expected that South Africa could regain its membership  of the United Nations General Assembly as early as next month,  after an absence of 20 years.</p>

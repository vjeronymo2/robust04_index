			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ulrich Rosenbaum: "FDP Makes Premature Decision </F> for Coalition With Union"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Presidium of the Free Democratic Party  of Germany [FDP] yesterday unanimously decided to make a  statement in favor of continuing the Bonn government coalition  with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union  [CSU]. The recommendation is to be presented to the Executive  Committee on 2 May and to the federal party congress in Rostock  at the beginning of June.    FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel had suggested that the Presidium  make a quick decision in order to end the debate on the  coalition statement. He said that factual work had been pushed  too far into the background over the past few weeks.    Over the weekend, FDP honorary chairman Hans-Dietrich  Genscher said in an interview with DIE WELT that the public  debate has made things difficult for Kinkel and announced: "He  will clarify things very quickly now."    A decision in favor of continuing the coalition under Helmut  Kohl had generally been expected. Kinkel did not give the exact  wording yesterday. The FDP chairman only said: "Anybody who  wants to prevent a red-green [Social Democratic Party of  Germany, SPD, and Greens] formation, or a grand coalition, must  vote for the FDP."    This way the question of whether the FDP reserves the right  to cooperate with the SPD in case the CDU/CSU does not manage to  achieve a government majority, remains open. Secretary General  Werner Hoyer had been talking of a "conditional" coalition  statement recently. Kinkel made a point of stating that the  coalition statement is not a preliminary decision of the 23 May  presidential election. If others establish such a connection "I  cannot do anything about it," the party chairman said.    Only the timing was surprising for the chancellor, not the  contents of the coalition statement, said Helmut Kohl's  supporters yesterday. Rudolf Scharping, the SPD candidate for  chancellor, is thus coming under pressure to state clearly  himself with whom he wants to form a coalition. Bonn is not  Mainz, where he could dodge a clear statement before the  elections. Also, it is a known fact that the FDP does not  consider the presidential election to be a matter of being loyal  to their coalition partners.    CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze yesterday spoke of a  "decision as expected." Thus, the choice on 16 October is  either continuing the present coalition or going SPD/Greens.</p>

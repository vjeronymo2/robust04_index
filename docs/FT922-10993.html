			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Virgin launches 'Mid Class' travel VIRGIN ATLANTIC Airways is to follow other intercontinental carriers by offering three classes of travel. The company launched its 'Mid Class' service yesterday for passengers who have paid full price for economy tickets. They will have a separate cabin and more legroom. Until now, Virgin has sold seats only in economy class and upper class, where prices were roughly comparable with business class on other airlines. Fewer than 4 per cent of Virgin passengers pay the full transatlantic economy one-way fare of between Pounds 334 and Pounds 404. Discounted tickets can be as cheap as Pounds 99 but there are restrictions on travel dates. Virgin hopes Mid Class will push the proportion of full-fare passengers up to 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / More appeals likely against tax decisions A steep increase in the number of appeals against tax decisions is expected to follow reforms to the appeal procedures to be phased in over the next four months. The reforms will make it easier to challenge rulings by Customs &amp; Excise and open the procedure for appealing against the Inland Revenue to public scrutiny. The VAT and Duties Tribunal will for the first time hear appeals against Customs &amp; Excise duty assessments from January 1. These assessments now can be challenged only in the High Court, with appeals taking two years to be heard. At the same time, the special commissioners who hear appeals by taxpayers over Inland Revenue decisions are opening their proceedings to the public from today after nearly 200 years of secrecy. Tax appeals to the special commissioners lodged from today will be heard in public unless the taxpayer wants it to be in private. The commissioners' decisions will also now be published, providing information to taxpayers and their advisers that was previously available only to tax inspectors. Judge Stephen Oliver, who presides over both bodies, said yesterday he expected the reforms to encourage a higher level of appeals against tax decisions. He predicted that appeals against Revenue decisions would rise by 10 per cent to 15 per cent as taxpayers and their advisers saw commissioners' decisions. 'Openness will stimulate accountants, lawyers and advisers to appeal against decisions which they had previously thought were beyond challenge,' he said. On Customs &amp; Excise duties, the judge estimated that the tribunal might attract 160 to 200 appeals a year compared with the four or five cases which come to the High Court under the present arrangements. The tribunal will be able to review a wide range of administrative decisions by Customs &amp; Excise relating to duties. These include licensing arrangements for bonded warehouses, the imposition of anti-dumping duties and deadlines for payment of duties. The tribunal will also hear appeals over two new taxes introduced in the November Budget last year: the insurance premium tax from October 1, and the air passenger duty from November 1. Judge Oliver said he planned to recruit new members to reflect the expansion of the tribunal's remit. Representative bodies affected by Customs &amp; Excise duties, insurance premium tax and air passenger duty would be invited to put names forward. He also intended to create a users' committee to advise him on the work of the special commissioners. This would review their rules and procedures and make recommendations about facilities for those appearing before the commissioners.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kaleem Akhtar: "U.S. Wants To Make India </F> Regional Policeman To Protect Its Interests"]    [Text] There is no doubt that the United States showed  enough interest in the "Kashmir freedom struggle" to call it a  live issue that needed resolution. President Clinton also  mentioned the movement in Kashmir. This was the first time in  many years that a U.S. president had recognized this fact. The  Indian media's hue and cry over this was natural. Since the  freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir changed into an armed  confrontation; Kashmiri workers, journalists, and politicians  started having contacts with the outside world; Kashmir centers  were established in the United States, England, Canada, and  Saudi Arabia; and many "NGOs" [nongovernmental organizations]  have become active, the Kashmir issue has become prevalent all  over again. In this context, we cannot ignore Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto's hard work. She bravely and astutely presented  the Kashmir issue at all international forums and during her  foreign travels. The fact that Pakistan could not present its  resolution effectively in Geneva does not mean that Pakistan has  adopted flexibility in its fundamental stand or the freedom  struggle of Kashmiri people has weakened. Therefore, it is  appropriate to say that Pakistan is still firm on its stand and  the Kashmiri people are still active in the battle field.    This whole exercise, which also includes India's "exercise  in  atrocities," has helped the whole world to at least understand  that Jammu and Kashmir are not an "integral part" of India; that  this is a disputed region about which the UN Security Council  has passed resolutions. The Kashmiris are fighting against  India's invasion and control and India is using military power  to stop them and is violating human rights there.    As for the United States, the Kashmiris living there have  convinced the U.S. politicians, intellectuals, and journalists  that India is committing bestial actions in occupied Kashmir.  That is why the U.S. press, which used to publish one-sided news  to do its duty to support India in the past, is also publishing  some real facts. Pakistani and Kashmiri representatives have  also succeeded in establishing their lobbies in the United  States. Although the pro-India factions had worked hard for the  last four and a half years to have Pakistan declared a  "terrorist" or a "fundamentalist" nation, they were unsuccessful  and the U.S. government has agreed that Pakistan is not involved  in any kind of terrorism.    Thus, the pro-India group in the United States including  famous author Selig Harrison has been forced to admit that the  present movement in occupied Kashmir is purely a people's  movement against Indian occupation of Kashmir. The fact is that  India has a major lobby in the United States supported by Jews.  These people repeat the story that India feeds them. This Jewish  group includes Stephen Solarz, William Shuazberg, James Claude,  and Selig Harrison. Their job is to sing India's song all the  time. The reason for this is their enmity towards Islam. If  these American intellectuals see any danger after the fall of  communism, then it is Islam. They are also afraid of China in  Asia. Anyhow, what I am trying to say is that the efforts of  Pakistanis and Kashmiris have stopped the progress of the Indian  lobby and it was the result of their efforts that a group in the  United States has emerged now that discusses Kashmir. Some of  these condemn human rights violations, others mention other  options for solving this dispute, and still others offer ways to  conciliate.    We cannot forget Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs  Robin Raphel's role in this context. She issued several  statements about the Kashmir campaign during the last few months  and openly supported the idea that India should resolve this  issue fully and make the UN Security Council and Shimla  Agreement the basis of these efforts. India reacted to it  strongly and the Indian government complained to the Unites  States to take notice of Ms. Robin Raphel's statements. It is  important to mention the fact that Assistant Secretary Robin  Raphel went to India uninvited recently and explained her  statements related to Kashmir. She emphasized that she had never  challenged the idea of Kashmir joining India, and had only said  that Kashmir is a disputed issue and should be resolved, and  this is possible under the Shimla Agreement.    Now who will ask Ms. Robin Raphel who will push India in  this  direction? India never started talks according to the Shimla  Agreement. It has been repeatedly saying that Jammu and Kashmir  are India's "integral part" and if there is a problem, then it  is: when will the Line of Control accepted as a permanent  border. The problem is that a faction in the United States,  which is associated with the government, accepts the influence  of India's propaganda and wants to sing the song of making the  Line of Control the permanent border. Recently, a U.S.  professor, Tom Travis, said in Peshawar that the Line of Control  should be accepted as an international border. Meanwhile, U.S.  Senator Dan Burton believes that the present Kashmiri campaign  is a bona fide campaign and can be compared to the U.S. War of  Independence. According to him, India should recognize Kashmiri  people's right to self-determination. Both these points are  being discussed in the United States now and the Kashmiri people  have made it clear as day with their unprecedented and  innumerable sacrifices that Jammu and Kashmir are not, and never  will be, "integral parts" of India. However, during the last few  days, especially after Mr. Talbott's return from Pakistan, the  United States has become quiet about the Kashmir issue. His  visit to Pakistan was declared to be successful, however, on  what basis this trip called successful has not been known to us  yet. One thing is clear; there was no mention of Kashmir in the  joint communique. The truth is that the United States has  economic relations with India and it is investing in Indian  projects. Ms. Robin Raphel said in her clarification that the  United States is the largest investor in India and that both  nations want to encourage peace and human rights. The United  States and India have the same viewpoint. Late Maulana Zaffar  Ali Khan had said once, [couplet] "A drunkard who tells the  truth in his drunken state is a lot better person than a  religious person." The same can be said about Robin Raphel. We  have been crying from the beginning that India and the United  States are both together because the anti-Islamic attitude of  the United States and India is not a secret to any one. The  living example of this is the establishment of Israel and now  India and Israel are together and the Israeli commandos are  working side-by-side with Indian soldiers to crush the freedom  fighters in Kashmir. This is the lobby that India created in the  United States. Thus, the United States which claims to be a  champion of peace and humanity all over the world, adopts double  standards when it comes to dealing with Muslims. It throws its  own principles out the window and puts pressure on Pakistan,  some time back having asked it to roll back its nuclear program.  Other times it has harassed Pakistan by accusing it of  fundamentalism and terrorism. Now it is asking us to "freeze"  Kashmir. This is done mostly because Pakistan is considered weak  and conspiracies are afoot to isolate it in the world. All this  is done because, as Ilama Iqbal said, [couplet] "The lord of  fate had ordered from the beginning that punishment for the  crime of being weak is sudden death." The fact is that after  Talbott's visit to Pakistan, our relations with the United  States have neither cooled nor warmed up. The United States  wants Pakistan to roll back its nuclear program, however,  Pakistan is neither willing to do so now nor will it ever agree  to it. Pakistan's security and existence is tied to this problem  and Pakistan's established enemy is India which is already a  nuclear power and is not willing to sign the NPT. According to  political observers, India will be ready to sign the NPT when it  has attained its goal to forcing Pakistan to sign it.    The truth is that the United States wants to make India the  policeman of this region so that Pakistan does not become a  major power. Pakistan's progress and prosperity will benefit the  Islamic nations most and the United States wants to keep all  Islamic countries as its "subordinate dependents." It wants to  make Israel strong on one side and Pakistan weak on the other  side. Its stand on Iran is similar and it had destroyed Iraq  under this policy. The other aspect of the U.S. politics is that  it does not want to provide India with a "free" atmosphere so  that it does not unite with China which could confront the "new  world order." Since Iran, China, and India talked about regional  unity, the U.S. fears have increased. Therefore, the United  States has to review its changed Kashmir policy to make India  happy and sent Robin Raphel to India to further explain the  position and remove Indian misunderstandings. In other words,  India has blackmailed the United States to achieve its goals.  Thus the defeat the United States has faced in its Kashmir  policy is the result of India's pressure. It is our bad luck  that we do not have a "lever" that we can use to pressure India.  In this situation, we need to review Pakistan's foreign policy  now.</p>

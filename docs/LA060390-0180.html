			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD STATE HIGH SCHOOL MEET;  </P> <P> BAKERSFIELD GIRLS WIN EARLY, MUIR BOYS WIN THEIR TITLE LATE  </P> <P> Mike Sulcer of Pasadena Muir knew the Mustangs needed to finish in at least  second place in the 1,600-meter relay to win the boys' state track and field  team title Saturday night before 10,470 at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Sulcer, who ran the anchor leg, already had scored 10 points for Muir by  winning the 400 meters, but the Mustangs' 14 points trailed first-place  Lompoc's 20 going into the meet's final event.  </P> <P> But Muir won its fifth boys' state championship with 24 points by winning the  1,600-meter relay in 3:14.00.  </P> <P> "It was the last quarter of the season and we had to take first in an event we  take pride and joy in," said Sulcer, who ran a 46.9-second anchor leg.  </P> <P> Muir's relay team's effort offset an outstanding meet by Lompoc's Napoleon  Kaufman, who accounted for all of the Braves' points. Kaufman, a junior, won  the 100 meters in 10.57 seconds and the 200 in 21.15.  </P> <P> Carson, behind Curtis Hawkins' victory in the 110-meter high hurdles in 14.41  seconds and the Colts' runner-up 400-meter relay team, finished tied with  Fallbrook for third place with 18 points. Brent Noon, the state shotput  record-holder, scored all of Fallbrook's points by winning the shotput (74 feet  4 3/4 inches) and finishing second in the discus (200-8).  </P> <P> City champion Washington, a pre-meet favorite, finished out of the running when  two-time City sprint champ Donovan Burks suffered a hamstring injury in  Friday's preliminaries.  </P> <P> After failing to win a state championship the last two years, Coley Candaele of  Carpinteria outdueled Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande in the 1,600 meters to  win his first title in 4:06.26.  </P> <P> Quintana tried to combat Candaele's strong finishing kick by quickening the  pace after 800 meters, but that tactic failed when Candaele took the lead with  300 meters remaining.  </P> <P> "(Quintana) had to run a race like that, but I was not going to let this one  slip away," Candaele said, who finished out of the running in the 800-meter  final one hour later. "The 1,600 took a lot out of me for the 800, but I had to  get at least one title."  </P> <P> Competition for the girls' team title was basically over one hour into the  meet, as Bakersfield finished 1-2 in the shotput and then won the 400-meter  relay to score a quick 28 points.  </P> <P> Bakersfield finished with 61 points to Inglewood Morningside's 30. The bulk of  Bakersfield's scoring came in the shotput and discus, with Dawn Dumble and  Melisa Weis accounting for 18 points each. Sophomore Janice Nichols won the 400  meters in 53.89 seconds, fastest time in the nation by a high school girl this  season.  </P> <P> Freshman Marion Jones of Oxnard Rio Mesa easily won the 100 and 200 meters in  11.67 and 23.71, respectively.  </P> <P> Defending state champions, Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica and Juliana Yendork  of Walnut, joined Jones as double-event winners.  </P> <P> Lipscomb won the 100-meter low hurdles for the second consecutive year in a  national best of 13.58, and then won the 300-meter hurdles by defeating last  year's champion, Twila Sims of Lompoc, 41.69 to 41.76, also a national best.  </P> <P> Yendork, a junior, won the long and triple jumps for the second year in a row  with leaps of 20-1 1/2 and 42-0 1/4.  </P> <P> Kim Toney of Atascadero defended her state title in the 800 meters by winning  in 2:06.13, also a national best this season.  </P></p>

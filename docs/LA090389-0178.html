			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: BROWNE COULD USE (NEIL) YOUNG VOICE;  </P> <P> WHILE BOTH ARE HEAVILY INTO MESSAGE MUSIC, ONE DOES IT WITH POETRY, THE OTHER  WITH A BLUDGEON  </P> <P> In a recent review of Jackson Browne's passionately political new album "World  in Motion," I irritated some of Browne's passionately loyal fans by complaining  that with few exceptions, the whole effort, however well intentioned, unreels  like Newsweek-on-tape.  </P> <P> Filled with songs about the plight of the homeless, about political corruption  at home and abroad, and about the insensitivity of First-World "haves" toward  Third-World "have-notes," the album forces you to reconsider whether complex  international and domestic issues can or even should be reduced to four-minute  rock 'n' roll songs.  </P> <P> It's what another writer was getting at in a review of a Moody Blues album  several years ago, when he described their songwriting style as the  "wrap-up-the-universe-in-three-choruses-and-a-bridge" school.  </P> <P> It's not that I've become less tolerant or more conservative over the years;  philosophically, I agree with most of the positions Browne takes in his songs.  It's the way he states them, the way he seems more like a TV news commentator  or an ardent preacher than a songwriter. His concert last weekend at Irvine  Meadows Amphitheatre only reinforced that feeling.  </P> <P> Proving the converse -- that pop stars can be equally effective as rockers and  as spokesmen and women for social concerns -- Neil Young performed at the  Pacific Amphitheatre the week before Browne, launching what looks to be one of  the most formidable tours of the year.  </P> <P> Browne's problem is that he can't translate deeply felt worries into credible  lyrics. In "How Long," for instance, he poses a perfectly legitimate question:  </P> <P> How long can you hear someone  </P> <P> crying  </P> <P> How long can you ear someone  </P> <P> dying  </P> <P> Before you ask yourself why?  </P> <P>  Timeless as that query may be, as a song it's a pallid recycling of Bob  Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind." Dylan's composition turned into a rallying cry  for the civil-rights and the anti-war movements of the '60s; its rhetorical  questions ("How many times must a man look up/Before he sees the sky?/How many  ears must one man have/Before he can hear people cry?/How many deaths will it  take till he knows/That too many people have died?") crystallize dilemmas that  always have and always will dog humankind.  </P> <P> With Browne, it's when he rails at his most earnest -- and there's no doubting  the sincerity of his convictions -- that he falls hardest.  </P> <P> I come here for Dr. King  </P> <P> Who gave the people a precious  </P> <P> thing...  </P> <P> And I come here to praise Mandela  </P> <P> And to send this message to his  </P> <P> jailer...  </P> <P> We come here to sing for freedom  </P> <P> And to send our voices to the ones  </P> <P> who need them.  </P> <P> Freedom for South Africa  </P> <P> And justice for Nelson Mandela.  </P> <P>  Nelson Mandela probably welcomes any and every voice that joins the chorus  chanting for his release, but rhyming "sing for freedom" with "ones who need  them"? Egad. (Not that rhyming "Mandela"" and "jailer" would have won this guy  any William Blake awards.) Beyond that, the song, "When the Stone Begins to  Turn," strings together slogans more befitting protesters' placards. It simply  doesn't tell us anything we haven't heard (or seen on TV news reports) before.  </P> <P> Where is the perspective, the new light that only an artist can bring to a  familiar situation?  </P> <P> On Browne's album, ironically, it is found in one of the two songs he didn't  write: "My Personal Revenge," by Tomas Borge and Louis Enrique Mejia Godoy,  composers who cry out for gentle victory in the war against oppression:  </P> <P> My personal revenge will be the  </P> <P> right  </P> <P> Of our children in the schools and  </P> <P> in the gardens.  </P> <P> My personal revenge will be to  </P> <P> give you  </P> <P> This song which has flourished  </P> <P> without panic...  </P> <P> My personal revenge will be to tell  </P> <P> you 'Good morning'  </P> <P> On a street without beggars or  </P> <P> homeless.  </P> <P>  That's a political statement, but it's also poetry -- poetry born of  inequality and suffering, a combination that surfaces far too infrequently for  the ardent Jackson Browne.  </P> <P> Neil Young, on the other hand, is every bit as angry over social and political  injustice in his new album "Freedom." But compared to Browne and his studied,  politically correct editorializing, Young has transformed his wrath into  inspired Philippics that consistently jab, sometimes frighteningly so, at the  listener, not merely at the evil-doer.  </P> <P> One of the reasons Young's new material carries such punch is that he hasn't  stuck to easy political stances over the years. Just a few years ago, he was  endorsing Ronald Reagan for President -- a move that assuredly got his name X'd  off the "A" lists for most entertainment-world soirees.  </P> <P> Now he is again examining our dearly held notions of "freedom," both the up and  the downsides that have emerged during this country's 200-plus years. In  "Rockin' in the Free World," the cornerstone song of the album, Young paints a  bleak picture of life on the streets of urban America with such moral outrage  that it's easy to miss the artistic skill he uses to focus his revulsion:  </P> <P> I see a girl in the night  </P> <P> With a baby in her hand  </P> <P> Under an old street light  </P> <P> Near a garbage can.  </P> <P> Now she puts the kid away  </P> <P> And she's gone to get a hit.  </P> <P> She hates her life  </P> <P> And what she's done to it.  </P> <P>  That's a stunning bit of songwriting already, and Young put it across at the  Pacific Amphitheatre in an explosive rendition backed by nothing but his own  acoustic guitar. And he turns the flame up several more notches in the next  verse, as he assesses the result of a life decision made out of desperation:  </P> <P> That's one more kid  </P> <P> That will never go to school  </P> <P> Never get to fall in love  </P> <P> Never get to be cool.  </P> <P> Keep on rockin' in the free world.  </P> <P>  Putting snide emphasis on the word cool, Young in a single syllable pierced  the heart of a culture where being "cool" is often placed above common sense,  family commitment or individual integrity.  </P> <P> And that was just for openers.  </P> <P> "Crime in the City (Sixty to Zero Part 1)" nattily rejects easy stereotypes,  both left and right: that criminals are either hapless victims of circumstance  or the source of all of society's ills and that the police are either heartless  usurpers of power or faultless supermen handcuffed by a criminal-kissing legal  system.  </P> <P> 'There's still crime in the city,'  </P> <P> Said the cop on the beat.  </P> <P> 'I don't know if I can stop it,  </P> <P> I feel like meat on the street...  </P> <P> That's why I'm doin' it my way.  </P> <P> I took the law in my hands.  </P> <P> So here I am in the alleyway,  </P> <P> A wad of cash in my pants.  </P> <P> I get paid by a 10-year-old,  </P> <P> He says he looks up to me.  </P> <P> There's still crime in the city  </P> <P> But it's good to be free'  </P> <P>  Now that's rage at a world in which it seems that all the old rules, the old  tenets about truth, justice and the American way, have fallen by the wayside.  </P> <P> And, equally important, it's a great song.  </P></p>

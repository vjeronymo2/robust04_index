			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: A LOT OF TREASURED JUNK LURKS BEHIND THOSE CLOSED DRAWERS  </P> <P> As my daughter, the neat freak, tugged to free a stuck drawer in the kitchen, I  reached in and expertly removed the church calendar that held it immobile. The  drawer slid out easily.  </P> <P> She gasped as she viewed its contents. "How long did it take you to put  together a drawer like this?"  </P> <P> I looked at the array of eclectic junk, from screwdrivers to birthday candles.  "I have to apologize," I said. "I've been throwing things in this drawer for  only seven years. The one at the old house was great! I tossed stuff in there  for 15 years. Now that was a catch-all drawer!"  </P> <P> My eyes proudly took in the VFW poppy, old lottery ticket, Christmas tree bulb,  plastic packets of ketchup from McDonald's, poker chips, corn holders, pruning  shears, a recipe for Cajun chicken and a telephone number written on a blank  check.  </P> <P> "How can you find anything in here?" she persisted.  </P> <P> "That's the point of a catch-all drawer," I said. "An item is never lost . . .  it's just never really found."  </P> <P> You show me a woman who does not have a junk drawer and I'll show you a woman  who launders her lint. I grew up with these drawers. My grandma had one of the  most impressive catch-all drawers I have ever seen. Hers came with a warning:  Every time you opened it to look for something, her voice would come out of  nowhere, "Don't hurt yourself!" It was like an arsenal -- old razor blades  rested by a ball of crochet thread, rusty pins burrowed under roach traps, and  paring knives were buried among buttons that never matched anything and keys  that never fit anything.  </P> <P> My mother's junk drawer wasn't as large as Grandma's, but it was more creative.  Hers held empty cardboard spindles that at one time held ribbon. She had rolls  of pennies she was going to check someday to see if she had one worth a  thousand dollars. She kept piles of coupons that had expired years ago and jar  lids she hung onto after the jars to them had broken. There was a pile of  warranties for appliances that had died of old age and a booklet of Christmas  carols for the piano. We didn't own a piano.  </P> <P> I have tried to uphold the family tradition of the catch-all drawer. The family  has been supportive, occasionally throwing in a watch that doesn't run anymore  or a half-stick of gum that hardens and crumbles.  </P> <P> I told my daughter, "I'd like to bequeath all of this to you, but you have to  amass your own." She was probably more upset than she let on.  </P></p>

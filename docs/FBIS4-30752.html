			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 27 May -- Shortly after 1530, the head of  Solidarity's national demonstration reached the office of the  Council of Ministers in the center of Warsaw, as the last  participants in the straggling march left Pilsudski Square.    The march was headed by a banner saying "Solidarity always  in  defense of your interests." The marchers chanted slogans,  including: "Cimoszewicz must go," "SLD [Democratic Left  Alliance] to Cuba," "An empty cell for Labor Minister Miller,"  and "Down with the commies."    In his speech at the rally preceding the march, Solidarity  leader Marian Krzaklewski referred to the helicopter observing  the preparations for the demonstration. He suggested that the  government had already prepared a statement saying that the  Solidarity demonstration had been a failure.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Management: Town hall basics - A local council inspired by the private sector The announcement 10 years ago that Courtaulds was closing its Braintree textile operations came as a bitter blow to local people. The problem was not just the disappearance of the Essex town's largest employer, leaving 5,000 workers on the dole. The prospect of them finding new jobs was also severely limited by the then concentration of government aid packages on apparently more deserving regions such as the Midlands and the North. That crisis, however, proved to be the early inspiration for a management revolution at the local council which has since become a model for other local authorities in the UK. The then newly appointed chief executive of Braintree District Council, Charles Daybell, decided that to attract investment the authority would have to concentrate on customer service. As the current assistant chief executive Robert Atkins explains today: 'You don't know when meeting a person at reception whether they will be complaining about their washing or whether they might have 2,000 jobs in their pocket.' Since setting off down this path in the mid-1980s, Braintree has developed a corporate culture drawn from best practice in the private sector which appears to permeate every part of its organisation. As such it belies the still potent image of UK local government firmly rooted in the bureaucratic town hall atmosphere of post-war Britain when gentlemen with waistcoats and fob watches inspected holes in the road and had a form for everything. On the surface, Braintree (population 120,000) appears to have a council not much different from others with modern, brick-built administrative offices at the edge of a tidy Essex town. It is the behaviour of the staff - and the way they deal with people - which has encouraged a steady stream of public-sector managers to beat a path to Braintree's door. 'Like many authorities if we had any terminology for the people we served it was ratepayers, residents, clients,' says Annie Ralph, the current chief executive. 'Now we have customers and what they think and say is paramount,' she adds. People are not only referred to as customers; they are encouraged to complain and told how to complain if they feel services fall below par. The complaints service, which includes a review procedure, is comprehensive and allows the involvement of chief officers and councillors. Staff are trained how to deal with people and how to respond to telephone calls, while concepts such as quality assurance have been taken to heart. All 70 services in the authority have been accredited to the British Standard 5750 on quality. Reading the mission statement and the set of core values, emblazoned like commandments on almost every wall of the headquarters, there is a suspicion that Braintree has had an attack of corporate fadism, an urge to run local services like a McDonald's hamburger bar. But, while its culture does borrow ideas such as TQM and draws on practices developed by organisations such as Marks and Spencer, the authority has attempted to be pragmatic in its application of management and personnel practices. When it decided to look at car parking arrangements, for example, it asked local residents what sort of car park they wanted. 'They said they wanted a hut with an attendant so they got one,' says Atkins. Services, meanwhile, are backed by undertakings. The guarantee on emptying dustbins includes a promise to come back and collect rubbish from a missed bin the same day if the council is contacted by noon or the next working day if the call is in the afternoon. 'We know we can meet such a promise because research has shown us we are likely to miss no more than 200 bins from the 47,500 pick-ups,' explains Atkins. One of the biggest impacts has been in industrial relations which has all the appearance of a rare union and management love-in. John Reeve, the GMB, general union convenor, said: 'I was a shop steward for about 18 years and probably one of the most militant people here. I think it was the authority that made me militant because they didn't understand us.' Today, by contrast, his union file is empty and meetings are overdue. 'There hasn't been anything to discuss, to be honest,' he said. An important catalyst, he believes, was the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering five years ago. 'We were already working towards a better understanding but I think the realisation that both staff and management needed each other or both would be out of work, was a strong influence.' Customer orientation, however, has been at the centre of the changes. In addition to the framing of five core values, the authority decided to invest heavily in staff training, devoting a higher than average percentage of the payroll. It harmonised the workforce - at a cost of Pounds 25,000 - so that all staff were given the same terms and conditions. Political stability in the administration has enabled polices to be introduced with all-party support. The council has been continually hung for the past 10 years. Wider recognition of its achievements came last year when Braintree was nominated as UK representative for the Carl Bertelsmann Prize, a German-based international award for good management in public services. The 1993 prize, focused on public efficiency and democracy in local government, was shared by Phoenix, Arizona and Christchurch, New Zealand, with Braintree among the runners up. 'The council managed to effect a close working relationship between elected members and officials without in any way subverting the political control of the authority,' Michael Clark, former chief executive of the local government management board and a member of the nominating panel, says. 'The basic theme of what it's about has percolated down through the institution and into the community at large. People have respect for it. Despite the high-flown stuff they have actually managed to keep their eye on the basics and they do the basics very well.'</p>

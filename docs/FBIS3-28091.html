Import bans, effective under the import  diversification system, will also be lifted on some consumer  products such as plastic household utensils. Imports of some  farm products, which have recently shown steep price spirals,  will be made as soon as possible to place curbs on soaring  prices.    These are the highlights of a package of anti-inflation  steps  announced by the Economic Planning Board [EPB] yesterday.    Deputy Premier-Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok  chaired a meeting of economic ministers to discuss these and  other anti-inflation measures. The measures are in response to  mounting public criticism about soaring inflation.    The National Statistical Office [NSO] on Tuesday announced  that consumer prices surged a whopping 1.3 percent in January,  boosted by the rise in public-service charges and sharp  increases in prices of some farm products.    Economists warn of inflationary pressure building up more  strongly, citing some factors which would hurt the nation's  price stability. To create long-term stability in  private-service charges, the anti-inflation steps call for  easing entry restrictions in the private-service sector across  the board. Specifically, the license system now used for new  beauty parlors, barber shops, public bath houses and lodging  places will be changed to a registration or report system to  encourage competition.    Criteria governing the opening of various private  institutions will also be eased to facilitate the opening of  these institutions. "The easing of restrictions will help spark  freer competition, thus contributing to reign in rises in  private-service charges," an EPB official said.    To stabilize prices of manufactured goods, the package  envisages phasing out import restrictions on some consumer  goods, particularly those imported from Japan, such as household  utensils made of glass and plastics.    The EPB also urged manufacturers not to raise prices of  their  goods by absorbing price-raising factors through technological  development while threatening to slap sanctions against those  who try to raise prices through collusion.    The government also plans to release state-held rice without  limit to curb rising rice prices. In January alone, rice prices  soared a whopping 3.1 percent, according to the NSO. Onions,  garlic, salt and powdered milk will be imported massively.  Imports of onions and garlic are planned at 3,000 tons,  respectively, this month and for the whole of this year, about  78,000 tons of salt will be imported.    The EPB said the government will exert utmost effort to  stabilize price increases of 30 basic necessities which affect  public livelihood significantly at below 4 percent in 1994.  They are rice, beef, pork, eggs, garlic, onions, sugar, ramyon  [instant noodles], wheat flour, salt, footwear, TVs,  refrigerators, toys, yontan [coal brickets], propane and so on.    The government will also focus on minimizing rises in  public-service charges by urging public utilities to refrain  from high increases through management renovation.    The EPB sees curbing this year's inflation rate, as measured  by consumer prices, at below 6 percent. Last year, the consumer  price index soared 5.8 percent.</p>

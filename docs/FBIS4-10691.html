			<p>BFN     [Text] Carlos Lage Davila, vice president of the Council of  State, has urged sugar industry workers throughout the country  to continue exhibiting the same spirit in the final stage of the  harvest.    During the assessment of the current sugar harvest in the  southeastern region, Lage presented to Granma the banners  acknowledging the province as the best of three during the first  10 days of April. Reporter Jorge Luis Batista has a recording by  Lage on this matter:    [Begin Lage recording] A political message of a sugar  harvest  that is beginning to recover is a very positive political  message, one that helps and encourages us to tackle the  situation and to confront the daily difficulties.    I don't know whether I need to make a call for a final  effort, because the appraisal that we have from all comrades is  that the maximum effort is being made. The call must be to  maintain that maximum effort during this harvest, because this  is what will bring the nation resources, although these  resources will be very limited because the harvest is still  limited. Nevertheless, I am leaving with the conviction that the  three provinces being assessed will fulfill their objectives --  especially Granma, because I had the opportunity to listen to  the directors of the different complexes and I think the people  are making the efforts that are necessary for the Revolution.

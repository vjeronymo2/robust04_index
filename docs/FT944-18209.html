			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Eko Stahl sale to Belgians faces aid probe The German economics ministry and the Treuhand privatisation agency have agreed to sell the last of east Germany's steel mills to Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian steel producer, in a deal likely to meet resistance from the European Commission. The privatisation of Eko Stahl, one of the few remaining large industrial complexes to be sold, will be referred to Brussels after the Treuhand board agrees to the privatisation contract next Friday. The Commission has already questioned, but not prevented, part of the DM1.3bn (Pounds 530m) subsidies which the Treuhand has granted to Eko Stahl since 1990. Mr Gunther Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, yesterday said he expected 'bitter resistance' from Brussels to the sale, particularly since Cockerill is seeking substantial state and federal grants for its investment commitment of more than DM530m in Eko Stahl. A further investment package of DM770m will be provided, with the federal government and the state of Brandenburg, where Eko Stahl is located, each providing DM150m and the Treuhand DM470m. Cockerill will pay DM30m for a 60 per cent stake, with an option on the remaining 40 per cent which will be held by the Treuhand. In an attempt to win support for Cockerill's plans in Brussels, Mr Rexrodt said he had already begun talks with Riva, the privately-owned Italian steel producer, to reduce capacity in its plants in eastern Germany. Riva had been the front-runner to buy Eko Stahl until it unexpectedly withdrew its offer last May. Mr Rexrodt added that he also expected resistance from British Steel, but said such objections were unwarranted since British Steel received DM27bn in subsidies in the early 1980s before it was sold. A Cockerill spokesman said the investments would be used to re-build a blast furnace and build a hot-rolling mill with the aim of establishing an intergrated steel mill in the region. But Germany's Steel Federation yesterday said there was only room for a cold-rolling mill at Eko Stahl, adding that there was already an excess of hot-rolling capacity in the EU. Cockerill, which already has a small steel mill and a steel services division in eastern Germany, said it was anxious to 'gain a greater foothold in the German market as well as eventually tap the markets in eastern Europe'. The sale of Eko Stahl, which last year had a turnover of DM1bn on annual losses of DM150m, follows several attempts by the Treuhand to find a buyer for the mill, which is located in Eisenhuttenstadt, one of the more depressed regions in eastern Germany. The Treuhand, backed by Bonn, opted, for political and social reasons, to keep Eko Stahl open despite overcapacity in the German steel industry. The mill, which employed more than 12,300 people before German unification and produced 2.2m tonnes of steel, has since reduced the workforce to under 3,000 and its capacity to under 1m tonnes.</p>

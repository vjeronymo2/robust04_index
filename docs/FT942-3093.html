			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No doubt about estimates of beer imports to UK Sir, I was surprised by Mr Pressnell's assertion (Personal View, June 9) that BLRA data on duty-paid imports might not be defensible. The Calais effect has clearly given rise to uncertainty in France as to the precise fall in the French domestic market which occurred in 1993, but Mr Pressnell admits personal imports from France in 1993 were 'around 800,000 hectolitres, perhaps 1m at the most'. This is in line with the BLRA's estimate of the growth of personal imports that year, bearing in mind that personal imports were already running at more than 900,000 hectolitres per annum in 1992. Mr Pressnell says that beer duty receipts were higher (by 0.08 per cent) in 1993 than in 1992. But the effective rate of duty was 6 per cent higher overall in 1993 than 1992. This leaves plenty of room for a fall in domestic beer sales in 1993 of about 2 per cent and for the BLRA's estimate of the growth in duty-paid imports. The BLRA has never predicted increasing duty-paid imports would nullify the strong growth in the take-home beer market. Nevertheless, 1992 growth of, say, 5 per cent was reduced to 2 per cent in 1993 and pub and club beer sales fell by 3.8 per cent. Mr Pressnell's figures for vehicle journeys across the Channel appear to assume that all journeys are made through Dover. Although Dover is undoubtedly the largest passenger port for the Continent, 40 per cent of all journeys go through other ports - Ramsgate, Folkestone, Portsmouth, Newhaven, Plymouth, Harwich, etc. He disregards the 624,000 return trips made by coaches and commercial vehicles through Dover. The figure of 8.5m return passenger trips in 1993 is too low even for Dover, the correct figure being 9.2m. Moreover, about one-third of all duty-paid imports of beer are carried in transit vans carrying on average a full load of 860 litres. The actual average load per car is less than 50 litres, less than half the guideline level per person of 110 litres and the same as the old allowance per person. Mr Pressnell's article gives no ground whatever for doubting the BLRA's estimates. M H Rees, secretary, Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association, 42 Portman Square, London W1</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Janet Bush and James Landale report: "Bank Governor Warns </F> Treasury Over Risks of Dash for Growth"]    [Text] Brussels -- The Governor of the Bank of England,  increasingly on a collision course with the Chancellor over  interest rate policy, yesterday warned the Government against  going for faster growth because of its political problems and  the risk of a 1980's-style boom and bust.    Eddie George, the ever more outspoken Governor, urged the  Government not to be tempted into "policy short-termism" but to  pursue steady and sustained growth. He appealed to the  Government and the public to get used to the idea of a slow  recovery with none of the feel-good factor of the 1980's boom.    In a speech to businessmen last night he acknowledged that  people were saying that it still does not feel much like a  recovery. "But that is precisely the point -- we have to avoid  the excesses of the late 1980's, which felt wonderfully good in  the short term, but which were the root cause of the misery that  followed," Mr George said.    His speech came the day after the Bank of England published  its latest Inflation Report, published every three months, which  indirectly blamed the recent rise in interest rates on Britain's  money and bond markets on the Chancellor's insistence at his  February meeting with the governor on a quarter-point cut in  base rates.    Officials at the Bank are increasingly concerned that the  Government, battered by the poor showing in the local polls and  the prospect of heavy defeats in next months European elections,  will be tempted to throw away its anti-inflation discipline in  favour of a politically popular go-for-growth policy.    The Governor's call yesterday for cautious  "stability-oriented" policies came on the day that the European  Commission revised downwards its prediction for British economic  growth next year. The Commission said that Britain would  probably achieve the 2.5 percent growth rate estimated by the  Treasury this year, but now believes that tax increases will  slow growth to only 2.3 percent next year. In November, the  Commission had been looking for 2.7 percent growth in 1995.    Although Britain is currently outperforming the rest of  Europe, which entered recession much later, the latest  Commission growth forecasts predict that Britain will have a  slower rate of growth next year than the rest of the Community,  which it expects to rise to 2.5 percent.    Mr George's hard-line stance on interest rates, underlined  in  both the Inflation Report and in his speech last night, is  likely to put him on a collision course with Kenneth Clarke, the  Chancellor, particularly if the economic recovery decelerates  later this year because of higher taxes.    The Bank's criticism of the February 8 rate cut has now  become highly public, to increasing irritation within the  Treasury. The cut was decided only after a difficult two-day  meeting, with Mr George opposed to another easing in monetary  policy and Mr Clarke arguing for a larger 0.5-point cut.    The Bank has become increasingly public in its views about  economic management, aided by Mr Clarke who has campaigned for  more openness in economic policy decision-making but who is now  having to face the consequences in the form of a publicly  critical central bank.    On the February 8 base rate signal, Mr Clarke said that it  was "as plain as a pikestaff" that the decision to cut was the  right one. Mr George was unrepentant about his opposition,  saying: "It is debatable whether I lost the argument. I lost  the decision."    The City was disappointed yesterday with news that Britain's  manufacturing production had fallen by 0.5 percent in March and  that even industrial output, which includes North Sea oil and  gas, had fallen by 0.6 percent.</p>

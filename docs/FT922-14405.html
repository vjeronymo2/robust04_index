			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Stepping in where others fear to tread - David Barchard considers National Australia's growth in the UK FIVE YEARS ago, while the large French and German banks were hesitantly eyeing the UK retail banking market for opportunities, a relatively little known outsider from the other side of the world, National Australia Bank, unexpectedly bought Clydesdale and Northern Bank from Midland and became the first large foreign entrant into the UK retail banking market. Since then, barring a few mortgage operations, the large European banks have stayed outside UK retail banking. Meanwhile, National Australia has established a strong group of regional banks in the UK and Ireland, including National Irish Bank and since April 1990, Yorkshire, the largest regional and one of the stars of the British retail banking scene. It has spent a total of Pounds 1.5bn on the four banks. In return it has got an impressive cluster of regional banking subsidiaries. Yorkshire has 261 branches and assets of Pounds 4.4bn with a 24 per cent market share in the Yorkshire Humberside region. Clydesdale has assets of Pounds 5.1bn and 346 branches and a 22 per cent share in Scotland; Northern has assets of Pounds 2bn and 100 branches with a 34 per cent market share in Northern Ireland and nearly 50 per cent of the commercial banking in the province. National Irish Bank, a smaller Dublin-based bank, has Pounds 800m in assets and 52 branches, 5 per cent of its national market. National Australia has kept a low profile and many of its UK customers may never have heard its name, but it is now the only well-established outside presence in high street banking in the UK. And in a time of market turbulence, so far none of its purchases has gone wrong. 'Our group performance is already superior to that of most of the banks in the UK,' says Mr Alan Diplock, chief general manager, Australian Bank, who headed the UK operations until recently. Breaking into UK retail banking was a fateful step for a retail bank on the other side of the world which had previously only had representative offices in south east Asia and the US. National Australia ranks as Australia's third largest bank with group assets of ADollars 92.5bn (Pounds 41bn) of which ADollars 64.6bn are in Australia. Judged by market capitalisation, it is the second largest bank. A strong retail bank with a dominant position at home, it is in search of larger markets outside its homeland, with its sights on opportunities in regional retail banking. The choice was between the US and the UK. The latter was selected mainly because opportunities arose at the right time. Instead of trying to forge a new UK bank under its own name, National Australia has kept its subsidiaries as separately branded units with a strong regional flavour. At the same time it has tried to develop pooled back office functions, such as computer systems, product development, marketing, and credit policy. The only serious snags so far seem to have come at Clydesdale where Pounds 5m of new cash had to be injected to improve computer systems and procedures, along with Pounds 50m in retained earnings. However, the processing and administration are an opportunity to cut costs by centralising operations. National Australia has built a new processing and information technology centre at Clydebank and is slowly converting it from NCR to IBM. The centre will eventually service all the group's UK retail banking operations and develop systems for possible use by the group across the world. Yorkshire Bank, previously owned by four of the big clearers, was by far the most expensive acquisition at Pounds 976.5m cash, three times its net asset value. The high price raised some eyebrows. 'We had already banks in Northern Ireland and Scotland, and we wanted one in England. It was more of the jigsaw and we had to pay to get it. It would have been quite different if we had paid Pounds 1bn for Yorkshire as a stand-alone operation.' Mr Max Bray, who took over as UK general manager early this year, may find his time is spent consolidating operations rather than planning fresh purchases. But another acquisition cannot be ruled out. Certainly National Australia has the cash. Early in 1990 it raised ADollars 1bn in a rights issue mainly for expansion. 'We are in an acquisitive mode at the moment,' said Mr Diplock. He added that all suitable opportunities in the UK would be considered. At the moment Yorkshire is expanding its branch network southwards at the rate of six new branches a year. At that rate, National Australia would take quite a while to achieve its goal of branch coverage of the entire UK. The other options are to buy a building society and incorporate its branch network or to 'cold-start' more new branches. Mr Diplock does not rule buying a building society but points out that its attractiveness remains to be seen. It would be uncharted territory involving persuading its members to vote for its demutualisation along the way and retraining its staff. He also pointed out: 'It is also impossible to know what premium you would have to pay when a building society came on the market.'</p>

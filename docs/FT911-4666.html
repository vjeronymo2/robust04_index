			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian earnings from leather exports up 30% INDIAN raised its earnings from exports of leather and leather goods by 30 per cent to Rs26bn (Pounds 712m) in the year to the end of March. However, earnings fell Rs2bn short of the target, which many felt to be over-optimistic. The export target for the current year of Rs34bn also appears unrealistic. The Council of Leather Exports believes that the volume of exports in 1991-92 will not be much more than last year. It points to adverse developments such as the difficulty in opening letters of credit for the import of raw materials, the acute foreign exchange crisis and the delay in support payments and duty drawbacks to exporters. The council considers highly encouraging the 45 per cent growth in exports to Germany, which accounts for more than 20 per cent of total Indian leather exports Germany has banned the import of leather containing pentachloraphenol (PCP), which has been found to be carcinogenic. However, the chemical is still used by some tanneries in India in the early stages of leather processing. The use of PCP, in however small a quantity, could create a crisis of confidence among other foreign buyers. Following the example of Germany, the US and the Soviet Union are also to ban the import of leather containing PCP.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Angst over Aerospace British Aerospace always finds a way of disappointing the market. Yesterday the problem was cash flow. During the half year to end-June, there was a net cash outflow of Pounds 202m, despite the fact that BAe sold Rover for Pounds 800m during the period. There were reasonable explanations: bank guarantees to associate Hutchison Telecom were replaced by a Pounds 220m loan; and Pounds 250m of cash relating to work done in the half year actually arrived at the end of 1993. But the fact is that most analysts were surprised by the outflow, so some mark-down in the shares was in order. Yesterday's drop of over 5 per cent, though, looks excessive: the sharpest profit downgrades are hard to square with the board's decision to raise dividends by 21 per cent. Moreover, the medium-term outlook is encouraging. Profits at BAe's defence business will be spurred on by lower costs and higher volumes. This week's promise by King Fahd to Mr John Major, the prime minister, that Saudi Arabia would turn to the UK for 'all our defence needs' could also point to further lucrative contracts from that source. Meanwhile, Airbus's profits are taking off and there may even be good news on turboprops, a source of much red ink. Negotiations to merge the operations of several European suppliers and cut capacity are making progress. If the right deal can be concluded, BAe's losses from the business  -estimated to be around Pounds 150m annually - could shrink rapidly. BAe has caused investors much anxiety in recent years, so yesterday's jitters are hardly surprising. But the underlying business is in relatively good shape.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Managers attack quality of training Employers would like more official help in weeding out poor providers of training, on which they are estimated to spend more than Pounds 18bn a year, says an Industrial Society survey published today, Lisa Wood writes. The survey says half of Britain's managers believe a significant amount of the staff training they pay for is 'very poor'. Much more than a third of the 531 managers surveyed felt that increased regulation was desirable. Half of them agreed that there should be some kind of system to licence approved trainers. The society describes the concern over training quality as 'alarming'. But it does not support a licensing system, which it says might be bureaucratic. Instead, it calls for training bodies to draw up agreed criteria to help employers judge the effectiveness of trainers.</p>

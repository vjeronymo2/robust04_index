			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Q&amp;A, Briefcase: My hobby and self-employment I have followed your correspondence relating to tax liability arising from a hobby and, as a result, have declared sales from my hobby to the Inland Revenue. They have agreed that costs far outweigh any profit and no tax liability arises. The Department of Social Security is now requiring me to register as self-employed and I am resisting this on the grounds that this is a non-commercial venture and without the necessary intent to make a profit there can be no question of employment. Can you tell me if I am justified in my refusal to register as self-employed? What, if any, appeal lies from the local Department of Social Security and what sanctions are they able to apply? I have sufficient contributions to draw a full retirement pension when I reach 65. I am a higher rate tax-payer but do not seek to offset the loss on my hobby against my tax bill. The first thing is to get yourself exempted from class 2 contributions for the future (and the past few weeks) on the grounds of small earnings - without conceding that you are in fact liable to pay class 2 contributions at all. Ask the DSS for the free leaflet NI27A, and complete the exemption claim form which it contains. Strictly, a certificate of exception can only be backdated by up to 13 weeks, but in the circumstances the DSS should feel able to grant retrospective exemption for a far longer period. You could also ask for leaflet N139 on self-employment generally. The basic question is whether you are gainfully employed in selling the products of your hobby. The statutory term 'gainfully employed' means that your hobby must be pursued with the motive of gain - but not necessarily for profit (which it clearly is not). The fact that you seek to offset some of the costs of your hobby by making sales may well be sufficient to constitute a motive of gain. The appeal procedure is complicated and time consuming, so it is best to try to reach a compromise solution with the local DSS office by correspondence, and face-to-face discussion. To indicate your determination to fight, however, you could ask them for an appeal form CF90. It may be helpful if you write to your MP with a brief outline of the situation, (and mention to the DSS that you have done so). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

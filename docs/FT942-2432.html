			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Greece faces loss of EU cotton subsidies: As many as 10,000 farmers are suspected of fraud Greece faces the possible withholding of its entire European Union subsidy for cotton production amounting to about Ecu500m (Pounds 385m), in a highly embarrassing development before this week's EU summit in Corfu. European Commission officials are considering the sanction in the closing stages of a two-year inquiry into allegations of widespread fraud involving subsidies to Greek cotton, one of the country's most important products. The extent of the action against Greece will be an important test of the EC's recent tough talk about cracking down on fraud and other irregularities, which are believed to account for about 10 per cent of total EU spending. Mr Andreas Papastavrou, a leading cotton farmer and president of the Federation of Farm Co-operatives in Levadia, central Greece, says there have been 'complications' involving the flow of EU subsidies to the local cotton industry. Levadia, a bustling town of 20,000 people, has many bars, nightclubs and shops. The signs of prosperity are linked to the high level of cotton subsidies since the 1980s, which compensate farmers for the relatively low price of cotton on the world market. On average, each of the 7,000 cotton farmers in the area around Levadia have received about Ecu5,000 a year in EU subsidies over the past few years - in many cases amounting to more than half their overall incomes, according to estimates. Documents related to cotton production around Levadia have been particularly carefully scrutinised in the EU's inquiry, which has centred on nine cotton processing plants - or gins - of which seven are in or around the town. It has been alleged that in 1991-92 cotton farmers in Greece as a whole inflated their production figures by 10 per cent, gaining about Ecu50m in subsidies to which they were not entitled. The gins are central to the inquiry because these plants - of which there are about 70 throughout Greece - act as collection points for cotton. It is separated into fibres used in the textile industry, seeds used for oil and the vegetation which is thrown away. On grounds of administrative ease, the gins receive the EU subsidies before channelling them to farmers. Investigators believe some gins have collaborated with growers to falsify the amounts of cotton produced, either by entering incorrect weights into production records or by expedients such as 'double weighing' the same bale of cotton. Another theory is that farmers have regularly inflated their figures for the area planted with cotton, aided by lax checking procedures by the cotton board. According to one gin owner involved with the inquiry, up to 10,000 cotton farmers may have been involved with fraud or other irregularities over the past few years. The Greek Cotton Board, the organisation which administers the EU payments, is said by EU investigators to have presided over an 'inadequate' system for checking that documentation related to cotton production was filled in correctly. Under special scrutiny have been managers of nine gins, seven of them in the Levadia area, suspected by the cotton board of having made false claims. In some cases, the board has imposed fines but none of the fines has been paid. Mr Stathis Angeloussis, who owns two cotton gins in Levadia, was one of those named by the board but says the fraud allegations are 'a pack of lies'. He adds: 'The fines were imposed without a proper investigation. The cotton board inspectors looked around and came up with what suited them. The process was quite illegal because it wasn't backed by a judicial decision.' According to Mr Papastavrou, the cotton farmer, some irregularities have taken place but many of these have concerned the technicalities of adjusting records of cotton production for the level of moisture and impurities which affects the subsidy. He is not surprised that so far no one has paid fines for any wrongdoing - in spite of the involvement in the inquiry of public prosecutors in Athens and other regional centres. 'In Greece judicial investigations can go on for 10 years. That is the nature of the place.' Mr Markos Tsambos, a cotton board official in Levadia who has his own cotton farm, said: 'You can't rule out criminal activities. If you have a criminal disposition then it (false accounting) may have taken place.' Sparking the EC's investigation, which has also involved officials at the Greek cotton board and the Court of Auditors, the EC's Luxembourg-based financial watchdog, was that the board's declared production of 719,449 tonnes for 1991-92 was nearly 15 per cent higher than its initial estimate before harvesting. That alerted investigators to the idea that widespread fraud might have taken place to take maximum advantage of the subsidies - which during 1991 climbed by about 50 per cent due to a sharp fall in the world cotton price. Over the past year, the subsidy has fallen slightly and has accounted for between 50 and 80 per cent of the price paid to farmers for their cotton. The amount of cotton grown in Greece has increased to nearly 1m tonnes last year, according to the cotton board. A big factor behind this has been the attractive subsidies which make the life of a cotton farmer relatively prosperous and keep cotton among Greece's most important agricultural products along with tobacco and fruit. However, many in the Greek cotton industry fear that, whatever the result of the EC inquiry, the subsidies are likely to fall following calls worldwide for less government support for agriculture and the specific proposals related to farm aid in the latest round of the Gatt trade negotiations. Mr Athanasios Kostoyannos, who farms in the village of Exarchos near Levadia, said: 'We've done nothing fraudulent. Life as a cotton farmer is hard and without the subsidy it would be impossible.'</p>

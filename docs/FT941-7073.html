			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Euro Conservatives: no links, similar whips (1) Sir, Fundamental errors occurred in your article, 'Tories split over European allies' federal stance in poll manifesto' (February 24). The European People's party, whose manifesto will be published on Friday, does not, as your opening paragraph asserts, include the British Conservative party. The Conservative party has no formal links at all with the EPP. The manifesto is that of the party, not of the European Parliamentary Group as stated in the second paragraph. It has not been kept under wraps to spare Conservative embarrassment or for any reason other than the need to have the original (French) version translated into the other eight Community languages. It follows that your later statement to the effect that John Major has secured an opt-out from some of the federalist elements of the manifesto is entirely spurious - neither he nor any other representatives of the Conservative party negotiated any part of the text. Christopher Prout, 2 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA</p>

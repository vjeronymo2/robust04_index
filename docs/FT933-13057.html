			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: House of Fraser A new chapter will soon be written in House of Fraser's colourful history. Sadly, it may prove rather dull after what has gone before. Next year, the company should return to being a respectable listed company with assets of some Pounds 250m and sales of Pounds 700m. By then, the whiff of cordite from the infamous Rowland-Fayed feud may have fully blown away. There is little doubt the flotation reflects the financial pressure on the Fayeds, however much they may care to window dress the sale. Despite this year's refinancing, the brothers are still saddled with a mountainous burden of debt. That said, House of Fraser has hardly been starved of investment in recent years. Unlike Harrods, it does not appear to have been subject to the fanciful whims of its proprietors. Ahead of the flotation, House of Fraser will be run as an independent company but will face a stiff challenge overcoming historical prejudice. The pukka presence of Warburg as sponsor reassures. The surprisingly swift re-emergence of Mr Brian McGowan on the corporate scene as chairman represents another plus. Fishing, it seems, has only limited attractions after all. A price of Pounds 350m-Pounds 550m should be attainable from the flotation - although this depends on how much debt House of Fraser carries. The toughest task for management, though, may be persuading investors the company has much growth potential after five years of flat sales and thin profits. Department stores have long been viewed as the dinosaurs of the high street. Yet, Nordstrom in the US has shown there is life in the concept. House of Fraser has now to show it can be as nimble too.</p>

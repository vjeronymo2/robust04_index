			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Whitehall and judiciary clash in arms probe GROWING unease within Whitehall with the way Lord Justice Scott is conducting the arms-for-Iraq inquiry resurfaced yesterday on the first day of public hearings after the summer recess. Mr David Gore-Booth, the ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told the inquiry team: 'I think you underestimate the intelligence of Her Majesty's ministers.' He was speaking during a hearing marked by continuous heated exchanges mainly between himself and Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, the inquiry's counsel. The official also at one point clashed with the judge when he said the judge did not understand adequately the workings of Whitehall. Mr Gore-Booth was a Foreign Office official responsible for the Middle East between January 1989 and January 1993. He was questioned on how officials could justify keeping from parliament a Whitehall decision to relax the guidelines restricting defence exports to Iraq at the end of 1988. Mr Gore-Booth justified a decision by Whitehall's Interdepartmental Committee to approve the export of an IBM computer for the Iraqi military industrial plant of Nassr after ignoring warnings from intelligence and defence experts of its potential military use. Mr Gore-Booth said: 'Intelligence is a very imprecise art . . . if the IDC reached that conclusion, that is good enough for me and good enough for my masters.' During 1989 government ministers - briefed by Whitehall officials - repeatedly told parliament that the guidelines announced in the Commons in 1985 were being strictly adhered to. However, documents made available to the Scott inquiry show that the wording of the guidelines had been changed to make it easier for British companies to export defence-related goods to Iraq. Mr Gore-Booth laughed when Miss Baxendale suggested that a parliamentary question should be fully answered by the minister. 'The question should be answered in such a way as to give maximum degree of satisfaction to the questioner. It doesn't necessary need to be full,' Mr Gore-Booth said. Mr Gore-Booth provided the judge with a list of defence exports to Iraq during the 1980s which he said showed the relatively small amounts involved. However, he admitted during cross-examination that the list was incomplete as it did not include dual-use equipment such as machine tools. The public hearing continues today.</p>

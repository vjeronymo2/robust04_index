			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Minister of  Human and Minority Rights Margit Savovic said on Monday that the  U.N. Human Rights Commission was unwilling to have a discussion  on sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), because the  United Nations had violated the Yugoslavs' basic human rights by  voting for the sanctions in the first place.    Minister Savovic said Yugoslavia was being accused of  violating human and minority rights, while the rights of its  citizens were being violated by the U.N. sanctions, and its  population was surviving in inhuman conditions through a sheer  will to live.    The Yugoslav Government has filed countless memoranda with  the United Nations, apprising it about the difficult position of  the children, women, the ill and the elderly in the country and  making it clear that "our people have virtually been deprived of  the right to live, and the sanctions have violated a host of  U.N. conventions, but nothing has been done about it," she said  in a statement to Serbia's Radio Jagodina.    "The United Nations is well aware that a discussion on the  anti-Yugoslav sanctions would call in question their further  justifiability since Yugoslavia has complied with all  requirements for their lifting. It would also broach the highly  unpleasant question of why the United Nations is violating its  own conventions," she said.    The United Nations imposed comprehensive and mandatory  sanctions on Yugoslavia in May 1992, because of its alleged  military involvement in civil war in neighbouring  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is being waged among Bosnia's Moslems,  Serbs and Croats.    Margit Savovic said that more than 180,000 Serbs were living  in Albania, Hungary and Romania, and their position there "is  far different from that of the minorities in Yugoslavia."    "They are deprived of rights in all fields, from the right  to  education in their mother tongue, to information, cultural  development and power-sharing, to being assimilated," she said.    Yugoslavia "has no intention of insisting on reciprocity,  but  wants its minorities to retain their rights, and the rights of  the Serbs in the neighbouring countries to be enhanced to  correspond to those the national minorities have here," she  explained.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL SIGNED TO CREATE L.A. RIVER PARK PLAN  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday signed a bill that supporters describe as a  first step toward turning the 58-mile-long Los Angeles River flood control  channel into a park and recreation area.  </P> <P> The measure by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) gives the state Coastal  Conservancy the authority to prepare a master recreational plan for the  concrete-lined channel, which begins in the San Fernando Valley and flows into  San Pedro Bay at Long Beach.  </P> <P> Alan Gordon, a Torres aide, said other state agencies will be called upon to  provide help in reviewing the river's bird habitats and hydrology. Also, the  study will determine whether operating a monorail along the channel would be  compatible with turning the river channel into a park.  </P></p>

Thousands of artillery  shells, bullets, and rockets have hit various districts of  Kabul, leaving hundreds dead. Here is our colleague with a  telephone report from Kabul on the situation:    [Unidentified correspondent] I am reporting from Kabul. The  battle between the warring factions intensified this morning.  As a result of artillery fire, Kabul radio's transmitter is out  of action.    Forces of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami  [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] have joined General Dostam's  forces, and forces loyal to Hezb-e Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic  Union of Afghanistan] of Rasul Sayyaf have joined those of  President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and have turned Kabul into a  battle arena since dawn this morning.    Another report from Kabul's hospitals indicate that 650  wounded people, mostly civilians, are hospitalized in two city  hospitals. Reports from the southeastern district of Kabul, the  main area of concentration of General Dostam's forces, indicate  that the intensity of the clashes prevents the people from  evacuating their dead and wounded from houses. Columns of thick  smoke cover the sky above Kabul and in the city itself nothing  but the fire of artillery exchanges is visible.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lion Nathan in move to expand into China Lion Nathan is planning up to three breweries in China as a way of diversifying from the mature Australian and New Zealand beer markets, Mr Douglas Myers, Lion chief executive, said yester-day. The announcement came as Lion Nathan, the biggest brewer in both countries, reported a 45 per cent rise in profits to NZDollars 204m (USDollars 124.9m) in the year to August 31. Its brands include Castlemaine XXXX, Tooheys, Swan and Steinlager. Mr Myers said the first of its Chinese investments, a joint venture in Shanghai, was likely to be confirmed in December. He said that because of the risks involved, Lion Nathan wanted to be the leading partner. It was considering 'green field' developments because of the vast overmanning in Chinese breweries which used 300 to 400 per cent more staff than was required. He hinted that the initial investment would be around NZDollars 100m and would stem from the company's strong cash flows of NZDollars 230m. Mr Myers showed frustration at analysts' criticism that the company is burdened with 'mature' products and intense competition in world markets: a view that has caused its share price to perform poorly. He said that the company had done everything analysts had demanded, and yet its share price was lower than when it was deep in debt. Its balance sheet had been strengthened by asset sales and high cash flows which had reduced net debt by NZDollars 271m over the past year. The debt to equity ratio was 38.62 at August 31, compared with 47.53 the year before. The dividend is being lifted to 15 cents a share from 13.5 cents last year.</p>

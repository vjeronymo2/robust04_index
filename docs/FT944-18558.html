			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino reports net profit Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking group, reported a net profit in the first half of L203bn, almost the same as last year, but operating profits fell by 21 per cent to L862bn. San Paolo has been affected, like all Italian banks, by pressure on interest margins and paper losses on its investment portfolio, compared with the favourable conditions of the first six months of last year.</p>

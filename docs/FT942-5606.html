			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Ashley Group The forecast Pounds 21m charge related to the disposal of its Spanish subsidiary resulted in a loss before tax of Pounds 20.6m at Ashley Group in the year to December 31 1993. The window blinds and timber group had warned of the charge in March. Continuing operations in the period produced sales of Pounds 40.6m (Pounds 48.5m) and operating profit of Pounds 3.07m (Pounds 3.26m). Provisions in 1993 totalled Pounds 22.1m, mainly due to deferred consideration related to the Spanish sale. In 1992 provisions of Pounds 52m were carried, which produced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 61m. There is no dividend payment. Losses per share came to 15.7p (45.11p). The annual meeting will be asked to approve a change in the company's name to Eclipse Blinds.</p>

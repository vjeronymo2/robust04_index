			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Central Asians cut loose from Moscow: An attempt to establish a tripartite economic union The largest republics in Central Asia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, are reducing their dependence on Russia in the run-up to their agreed formation of a common market with Kyrgyzstan on February 1. The breach became evident at the start of the year when Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan formed their own economic union and gained momentum this week when Kyrgyzstan joined the breakaway grouping, representing open antagonism from a region which had previously valued close ties with Moscow and even opposed the Soviet break-up. The new distaste for and worry about Moscow follow increasingly vocal demands from Russia for part of the wealth in the resource-rich Caucasus and Central Asia, particularly giant oil and natural gas deals under negotiation in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The demands for percentages and equity holdings in exploration and extraction contracts have been echoed by Russian nationalists such as Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky who insist on reclaiming the empire and the spoils that go with it. In loosening ties with Moscow, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have also moved away from their two Central Asian neighbours, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, both of which have elected to remain as either economic or political satellites. Tajikistan has handed over supervision of both its security and economy to Moscow, while Turkmenistan is pursuing a course of appeasement with Moscow. Kazakhstan, which has the second-largest oil reserves in the former Soviet Union, including two of the world's 10 largest oil fields, has recently altered the tone of its statements on Russia to almost open hostility. Despite Kazakhstan's vulnerability to its northern neighbour, with an ethnic Russian population of 38 per cent, the republic's state secretary, Mr Tulebek Zhukeev, has taken the risky step of publicly denouncing Moscow's 'imperial ambitions'. Mr Zhukeev recently announced his government would charge Russia Dollars 7bn in annual rent for the Baykanur space station and two military test sites. Demonstrating the sentiment behind the pricey demands, Mr Zhukeev declared: 'This will bankrupt Russia.' The Kazakh government has reason to be upset with Russia. While demanding Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 803m) in 1993 debts to Russian state enterprises, Moscow has not paid for huge coal shipments from Kazakhstan's Karagan region. At the same time, raw material shipments from Russia have become unreliable. The Central Asian economic union is meant to co-ordinate economic, monetary and labour policy. It would create a region larger than western Europe, with a combined population of 48m but possessing as much oil and mineral wealth as some leading Gulf states. The grouping will abolish customs procedures and tariffs and co-operate on economic policies. It aims to encourage growth of trade between members. Another motive, however, is to erect a front-line defence against Moscow's growing political demands, including one that ethnic Russian citizens in Central Asia be granted dual nationality, a demand rejected by Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan as an unacceptable infringement of their sovereignty. In short, the Kazakh and Uzbek leaderships want Moscow to back off. This may not be accomplished, said a senior diplomat in Tashkent, but at the least 'the union makes it easier to deal with Russia both economically and politically'.</p>

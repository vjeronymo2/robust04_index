An analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says it is the height of  folly, that he, a despicable pro-American and pro-Japanese  stooge, dared to let out such remarks, lost to shame.    The news analyst goes on:    The March First popular uprising of 1919 was an  anti-Japanese  resistance against the Japanese imperialists' brutal colonial  rule and for the independence and sovereignty of the country.  Kim Yong- sam is not entitled to talk about it, even if he had  ten mouths.    His "civilian" regime is a treacherous one of "the second  term of the sixth republic" which has inherited the tradition of  treacheries of the "first republic" of Syngman Rhee who  manipulated the assassination of Kim Ku, the leading figure of  the "Shanghai Provisional Government".    What should not be overlooked is that the traitor Kim  Yong-sam, allegedly commemorating the March First movement,  insulted patriotic forerunners.    He drivelled that although they rose up in resistance  against  the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule, the forerunners did  not intend to "discipline Japan's crimes". And he said it is  necessary to have a correct understanding of "new Japan" of  today and "cooperate" and "compete" with it.    This rigmarole of the traitor is a sermon telling the South  Korean people to forget and not to call into question all the  disgraces and sufferings they had undergone under the Japanese  imperialist rule. It is a shameless jargon intended to conceal  his pro-Japanese flunkeyist treacheries and prettify his  clique's tieup with the Japanese reactionaries.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst says the traitor Kim has more  glaringly betrayed his true color as a pro-Japanese traitor  although he tried to conceal his treacheries through his "March  First address".</p>

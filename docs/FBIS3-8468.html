			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Member Ejup Ganic  received representatives of the Russian Battalion today, which  as a part of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] is carrying out  its duties in the [Serb-held] Sarajevo district of Grbavica.    After welcoming them, Dr. Ganic explained the current  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Russian UNPROFOR soldiers  and emphasized that the Serbs are not the only ones to have the  exclusive privilege of cooperation with Russia. The legal  Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities want this cooperation, too.  However, as Dr. Ganic said, very little is known in Russia  about the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian media do  not have the correct information about the events on these  territories. When the war is over, Ganic said, some politicians  will perhaps have to answer for concealing war crimes committed  on the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The reason for today's meeting with the representative of  the  Russian UN Battalion was also the mistrust of citizens toward  these soldiers, especially after seeing the television footage  of their arrival in Pale. However, it does not seem that there  will be any major problems.    The representatives of the Russian forces -- Assistant  Commander of the Sector South (Aleksandar Mihaylovic) [word  indistinct] and Commander of the Russian Battalion in  Bosnia-Herzegovina Victor (?Vorodilov) -- emphasized that they  are merely a part of UNPROFOR and only accountable to the UN  Secretary General and the UN Security Council.</p>

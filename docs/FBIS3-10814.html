			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Attorney General Carlos Gustavo </F> Arrieta by "NTC News" anchorman Felix de Bedout -- live]    [Text] [de Bedout] For the past few weeks it has been  obvious that you, the government, and the prosecutor general  have grown apart. A few hours ago you said that the way this  process has been handled could lead to impunity. Do you feel  the same way after today's surrender?    [Arrieta] I think a couple of things need to be cleared up.  There have been differences, which the people heard about. I  have questioned some decisions because I think these matters  must be handled within a process, respecting the rights and  duties of each entity. I do not believe the government, the  Prosecutor General's Office, or the Attorney General's Office  have grown apart. We have had our differences. I think that  what happened today is the best proof that if we cooperate with  one another, as we did in [Julio Fabio] Urdinola's case, this  process can work. The truth is that Urdinola's surrender was an  announced surrender. For quite some time now there has been  talk of a surrender. I do not think there are any differences  between the government, the prosecutor general, and the attorney  general on this.    [De Bedout] But the problem of impunity continues. Do you  think the way things are being handled could result in impunity?    [Arrieta] I have said repeatedly that because our Penal Code  is a confusing, profuse, and diffuse code, it could lead to  impunity. I have also said that the best way to prevent this is  for all the institutions that must work with the law to agree on  how we should make it work. In other words, the prosecutor  general would do his job, the government its job, and the  attorney general would orchestrate the whole procedure and see  that no one goes unpunished. If we can achieve this, even though  the Penal Code is confusing, profuse, and diffuse, I think we  can give the country a balanced and appropriate answer.    [De Bedout] Attorney General Arrieta, one subject that led  to  differences between the government and the prosecutor general  was the transfer of certain Medellin Cartel members to a jail in  Medellin. Do you think that transfer should be made?    [Arrieta] I cannot express my opinion on that matter.  Depending on what happens, the Attorney General's Office may  have to become involved in this matter, and if I expressed my  opinion now, I would have to declare myself ineligible to rule  on this matter. I would like to say that the law is clear. The  law clearly establishes the duties of the prosecutor general and  the government, and we are responsible for ensuring that none of  the two institutions oversteps its authority in order to ensure  that the law is respected, not just in this particular case but  in all cases that are controlled and supervised by the Attorney  General's Office.    [De Bedout] Thank you, Attorney General Arrieta.</p>

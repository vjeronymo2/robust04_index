			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Podberezkin, head of the author's </F> collective of the "National Doctrine of Russia" by Olga  Sapozhnikova, date and place not given: "The `National Doctrine  of Russia'"]    [Text] This is the title of the voluminous work, prepared  and published very recently by the RAU-Corporation. The  president of this well-known scientific research organization  and leader of the authors' collective Aleksey Podberezkin  answers the questions of our correspondent Olga Sapozhnikova.    [Sapozhnikova] What basic factor influenced the publication  of your book at such a complicated time?    [Podberezkin] In Russia today all the problems are closely  intertwined: There cannot be economics without spirituality,  there cannot be military security without ecological security  and so on. The contemporary Russian idea with an answer to  these questions should find its expression in the formulation of  a national doctrine. (The Russian idea is more than a  geographical concept--it reflects the interests of all citizens  living on the territory of contemporary Russia and within the  boundaries of the former USSR.) Our work is an attempt to bring  together and to show in its interdependence a strategic  conception of the development of our state at the current time.    [Sapozhnikova] The "Russian idea" is a claim to a definite  ideology. In the title of the book there are the words  "National Doctrine." One recalls immediately the lexicon of  American presidents. What is the genre of your book?    [Podberezkin] If one proceeds from the fact that a doctrine  is an aggregate of officially adopted views toward common  national goals and the ways to achieve them, then, of course, it  is not an official document because it was prepared by  non-official structures. It is more a practical attempt to  inspire the process of forming a national doctrine.    [Sapozhnikova] What can representatives of the political  establishment find in a book entitled "The National Doctrine of  Russia?"    [Podberezkin] In our book the key feature is the development  of the factor of spirituality as a condition for resolving all  the remaining problems. To establish the priority of the  problems, having determined them and analyzed their situation  today, and to give some hardly inarguable variants for resolving  them--that is our task.    [Sapozhnikova] Society in our country today is seriously  splintered. How can your book influence this situation?    [Podberezkin] One of the most important tasks of our work is  to show realistically this problem of society's splintering and  possible prospects for overcoming it. The nation faces a choice:  either we will develop according to the Georgian scenario,  where the sides cannot come to an agreement and sooner or later  a violent confrontation will begin, which acquires its own  internal logic and in the end everyone forgets who fired first;  or we will not have civil war. It is necessary to do everything  so that the first variant does not develop. This requires  serious efforts on all sides. Here the main difficulty is how  and to what degree to arrive at a compromise.    [Sapozhnikova] A national doctrine begins with the fact that  a nation forms for itself an ideal of development. You call  spirituality such an ideal. But we are also split over the  question of spirituality. There are forces who consider that  Russia is an uncivilized country and that it is necessary for us  to be integrated into "world civilization." And there are those  who are activiely seeking the ideal of spirituality in the  15th-16th centuries. As long as society will not achieve  agreement regarding an ideal of development, the remaining  problems will bear a secondary character.    [Podberezkin] Problem number 1 is the achievement of an  agreed-upon spiritual ideal. We are Eurasian. From a  geopolitical point of view we are located in the center of a  continent, unique in its historical, geographical and cultural  features, and we should work out our own model of development,  our own world view. In it the primary role belongs to the  spiritual factor, which is coompletely unrecognized by the  supporters of the Western model of development. Our mentality  wull be formed on the basis of our historical and cultural  traditions...    [Sapozhnikova] The "new Russians" don't think so.    [Podberezkin] A large part, but not all of the "new  Russians"  support the comprador model of development. These people take  for themselves the values, lets say, of Austria or Holland. If  it works out for one of them to become Austrian or Dutch, which,  frankly speaking, I doubt, then good; if it doesn't work out,  which I am to a greater degree convinced of, that person,  whether there or here will be a foreign body.    The spiritual and ieological factors form the basis of the  development of our state both in the future, and in economics.    If we use both of them, we will come to the unavoidable  conclusion that we can solve economic and social problems. But  now these factors are simply not taken into account. Financial  culture, education, science, the current tax system--these are  the destruction of the nation's spirituality, the destruction of  the factor which can lead society out of the crisis.    [Sapozhnikova] A national doctrine is an all-society  agreement. It presupposes the presence of a conscious group of  interests. We have still not formulated them, the social  structure of our society is changing: there are the "new  Russians," the criminal associations...How to move society  toward a realization of its common interests?    [Podberezkin] An original conclusion from this situation was  proposed in our work. If we view the political party spectrum  according to its interests, we see that agreement is practically  impossible. The interests of these strata are varied and it is  very difficult to find a social-political basis on which to  unite them. If we try to look at society according to a  different spectrum, dividing it into a system of priorities of  all-national interests, having removed the party factor of  personality and ambition, society will be divided into two  camps. The first are the state patriots, seeing their Russia as  a strong great power with a developed economic structure,  intellectually and economically independent. Therefore in this  camp there will be some supporters of the president, of  parliament, and followers of your newspaper.    In the second camp are the compradors. What Russia will be  is all the same to them.    [Sapozhnikova] How did the work on preparing "The National  Doctrine of Russia" proceed?    [Podberezkin] The first version of the work, presented as a  document on the strategy of national security was conceived and  completed in two weeks.    After the book was printed and we began to get reactions it  became clear that the work was not finished. In the course of a  month we produced its expanded version. Nearly 300 people,  leading specialists in their areas, to a greater or lesser  degree participated in preparing the final text (the creative  collective directly). These experts are well known and  recognized not because they have big titles or because they  often appear on television, but first of all they are respected  in their professional field. Among the authors is Nikita  Nikolayevich Moiseyev, a star of the first magnitude, and other  well known names.    [Sapozhnikova] Did "Group Most" finance the work?    [Podberezkin] Not completely. The work was done on an equal  footing, since our corporation took upon itself a large part of  the financing. "Group Most" paid for printing. Without  financial support we would not have been able to publish the  book--there was not enough money.</p>

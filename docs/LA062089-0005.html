			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEPPER: MAVERICK CONGRESSMAN  </P> <P> In his article "Decency and Vision Made Claude Pepper a Congressional Maverick"  (Op-Ed Page, June 2) on the career of Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), Roger Morris  made some very dubious statements about the late congressman's actions during  the Cold War period.  </P> <P> In defending Rep. Pepper's "courage" in withstanding American anti-Soviet  "hysteria," Morris does not take into consideration that Pepper's defense of a  moderate policy towards the Soviet Union came at the height of the Stalinist  terror.  </P> <P> The years immediately following World War II saw the Communist coup in  Czechoslovakia, the show trials to crush "Titoist" deviation throughout Eastern  Europe resulting in the torture and hanging of dozens of innocent persons, as  well as the "doctors' plot" and the assault on intellectuals within the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> These were all controlled and masterminded by Stalin and carried out by his  associates. In addition, there was the North Korean invasion in 1950 by a  client state of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> I bring these incidents up to illustrate that a "moderate" and "reasonable"  policy towards the Soviet Union advocated by Rep. Pepper and others including  Henry Wallace was not courageous but naive in the extreme.  </P> <P> Let us remember Claude Pepper for his work with Social Security and government  aid and assistance to senior citizens not for his mistakes of 40 years  previous.  </P> <P> BRIAN DELANEY  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

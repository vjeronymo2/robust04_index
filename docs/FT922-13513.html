			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Quiet bewilderment as Iranians cast their votes IT IS hard to spot an election poster in Tehran this year. On previous polling days they covered this vast city, every wall sprouting slogans and portraits of the ruling clergy. Instead there was an air of tranquillity yesterday as Iranians voted in parliamentary elections which are expected to strengthen the hand of President Hashemi Rafsanjani and his supporters who want to improve relations with the west. Opposing the president is another Islamic faction, fighting a rearguard action in the 270-seat parliament to assert a more radical role. Election days in Iran have not been noted for their tranquillity. Debates in parliament can be fierce and chanting demonstrators fill the streets. In 1988, Islamic radicals hijacked an airliner shortly before the poll. Bombs are not unknown, usually planted by the banned Islamic Marxist opposition. By contrast, the voting yesterday for the Fourth Majlis (parliament) was a muted affair. Polling stations were quiet. 'I'm sure they will come,' said an election official peering anxiously at the empty streets. The day slid by, much like any other weekend. Friday prayers started with the usual chorus of 'Death to America'. Friends strolled around Mellat park. Only a few soldiers stood on street corners in case of trouble. In part, it was the mayor's responsibility. He had declared war on political posters and sent city workers into the streets in hot pursuit of party volunteers. Even before the glue had dried, most of the posters were removed and dumped. Throughout the past week campaign meetings have been low-key. Like most other candidates, Mr Rajaie Khorassani, former Iranian ambassador to the UN, held his in a mosque. The audience, stragglers from evening prayers, chatted quietly through his speech. So subdued was the campaign that voters often had little idea of who was who among the bewildering array of candidates. Mr Ali Mohammad Arab, a 19-year-old conscript from Teheran, proclaimed himself a supporter of President Rafsanjani; in fact, he had voted for a random selection from both sides. With 30 votes to cast and over 2,000 candidates to choose from, voters had to rely on short lists published in daily newspapers. If voter-turnout appeared to be low, there was good reason. People are angry at the state of the economy. With prices soaring on the black market and rents nudging European levels, they have a point. 'We are earning in rials and paying in dollars,' proclaimed a middle-class Tehrani woman. Many of the middle classes see little point in voting. The only alternative to the government is the Society of Combatant Clergy, militant mullahs in the image of the late Ayatollah Khomeini. Certainly no one seemed in much doubt that President Rafsanjani will consolidate his support. 'We already know who is going to win,' said an official from the Ministry of Islamic Guidance.</p>

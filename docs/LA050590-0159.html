			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAZDA COMPLETES REORGANIZATION  </P> <P> Mazda Motor of America Inc., the U.S. importer and distributor of Mazda  automobiles and trucks, said it has completed a reorganization begun more than  20 months ago with the streamlining of its sales, marketing and product  planning functions.  </P> <P> As part of the changes, which became effective May 1, the company created a new  dealer relations unit to be headed by James Wiesner, former assistant group  vice president for sales.  </P> <P> A company spokesman said a new sales division head is still to be appointed and  could come from outside the company.  </P> <P> Mazda officials could not be reached to elaborate on the announcement, which  was released late Friday afternoon.  </P> <P> But in a prepared statement, Chief Operating Officer Clark J. Vitulli said the  new changes "respond to Mazda's continued growth and recent sales performance.  It strengthens three of the critical areas for success in the '90s." Despite a  nationwide slump in the new car market, Mazda has been posting record sales.  </P> <P> Under the restructuring, corporate functions have been regrouped into new  product planning, sales and marketing divisions.  </P> <P> Sales, marketing and the dealer relations unit will report to George McCabe,  group vice president for operations.  </P> <P> Product planning, parts, service, logistics, information systems, human  resources and public relations will report to Vitulli.  </P> <P> The new Sales Division encompasses MMA's five regional offices, a new truck  sales position, dealer development, sales planning, fleet sales, vehicle  distribution and business management.  </P> <P> Janet Thompson, previously vice president for advertising, has been named vice  president for marketing. Merchandising, market planning, training, motor sports  and advertising will report to her, the company said.  </P> <P> William Hackett, former head of the Marketing Division, has been named vice  president for product planning.  </P></p>

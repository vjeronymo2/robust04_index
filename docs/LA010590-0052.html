			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Anselm Kiefer Gets Israeli Prize: West German painter Anselm Kiefer has been  awarded the $100,000 Wolf Prize in the arts.  </P> <P> Kiefer will be presented the prize by Israeli President Chaim Herzog in May at  the Knesset. In an announcement, the Israel-based Wolf Foundation said that  Kiefer, who was born in 1945, "has created an art that synthesizes human  history and the present condition of life in epic canvases that inspire gravity  and awe." Kiefer first came to prominence in the 1970s with subjects that dealt  derisively with his German heritage, particularly the Nazi period. DANIEL  CERONE  </P></p>

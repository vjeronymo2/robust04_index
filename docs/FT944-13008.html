			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hiscox shelves listing plans after Pounds 27m issue Hiscox Dedicated, one of the pioneer corporate investors in Lloyd's of London, yesterday shelved plans to seek a UK Stock Exchange listing after raising Pounds 26.6m via a fully underwritten share issue. But Mr Robert Hiscox, a director and a deputy chairman of the insurance market, said the company remained intent on evolving into a fully-fledged quoted insurance company operating under Lloyd's umbrella. It intended to acquire 25 per cent of the Hiscox managing agency business, which runs some of the London insurance market's most profitable syndicates, with the object of buying the balance when Lloyd's rules were changed. Moreover, the company said it intended to be quoted on 'a recognised stock exchange' within five years. 'It will be a much better company to list when it is merged with the management of the syndicates,' Mr Hiscox said. Hiscox Dedicated is one of 25 companies which this year have invested Pounds 900m in the Lloyd's insurance market. Unlike many of the others, it invested in only a narrow range of insurance syndicates and had been expected to seek a listing this autumn as part of a fund-raising exercise. But yesterday the company announced that Trident, a Bermuda-based company investing in insurance and reinsurance, had fully underwritten a Pounds 17.7m open offer to existing Hiscox Dedicated shareholders and warrantholders. Trident will also subscribe Pounds 8.9m through a placing of Hiscox Dedicated shares. The new shares are being issued at 110p a share, half payable on issue and the balance when called. Trident was formed a year ago by Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker, J P Morgan, Mid Ocean, a Bermuda reinsurance company, and Byrne &amp; Sons, a small investment bank. Depending on the outcome of the offer, Trident will own up to 68.35 per cent of Hiscox Dedicated's ordinary share capital. However, it is seeking shareholders' approval for not making a general offer. To allow Hiscox Dedicated to buy the Hiscox Syndicates management agency, Hiscox Holdings - parent company of the latter - plans to demerge its non-managing agency activities. These include Roberts &amp; Hiscox members agency, which acts for Names, and R K Harrison, an insurance broker and financial adviser. The funds raised will be invested on four Hiscox managed syndicates, raising Hiscox Dedicated's share on each from between 4 and 5 per cent to about 11 per cent.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Gardening: Clipped into proper shape - Topiary is undergoing a revival WHILE visiting gardens recently, I have seen some remarkable examples of topiary, the art of training and clipping plants into all manner of artificial shapes. It is an ancient art, used in classical times; and, from the amount I have seen in gardens this year, it is enjoying a period of popularity. There are many ways of approaching the art, one being to buy young specimens in nurseries or garden centres and continue to clip them according to the shape, simple or fanciful, which they have been given already. These ready-made specimens usually will be fairly simple columns, cones or balls, or perhaps twisted stems with a ball on top, a form that once was highly popular. Peacocks are still in fashion and can sometimes be bought ready-made, and so can some stranger creatures. A catalogue arrived the other day offering wire frames on which topiary could be trained, either in large pots or other containers or in the open ground. These frames all were comparatively small, the largest being a simple cone (it was called an obelisk in the catalogue but cone would seem to be a more accurate description) 22 in high by 12 1/2 in wide which, when clothed fully with plant growth, would be about double these dimensions. Other more fanciful shapes were a lyre, a guitar, and playing-card shapes of spades, diamonds, hearts and clubs. In the garden of Schute House near Shaftesbury, Dorset, the owners had made their own frames on a very much larger and more substantial scale. Several were about 6 ft high and 4 ft through, shaped like a pawn made for a giant chess board and each containing several small yew trees which might be expected to fill them in two to three years. Yew is one of the best shrubs for topiary because it is fully hardy and stands clipping well. It has small leaves and a densely-branched habit which makes it possible to cut quite small detail in it. There are both green and golden-leaved varieties. Box is also good, for similar reasons, but is less strong in growth than yew. In this same garden, there also was one other frame and plant which must surely have been for an experimental specimen of topiary. The frame, apparently made of aluminium, was a narrow cone fully 15 ft high and about 5 ft wide at the base. The plant growing in it was a dawn redwood, or mettasequoia, the very ancient species of conifer which was known only as a fossil until the early 1940s when it was discovered growing wild in China. It has finely-divided leaves, very much like those of the swamp cypress (taxodium), but it grows much faster than that tree - as much as 4 ft a year when young - and I would expect the plant in the conical frame to cover it in three to four years. What is problematical is how it will behave after that. It has a naturally loose habit, totally different from yew, and I have never seen it clipped. It also loses its leaves in autumn, but they hang on late and the new leaves come early. If the experiment comes off and the cone is covered with light green, ferny foliage, turning yellow in autumn, it will be a remarkable feat of topiary-making. Another garden with topiary that I saw recently is Hillbarn House, Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire. Here, it has all been made on site by the owner, AJ Buchanan, who has become expert at all kinds of tree and shrub clipping and training. I have known this garden for some years and, each time I visit it, there are several new specimens. As far as I am aware, Buchanan does not rely on frames for most of his training, but I suppose the occasional support is used to get a peacock's tail or a dog's legs into exactly the right position. It is the variety and originality that give special delight at Hillbarn - the topiary includes chairs, dogs, teddy bears, and a variety of abstract shapes. Some years ago, Buchanan told me he was expecting a visit from a Chinese friend and, in honour of him, had made the first cuts for a Chinese dragon, This has now grown into a formidable monster. And he has a pair of poodles. They started life as a single dog, but it looked lonely so he gave it a mate. On my last visit, I found two teddy bears that were even more amusing. Each apparently was sitting in the middle of a large garden seat. When I examined them to discover how this illusion had been created, I found that each bear, cut in box, had been planted in a container of just the right height to bring it level with the seat, and that a hole had been cut in the seat to fit the container exactly. One of the bears was wearing a red bow tie. Humour is much in evidence in this garden, and so is good design.</p>

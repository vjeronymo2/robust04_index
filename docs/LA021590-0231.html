			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FRIED CHICKEN KING DIES AT 85  </P> <P> Jack C. Massey, who helped build Kentucky Fried Chicken Co. into an  international success and co-founded Hospital Corp. of America, died today at a  Palm Beach, Fla., hospital. He was 85.  </P> <P> Massey died of pneumonia at Good Samaritan Hospital early this morning, said  Mimi Scruggs, his secretary at Massey Investment Co. in Nashville. Massey, who  retired from the company in 1978, had been staying at his winter home in  Florida.  </P> <P> From a chain of six drugstores, the Nashville businessman founded Massey  Surgical Supply Inc. in 1930. He sold that company for about $1 million in 1961  with the intention of retiring in Florida but soon found himself looking for  other business ventures.  </P> <P> In 1964 he bought Kentucky Fried Chicken Co. from its founder, Col. Harland  Sanders. With John Y. Brown Jr., who later became governor of Kentucky, Massey  built the company into one of the world's largest commercial marketers of  prepared food. The two sold that business to Heublein Corp. in 1969.  </P></p>

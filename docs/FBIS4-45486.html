			<p>for   `Tough Action'   <F P=102> 94WD0392 London THE GUARDIAN in English 30 May 94 p 7--FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94WD0392 </F> <F P=104>  London THE GUARDIAN </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by James Meikle: "Heads Call for Drive Against Drug </F> Taking"]    [Text] Head teachers will call for tough action against  drug taking among young people this week amid growing evidence  of the ease with which schoolchildren can obtain illegal  substances.    Allegations that pupils are turning to crime and  prostitution  to pay for experimentation or to finance addiction will be  voiced by members of the National Association of Head Teachers  meeting in Eastbourne.    A recent study in the Northwest indicated that six in 10 14-  and 15-year-olds had the opportunity to try drugs, and there is  increasing concern that primary schoolchildren are becoming  involved.    The plea for a co-ordinated campaign of education about  drugs  and measures to combat their illicit trade among children  coincides with a government review, headed by Tony Newton,  Leader of the House of Commons, to clarify national policies on  the issue.    One source said: "There is concern we reduce to an  irreducible minimum, the proportion of children taking drugs.  Education [about drugs] is part of the national curriculum and  the question is how effectively it can be taught in schools, who  should be doing it, and in what form."    Martin Saunders, a primary school headteacher from  Stoke-on-Trent, said yesterday: "I have evidence of at least one  child drug-dealing at the age of eight in this city. There is  increasing evidence that young people are involved in crime to  obtain finance to buy drugs. I have social and welfare officers  talking to me about young people being involved in prostitution  to pay for drugs."    Mr Saunders said many heads were worried that their schools  would get labeled as problem schools and lose pupils, and  therefore money, if they talked openly about drugs.    Drugs education experts are angry that the Department for  Education last year dropped central support for health education  co-ordinators.    Alasdair Cant, training manager for Release, the national  drug advice service, said the biggest increase in calls in the  last 18 months had involved children aged 11 to 14. "We have  seen them coming into drugs, not just hearing about it from  older brothers or sisters, but being in a group where substances  are being taken or experimenting themselves."    But no overall policy meant that "in one area, one school  will do one thing and another something completely different. It  is confusing for parents and students." More schools are using  former drug addicts to talk to children. Drug educators,  including the Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drug Education,  believe that teaching about illegal drugs should be closely  integrated with teaching on more socially tolerated drugs.    Liverpool education authority and Merseyside police last  week  launched a new initiative attempting to develop consistent  policies, including a recommendation that all serious incidents  in schools should be reported to the police.    David Barrie, the city's assistant director of education,  said that exclusion from school should be used only as a last  resort. "We are not saying drugs are trivial. But where a young  person is excluded, he or she can get into far more serious  trouble."    The Education Secretary, John Patten, last week decided to  drop his suggestion that drug trafficking might be a reason for  excluding pupils, leaving decisions to heads and governing  bodies. But David Hart, general secretary of the NAHT [expansion  not given], said most questions about dealing with drugs came  from secondary school members, and most involved grounds for  excluding pupils. "It sends a bad message to the rest of the  pupil community. It says you can get away with sampling drugs or  trafficking in drugs on school premises or during the school  day."

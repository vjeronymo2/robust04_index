			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Leasing industry attacks Treasury transport policy The leasing industry is unlikely to back any private-sector transport projects if the Treasury sticks to its present financing guidelines, Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the Finance and Leasing Association said yesterday. He said leasing companies had the ability to write Pounds 5bn worth of railway equipment business but had been disappointed at the failure of the government's private finance initiative. Proposals for a Pounds 440m deal to finance new trains for London Underground's Northern Line are stalled because they do not meet Treasury guidelines. Mr Mallin said the only way the leasing industry would be able to finance deals was if it could negotiate special terms for deals which reduced the risk assumed. 'The leasing industry is not yet willing to do deals because we are being asked to finance risks we are not familiar with,' he said. 'We would have hoped to have more projects to take forward.' The industry is unsure whether a viable second-hand market for rolling stock and other assets can be created. Leasing companies base charges partly on the expectation that leased equipment will have a residual value when a lease comes to an end and can be sold. In sectors funded by leasing, such as cars and aircraft, there are active second-hand markets. Under guidelines announced by the Treasury last year the private sector must take on about 10 per cent of the risk - about equivalent to the residual value of the asset when all lease payments have been made - of deals valued at up to Pounds 1m. This rises to 30 per cent on deals worth between Pounds 1m and Pounds 10m and to 'the greater majority of risk' - normally interpreted to mean 60 per cent to 70 per cent - on deals worth more than Pounds 10m.</p>

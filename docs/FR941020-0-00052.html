			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> HSWA Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the Agency is not amending 40 CFR part 272 to include HSWA requirements and prohibitions that are immediately effective in Arizona and other States. Section 3006(g) of RCRA provides that any requirement or prohibition of HSWA (including implementing regulations) takes effect in authorized States at the same time that it takes effect in non-authorized States. Thus, EPA has immediate authority to implement a HSWA requirement or prohibition once it is effective. A HSWA requirement or prohibition supercedes any less stringent or inconsistent State provision which may have been previously authorized by EPA (see 50 FR 28702, July 15, 1985).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the vast number of HSWA statutory and regulatory requirements taking effect over the next few years, EPA expects that many previously authorized and incorporated by reference State provisions will be affected. The States are required to revise their programs to adopt the HSWA requirements and prohibitions by the deadlines set forth in 40 CFR 271.21, and then to seek authorization for those revisions pursuant to 40 CFR part 271. EPA expects that the States will modify their programs substantially and repeatedly. Instead of amending 40 CFR part 272 every time a new HSWA provision takes effect under the authority of RCRA 3006(g), EPA will wait until the State receives authorization for its analog to the new HSWA provision before amending the section of 40 CFR part 272 applicable to the State. In the interim, persons wanting to know whether a HSWA requirement or prohibition is in effect should refer to 40 CFR 271.1(j), as amended, which lists each such provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Incorporation by reference of State authorized programs in the CFR should substantially enhance the public's ability to discern the current status of the authorized State program and clarify the extent of Federal enforcement authority. This will be particularly true as more State program revisions adopting HSWA provisions are authorized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated earlier, Arizona is authorized to implement certain HSWA requirements in lieu of EPA. EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to allow such action in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  documents granting Arizona authorization effective October 7, 1991 (56 FR 37290, August 6, 1991), September 11, 1992 (57 FR 30905, July 13, 1992; 57 FR 41699, September 11, 1992), January 22, 1993 (57 FR 54932, November 23, 1992), and December 27, 1993 (58 FR 57745, October 27, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action is intended to incorporate by reference the decisions already made to authorize Arizona's program and has no separate effect on handlers of hazardous waste in the State or upon small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., Federal agencies must consider the paperwork burden imposed by any information request contained in a proposed rule or a final rule.

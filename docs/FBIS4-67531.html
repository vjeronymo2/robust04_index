			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 8 (XINHUA) -- South China's Guangdong  Province recently passed a new forest law, which is to come into  effect soon.    The forest protection and management regulations, a revision  of 1987 regulations, divides Guangdong's forests into ecological  and public forests and commercial forests, to which different  rules will apply.    The ecological and public forests include those for wind  shelter, water and soil conservation, recreation and  sightseeing, and protection of plants and animals.    This area of forest land must account for no less than 30  percent of the total forest area and will be maintained under  the government budget. It will be free from commercial felling,  the new law reads.    Forest resources, including timber, fuel and economic  forests, fall under the category of commercial forests.    According to the new regulations, the felling of commercial  trees will be controlled by quotas and a licensing system.  Commercial forests could be subject to rent, transfer and  mortgage.    The new law encourages the development of forests through  means other than governmental investment, such as the use of  overseas funds or stock companies.    The publishing of the new law was preceded by the province's  announcement last year that its forest coverage had reached 53.7  percent.    Forest officials said the new law is aimed at consolidating  and expanding the province's achievement in afforestation, and  establishing a new forest management system that fits with a  market economy.    The new law stipulates that the province will keep its  forest  coverage above 50 percent and that all cities and towns allow  for 30 percent of urban areas to remain green land.    The new law also contains detailed articles on punishment  for  offenses.</p>

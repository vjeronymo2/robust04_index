			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Japan's economy is not yet  set to recover but a further fall is unlikely, Vice Finance  Minister Jiro Saito said Thursday [7 April]. "As we have been  saying, the economy is unlikely to deteriorate further," Saito  told a scheduled news conference, referring to remarks Wednesday  by Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno.    The BOJ chief virtually declared an end to the three-year  recession by saying the economy is showing signs of hitting  bottom.    But Saito remained cautious about projecting recovery as did  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii when he met reporters after  Mieno. "There may be some differences in nuances, but they  (Mieno's comments) are basically the same as the latest  (monthly) economic report by the Economic Planning Agency,"  Saito said.    "Mieno also did not completely mention a recovery," Saito  said. Under these circumstances, Saito stressed the government  must steadily implement the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus  package and enact the fiscal 1994 budget as early as possible to  put the economy on a "full-fledged recovery track."    Considering the tax issue, Saito welcomed the recent  direction indicated by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to  accepting a consumption tax hike. But he declined to comment  further on ongoing discussions among the ruling coalition  parties which are to decide on a full-scale tax reform by the  end of the year.</p>

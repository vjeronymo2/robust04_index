			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JURY SELECTION IN SILBERMAN TRIAL DELAYED BY ILLNESSES  </P> <P> Jury selection in Richard T. Silberman's money-laundering trial was put on hold  until next week because two of the prominent San Diego businessman's defense  attorneys became ill, the federal judge hearing the case announced Thursday.  </P> <P> After seating 28 potential jurors, U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving said  that formal interviews of that group by prosecutors and defense lawyers will  resume Tuesday. By then, he said, defense lawyers James J. Brosnahan and Diane  Amann are expected to recover from food poisoning.  </P> <P> The postponement occurred after Irving announced, out of the presence of  potential jurors, that he was also putting off -- until the end of the trial --  prosecutors' request to sanction Silberman for saying in a television interview  that he was innocent of all charges.  </P> <P> Silberman, 61, who was a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., faces  seven felony charges. He is accused of laundering $300,000 that an undercover  FBI agent characterized as the proceeds of Colombian drug trafficking.  </P> <P> His trial, which began Tuesday, is expected to last six weeks. If convicted,  Silberman could face up to 75 years in prison.  </P> <P> When jury selection resumed Thursday, Irving dismissed six potential jurors who  indicated in a special questionnaire that they already had formed an opinion  about the case and two who didn't answer whether they had an opinion.  </P> <P> The judge also dismissed a number of other potential jurors who said they had  thought about the case since Tuesday and decided that they also had formed  opinions about it. It was not known what the opinions might be.  </P> <P> Jurors, who were cautioned Tuesday not to read newspaper stories or watch  television accounts of the case, were not made aware in court of that  prosecutors' contention that Silberman should be found in contempt of court for  talking about the case to NBC cameras.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. asked for sanctions Wednesday,  saying Silberman's comments violated a partial gag order imposed March 1. The  order bars Silberman and the lawyers from talking about various matters,  including the strength or weakness of either side's case.  </P> <P> In the interview, which aired Tuesday on NBC's San Diego affiliate, KNSD  (Channel 39), Silberman said FBI agents and prosecutors had made a mistake by  charging him, insisted he was innocent and predicted the jury would agree with  him.  </P> <P> Irving said Thursday after reviewing a tape of the interview that, if Gorder  wants to pursue the issue, the time to do it was after the trial, through a  formal, written request for sanctions.  </P> <P> Before taking ill, Brosnahan told Irving that Silberman had a free-speech right  to talk about his case, even if there was a gag order.  </P></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (9): Smooth move for National Grid - Persuading more than 250 families to move from one region to another was not an easy task, but the relocation has so far gone well IN A small Portakabin alongside a windswept building site, a family with two children is in search of a cup of tea. Inside, six cramped but cheerful office workers are putting on the kettle, chatting to the family and busily tapping into computers. Behind the small cabin of activity, a grandiose palace of concrete and glass stands against the grey Coventry skyline: by the end of this summer it will house 300 or more employees of National Grid who have chosen to relocate from the electricity company's current London headquarters. The tea-seeking family are one of those due to move to Coventry this summer so that the father, a systems operator, can continue in his post. They have called in at National Grid's information centre to take a break from the house-hunting. Where to live is only one of the many concerns on their minds. They have to find a school for their children, the wife wants to work part-time and they are apprehensive about leaving behind their family and friends in London. Persuading more than 250 families to move to the Midlands was never going to be an easy task. As Mr Raymond Bowker, the relocation manager, says: 'Very few people out of the total population would choose to relocate because any change is likely to be a strain on the employee or the family.' Mr Bowker has been seconded from his own company, Tavistock Relocation Management, which manages relocations for other companies. His approach to National Grid's huge project was to concentrate on the practical difficulties of moving families from one area of the country to another. Companies have traditionally thrown money at a relocation, he says, neglecting the need to get partners and families involved. It was the emphasis on housing, education and getting to know the area, that he believes helped make the National Grid move a smooth one. One of the main problems facing the relocation team was how to overcome the unease created by the announcement of the move among the London-based staff. Initially, this was done by giving every member of staff (all were offered the choice of relocation) a binder of information setting out what the company's role would be in assisting with the practicalities of relocation. A first hurdle was the general misconception of the so-called 'Black country' that greeted the announcement of the move, made to staff in the late summer of 1989. 'There were mixed reactions,' says Mr Bowker diplomatically. 'Especially for people who had lived in the south east all their lives.' The company organised a series of coach trips to the area for employees and their families considering the move. Those who took up the offer were taken from London in a double-decker coach (children were enticed along with a bag of 'goodies') and put up in a four-star hotel. Over the weekend, adults were given conducted tours of the area, visiting nearby towns and villages like Warwick, Leamington and Kenilworth where they would perhaps decide to buy houses. On Sunday morning they explored Coventry and the City's schools and sports centres. 'We took them through the grotty areas of Coventry too,' says Mr Bowker. 'We didn't want them to think we weren't being objective.' Meanwhile, the children were kept busy visiting a zoo, the Cadbury's chocolate factory and Warwick castle. Back in London presentation evenings were organised to answer fears and queries and provide more information, a system that helped keep partners involved. 'This got round the problems that often happens that companies communicate with employees but don't get through to the families,' says Raymond Bowker. In addition a monthly publication, and even a series of videos were sent to the homes of employees considering the move, with information and updates on the area. One real concern was leaving behind the London circle of friends and families, but according to National Grid the outings and presentations went some way towards easing this problem, by introducing the families to each other. However, the main areas of concern remained housing and education. The company employed an education consultant to find suitable schools in the area and answer queries. The task was made easier by Warwickshire education authority's good record and its own active role in providing information and assistance. For help with housing, National Grid organised a computerised housing data base - one was placed in the information centre in the London headquarters while the other was set up in the Portakabin adjacent to the new site. The data base contained every house that was for sale within half an hour of the new HQ (roughly 9,000 properties at any one time) and house-hunters were able to key in their specifications - location, number of bedrooms, detached or semi, and a price range. They then received a print out of options that met their requirements. By looking up the properties on file at the centre, they were able to avoid traipsing around estate agents. With all the problems facing the housing market, National Grid introduced a 'Managed Home Sale' service for the employee's existing home. Under this system National Grid provided the bridging finance, while Tavistock's relocation team instructed valuers, made all the necessary financial arrangements, appointed the estate agents, considered the offers and looked after vacant properties. They also tried to ensure their employees were in strong purchasing positions by enabling them to make cash payments for the houses around Coventry. 'This made them the most favoured applicants,' says Raymond Bowker. Employees with partners unable to move to Coventry because of their own jobs in London, were encouraged to find houses between the capital and Coventry, in towns like Oxford and Milton Keynes. Families taking time off to look around Coventry were able to use the the Coventry base not just for the house search, but for maps, information, somewhere to change nappies, or somewhere to put their feet up. Furthermore, a small cottage located near the new headquarters was turned into a comfortable rest centre. By the spring of this year, some 40-50 families had already made the move. With National Grid's target date for the opening of the new centre around the beginning of September, most were expecting to move this summer. Some temporary office space was taken over to allow some of those as who moved early to work near their new homes, although some continued to commute. In addition to the organised trips, the company agreed to pay all the 'reasonable costs of relocation.' Bills incurred on individual trips to the area for house and school-hunting were met as were all the costs of the actual move. In addition, a cushioning period of just over four years was arranged to ease families off their London allowances. Employees had the option of taking the money as a lump sum. Many of those who had survived as one car families in London but who felt they would need two in the new location took it up. Employees also got a relocation grant related to their salary and the size of their family. Meanwhile, partners who had to sacrifice their London jobs were given the opportunity to apply for vacancies within the company. An employment consultant was taken on to give advice for those looking for different type of work. It is early days to judge the move, but Raymond Bowker says that without exception, the families who have made it are pleased. Other reports suggest families believe the the 'quality of life' is higher and an overwhelming response has been 'the journey to work is so short]' One employee comments: 'The company has been very positive. No member of staff has been left 'out of pocket' as a result of the relocation. It must have been a very costly process.' 'It did all cost money,' reflects Raymond Bowker. 'But we retained good quality staff - it would have been even more costly to lose them.'</p>

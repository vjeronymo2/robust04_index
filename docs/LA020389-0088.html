			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: AMPLIFICATIONS  </P> <P> An item in Thursday's Morning Report prompted a number of cable television  subscribers to call the Los Angeles City Department of Telecommunications  asking about deposits they have made on channel changers and converter boxes.  Cable companies are automatically required to return deposits with interest at  the time service is disconnected, says Susan Herman, general manager of the  department. She says that two Los Angeles area cable companies currently hold  deposits: American Cable Systems, which serves Hollywood, Wilshire, Westchester  and South-Central Los Angeles, and Cablevision, which took over Valley Cable  and maintains deposits collected by that company.

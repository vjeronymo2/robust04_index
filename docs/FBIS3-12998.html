This  would not have been so bad had they not started believing that  the negotiations on limited autonomy in Gaza and Jericho would  bring the Middle East into a new era. Instead of reading the  writing on the wall, they preferred to become immersed in  daydreams about the end of days.    It is characteristic that in the week of the Cave of the  Patriarch murders, Jordanian diplomats found it hard to wriggle  out of the Israeli and U.S. bear hug. A member of the Jordanian  cabinet was invited to Washington to give the date of the Amman  conference that is supposed to bring together thousands of  company directors. A different delegation searched for escape  routes from the trilateral forum which emerged at the  Clinton-Hasan-Peres meeting at the White House. Soon, economic  and environmental experts will drag themselves to Oman or Qatar,  or perhaps Tunis, for another round of multilaterals. Morocco  did not know how to get out of the desertification conference  initiated by Peres and Vice President Al Gore. It can be  assumed that Goldstein solved the problem for them.    Since 13 September, U.S. Administration spokesmen have been  reiterating the three targets they have taken upon themselves.  First: advancement toward a comprehensive peace, or in other  words, bridging the gaps between Israel and Syria. Second,  recruiting the international community to rehabilitate the  inhabitants of the territories so that the Palestinians believe  that peace pays. Third, improving relations between the Arab  states and Israel, mainly through efforts to lift the Arab  boycott so that Israelis find that peace pays. Next week will  be six months since the signing ceremony at the White House.  What is left? Syria and Israel are more or less treading  water. The Clinton-al-Asad summit meeting was wasted, and the  Palestinians learned that it is much easier to exploit people  under occupation than to rehabilitate them.    The most striking achievement of U.S. diplomacy since the  Madrid conference was the public relations campaign for the  Declaration of Principles among the Jews, especially in America.  Several minor Arab leaders who understood that Clinton would owe  them a favor, made the Israelis several small gestures. The  Americans, with their faulty understanding of inter-Arab  politics, continued to exert pressure. They wanted the Arabs to  lift the embargo even before the first Israeli soldier leaves  Gaza, and pleaded with al-Asad to shake hands with Yitzhaq  Rabin, although the latter tied himself to the Golan Heights  through a referendum. President Clinton is urging King Husayn to  accept Israeli leaders in Amman before a single uprooted family  is returned to Ramallah and while Kahanists imported from  America run around in Hebron as if they own the place.    It appears that the Americans recently became concerned that  the Hebron massacre might spoil their relations with the Jews.  The President and the secretary of state apologize almost every  time somebody forces them to say that it would be preferable  that armed Goldsteins not roam around in Hebron. While this  article is being written, three announcements came up on my  facsimile machine: One announced Vice President Gore's  participation in a fundraising dinner for Bar Ilan University at  the Israeli Embassy in Washington. In a special gesture, on the  day after the massacre, Gore announced that he had decided to  accept an old invitation to receive an honorary doctorate from  the National Religious Party's intellectual bastion.  Immediately after that, came another White House announcement:  The entire telephone conversation between Clinton and the  family of the yeshiva student wounded in Brooklyn. And after  that, more good news: The federal official in charge of U.S.  heritage abroad announced that Ukranian President Leonid  Kravchuk took time off in Washington to sign an agreement to  look after the synagogues and Jewish cemeteries in his country.    On the other hand, leaders of the Arab lobby in the United  States who have repeatedly requested a meeting with the  President since the massacre, have so far been turned down. A  group of Arab activists in the "Builders for Peace" movement,  another level in the upside down pyramid of the peace process,  had to settle for a meeting with the vice president. It was  reported that he was "pleasantly surprised with their good  manners."    The signs of friendship are touching, but the problem of the  moment is the difficulty of building a peace process credible to  both sides on such a transparent leaning toward Israel by the  sole mediator.</p>

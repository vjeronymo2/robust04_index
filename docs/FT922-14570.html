			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Pounds 1.2m increase for Atlas Converting Without the burden of exceptional charges in 1991, Atlas Converting Equipment has increased its pre-tax profit from Pounds 5.51m to Pounds 6.67m. Turnover rose to Pounds 48.5m (Pounds 38.3m). Margins were maintained on Atlas machines, which accounted for 62 per cent of sales, but reduced profits came from Titan units principally because of the weak US dollar in the first half, and from General Vacuum Equipment where prices were reduced to maintain volume. Results also included first full figures from Atlas Hurley Moate, where profit was 'not at an acceptable level.' There was a small interest charge of Pounds 70,000 this year, against income of Pounds 631,000. Earnings per share were 55p (45p) and the final dividend is 14p for a total of 21p (19.5p).</p>

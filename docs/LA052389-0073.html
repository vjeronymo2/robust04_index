			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: LITIGATING THE QUARRELS OF YOUNG LOVERS  </P> <P> It was in all the papers. A young woman in Palm Beach, Fla., named Tomontra  Mangrum was stood up by her 17-year-old date who had promised to take her to  the high-school prom. Tomontra did what any jilted young woman would do -- she  filed a lawsuit to recoup the cost of her new shoes, her hairdo plus the  flowers for her hair.  </P> <P> Wait, there is more. . . . The defendant, Marlon Shadd, says that he had  fractured his ankle and had informed Miss Mangrum a week before that he would  not be able to take her to the dance.  </P> <P> It must be obvious to anyone reading this that the only way this dispute can be  resolved is to turn it over to the lawyers.  </P> <P> Something about this story was familiar. My mind went back to my youth when the  situation was very different from the one we have now. Those were the Roosevelt  years when many more men than women were stood up. I can remember at least 10  -- no, make it 12 -- occasions when I arrived at a young woman's door only to  be informed by her father that she had already left for the evening.  </P> <P> In those days, corsages did not grow on trees -- nor did tickets to the  Paramount Theater on Broadway. We're talking about five bucks for the entire  package, but they were 1940 dollars, worth about $100,000 today.  </P> <P> Yet, no matter how cruel the rejection, the last thing I would have done in  that distant time and place would have been to sue the girl who wasn't there.  The fact is I respected her for seeing through me, and for giving me a lower  opinion of myself than I had ever had before.  </P> <P> It just wasn't in for teen-agers to seek out a lawyer's help to resolve our  lovers' quarrels. Most of us didn't even know a lawyer, which is more than can  be said for the affluent kids of today, who usually have one attorney living on  either side of them.  </P> <P> Instead of taking our cases to court, we suffered -- sometimes for weeks and,  if it was serious enough, even a month. We wove fantasies in which we went off  to join the Navy, came back in uniform and then refused to dance with the girl  who had broken our heart. We never wanted monetary satisfaction -- we only  wanted the one who had wronged us to weep tears and beg forgiveness.  </P> <P> Those of us who grew up in the '40s, '50s and even '60s did not wish for a  black-robed judge to mete out justice against the person who had stood us up.  We dealt with our sorrow alone.  </P> <P> So back to Miss Mangrum who, I am sure, is quite lovely. Yet, according to  Marlon, she suffers from a communication problem. The reason that her suit has  today's parents unnerved is that young people are breaking dates all the time,  and if they're going to be dragged into court for it, they'll never get their  homework done.  </P> <P> In one of the newspapers, I read that Marlon's mother offered to compensate  Tomontra for her expenses, but Tomontra's mother refused, saying that Marlon  had to be taught a lesson.  </P> <P> What kind of lesson could Marlon possibly be taught, you may be wondering? He  claims that he gave Tomontra notice and therefore he is not responsible for  Miss Mangrum being left standing in the hall in her prom dress. I know that  there are many people who say Tomontra has no case, but that's the kind lawyers  like best.  </P> <P> All over America teen-agers are awaiting the outcome. The price of suing may be  very high. The terrible thing is that if Miss Mangrum wins the $50, she will  never know if the boys who ask her out are inviting her for herself or because  of her money.  </P></p>

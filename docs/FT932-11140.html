			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: UK-India trade drive under way AN Anglo-Indian initiative to step up trade, following the January visit to India of Britain's Prime Minister John Major, will be launched in London today. During his Indian tour Mr Major and Mr P V Narasimha Rao, his Indian counterpart, announced moves aimed at greater economic co-operation between the two states. Mr Major called on business communities in both countries to consider measures, with the help of government, to improve two-way trade. He asked Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, who was with the prime minister's tour party, to head the new initiative. Dr J J Irani, managing director of Tata Steel and president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, is leading the Indian effort. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, whose department is leading a drive to increase UK exports by promoting partnership between government and industry, will attend today's launch of the Indo-British Partnership Initiative. Britain sells nearly Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.54bn) worth of goods to India, which has a small trade imbalance with the UK. New Delhi has committed itself to a new era of trade liberalisation. Since the visit, British Gas has acted as the UK catalyst - with the help of the south-east Asia desk at the Department of Trade and Industry - to bring together a number of 'patron' companies to spearhead the initiative. Companies already signed up include British Aerospace, Cadbury Schweppes, GEC Alsthom, Inchcape, National Power, Rolls-Royce and Unilever. Representation will be at chief executive or senior level and member companies will each contribute to running costs. Members will be organised along industry sector lines and will form working groups to analyse potential markets and ways to exploit them. The effort will be regionally based, with local Department of Trade offices, chambers of commerce and the Confederation of British Industry providing back-up. Important sectors identified for examination include power generation, telecommunications, food processing, banking and financial services, oil and gas, engineering, textiles and healthcare. The results of the work will be brought together and the prime ministers will be given proposals for enhancing trade between the two countries early next year. A UK spokesman emphasised the initiative was intended primarily to assist medium-sized and small companies without the necessary resources to tackle the Indian market. 'The really big companies can look after themselves. The intention is that other businesses should be able to use the muscle of big companies to get into a market with huge potential.'</p>

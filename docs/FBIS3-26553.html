While she was chairman of  the Sixth CPPCC National Committee, she upheld and refined the  multiparty cooperation and political consultation system under  the CPC's leadership; forcefully advocated and promoted the  workstyle of "political consultation, democratic supervision,  working in a cooperative spirit, and making friends at home and  abroad"; and, with the broad vision and personal charisma unique  to proletarian revolutionaries, united friends of all circles,  enabling our patriotic united front to continue to gain strength  and to develop.

She selflessly dedicated her whole life to the country  and the people; her spirit of dedication is indelibly engraved  on the memory of the Chinese people.    Huang Qizao, vice president of the All-China Women's  Federation, said at the forum: During her revolutionary career  of more than 70 years, Deng Yingchao was full of enthusiasm for  Chinese women's liberation. As a pioneer and leader of China's  women's movement, she mobilized, organized, and urged women to  participate in the revolutionary movement and production and  construction work; called for the realization of equality  between men and women, both legally and in real life; and  repeatedly emphasized the need to protect women's fundamental  interests and to manifest the principle of the freedom of  marriage through legislation.

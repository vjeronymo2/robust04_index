			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW TURNOUT IN L.A. ELECTION  </P> <P> What right have non-voting members of society to complain about the educational  system and the ramifications which produce non-reading and non-writing students  when they have not exercised their right to vote?  </P> <P> We who worked in the precincts were horrified by the apathetic showing. This  deplorable record can be best measured by the scholastic records of today's  students.  </P> <P> And, in the same vein regarding the election, we who worked from 6:30 a.m.  until 8:30 p.m. in the precincts were paid the princely sum of $35; exactly  $2.50 per hour which has been the sum paid for countless number of years. I  hope that election officials will take heed and correct this inequitable  situation.  </P> <P> KIYOKA KURUMADA  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

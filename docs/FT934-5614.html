			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Emerging Markets: Keeping an eye on the old tiger - The Emerging Investor In Latin American terms, Chile is considered the 'old tiger' of capital markets. No longer as dynamic as more sprightly counterparts such as Peru, Chile has a market sophistication unparalleled on the continent. Such maturity is manifested in several ways. The market capitalisation of the Santiago stock exchange, at about Dollars 36.5bn (Pounds 24.4bn), is 95 per cent of GDP - much larger in relative terms than that of, for example, Mexico. The exchange, or bolsa, is underpinned by a strong institutional base lacking elsewhere on the continent. Private pension funds (AFPs) - to which Chileans are theoretically obliged to commit 10 per cent of their wages - have accumulated nearly Dollars 15bn in funds and are expanding by Dollars 300m a month. Local companies regularly tap the solid - if sometimes illiquid - local market through the issue of equity as well as medium and long-term paper. Corporate bonds, denominated in index-linked Unidades de Fomento, carry a coupon of anything between 7 and 12 per cent. Chile was last year the first Latin American country to obtain an investment grade rating of BBB, and there is already talk of a further upgrade. Likewise Endesa, the electricity company, became the continent's first private sector company to win an investment grade. Such features separate Chile from most of its neighbours. 'It is almost like having an Asian economy in the heart of Latin America,' says one analyst. After the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, investors are likely to focus on Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Argentina, largely on hopes of ratings upgrades in both countries. But, says Mr Alfredo Viegas, senior analyst at Salomon Brothers, this does not mean that Chile should be ignored, particularly later in 1994 when the prospects of Chile's accession to Nafta should become clearer. 'We still firmly believe that Chile is the most structurally advanced economy in Latin America. Growth is primarily financed through internal savings, which is the sort we see in many of the Pacific Rim countries, and the type that ultimately leads to a rising standard of living,' says Mr Viegas. Such fundamentals have produced jolting, though significant, gains on the bolsa this year. The IPSA index of the 40 most traded shares, reset at 100 each year, closed on Friday at 139.65, a 27 per cent gain in dollar terms. Volumes have remained low, averaging only Dollars 8m a day, mainly because of the domination of the AFPs which tend to sit on their equity purchases. Most trading is concentrated on very few companies, the three principal sectors of activity being electricity (30 per cent), telecommunications (16 per cent) and petrochemicals (10 per cent). Mr Viegas expects a quiet first half to 1994, with greater interest later. With an average p/e of 16.8 on projected 1993 earnings, Santiago is Latin America's most expensive exchange, but Salomon is nevertheless forecasting real gains of 15-20 per cent next year. Neither imminent presidential and parliamentary elections - on December 11 - nor the prospect of lower economic growth in 1994, are likely to cloud long-term horizons. 'Good corporate fundamentals mean that the larger, well-managed companies will continue to do well even in leaner times,' says Mr Viegas. Chile's economy is expected to grow by 4-5 per cent next year, against projected growth of 6 per cent in 1993 and 10.4 per cent in 1992. Next year's relatively poor performance - measured against exceptional average growth of 6.5 per cent over the past decade - is primarily the result of weak international prices for Chile's three main exports, namely copper, cellulose and fishmeal. Slowdown is most unlikely to produce a change of economic course. Presidential frontrunner Mr Eduardo Frei, candidate of the governing Christian Democrat-led coalition, is committed to continuing the tight fiscal and monetary policies of the present administration. In the medium term, a Frei administration is likely to accelerate economic reform. Mr Juan Villarzu, Mr Frei's economic adviser and the man widely tipped to be the next finance minister, is keen to push through capital market reforms, currently languishing in congress. These aim to broaden investment options for pension and insurance funds. Institutional investors will be allowed to purchase second-tier stock, extending their scope to around 200 companies from the 40 blue-chips currently permitted. They will be allowed to provide venture capital, project funding and to expand their international investments to corporate bonds and equity. Mr Villarzu has also hinted that, given the country's Dollars 10bn external reserves, now may be the time to lift remaining exchange controls which oblige foreign investors to leave money in Chile for at least a year. Given the steady appreciation of the peso, Mr Villarzu probably figures that it may be no bad thing to give foreign capital an escape route. He has also hinted at the possibility of lowering interest rates in order to further stimulate investment - already at historic highs - and to ease pressure on the peso by reducing the differential between domestic and international rates. Cheaper money might also help to stem the flow of American Depository Receipt issues, all the rage in Santiago. The quantity of companies lining up to raise capital on the New York stock exchange has become a source of frustration for some local investors, according to Mr Viegas. According to Mr Daniel Yarur, deputy chairman of the securities and exchange commission, the old tiger may have a bit of life in it yet.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Friday   Week on week change Stock                         Country     close   dollars     %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Migros                        Turkey    13.8839     +3.07     +28.38 Eregli Demir Ve Celik         Turkey     0.4770     +0.08     +21.40 Cia Sudamericana de Vapores   Chile      1.0243     +0.15     +16.63 Kordose                       Turkey     0.4486     +0.06     +15.21 Petrtobas (pfd)               Brazil     0.1143     +0.01     +14.88 Cifra (A)                     Mexico     3.0201     +0.36     +13.67 Michaniki                     Greece    48.0652     +5.22     +12.18 Cukurova Elektrik             Turkey     1.0324     +0.10     +10.15 Grupo Ficiero Banamex-Acciv   Mexico     6.1205     +0.52      +9.26 Cifra (C)                     Mexico     2.8080     +0.23      +9.11  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MEL GIBSON TAKES NEW ROLE: REAL LIFE  </P> <P> Mel Gibson, the star of a string of blockbuster movies and one of Hollywood's  top box-office draws, is going home to Australia "to lead my own life instead  of someone else's."  </P> <P> The star of the "Lethal Weapon" and "Road Warrior" series says he is so tired  after years of nonstop work that he is incapable of making another movie.  </P> <P> "I'm going to take off 10 months or a year, if for no other reason than people  must be getting sick of the sight of me," he told Reuters in a recent  interview.  </P> <P> "But seriously," he added, "it's just doing all these films. My state of mind  says that I never want to do anything again, but I'm sure after a year off I'll  feel like it.  </P> <P> "It's just the workload. I think if I had to make one more film, I couldn't do  it. Not right now. Not for about a year or so. I'm just too tired. I just want  to go home."  </P> <P> Asked where home was, the 34-year-old actor smiled ruefully and said, "I wish  someone would tell me."  </P> <P> Home for much of this year has been Scotland, where he filmed Shakespeare's  classic "Hamlet," which Gibson called "the hardest damned thing I've ever  done."  </P> <P> Last year, home was Thailand, where he spent several months shooting "Air  America," his current release about the CIA's secret air force and its  operations in Laos during the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> Home in real life is a sprawling cattle ranch in the Australian state of  Victoria.  </P> <P> "I'm not myself here," he explained as he sipped black coffee in a luxury hotel  in Los Angeles' fashionable Westwood section. "You're not seeing the real me."  </P> <P> The real Gibson, he explained, likes nothing more than romping on the floor  with his six children or spending his days working with cattle and studying the  genetics of the bovine animals.  </P></p>

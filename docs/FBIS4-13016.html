			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Pondicherry assembly, the entire opposition  consisting of the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam], DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam], CPI [Communist Party  of India], and Janata Dal staged a walkout today following the  deputy speaker's refusal to admit an adjournment motion. The  motion tabled by CPI and Janata Dal members sought to discuss  the signing of the GATT agreement. The deputy speaker, Mr. A.B.  Subramaniam, while refusing permission for the motion said that  the subject does not come under the purview of the union  territory's assembly. The lone CPI member attended the session  with a black towel on his shoulders to protest the signing of  the GATT accord today.    In Kerala, the 12-hour statewide bundh [strike] called by  the  CPI-ML [Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist] today evoked  little response. Barring some minor incidents of stone  throwing, the bundh was by and large peaceful. Some shops and  business establishments remained closed. However, traffic plied  as usual. The bundh call was given in protest against India  signing the GATT agreement.</p>

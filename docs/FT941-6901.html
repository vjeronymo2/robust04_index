			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Rose fearful for Bosnian ceasefires Ceasefires agreed in Sarajevo and central Bosnia could fail if western governments refuse to commit more ground troops, General Sir Michael Rose, United Nations commander in Bosnia, warned yesterday. Speaking after a week-long ceasefire in the Bosnian capital, Gen Rose said the UN needed 3,000-5,000 troops to shore up the fragile peace. They were urgently required, both in Sarajevo and in central Bosnia, where Croat and Moslem military leaders started implementing a ceasefire last Friday. Military experts, including Mr Michael Clark, head of the centre for defence studies at London's King's College, believe at least 5,000 are required to secure ceasefires in the main towns and cities. Gen Rose said: 'I am a realist. In the end, all I can do is the best I can with what I have got, but we are living on borrowed time.' Meanwhile, peace talks are continuing in Washington between Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's prime minister, Mr Kremir Zupak, head of the Bosnian Croats, and Mr Mate Granic, Croatia's foreign minister. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who has been closely involved, said the three sides had 'a very special moment' to achieve peace. 'We need to build on the ceasefire and success we've had in Sarajevo. We can't let this moment slip by.' US officials have already told President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia he risks economic sanctions and isolation if he does not co-operate. The Washington talks are being led by Mr Charles Redman, US special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Mr Steve Oxman, undersecretary of state for European affairs, and Mr Victor Jackovich and Mr Peter Galbraith, US ambassadors to Bosnia and Croatia respectively. They are aimed at setting up a confederation, loosely linking territories held by Bosnian government forces with those held by the Bosnian Croats, which in turn would have an administrative arrangement with Croatia proper. The plan would guarantee the Bosnian Moslem side a degree of political and economic security. But Mr Silajdzic said the plan was 'complex and fraught with difficulties'. US officials said it would also require Serbia to make territorial concessions in eastern Bosnia.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson up 23% LLOYD THOMPSON, the London market insurance broker, increased pre-tax profits 23 per cent to Pounds 8.2m in the six months to December 31, despite what Mr Peter Lloyd, chairman, described as 'very difficult market conditions'. The interim dividend goes up 21 per cent, from 1.65p to 2p, payable from earnings ahead 23 per cent to 7.02p (5.7p). Volume continued to increase, with turnover up 15 per cent from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 19.7m. Mr Lloyd said that the growth in volume had led to higher cash balances, which offset the effect of falling interest rates on investment income, unchanged at Pounds 3.1m. In the wholesale marine business, higher premiums were frequently offset by lower demand, as companies decided to shoulder more risks for themselves. Insurance markets for North American business were 'soft', Mr Lloyd said. Reinsurance business rose 28 per cent, from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 6.8m.</p>

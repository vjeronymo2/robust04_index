			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Noriega says he will not testify in drug trial FORMER Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega said yesterday he would not testify in his drug-trafficking conspiracy trial in Miami. He said he had made the decision because 'my presentation would have to be limited not to include political matters, issues of war, and the (1989 US) invasion.' The decision was announced as the general's defence rested its case. Prosecutors yesterday began to present a rebuttal case in which several agents of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will testify. If convicted on 10 drug and racketeering counts, Gen Noriega could get up to 140 years in prison.</p>

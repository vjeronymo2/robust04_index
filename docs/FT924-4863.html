			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / US Money and Credit: Cool response to signs of recovery IT WAS short, but it was sweet. The Thanksgiving holiday meant that trading on US bond markets was restricted to three-and-a-half days. But in that abbreviated period, there was both good news on the economy and a remarkably sanguine response from bond traders. Normally, signs of economic strength depress bond prices, pushing up yields, as investors fret about looming inflationary dangers. But the Commerce Department's announcement on Wednesday that the nation's economy grew by a sturdy 3.9 per cent during the third quarter - a large upward revision from the previous-reported 2.7 per cent rate - brought only the slightest of reactions. The 30-year long bond, for example, fell by  1/16 to 100 1/16 , where it yielded 7.53 per cent. By Friday's 2pm close. the price had edged only marginally lower, and the yield stood at 7.59 per cent. At first glance, this apparent stoicism was surprising. The third-quarter growth rate, after all, was the strongest registered for four years, and release of the revised data came amid a raft of other encouraging economic news. This included, for example, a 4 per cent increase in durable goods orders in October (although the gain was heavily concentrated in aircraft, automobiles, and defence); a sharp jump in the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence, from 54.6 in October to 65.5 in November; and a 12,000-strong fall in initial claims for state unemployment insurance for the week ended November 14. There are two simple explanations for the market's response. The first is the thought that an economy which is demonstrably recovering under its own steam will be less likely to provoke a large fiscal stimulus package from the Clinton administration next year. The President-elect seemed anxious to reinforce this impression when, amid the Thanksgiving festivities in Little Rock, he said the latest growth figures 'could have some impact on short-term judgments' - although he also stressed that it would not affect his long-term plans to improve the nation's competitive stance. More simply, despite the upturn in industrial activity, there is relatively little sign of any serious inflation threat. In fact, the same Commerce Department report which revised the growth figure, also tweaked the 'price deflator', to show a 1.7 per cent annual rate for the third quarter, compared with the 2.0 per cent rate estimated last month. Third, there is a widespread conviction that this robust level of growth will not be repeated in the immediate future, even if the economy is edging out of the doldrums. It is true that some economic growth forecasts for the first half of 1993 are being nudged higher, but many pundits are happy to stick around the 2.5 per cent mark. This, in turn, might warrant some modest decline in bond prices, but there is a widespread expectation that yields at the long end will hover around the 7.75 per cent mark. This week, further confirmation that the economy is on a slow recovery tack is expected in a steady flow of statistics. It will start with the October leading indicators, to be released on Tuesday; work on to factory orders and auto sales on Thursday; and culminate in the November employment data on Friday. There is little doubt that Friday's news will be the focus of the week: analysts are looking for some further pick-up in non-farm job growth, although they still expect this to come from the service sector, with manufacturing registering another overall loss of jobs. The unemployment figure itself is predicted to remain at around the 7.4 per cent mark.</p>

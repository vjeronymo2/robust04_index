			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA DOES PROTECT INSURANCE POLICYHOLDERS  </P> <P> James Flanigan's column, "Insurance Won't Suffer S&amp;L-Like Collapse" (Oct.  17), put the difficulties of the insurance companies into more realistic  perspective.  </P> <P> However, Flanigan indicated that California does not have a guarantee system, a  system in which all companies chip in to rescue the policyholders of an ailing  member.  </P> <P> California does have such a system now. One measure established a state  guarantee fund to pay consumer claims filed against health insurance firms that  go bankrupt, and a separate bill covers life insurance claims. The bills became  law in September.  </P> <P> DAVID J. PETERS  </P> <P> The writer is a Los Alamitos-based consultant to the insurance industry.  </P></p>

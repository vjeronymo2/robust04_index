			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / US warns Serbia against military action in Kosovo US PRESIDENT George Bush has warned Belgrade that the US would use military force if Serbia provoked military conflict in the province of Kosovo bordering Albania. A letter from Mr Bush to President Slobodan Milosevic and General Zivota Panic, the army chief-of-staff, was delivered on Christmas Day, it emerged yesterday. The letter also said action would be taken against Serbian aircraft if the United Nations Security Council votes to back with force the no-fly zone over Bosnia, which it is expected to do later this week. Mr Bush said the US would also protect UN peacekeepers on the ground in Bosnia and ensure safe passage of humanitarian aid. The US warning was complemented in Geneva by a similar admonition to Serbia from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, who plans to make a one-day visit to Sarajevo on Thursday. He reportedly told Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump state of Yugoslavia, that military intervention was inevitable unless fighting in Bosnia was brought to a halt. In drawing a metaphorical 'line in the sand' in Kosovo, the previously autonomous region which Serbia in effect re-annexed three years ago, the Bush administration clearly hopes to contain the conflicts in former Yugoslavia. The letter raised fears among diplomats at the Geneva conference on former Yugoslavia that Kosovo's repressed Albanians may try to provoke military intervention in an effort to gain independence from Serbia. US State Department officials privately doubt that in its final three weeks the outgoing administration will do more than issue warnings, unless Serbian provocation in Kosovo becomes intolerable. Nor is it thought likely that the US will authorise the provision of arms to the Bosnians. The same officials hope that the incoming government of Mr Bill Clinton will be less reticent. In Geneva, international peace mediators warned that Bosnian forces were poised to launch a counter-offensive amid growing calls for military intervention. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the Geneva conference, said UN peacekeeping forces had reported a build-up of mostly Moslem Bosnian forces on Mount Igman, outside Sarajevo. He reported progress among the three sides in peace talks aimed at building a political framework to accompany the draft constitution proposed by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the co-presidents of the conference.</p>

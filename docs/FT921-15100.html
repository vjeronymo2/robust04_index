			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Arts: Upheaval at the British Museum - Patricia Morison talks to Robert Anderson, the new director who took up his post this week IT MUST be a warm feeling to stand on the steps of the British Museum and think: 'All this is my domain - plus another 40 per cent.' Dr Robert Anderson has been director of the British Museum for just over a week. He inherits the world's first and greatest public collection, and with it an expansion programme which will put the Museum through the most profound upheaval of its 139 years. Anderson, 47, spent six years previously as Director of the National Museums of Scotland. He is fortunate to have left Edinburgh when he did, given the fierce squall which blew up last August over the proposed extension to the Royal Scottish Museum. Anderson was on the panel which chose a modernist scheme, thus prompting the Prince of Wales to resign from being the museum's patron. Before the affair of the Edinburgh carbuncle, Anderson was not a figure known outside the museum world. Among museum people, however, he is regarded as someone with common sense and considerable tact. Academically, he is something of an oddity in his new post. He is the first director of the BM to be a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemists. Anderson's academic career began with a doctorate in physical chemistry at Oxford. The exact title of his thesis he does not recall, but it was about 'the scattering of slow neutrons.' And that, he decided, was as far as he wanted to go with scientific research. Instead, he went to the Royal Scottish Museum as the curator in charge of scientific instruments. The switch from laboratory to museum was not as unexpected as it might seem because, despite an intense dislike of autobiographical revelations, the new director does admit to a childhood in which visits to museums played a major part. His chief love was the Victoria and Albert museum, which ran an imaginative children's club. He recalls that by the age of nine he would travel on his own each Saturday by bus from Finchley to South Kensington. 'Art school students would take us in groups to draw objects, Tang horses and so on, and tell us about their history. It was a really imaginative experiment.' Anderson is at pains to point out that acquiring an appetite for museums was not precocious, nor even unusual, for a London child of his generation. In those days, entry to all the national museums was free: Anderson's fierce opposition to the principle of museum charges has much to do with his childhood experience. It was also one of the factors which won him the post of BM Director. The former director, Sir David Wilson, now retired, is a Viking scholar. During his 15 years as director, he fought with a ferocity worthy of the Vikings in defence of free entry to the Museum, and its role as a major research institution. Anderson's appointment was, therefore, greeted with relief by those who can be called the conservatives within the museum fraternity, and also without much surprise. One curator described it to me as 'the classic insider's appointment'. Anderson will certainly be holding the line on the importance of research. He cites with glee a recent Museums and Galleries Commission report, which warns that any national museum which fails to carry out research 'would ultimately forfeit its claim to be regarded as a national museum.' From the public's point of view, this is good news because it means the BM will continue its commitment to major scholarly exhibitions. Anderson admits to feeling dismay that there were national museums which did not hold out against the pressure to go overboard in the hunt for outside sources of funding. 'During the 1980s, some museums adopted the culture of more commercial attitudes and made sudden changes of direction. What happened during that period cannot now be reversed. For many non-national and independent museums, things will be very bad.' At the BM morale is said to be high. You will hear curators complaining that both they and their objects are dreadfully cramped. They also grumble about a ponderous administration. But the first problem, at least, is going to be solved. Starting next year, the British Library will move north to the dismal St Pancras site. The people at the Museum are delighted to see the back of this difficult daughter and besides, it will gain them that staggering extra 40 per cent in space. Last year, the BM published a handsome booklet to tell us all of the costly delights in store, such as the plans to renovate the dilapidated King's Library, and to restore the Round Reading Room to its original blue-and-gold decoration and turn it into the BM's own reading room. As anyone who has been to the BM in the last decade will know, existing galleries have been renovated to an extraordinary extent, 46 of them so far. The pace has been forced by the coming internal expansion, when the Museum of Mankind will finally rejoin the BM. Changes are due to be more or less complete for the 250th anniversary in 2003. Anderson's major problem will be finding the money for these ambitious changes, in the region of Dollars 80m. He speaks about it with considerable calmness. 'I'd like to see the government being rather more flexible in providing money for exceptional circumstances. The British Library moving out just has to be called exceptional.' So far, there appears to be no sign that the Treasury will be offering the BM anything extra to pay for the expansion plan. 'We will be trying very hard to raise money from outside sources. However, there just is not going to be money from sponsors for the behind-the-scenes kind of things.' There is still plenty of time for Anderson to wear out his shoe-leather in the eternal search for moneyed admirers of the BM. Meanwhile, he has some months to get to know his staff, Ginger the Mummy, and Pete Marsh, also known as Lindow Man. Nor is the new director completely severed from his scientific roots. Unknown to the public, there is in the BM 'an extremely good collection of scientific instruments.' We can expect to be seeing more of that in the coming years.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Southern comfort: Bill Clinton's economic policies promise a radical break with the laissez-faire of the 1980s It's time to put people first. That is the core of my national economic strategy for America. And that will be the fundamental idea that guides my presidency - Bill Clinton, June 1992 The economic convictions of Governor Bill Clinton, the front-runner in the US presidential election, are now a matter of pressing importance. Would he make marginal changes to US economic policy or push the US in a radically new direction? The answer is still hotly disputed, partly because Mr Clinton's speeches are the artful constructions of a master politician. For example, he proclaims his commitment to free trade, yet in the same breath condemns the Republicans for 'exporting' American jobs to the Third World. The truth seems to be that Mr Clinton is offering a genuine break with the past. As a conservative southerner, he has little sympathy for either old-style 'tax and spend' liberalism or Republican laissez-faire. President George Bush is offering the nation a watered-down version of Reaganism. He argues that big government is part of America's economic problem and pledges new tax cuts if re-elected. Tax cuts - particularly more generous relief on capital gains - are sold as a way to stimulate more saving and investment, thus boosting growth and helping reduce the budget deficit. For Mr Clinton, this is the failed policy of 'trickle-down' economics. He argues that rich individuals failed to invest or save in the 1980s despite a halving of the top rate of income tax. Instead of raising productivity growth, supply-side economics led to a consumption binge of unprecedented proportions. Democrats attribute the economy's inability to shake off recession in the past two years largely to the record corporate and personal debts accumulated during the boom years of the 1980s. Mr Clinton offers policies based on radically different premises. From the day he shook former president John F Kennedy's hand as a schoolboy in the 1960s, he has believed in government as a positive force in people's lives. He believes the US is losing ground relative to Europe and Japan because federal and state governments often do little to support economic growth. Deliberately echoing the rhetoric of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, Mr Clinton is offering the American people a 'new covenant' - a pledge that a revitalised public sector will take active steps to help the forgotten mass of middle-class American families, many of which have recently suffered a steady erosion of living standards. But in an era of global economic competition and unprecedented mobility of physical and financial capital, how can government best promote high living standards? Drawing on the ideas of advisers such as Mr Robert Reich, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, Mr Clinton argues that policymakers should concern themselves with factors of production that are immobile, principally people and infrastructure. He makes the argument crystal clear in his economic plan, Putting People First: 'In the emerging global economy, everything is mobile: capital, factories, even entire industries. The only resource that's really rooted in a nation - and the ultimate source of all its wealth - is its people. The only way America can compete and win in the 21st century is to have the best-educated, best-trained workforce in the world, linked together by transport and communication networks second to none.' The underlying logic seems persuasive. US per capita incomes once depended purely on the performance of American companies. In a global market, they now depend on Americans' ability to gain employment with the world's most dynamic companies, regardless of their ultimate ownership. One route to high US living standards is thus to persuade the most productive companies - German and Japanese as well as American - to locate high-tech plants and research facilities in the US. But they will do this only if the US offers a better environment for business than other countries, which means a better-educated workforce and a modernised public infrastructure. On education and training, Mr Clinton's proposals move well beyond the usual focus on high-school reforms. By proposing a national apprenticeship programme based loosely on continental European practice, he has become the first presidential candidate to take seriously the educational needs of the majority of Americans who do not attend university. To help those already in the workforce, he would oblige employers to invest about 1.5 per cent of payroll in training or contribute to the cost of public training schemes. The college-bound, meanwhile, would benefit from financial reforms allowing all qualified students to borrow from the government and repay loans either through a low tax on subsequent earnings or by serving the community for a limited period after graduation, for example as police officers or social workers. The bold idea of encouraging thousands of graduates to pay for college by enlisting in a domestic 'Peace Corps' is especially appealing for middle-class families hit by rocketing tuition costs. On infrastructure investment, Mr Clinton's plans go beyond mundane projects such as new bridges and roads. He favours Japanese-style bullet trains and promises a 'communications network of high-technology interaction that will link every home, every school, every factory, every business in America, and put us in the lead economically well into the 21st century'. Mr Clinton's case for more activist government has other important planks. He sees healthcare as partly an economic issue, because soaring costs are putting an intolerable burden on much of American business. The Republican claim that competition can bring down costs is dismissed as yet another failed nostrum of the 1980s. Noting that a competitive free-for-all has led to healthcare spending equivalent to 13 per cent of gross domestic product - easily the world's highest - Mr Clinton argues convincingly that the US must learn lessons from other advanced countries and accept the need for sterner government regulation, including national spending caps. He is also openly advocating a more interventionist industrial policy, partly to help redeploy resources devoted to defence during the cold war years. His advisers say he is not interested in 'picking winners' but does believe that the federal government could do more to support the development of new 'generic' technologies in fields such as robotics, high-speed computing and biotechnology. He would create a civilian research and devel opment agency 'to bring together business and universities to develop cutting-edge products and tech-nologies'. For many economists, however, Mr Clinton's otherwise attractive plan is flawed by a failure to address the nation's single most pressing problem: the federal budget deficit. His promise to 'halve the deficit' by 1996 despite proposing an additional Dollars 200bn of investment in education and infrastructure is not regarded as credible. The extra spending is not large relative to the US budget, but it is likely to inflate the deficit because the offsetting tax increases and spending cuts proposed are dubious. For example, Mr Clinton has unrealistic hopes of raising about Dollars 85bn from the top 2 per cent of earners and Dollars 45bn from foreign companies operating in the US. Mr Clinton's failure to propose tough fiscal measures - such as Mr Ross Perot's bracing Dollars 160bn increase in petrol taxes and Dollars 230bn cut in entitlement programmes - makes a mockery of his pro-growth rhetoric. The drain on national savings from record budget deficits is arguably the single most important cause of low investment and productivity growth. Yet what should Mr Clinton say if he hopes to win the election? Should he make the same mistake as Mr Walter Mondale, the Democratic candidate in 1984, and call for a general tax increase? This would be to present himself as a lamb for slaughter. Given electoral realities, budget policy should perhaps not count as a clear negative for Mr Clinton. His promise to raise federal investment without specifying credible tax increases is no more irresponsible than Mr Bush's pledge to cut taxes without specifying offsetting spending cuts. What he will do if he wins the election is uncertain; if the economy is still stagnant, he will face immediate pressure to agree a fiscal stimulus. But there is little reason to fear he will perform worse in the medium term than the Republicans, who have quadrupled the national debt in 12 years. He may do better. As governor of a poor state, he is used to making hard fiscal choices and is reputedly keener on budget balance than most of his economic advisers. He may even take advantage of an emerging consensus in Congress on the need for budget retrenchment finally to bring the deficit under control. Many elements of the Clinton plan have received broad support - in normally Republican business circles as well as in Democratic strongholds such as the teaching profession and labour unions. People appreciate Mr Clinton's long time horizons. In the US, economic policy debates have normally been restricted to next year's tax and spending plans. Mr Clinton is breaking new ground by shifting the focus to the long-term determinants of productivity growth, such as the quality of the workforce. The common thread linking different parts of the plan is the notion that the US must adapt and become more like its main trading rivals, such as Germany and Japan. It is striking that each of Mr Clinton's main reform proposals - in education and training, infrastructure, healthcare and industrial policy  -would push the US economy in a distinctly European direction. Mr Clinton, in effect, is offering the American people something akin to a Germanic social market in which free enterprise is bolstered, rather than undermined, by strong social policies. This approach is not without risks: greater state intervention can inhibit the ability of economies to respond flexibly to economic shocks, which is one reason why German unification has imposed such great strains in Europe. But it also offers the prospect of greater social cohesion, which may be more important in the long run. Mr Clinton's success in the polls suggests Americans are ready for what could prove an historic change of direction.</p>

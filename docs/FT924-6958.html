			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / GEC to restore pay-offs UNION negotiators yesterday claimed victory when GEC Avery, the Birmingham-based weighing equipment subsidiary of the UK electronics and electrical engineering group, agreed to restore an enhanced redundancy pay agreement for more than 2,000 workers. The agreement, due to be signed today, wins back the right to redundancy pay for workers employed before April 6. It had been cut about two years ago as part of an economy drive. The move follows a damages award by the High Court to a former employee made redundant on inferior terms. The company has agreed to pay unions' court costs of Pounds 130,000. The company does not accept the unions' argument that redundancy pay had formed part of workers' contracts. The new agreement sets redundancy pay on a contractual footing for the first time. 'At the end of this process we have achieved an agreement with which we are satisfied,' the company said. It refused to comment on the detail of the agreement. The company has agreed to pay 60 former employees who had been made redundant on inferior pay compensation equivalent to the enhanced pay, as well as 15 per cent interest. The MSF technical and professional union said the company's concession added weight to growing evidence that almost all GEC companies, employing 80,000 workers in the UK, would have to reassess their policy of squeezing redundancy pay.</p>

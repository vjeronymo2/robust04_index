			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPRIATI WILL ADD GRAF TO HER LIST IN TODAY'S FEATURE AT WIMBLEDON  </P> <P> Who is missing from this list? Martina Navratilova, Monica Seles, Gabriela  Sabatini and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.  </P> <P> Did you say Steffi Graf?  </P> <P> In a career that began in March, Jennifer Capriati has played all the  top-ranked players except Graf, ranked No. 1, but all that changes today.  </P> <P> Capriati, 14, and Graf, 21, punctuate a long day of heavyweight matches today  at Wimbledon as the 106th All England Championships begin a second week.  </P> <P> Graf, who flew to Hamburg, West Germany, Saturday night to see a doctor about a  flareup of sinusitis, said she expects a good match.  </P> <P> "It wasn't that I was really eager for it before, but now that it's happened,  I'll enjoy it," Graf said.  </P> <P> Possibly, but Graf's road to a third consecutive Wimbledon title does not look  very easy. After Capriati, she could play Jana Novotna, Seles in the semifinals  and Navratilova in the final.  </P> <P> Navratilova's way seems much clearer: Judith Weisner, then possibly Katarina  Maleeva and Gabriela Sabatini before meeting Graf in the final.  </P> <P> Fifteen fourth-round matches are scheduled today as well as the completion of  Ivan Lendl's third-round match with Bryan Shelton that was halted at dusk  Friday tied one set apiece.  </P> <P> The top men's matches include second-seeded Boris Becker against Pat Cash,  third-seeded Stefan Edberg against No. 13 Michael Chang, seventh-seeded Brad  Gilbert against David Wheaton, Guy Forget against Christian Bergstrom and Goran  Ivanisevic against Mark Koevermans.

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIFFERING VIEWS OF 'LONER ON THE LEFT'  </P> <P> It's too bad Benedict Arnold isn't alive so you could do a real puff piece on a  traitor. Actually, however, old Benedict didn't stoop to the degraded level of  your hero, Ramsey Clark, to whom View devoted a Page 1, four-color love letter.  </P> <P> Despite the publicity given to Jane Fonda's embrace of the Communist Viet Cong  and her taunting of sick, wounded and starving U.S. prisoners of the North  Vietnamese Reds, the American POWs ignored her as a brainless Hollywood  airhead, Barbarella over the hill.  </P> <P> But when Ramsey Clark, the former attorney general of the United States,  belittled the helpless American captives and praised their Communist jailers,  that broke the spirit of many U.S. POWs, some of whom died. Others, who  survived, have forgiven their Viet jailers but still regard Ramsey Clark as a  son of Satan.  </P> <P> ALBERT J. FORN, Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT DEMANDS U.S. HALT ITS PHONE TAPS OF EIGHT ALIENS  </P> <P> Civil rights attorneys filed suit Wednesday demanding that the federal  government cease tapping telephone conversations between eight Los Angeles-area  aliens arrested on subversion charges and their lawyers.  </P> <P> The suit accuses the FBI, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S.  Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh and the Executive Office for Immigration Review  of interfering with the privileged communications between the attorneys and  their clients -- seven Palestinians and a Kenyan -- arrested in January, 1987.  </P> <P> None of the eight aliens -- originally accused of belonging to a Marxist  faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization -- have been charged with  criminal activity. Some still could be deported.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unrelated Cases  </P> <P> At a press conference at the American Civil Liberties Union's office in Los  Angeles, ACLU Executive Director Ramona Ripston expressed fears that government  officials have tapped telephone conversations in her office involving unrelated  cases as well. She estimated that 200 pending ACLU court cases could be  jeopardized.  </P> <P> "The government admitted wiretapping these plaintiffs and overhearing  conversations between these plaintiffs and their lawyers," Ripston said of the  aliens' cases. "We here in the ACLU are enormously concerned that our  telephones may have been tapped."  </P> <P> Evidence of the electronic surveillance surfaced in March in court documents  related to immigration proceedings against the so-called "Los Angeles 8." In  the documents, U.S. Department of Justice Counsel Michael Lindemann noted that  a single conversation was overheard in the case against the aliens.  </P> <P> In connection with this, Lindemann has told Immigration Judge Ingrid Hrycenko,  who has been conducting the deportation proceedings against the aliens, that he  and his co-counsels have not been given the surveillance tapes.  </P> <P> Justice Department officials in Washington, where the suit was filed in federal  court, declined comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unanswered Questions  </P> <P> Peter Shey of the National Center for Immigrant Rights said that, while  Lindemann insisted the conversation did not involve attorney-client privilege,  "the government has not stated who made that determination, the standards used  to make that determination, or when that determination was made."  </P> <P> Moreover, Shey said, "despite our inquiries to the government, they have  refused to confirm or deny that communications between attorneys and clients at  this time are no longer the subject of surveillance."  </P> <P> Government officials contend that electronic surveillance is authorized by the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act when individuals are believed to have  engaged in criminal acts deemed a threat to national security.  </P> <P> But the aliens' attorneys insist that the surveillance is illegal because their  clients have never been employed by a foreign power, or committed any illegal  acts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the National Center for Immigrant Rights Inc. of Los Angeles filed a  separate claim with the U.S. attorney general's office in Washington seeking  $250,000 for seven plaintiffs whose right to privacy and freedom of expression  were allegedly violated by the surveillance, Shey said.  </P> <P> The basis of the government's subversion charges against the aliens, who were  accused of being national security risks, was the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act,  which subjects them to deportation. Since 1987, the INS has dropped noncriminal  charges against six of the eight, accusing the six of visa violations. Still  accused of subversion are Khader Hamide, 35, of Los Angeles and Michel  Shehadeh, 33, of Long Beach.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ronald L. Soble contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party political adviser Francisco </F> Weffort by Fernando de Barros e Silva; place and date not given  -- first two paragraphs are FOLHA DE SAO PAULO introduction]    [Text] The PT [Workers Party] has distanced itself from the  peoples' movements that gave it birth and become a party of  officeholders and internal camps. The diagnosis of the crisis  hanging over the PT comes from political scientist Francisco  Weffort, 56, a professor at USP [Sao Paulo University] and  member of the political council that drafted the platform for  Lula's campaign for the presidency.    A founder of the PT, its former secretary general (1984-87),  and a former member of its Executive Board (1980-89), at 1500  today Weffort will attend a public meeting at PUC [Pontifical  Catholic University] in Sao Paulo, an event convened by  intellectual and labor union members who see in the "castling"  of the PT leadership a threat to Lula's election. Weffort says  he is rooting for the FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] plan.    [Barros e Silva] What do you think of the FHC economic plan,  and the administration?    [Weffort] Fernando Henrique is the government. I hope the  plan is successful and achieves the stability it seeks. That  could be a better starting point from which the next  administration can implement a policy of growth. Any  reservations one might make at this point are secondary, in my  opinion. The policy of "the worse things get, the better" does  not help anyone.    [Barros e Silva] The PT calls itself a socialist party.  Would  a Lula administration pave the way for socialism?    [Weffort] No. Lula's program seeks to democratize and  modernize capitalism. This means redistributing income, finally  implementing agrarian reform, correcting the imbalances in  regional distribution, and carrying out a series of economic  reforms, including a reform of the State, that will permit  resumption of growth. Brazil is so conservative that the  capitalists are unable to democratize capitalism.    [Barros e Silva] What effect does the fact that the most  orthodox faction of the party holds a majority of the leadership  posts have on the PT program?    [Weffort] I do not know what you mean by "orthodox faction."  Orthodox as regards what?    [Barros e Silva] The dogmas of the Left.    [Weffort] That does not exist in the PT. The backwardness  people talk about today does not lie with the PT's Left; it is  in the eyes of those who are looking at the party. The problem  is something else: the PT is a national party that expresses the  inequalities and heterogeneities of Brazilian society. One  cannot imagine Brazil having a national party of the Left that  does not express the protest sentiments that are at work in  society. Sometimes the party has trouble understanding certain  requirements of development policy in Brazil today.    [Barros e Silva] So what are the party's "blind spots?"    [Weffort] The PT's biggest problem lies in the fact that it  ends up making room for some of the corporativism we have in  this country. Sometimes you think a fellow is defending the  government monopoly on petroleum because he is a radical.  Actually he is connected with the corporativist interests in the  petroleum business. What passes for radicalism is a sectoralist  view of the policy, held by those who cannot see the country as  a whole.    [Barros e Silva] Lula's electoral base at this point is  larger than that of the PT. If he becomes president, who will  govern--Lula, or the party? Does Lula risk becoming a new  "savior of the nation," thus reviving the old messianic  tradition of Brazilian politics?    [Weffort] It is neither the party nor Lula that will govern.  It is the government of alliances that Lula will preside over.  Even if he does not forge alliances for purposes of the  election, it is clear that he needs to build alliances in order  to govern. As regards the messianic tradition, I do not think  such a risk exists. Lula is a charismatic leader who has been  working for years to build up the institutions. That runs  counter to the messianic route.    [Barros e Silva] Is the current configuration of the PT  leadership the result of the weakening of the social movements  that played a central role in the formation of the party? Has  the petista culture been lost?    [Weffort] In part this is due to a decline in the ability of  the social movements to exert pressure, but mainly it is an  expression of the changes in the national political picture.  When the PT was born, at the end of the military regime, people  were convinced it would be possible to build democracy from the  ground up. An antigovernment sentiment was spreading throughout  the society. As the dictatorship was on its deathbed, the social  movements became weaker, while the channels of representative  democracy with its extremely powerful attraction were opening  up. The PT threw its grass-roots leaders onto the scenario of  representative democracy. The consequence was a certain  strangulation of the fellow who simply wanted to be a  petista militant, the guy who has no political  ambitions and does not take part in the internal tussles among  the different camps in the party. It is not the leadership's  fault.    [Barros e Silva] Has the PT become a party of cadres?    [Weffort] It has become a party of officeholders and  internal  camps. It has some fairly well-organized partisan factions  within it. I am not against this, but I think that by itself  this is not enough. You have to have people who are not aligned  with any camp and not interested in running for elective office.  What is missing are those militants whom we used to call PT-PT,  those who do not belong to any faction.    [Barros e Silva] The PT leadership reacted vehemently to the  manifesto that called on the militants to discuss the gap  between the leadership and the rank and file of the party. As  one who signed the text, what do you think of that reaction?    [Weffort] There is a mistake in all that. I signed that text  with the intent of discussing how the PT could go back to being  a party of the masses. I did not sign off on criticisms of the  leadership, and I tell you that if that was the intent, I would  not have endorsed it. I believe this could hurt not only Lula's  campaign, but the objectives I want to achieve.    [Barros e Silva] What are the PT's boundaries in terms of  political alliances during the presidential campaign?    [Weffort] The chances of an alliance during the first round  are very limited. Now the chances of an alliance of masses  during the runoff are great, if the PT keeps an open mind from  now on. In regard to the boundaries, I believe the classical  parties of conservatism--the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party],  the PFL [Liberal Front Party] and, secondarily, the PTB  [Brazilian Labor Party]--are beyond the realm of possibility.  Alliances could be formed on the other side.    [Barros e Silva] Even with Quercia?    [Weffort] It is unlikely, but I think it has to be discussed  separately. We must not think only of the leaders; we must  consider the masses they represent.    [Barros e Silva] Do you concur with the PT leadership's ban  against party participation in the constitutional revision?    [Weffort] I think the PT got itself into a mess on that. The  party had every right to oppose the revision but, once it was  approved, it had a duty to participate. It lost more by not  joining the revision than it would have had it taken part, even  if it always voted against the changes. Staying out helps  isolate a party that needs to leave itself open to alliances.</p>

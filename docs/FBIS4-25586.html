			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "China--`A Train Which Advances Rapidly'"] </F>   [Text] China's development situation greatly affects Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability, and the people of Hong Kong are  very much concerned about the mainland's economic situation.    As indicated by several state leaders's recent remarks and  by  information provided by some authoritative departments, the  present situation of the Chinese economy is good. What  impressed us most is: The trend of rapid economic growth is  still maintained this year despite a steady drop in the pace of  growth, and the GDP in the first half of this year is expected  to increase by approximately 12 percent over the same period of  last year; the trend of reform is good, the several major reform  measures introduced this year proceed smoothly despite arduous  efforts made and the great difficulties met, the new system is  running normally, and China has fully entered the new period of  establishing a socialist market economic system; a good  situation of opening up to the outside world, which is  unprecedented, has emerged. China is opening up to every trade  partner and has become one of the countries in the world with  such ae great degree of opening up. A few days ago, on the  basis of announcing the abolition of import administration for  283 commodities late last year, China also relaxed restrictions  on the import of 195 commodities. This year, China's foreign  trade continues to grow at a full and high speed, and import and  export volume in the first four months increased by 20 percent  over the same period last year.    As for China's economic situation, the international  community has, generally speaking, made very good comments on  it. Not long ago, NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, a French weekly,  published an article about impressions of China after visiting  it, saying that "visitors are really startled by China's  changes" and that in China, the "train has been set in motion,  this is a train of reform and full-scale opening up which is  advancing at a high speed." Sutherland, director-general of the  GATT, said in admiration: "China's ambitious reform makes its  economic system closer to the international trade system" and  "the Chinese economy is undergoing eye-catchingly great  changes." Even U.S. President Clinton also acknowledged not  long ago that "last year, China was the country with the fastest  economic growth in the world" and that "an economic entity  belonging to the 21st century is gradually taking shape in  China."    Hong Kong is linked by common mountains and rivers with the  mainland, and the people of Hong Kong are more capable of  noticing the mainland's constant changes and of listening to the  mainland people's footsteps of making great strides. We may  ponder on things which we see and hear or even personally  experience and take part in.    In recent years, influential powers in the world have been  trying every possible means to cooperate with China, and many  globally renowned big enterprises have been vying with each  other in marching into the market of China. What does it mean?  It means that apart from having a vast market and an abundant  supply of labor and raw and processed materials, more important  is that the Chinese economy is growing at a quick pace, its  investment environment has been improved greatly, and its  domestic market is linking up with the international market step  by step. These are precisely the results of China's reform.    As far as Hong Kong business investments in the mainland are  concerned, areas of investment have been extended to interior  provinces or even to border areas in the northwest, the focus of  investment fields has shifted from tertiary industry to  infrastructure construction, and the scale ranges from investing  tens of thousands or several millions yuan in running an  enterprise to investing billions or even 10 billions yuan in  developing stretches of land in a city. Not long ago, three  worldwide famed transnational companies based in Hong Kong--New  World Development Company Limited, Sun Hung Kai Company Limited,  and Henderson Land Development Company Limited, decided to  jointly invest 15 billion yuan in rebuilding riverside urban  districts and some obsolete industrial enterprises in Wuhan,  which is inspiring. What does it mean? It means that China's  economic situation is getting better and better, and China has  increasingly strong power to attract foreign investment.    A number of Chinese state-owned enterprises have been  successfully listed in Hong Kong. The first group of them are  nine state-owned enterprises, which have issued a total of 5.5  billion H-shares and raised 11.6 billion Hong Kong dollars of  funds, thus helping China's securities market take the first  gratifying step towards internationalization. Now, another  group of 22 state-owned enterprises scattered over the country  are going to be listed in Hong Kong and in the United States.  What does it mean? It means that the transformation of China's  state-owned enterprise mechanisms is successful and approved of  and accepted by international investors, and that the trend of  the reform of state-owned enterprises is good and promises high  hopes of establishing a modern enterprise system.    In the exchange market of Hong Kong, we notice that the  exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and renminbi is kept  at 100 to around 110 and that between U.S. dollars and renminbi  has remained at one to 8.7 since China announced the unification  of the exchange rates. What does it mean? This phenomenon also  shows that China's financial situation is stable.    We are not saying that everything is fine when we describe  China's economic situation as good. Since China is so big a  country and its conditions are so complicated, it is impossible  that nothing is going wrong in the development process. Reform  brings about a readjustment of interests, and different  localities and different kinds of people benefit from the same  reform at different times and in different degrees, thus it is  inevitable that certain ideological problems arise. Reform is  an orderly and gradual process which can never be accomplished  in one move. At a time when the old system is being transformed  into the new one and domestic and international markets have not  converged, certain friction and conflicts are bound to arise.  Although these problems are nonessentials, the CPC and the  Chinese Government still attach great importance to them and  vigorously seek to solve them by means of reform.    We appreciate the remark made by Malaysian Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamed: It is never easy to rule a country with a  population of over 10 million, let alone rule a big country with  a population of over 1.1 billion! If we take such an attitude,  various nonessential problems arising in China's economic work  are comprehensible.</p>

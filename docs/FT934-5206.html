			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Court orders surrender of riot film A court yesterday ordered news organisations to hand over film and photographs taken during a violent anti-Nazi demonstration in Welling, south-east London, last month. Judge Gerald Butler QC ruled at Southwark Crown Court that the public interest in seeing the capture of those responsible for rioting on October 16 which left 200 police and 50 other people injured 'far outweighed' the real possibility of an increased risk to photographers as a result of his decision. The order, sought by the Metropolitan Police, applies to the Press Association news agency, the BBC, Independent Television News, British Sky Broadcasting, London News Network, and The Guardian, The Observer, The Sunday Times, the People and the News of the World, which all opposed the applica-tion. The judge said that when trouble broke out during the protest, which attracted up to 16,000 demonstrators, police officers were attacked with a hail of missiles. The judge said that he accepted the police contention that, although they had photographs and video film of the violence, this presented an incomplete picture. The material held by various media organisations was far more extensive and was necessary to identify the culprits. He said most of those opposing the application, including the Press Association, had contended that courts should be slow to take any step which would restrict full and fair news reporting. Among the arguments barrister Mr Manuel Barca had put forward on their behalf was that the police application would lead to an 'actual or perceived loss of impartiality and an increased danger to photographers'. No order was made regarding costs.</p>

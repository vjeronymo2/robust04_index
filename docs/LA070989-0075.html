			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALMS SPRINGS ETERNAL  </P> <P> Unfortunately, your Travel Editor Jerry Hulse was accurate when he described  this city's problems. Most of us who live here year-round do not want Palm  Springs turned into a Coney Island or a race track with streets lined with  T-shirt shops. The question we have is whether a city of the '90s needs a mayor  of the '60s. The quote from Mayor Sonny Bono, "I am a tourist attraction,"  explains part of the city's problem. Sonny Bono is a celebrity in his own mind  who has used the city's highest office to promote himself.  </P> <P> Last October the Citizens of Palm Springs, a citizen advocate group, voted  unanimously to give Mayor Sonny Bono and City Manager Norm King a  "no-confidence" vote. King, who told you he favors the proposed stadium and "is  very much looking forward to this year's road race," was publicly asked to  resign last week by one of our city council members. Maybe there is hope for a  comeback after all.  </P> <P> DICK SRODA  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

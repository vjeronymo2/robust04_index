			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Although the US bond market is closed today for the Presidents' Day holiday, the calendar is busy enough in the rest of the week to provide fixed-income investors with something new to digest. Tomorrow, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gives the biannual Humphrey Hawkins address to Congress, where he is expected to provide more details of the thinking behind the February 4 increase in US interest rates, which has so disturbed bond market sentiment over the past fortnight. Any hint from Mr Greenspan that he is close to tightening policy again would be likely to upset the already rattled market. Also tomorrow, the Conference Board releases its latest survey of consumer confidence, and analysts are expecting little change in the reading. On Thursday, the January durable goods orders report is released, and continued strength in the numbers is expected. A day later the latest monthly existing home sales figures are published. Finally, this week's Treasury auctions could cause a few problems, given the current weakness in market sentiment. On Wednesday, Dollars 17bn of two-year notes will be sold, followed by Dollars 11bn of five-year notes on Thursday. If prices continue to fall, the auctions could prove a crucial test of the market's mood.</p>

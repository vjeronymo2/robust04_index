			<p>CSO     [Text] Mr. Wichit Suphinit, the governor of the Bank of  Thailand, issued a statement following Mr. Giff, the head of the  G-7 (seven industrialized countries) work team. He said that he  had come to explain the details of the money-laundering law as a  course of action for Thailand. In principle, the central bank  feels that the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages.    Three points where submitted for consideration: 1.  Disclosing  the account figures of customers. Consideration must be given to  promulgating a law to protect those who make disclosures,  because this could pose a danger to financial institutions that  enjoy the trust of depositors. 2. Using special or fictitious  names in making deposits. Concerning this, in actual practice,  the bank knows the real identity of depositors who use  fictitious names. 3. Reporting unusual account transfers.</p>

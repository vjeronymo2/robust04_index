			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Zale returns to the black in quarter Zale, the biggest US jewellery retailer, yesterday reported a return to profit for the first full quarter since it came out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last July. In the three months to December, it made net profits of Dollars 41.6m, or Dollars 1.19 a share. The predecessor company made net losses of Dollars 17.8m in the same period last year, largely because of heavy reorganisation costs. Sales fell from Dollars 428.2m to Dollars 396.5m, but this was because Zale closed 175 stores as part of its restructuring. Sales at the stores which remained open rose by 1.6 per cent. Zale has 1,276 outlets in the US, Puerto Rico and Guam operating under the names Zales Jewelers, Gordon's Jewelers, Bailey Banks &amp; Biddle, and Corrigan's. It went into bankruptcy protection at the beginning of 1992 when it became unable to meet the interest payments on junk bonds issued in the 1980s.</p>

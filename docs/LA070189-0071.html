It also had a report  that an Uno aide was found to belong to a prostitution club.  </P> <P> Uno and his aides seemed to be trying to ignore the latest scandal Friday,  declining to comment.  </P> <P> According to an Uno aide quoted in the Focus article, Uno said: "For God's  sake, there's no truth in it."  </P></p>

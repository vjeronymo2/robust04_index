			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie battles to stay above 2,400 LONDON'S equity market battled gamely to build on Monday's good showing, fighting off bouts of profit-taking and bear selling to close above the crucial 2,400 level on the FT-SE 100-share Index, although well below the session's best. Behind yesterday's gritty performance was a brace of encouraging corporate results from two leading retailers, Next and Tesco, favourable press comment on the most recent UK economic data, and a strengthening of sterling against the D-Mark. It was also noted that three-month sterling interbank, a good guide to rate prospects, fell. The most recent opinion polls, all of which confirmed a Labour lead of around two to three points over the Conservatives, appeared to do little damage to a market which dealers said had already discounted just about every conceivable permutation for the next parliament. Commented one dealer, perusing the poll result from Harris confirming Labour's lead: 'At the moment I feel more of a psephologist than a share trader.' The equity market kicked off in fine form, with the leaders marked up sharply by marketmakers keen to head off any sizeable European buying orders triggered by the strong performance from Wall Street overnight. The ploy worked, stifling any big trades early in the session and leading to a minor setback in the market. A mid-morning programme trade, said to have been on the buy side, plus some genuine institutional demand, pushed the market up strongly around midday. But a weak opening by Wall Street, which moved progressively lower before London closed, affected sentiment to leave London only moderately ahead on balance. The FT-SE Index ended a net 3.3 up at 2,404.2, having touched 2,417.7, the day's best level, just prior to the Wall Street opening. Bank shares remained at the forefront of the market's attention, with Midland Bank moving ahead at the outset on stories, later denied, that Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) was about to announce the terms of its merger with Midland. Dealers remain convinced that HSBC will have to pay a minimum 400p a share. Retailers Next and Tesco delighted followers with results at the very top end of expectations, leading to a series of profit revisions by retailing analysts. Hopes of imminent good news on Reuters' Globex dealing system encouraged widespread demand for the company's shares. ICI rose as institutions paid more heed to the positive long-term stance adopted by its broker, Hoare Govett, than to the broker's profits downgrade. Vague rumours around the market that a Labour victory on Thursday would see the introduction of a windfall profits tax on the highly profitable water and electricity companies depressed share prices of all the utilities. Waste Management International made a highly successful UK market debut, closing around the 610p mark compared with the 585p placing price, with US buyers easily outweighing UK sellers.</p>

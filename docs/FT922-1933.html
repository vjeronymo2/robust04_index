			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber growers agree to work towards free market NATURAL RUBBER producers have agreed for the first time to work towards a new, open market system, with the possibility of international prices being set through a centralised exchange in Singapore. At the end of a three-day meeting here members of the the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries agreed to 'develop and foster one centralised open market in the rubber producing region'. The producers' association, formed in 1970, groups Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, India and Singapore which between them supply more than 80 per cent of natural rubber. At present more than 70 per cent of the world natural rubber trade is carried out through direct private party to party deals between plantations or smallholder groups and the main consumer companies, mainly the tyre manufacturers. Producer countries, frustrated by a prolonged period of low prices, had said in the past that the system was unfair and had suggested the formation of a rubber producers' cartel in order to gain higher prices. Mr Ahmad Farouk, chairman of the Malaysian Rubber Research and Development Board, said what was significant about the Singapore meeting was that consumers' representatives were now expressing a willingness to work towards a more open rubber trading system. 'What the big tyre companies want more than anything else is security of supply. In the short term they might gain by cheaper, direct deals with certain producers. But they also realise that the there could be supply problems in the years ahead. Some producers, like Malaysia, are either turning to what are considered to be more profitable crops like palm oil or are industrialising fast, with the result that less rubber is being produced. Another problem facing Malaysian rubber producers is a serious shortage of labour,' said Mr Farouk. Malaysia, for many years the world's biggest rubber producer, saw its production last year decline by 3.4 per cent. Thailand is now top of the world rubber production table. Mr Farouk said that there was general agreement at the meeting that the direct trading system had produced considerable distortions in the market. 'The volume of direct trade reduced liquidity in the market. We are all agreed that natural rubber still has bright prospects in the long term. But we must have a more transparent pricing system,' said Mr Farouk. The meeting here set up a committee to examine how Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Jakarta, which have physical markets, could link up with Singapore to develop a proper rubber international futures market. 'It is important that the futures market is linked to the producing countries so the cost of production can be adequately reflected in the market price,' said Mr Farouk. The committee will also examine ways of pricing natural rubber as an industrial product, rather than a commodity, on the international market. Mr Farouk said that a final decision on setting up the new market system would probably be taken later this year. Rubber output in Indonesia, the world's second largest producer, is expected to fall by between 10 and 12 per cent in the first half of 1992 because of to poor weather and low prices, a senior industry official said yesterday, reports Reuter from Singapore. 'The government estimated that production will fall 10 per cent during the first semester (January-June) but our own estimate is about 12 per cent,' said Mr Asril Sutan Amir, vice-chairman of the Rubber Association of Indonesia (Gapkindo). He said first half output was forecast to fall by between 60,000 and 72,000 tonnes from the 600,000 tonnes last year. Indonesia's total 1992 output is expected to fall to about 1.1m tonnes from 1.2m tonnes in 1991, he added.</p>

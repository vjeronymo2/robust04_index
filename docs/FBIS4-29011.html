			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok by Yi Yun-song on </F> 15 June -- recorded; place not given]    [Text] [Yi Yun-song] Sanctions mean war. Therefore, we  cannot be responsible. This is a threatening remark repeatedly  being made by the North Korean side. However, sanctions clearly  attach a precondition that it forces a dialogue. Some people  are buying large amounts of daily necessities, which is even all  the more instigating anxiety. We will hear about the current  situation from Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. Hello, Prime  Minister.    [Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok] Hello.    [Yi Yun-song] Even if war does not break out immediately, do  we have to be prepared for even the slightest possibility?    [Prime Minister Yi] Yes, we have to be prepared. There is a  saying: Be prepared, and you will have no cause for regrets. I  believe that we must be prepared for even the slightest  possibility so that we can live in security. A civil defense  exercise was carried out today. People are wondering if it was  carried out because of the current troubled situation. That is  not so. We are to hold civil defense exercises twice a year in  June and September. I want to clearly say that today's exercise  was no more than a scheduled exercise, it was not carried out  because an unusual situation has taken place.    [Yi Yun-song] The government is worrying about apathy by the  people regarding security and also over the excessive  apprehension and crisis awareness. People are even saying that  they do not know what to think. What is the government's clear  position?    [Prime Minister Yi] I believe that we must differentiate  between being aware of security and being apprehensive about  security. Awareness of security means being prepared for the  slightest possibility of a calamity so that there will be no  regrets later. Being apprehensive about security is an unsound  reaction stemming from ignorance over what the current situation  is and how it will develop. The current situation is a  situation in which we do not have to be worried. However, there  exists our counterpart, North Korea. I emphasized the need to  be aware of security even though we know that they will not dare  provoke us again when viewing our strong preparations, but we  must be prepared for the slightest possibility. Being  apprehensive makes the people act abnormally, such as buying  large amounts of daily necessaries, which may bring about social  confusion. I believe North Korea is aiming at social confusion.  Therefore, we must not react unsoundly without any solid ground  over the current situation.    [Yi Yun-song] From two to three days ago people living in  well-to-do residential areas started buying large amounts of  daily necessities. Fortunately most of the people are observing  the situation and are restraining from impulse purchases. What  is your view on this matter?    [Prime Minister Yi] Since we are under a situation in which  we are fully prepared, I would like to clearly say that war will  not break out immediately and would like to ask the people not  to be worried. I would like to ask the people to assume the  attitude of always being prepared for the slightest possibility.    [Yi Yun-song] Thank you.    [Prime Minister Yi] Thank you.</p>

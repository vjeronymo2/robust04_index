			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Arts: Jon Kimura Parker - London music This Canadian pianist (half Japanese by birth) won the Leeds Competition in 1984, against the likes of his compatriot Louis Lortie, but we still await significant developments. His last solo programme here, a couple of years ago in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, included pianistic war-horses that signally failed to gallop. In the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday he played less showy Schumann and Chopin better, efficiently and with evident sincerity - but without surprises, special insights or anything much like individual character beyond a few tics. Though the natural Kimura Parker personality seems to be ebullient, if not exactly effervescent, it was kept on a close rein. 'A well-known personality in Canada, he has hosted radio and television programmes for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,' the programme-book told us: could that be the trouble? Having to sell oneself purely as a performer-interpreter might concentrate the mind much better. Neither Schumann's Faschingsschwank aus Wien nor even his earlier Papillons is buttoned-up music, but in Kimura Parker's respectful hands they sounded tame, short-breathed and short of variety. One brief, happy flash was the D-flat waltz episode in the eighth of the Papillons, which he invested with a delectable lilt; but in most of the other quasi-waltzes in Papillons and especially in the Faschingsschwank, his habit of underweighting the third beat in the bar starved them of their proper heft and Schwung. A worse habit might be a result of early admonitions to Bring Out the Tune. Again and again in his Schumann and in Chopin's complete op. 28 Preludes, tunes were Brought Out with a percussive note-by-note 'ping', as if to make sure that even the dimmest audience shouldn't miss them: prettily crystalline, here and there, but inimical to singing curves or suggestive shadings. The effect was deadly in the rapturous Intermezzo of the Faschingsschwank - plonking and prosaic, without elan, not at all what was meant by Schumann's 'Mit grosster Energie'. There was a complementary downplaying of 'accompaniments', even those designed not only to gleam but to interact expressively with the lyrical burden. In Chopin's F-sharp minor prelude the seething figuration shrank to a soft, oleaginous mutter, and we scarcely heard the buoyant underpinning of the E-flat one. The preludes which are largely figuration without 'tunes' - the D major, the E-flat minor - rattled along featurelessly. In like fashion, the main rondo-themes of the Faschingsschwank's outer movements were robbed of their impetus because the busy finger-work which should power them was reduced to a discreet background: as if Romantic composers always traded in routine 19th-century feeling, with arbitrary titivation that can be flattened without musical loss. The bald fact is that many other pianists, no less scrupulously devoted, are far more interesting to hear in such music. Why should Kimura Parker want to compete in this area? With his first encore, a Rakhmaninov prelude, we suddenly heard a pianist wholeheartedly attuned to what he was playing: a lovely sound-idyll with a fluent, penetrating line, full of unconstrained feeling. If an extrovert West Coast person like him feels overawed by the classical Austro-German repertoire, he should embrace what comes more naturally. Hyper-educated Austro-Germans are already a glut on the market.</p>

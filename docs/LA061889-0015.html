			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE IGNOBLE SAVAGE  </P> <P> How am I, a single soul, supposed to respond to Kirkpatrick Sale's call for  action against the slow slide into ecological holocaust? Every time I turn the  key in my 1980 diesel car to drive to the store, I contribute more poison to  the nightmare. The electricity I burn every hour of every day drains a power  source which must be replaced through burning coal, oil or nuclear energy. My  refrigerator hums in the kitchen, I write by this light over my head, the clock  ticks on the mantle, the air conditioner whirs in the attic. If I cut my lawn,  prune my trees or turn on the garden fountain, more energy is expended.  </P> <P> So I then, the one served by all these machines, must in a very real sense be a  "root cause." Shall I walk to the store, turn off the electricity, scratch out  this message with a pen? I could do so, for I recall a time spent living on a  farm where 95% of our livelihood came from the land. But the subsistence farm  has been dead for 50 years at least, gobbled up by corporate farms and  converted to single crops.  </P> <P> How do I begin? How do we begin to reverse the nightmare slide? We each must be  more discriminating in meeting our needs, saying "no" to the quick buck, the  short cuts, the baubles. If the broom will sweep a walk, why buy a blower? Save  the energy. If a small car will give 27 miles per gallon, why buy a gas  guzzler? If our job's final result is to further the wastefulness of our  culture, why stay? In short, we must begin individually to reshape the very  elemental factors of modern industrial life while we still have time.  Otherwise, we are the eco-crisis!  </P> <P> JACK LYNCH  </P> <P> EL CAJON  </P></p>

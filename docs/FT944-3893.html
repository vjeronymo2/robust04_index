			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Travel: A coracle of my very own / Boat-building in Wales I had always wanted to build my own boat. To witness with growing pride the transformation of planks of wood into a vessel as, painstakingly, I would saw and plane and fit and shape. Finally, as high as the house and gleaming with fresh varnish and the glint of dozens of nautical accessories, it would be ready. A mobile crane would be hired and, with the local paper and regional television in attendance, my beautiful boat would be lifted over the rooftops for all the neighbours to see and settled carefully on a low-loader for its journey to the ocean. To be realistic, though, I am far too impatient for such a long-term project and, in any case, my back garden makes a pocket handkerchief look like a table-cloth. But the desire still remained and so, when I came across a three-day course in coracle building, with a seaworthy craft at the end of it, I had obviously found the answer to my dreams. It was a beautiful morning when I arrived at the woodland venue for the course, near Builth Wells, in central Wales. I followed a path of sawdust and shavings towards a wood fire. Gathered around it were nine other participants and Tim Wade, the course instructor and head boat builder. Tim is a bodger, a term once applied to skilled woodsmen. He is also a fine craftsman who designs and makes furniture. This year he won the commission for the National Eisteddfod's ceremonial chair. In comparison with that, a coracle is a simple affair, a basic craft originally fashioned from cleft ash and animal hides painted with pitch. I began to build my coracle with nothing more rustic than a piece of softwood plank from the local DIY store. To this was added three legs and then woven ash laths which, to form the essential half-walnut-shell shape of the coracle, had to be bent. Apart from the actual launch, this was the most exciting and the most tense part of the process. The laths were wrapped in sack and soaked first with cold and then hot water, which meant much fetching and carrying and stoking of the fire to keep plenty of water boiling for so many coracles. The bending was a strange experience. To grasp a sack-covered strip of hot wet wood, to apply pressure and feel it bend like lead or copper, was like performing a magic trick. It was as if the wrapping of the wood in wet sacking was a rite which endowed my hands with a certain power. The tension came when the wood refused to comply - or perhaps my faith in my ability to bend it ebbed. The lath would begin to snap with an ominous cracking. With luck the deft use of a clamp would get me out of trouble. Otherwise, some careful splicing was required. At the beginning of the day, we had carried our benches out of the barn to work in the sunshine. Sheep bleated, a buzzard mewed on the air currents and a pair of ravens croaked in the distance. Only occasionally was the peace shattered by the ground-shaking roar of treetop-skimming jet fighters. Lunch came, made and delivered by Mrs Lee from the nearby village as part of Wade's policy of spreading the benefit of his enterprise into the local community. The afternoon swept past and by early evening the main bones were in place. We had all made coracle skeletons. Stretching calico over these bones gave the coracle a bulk and substance greater than it warranted and led me to believe that this frail craft might float. Once fastened, and with additional material tucked away and sewn out of sight, on went the bitumen, a modern equivalent of pitch. Three coats were necessary to ensure that it was watertight. The boat was almost complete. Next came the paddle. To make a round shaft from a square stick required the use of an instrument like a giant pencil sharpener. As with all of Tim's tools it was perfectly honed so that it worked without protest. To fashion the T-shaped paddle handle, Tim Wade used his pole lathe, a contraption put together from a stout sapling and a piece of cord which requires only a strong thigh to operate it. By pushing up and down on the pedal, the selected piece of greenwood turned back and forth under the chisel until, out of a shower of woodchips, came a perfectly rounded handle. Turned greenwood is just one of the many uses of coppice. In a quiet moment, Tim showed me just how many products could be obtained from regularly cropped woodland: everything from besoms, apparently a popular item at city craft fairs, to charcoal - imported in to Britain in great quantities every year - which could be supplied from native coppice. The craft of coppicing is reviving, which must be good news for wildlife as its decline has led to the serious depletion of some species, such as the dormouse. It was shortly after lunch on the third day that we loaded our completed coracles on to roofracks and trailers and into estate cars and hatchbacks and drove in convoy through the narrow Welsh lanes to the River Wye. One by one, we anxiously cast these cockle-shells on to the water where they bobbed on the surface, barely breaking the meniscus. Stepping in, I pushed off and, by sculling gently over the bows, made my way across the river. I was afloat in a boat I had built myself. When I arrived home, I simply picked up the coracle and carried it through the house. It takes up no space in the back garden for I have hung it on the wall. Coracle Making courses are run by Tim Wade over a period of three days at a cost of Pounds 125. This includes tuition, all materials, use of tools, lunch each day and a barbecue on the first night.

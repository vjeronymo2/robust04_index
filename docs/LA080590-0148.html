			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS HURL HARSH WORDS AT AN EX-ALLY;  </P> <P> REACTION: ONCE THE SOURCE OF MASSIVE FOREIGN AID TO IRAQ, MOSCOW NOW ASSAILS IT  FOR BULLYING KUWAIT.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union called on Iraq on Saturday to back up its words with deeds and  pull its army out of Kuwait as official media heaped scorn on Moscow's former  ally, accusing Iraq of the same phony justifications the Kremlin once used to  legitimize the Afghan invasion.  </P> <P> "The moving in of troops 'at the request of' and 'to prevent foreign  intervention' -- that is quite recent," the daily Rabochaya Tribuna wrote in an  acid commentary. "We know better than anyone else the pretext used by the Iraqi  leadership to justify the attack on its neighbor."  </P> <P> In an extraordinary example of the new superpower collaboration, the Soviet  Union joined with the United States on Friday to call for an international  weapons embargo against Iraq, a longtime arms customer of the Kremlin and the  co-signatory of a 1972 treaty of friendship and cooperation.  </P> <P> As confusion reigned about Iraq's plans, the Soviet Union made it clear that it  would be satisfied with nothing less than a withdrawal from Kuwait. A Foreign  Ministry spokesman, speaking through the official Tass news agency, welcomed  the Baghdad government's expressed intent to begin the pullout today but said  words are not enough.  </P> <P> "If this encouraging statement is supported by real measures, this would mean  the start of implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 660 and of  settlement of the acutest crisis in the Persian Gulf, which has caused worry to  the entire world," said the spokesman, who was not identified by name.  </P> <P> The U.N. resolution, passed Thursday, calls for an immediate and unconditional  Iraqi withdrawal. The superpowers joined to demand that Iraq fully obey it.  </P> <P> If there were any doubts after the joint statement issued Friday by Secretary  of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,  the escalating language Saturday used by official Moscow-based media showed  there is no sympathy here for Iraq's point of view.  </P> <P> The government of President Saddam Hussein, once routinely lauded for its  "peace-loving" policies, was accused by Rabochaya Tribuna, a publication of the  Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, of waging a Wehrmacht-style  blitzkrieg against a tiny, helpless foe.  </P> <P> "What kind of adversary is it whose total forces, including police, are fewer  than 20,000, whose territory is 25 times smaller than Iraq's and whose  population is less than half of Baghdad's?" the newspaper's Vladimir Mikhailov  wrote in indignation.  </P> <P> So closely bound to Moscow that it owed the Soviet Union $6.3 billion for  foreign assistance at the end of last year, Iraq is now being pilloried in  Soviet media as an "absolute dictatorship" guilty of massive human rights  violations.  </P> <P> "President Saddam's coming to power was accompanied by an unprecedented  campaign to physically annihilate any dissidence, let alone any potential  shoots of opposition," the Sovietskaya Rossiya daily said. "Thousands of Iraqi  Communists vanished into the dungeons of the security forces. The northern  region of Iraq, Kurdistan, was drowned in a sea of blood when government troops  enforced Baghdad's policy of assimilation of the Kurds."  </P> <P> The language in such commentaries was so harsh that it made it hard to envisage  renewed cooperation with the Hussein regime on anything approaching the  pre-invasion scale, although Shevardnadze noted Friday that the Soviet Union is  keeping its official channels to Baghdad open and sees no merit in breaking  diplomatic ties.  </P> <P> Under Shevardnadze and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union has  publicly broken with many of the foreign policy practices of its past,  withdrawn its soldiers from Afghanistan and apologized for the 1968 Warsaw Pact  intervention that snuffed out Czechoslovakia's "Prague spring" turn to  democracy.  </P> <P> Such revisionism is now being applied to Iraq in the press accounts of last  week's Kuwait invasion, which tacitly criticize past Soviet indulgence for the  Hussein government.  </P> <P> "This unprecedented aggression should be regarded as yet another manifestation  of Baghdad's hegemonist policy in the region, the logic of power pressure and  rejection of world public opinion," Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist youth  organization newspaper, said.  </P> <P> A. Shumilin, writing for Komsomolskaya Pravda, one of the Soviet Union's most  popular dailies, also bared what would be a secret for many of his readers:  Tanks and airplanes used by the invading Iraqi army were Soviet-made and  Soviet-supplied.  </P> <P> "It is to be regretted that the Soviet weaponry which comprises the backbone of  Iraq's armed forces is being used for fanning regional conflicts for the sake  of satisfying ambitious designs of myopic politicians," Shumilin wrote.  </P></p>

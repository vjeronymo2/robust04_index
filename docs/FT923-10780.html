			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Miners' bid for colliery fails REDUNDANT miners have failed in their bid to take over Thurcroft colliery, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, from British Coal. British Coal, which officially closed the loss-making pit in December, agreed to let the miners keep it open with a view to restarting production. But yesterday the corporation said it would seal the pit off after the miners failed to make payments for keeping open and maintaining the pit.</p>

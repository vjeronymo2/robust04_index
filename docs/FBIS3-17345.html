This report caused serious concern in  Azerbaijan and in all the neighboring countries located in an  unstable seismic zone.    The Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences and the Ecology and  Environmental Protection Committee held a joint meeting today to  discuss this issue in depth. It was announced that such nuclear  stations, which are not up to international radiation safety  standards and pose a serious threat to the surrounding region,  cannot reoperate.    In view of this and to draw the international community's  attention to the problem, the Azerbaijani scientists and  specialists have appealed to the United Nations, the  International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Ministries of  Ecology in Russia, Turkey, Iran, and Georgia to seek their help  in ensuring radiation safety for the region.</p>

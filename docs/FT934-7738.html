			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (16): A dip in uncertain waters - France A DELEGATION from the French employers federation was in South Africa last week to restore the country's position in South Africa's economy. The political turmoil and violence of recent years, coupled with strong French government backing for international sanctions against apartheid, had the effect of reducing France's share in foreign direct investment in South Africa from 8.6 per cent in 1980 to around 2 per cent today. Recent negotiation between South Africa and France of treaties on reciprocal protection of investment and avoidance of double taxation should encourage more French companies to dip their toes in South African waters. It is to help smaller French companies in the South Africa market that the French Patronat employers federation and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa last year set up a joint organisation, aimed at modernising South African industry and developing higher value-added exports by South Africa. There has long been a traditional French interest in South African gold stocks. Several South African gold stocks are quoted on the Paris Bourse and, for example, a majority of the shares in East Rand Proprietary Mines (ERPM) are held by French individuals, according to one French banker. 'But this traditional interest in gold has not spread to other South African shares,' the banker says. The latter are relatively expensive, with a high price/earnings ratio, he says. This is due to the controls on capital movements which mean that South African investors have difficulty investing abroad. But the French investor's main worry says Mr Christian Graeff, leader of last week's Patronat delegation, is 'the current image of violence and the prospect that there will be no coherence in policy for some time to come'.</p>

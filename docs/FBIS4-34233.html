			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Fidel Castro by unidentified CNN </F> reporter in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 15 June --  recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] What do you expect from this summit?    [Castro] Every summit has had a positive effect, has  fostered  a closeness and friendship among the peoples of Latin America.  Diverse initiatives have sprung from the summits. This summit is  already an institution and constitutes a Latin American force.  This is something new which did not exist before. Previously,  the Latin American peoples meet only when summoned by the United  States. This is the fourth time we have met by our own  initiative.    [Reporter] Do you expect this summit to be akin to a  platform  to allow Cuba to rejoin the OAS?    [Castro] I do not hope for that much. This is a complex  problem. Diverse opinions have been expressed. We have to wait  to see the final result in favor of Cuba's reincorporation in  the OAS. That does not necessarily guarantee, however, that the  good wishes of many Latin American peoples can be effected.    [Reporter] What is your answer to the call by all the Latin  American leaders advocating a political and democratic opening  in Cuba?    [Castro] No, not all. Some very respectfully expressed their  views. I appreciate their concern for Cuba but I in turn  replied, you heard it, that I could not believe that not a  single word had been said against such an unfair and inhuman  blockade which is trying to make our people surrender out of  hunger and turn our country into a blood bath, and which  attempts to dismiss the heroic resistance which Cuba and the  Cuban people have put up in defense of dignity and sovereignty  of the peoples of Latin America for more than 35 years. Our  views are ignored.    Our country has been institutionalized and we have our views  on how the country ought to be organized, how to keep the  country united. We have our Constitution and follow it. I  believe our practices and the participation of our people are  truly much more democratic than that of others systems. There is  more than one model of democracy. I also explained how  distraught we were by the fact that it has not been acknowledged  that Cuba has attained the greatest social progress in the  history of this hemisphere; and that this hemisphere has the  worst distribution of wealth and land, that millions of people  die every year, people who could be saved. We have done so in  Cuba. Only in Cuba, the Revolution's social efforts have not  only educated the entire population but also saved the lives of  hundreds of thousands of people. [Words indistinct] the others  have not done this.    [Reporter] As you explained, Cuba has experienced great  social development. Currently, great economic development is  taking place.    [Castro] No, great economic development is not taking place  right now. We are under a double blockade. We have endured the  U.S. blockade for over 30 years and we have had to abide the  outcome of the collapse of the socialist bloc, with which we had  the bulk of our trade, and the disappearance of the Soviet Union.    [Reporter] Is Cuba attracting foreign investment?    [Castro] It is, not in the proportion we would like, but  increasingly so.    [Reporter] Could we expect to see an opening in Cuba like in  the PRC where a market economy coexists with a socialist  government?    [Castro] We have studied the Chinese and Vietnamese  experiences and everything useful and applicable to Cuba that we  can take from that experience will be undoubtedly implemented.  We cannot mechanically copy everything they have done because  their situation is different. For example, in the PRC, 80  percent of the population lives in rural areas where in Cuba, 80  percent of the population lives in urban areas. We cannot do in  rural areas some of the things they do. We have to do things  differently. We are in close contact with the PRC and Vietnam  and have studied them seriously in addition to our own  contributions. We have also conducted a significant economic  opening and are aware that we have to solve problems under very  difficult conditions. It was easier to resist the blockade when  the USSR existed and we had guaranteed trade and markets, fair  prices for our products, and had credit and technology which  today we do not have. Nowadays, we have to accomplish this on  our own and under enormous U.S. pressures.    [Reporter] You have made a unique statement by wearing a  guayabera for the first time in over 35 years. Does this imply a  change?    [Castro] Well, rather than a change it is matter of  (?deference) and respect, first of all, to the local climate and  second, to the request of the organizers. They sent word to  please come in guayaberas or shirts. I did not have any  guayaberas or shirts, our suits. I had to rush. Someone lent me  a guayabera for measurements, then one was made for me at full  speed. I had no idea how it was going to fit. On Monday, the  very day I left, guayaberas were being made for me. Thus, I  complied with all the requirements of the climate and the host  and I am very comfortable.    [Reporter] Will there be Fidel Castro in Cuba for a long  time?    [Castro] Who can tell if there will be Fidel Castro in Cuba  for a long time? It all depends on my health and, above all, my  capacity to contribute to solve the national problems.    There is no need for Fidel Castro in Cuba for a long time.  We  have many outstanding comrades able to do the job. We have been  developing younger and well prepared cadres. I am not  indispensable. I do not believe myself indispensable, nor does  it worry me how much longer I may have, how long I am going to  last, or for how long will they demand that I fulfill certain  duties which, by the way, are not easy.    [Reporter] Do you not think it is time for the Cuban people  to have other political options?    [Castro] The Cuban people participated in elections not long  ago.    [Reporter] But it is a one party system.    [Castro] Yes, but the party does not nominate the  candidates.  The candidates are nominated directly by the people. In other  words, we do not have one but a thousand, every citizen has the  option to make a nomination. The neighbors in the district meet  and nominate candidates.    [Reporter] But these are candidates from the Communist Party  of Cuba [PCC]?    [Castro] Well, it is an honor. There are many who are not  members of the PCC, however. Yet, in Cuba, the candidates are  nominated by the people, not the PCC. The PCC does not  participate in the nomination of candidates, the mass  organizations do. The percentage of the population that votes is  much higher than in the United States, a higher percentage than  in any Latin American country. That is a fact.    [Reporter] Regarding the embargo: Canada has said that it  supports the lifting of the embargo against Cuba. Do you believe  this is a good beginning to which the U.S. will be receptive?    [Castro] Canada has always followed independent and  outstanding policies regarding ties with Cuba, a policy of  respect for our national sovereignty. This policy, like  Mexico's, has been upheld for over 30 years through various  administrations, conservative, liberal, and progressive.</p>

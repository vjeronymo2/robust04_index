			<p>BFN     [Text] Brandenburg (DPA) -- Approximately 10 adolescents  were temporarily detained at a rally with Chancellor Helmut Kohl  (Christian Democratic Union) in the Havel city of Brandenburg on  Saturday evening [4 June]. Some of them had broken through a  barrier and loudly protested against the chancellor's speech.    At the rally with 5,000 participants, Kohl had called for  participation in building a joint European home. Only the  "United States of Europe" guarantees peace and freedom, Kohl  stated in his speech one week before the European elections.  His comments were accompanied by violent booing and a chorus of  whistles. On banners, citizens opposed the expulsion of eastern  Germans from their plots.    The chancellor said that the reduction of unemployment is  the  greatest challenge of the country's community of solidarity.  Unemployment will not disappear overnight, but it can be warded  off. At the same time, Kohl admitted mistakes in shaping German  unity and substantiated them by a lack of experience.</p>

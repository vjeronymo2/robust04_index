			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Aboriginal land claim row jolts investors INVESTORS in the Australian mining, pastoral and timber industries were yesterday thrown into confusion by a deadlock in talks between federal and state governments on how to deal with aboriginal land claims. And while the officials grappled with a definition of 'native land title' the Australian High Court has been flooded with aboriginal claims covering vast tracts of land, including the whole of the Canberra region. Large areas in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland are also being claimed. The meeting between Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, and state premiers was to have drawn up a national procedure to deal with aboriginal land claims triggered by the so-called Mabo decision handed down by the High Court a year ago. The court recognised that native titles existed before European occupation of Australia. The decision abolished the accepted doctrine that Australia was no one's land when the Europeans arrived. As a result of the decision, aboriginal groups able to demonstrate a continuing link with an area of land are now able to claim native titles. Mr Keating's Labor government has accepted the principle of native titles, and has tried to get agreement from state governments to establish tribunals to hear and resolve claims to them. And in a move to protect mining and business leases that might be covered by aboriginal claims, Mr Keating has proposed to introduce legislation validating leases granted between 1975 and the time of the Mabo decision in 1992. He has also proposed compensation be paid to Aborigines suffering losses from such leases. While the state governments agreed to legislate and validate leases, two of the most resource-rich states, Victoria and Western Australia, have rejected the Mabo decision, arguing that state parliaments could legislate to extinguish native titles. Mr Keating has now threatened to introduce federal legislation to force state governments to come into line.</p>

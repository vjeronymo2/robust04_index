			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bonus boost for Boots' chief SIR JAMES Blyth, chief executive of Boots, the retailing and pharmaceutical group, saw his pay increase by two-thirds last year with the benefit of a hefty bonus. He will, however, only receive the full extra payment if the company out-performs its competitors over the next four years. Sir James's basic pay increased 14 per cent to Pounds 385,000 but he received a further Pounds 186,000 bonus taking his total pay to Pounds 571,000. Sir James's salary in the previous year included a Pounds 6,000 bonus. Boots' other executive directors also received generous bonuses in 1991-92 sharing Pounds 900,000 between them compared with Pounds 54,000 the year before. The company's annual report and accounts, released yesterday, revealed details of a complicated long-term bonus scheme for executive directors which came into effect from April 1 1991 with the intention of 'locking in' valuable executives. Bonus payments under this scheme depend on the company's dividend and share price performance over the next four years when set against 10 competitors in the retailing and pharmaceutical fields. Part of the bonus payments last year were taken in the form of provisions anticipating the future performance of the group over the four-year period. Should the company not match these expectations, the directors will not receive their full bonus payments. The executive directors also benefit from a one-year bonus scheme, based on performance against budget targets. This has now been scaled down to match that operating for all senior managers. In the year to March 31, Boots' pre-tax profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds 374.2m. Earnings per share climbed 9 per cent to 26.4p. Boots' staff received a 9 per cent pay increase last year.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Russia to choose new army chiefs THE RUSSIAN president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, is expected shortly to appoint the top brass for the new Russian armed forces which are being built from the remains of the Red Army, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, said yesterday that the names of new deputy ministers, new commanders for the army, navy, air force and other services would be announced within days. He also said that there would be a reshuffle of some military district commanders. The new deputy ministers are to be 'new people' - leaving no room for deputies from the formerly Soviet and now so-called Commonwealth defence ministry. Gen Grachev said they would be selected on a 'democratic' basis - from multiple candidates who were presently in Moscow for the final selection procedures. But it is also clear that President Yeltsin will be looking for people whose loyalty he can rely on most at a time of political instability, and low morale within the armed forces.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Poetry cut down to size - The protagonists of 'Imagism', Ezra Pound and Hilda Doolittle WHEN DID the modern movement in literature actually begin? Virginia Wolfe had a ready answer to that question: 'On or about December 1910,' she wrote, 'human character changed.' Not human character itself, of course, but the way it was represented in the language of literature. And the agent that changed? A tireless American literary entrepeneur-cum-poet by the name of Ezra Pound, and the movement in poetry that he created in 1912 called imagism, which was celebrated in a series of events at the South Bank last weekend as a part of its continuing festival, Towards the Next Millennium. The young Ezra Pound had arrived in London in 1908 for the express purpose of sitting at the feet of WB Yeats, the only poet of value in the English-speaking world, in his opinion. Edwardian London was no place for a young, energetic poet-to-be - the feeble energies of the 1890s were spent; poetry seemed all lush and loose, the piping of mindless Swinburnian muzak. Pound set about to change all that. By 1912, he had formulated a set of principles for the writing of a new, more vigorous kind of poetry that would be equal to the demands of a new era. These principles would have an enormous influence upon the way poetry would be written and discussed throughout the 20th century. In Pound's opinion, there were three cardinal virtues: precision - poets must be precise and concise in their use of language; vers libre - free verse should be used as a way of freeing the poet from the trammels of dead metrical structures; but, above all else, the poet should employ hard, clear, concrete images. Abstract formulations had had their day. The movement was brought to birth in the British Museum tea rooms in June 1912. Pound had been joined in London by fellow Pennsylvanian poet Hilda Doolittle, a childhood friend. He asked to see some of her poems and, leaning over her shoulder, he corrected them in accordance with his new principles. Then he signed them for her: 'HD Imagiste'. A movement was born; and so was its most representative poet. HD remained faithful to the principles of imagism for most of the rest of that decade. Her poems were just what Pound seemed to have ordered as a tonic for the scribbling tribe: hard, clear, and short. In spite of the fact that they were usually set in Grecian landscapes and concerned themselves almost exclusively with figures out of Greek myth, there were no needless ornamentations, no quaint devices and no archaism. And HD, the Hellenist, espoused and sponsored by Ezra, became a fashionable commodity in Edwardian London, where Greekness seemed to be everywhere: it was modish to go about in sandal-shod feet; to purchase sculpture with Greek curls; and to be seen reading Andrew Lang's translations of Homer. The French spelling of 'imagism' as 'imagisme' is instructive. Some of the theoretical justifications for the new movement derived from the philosophy of Bergson and the practice of the French symbolist poets, and Pound himself was probably pleased to have coined a name that had just a touch of Parisian eclat - it would help to Europeanise him. Had not HD herself called him 'immensely sophisticated, immensely superior,' but also 'immensely rough and ready?' The Imagist movement waxed and waned for a decade, firstly under Pound's brief tutelage, and later under that of Amy Lowell, an American poet of uneven talent whom Pound heartily despised - perhaps because she was his equal in energy and influence. Pound called her movement 'Amygism' and condemned her for prolixity. And yet for all her faults as a poet she had the good editorial sense to publish the verse of DH Lawrence, James Joyce and William Carlos Williams in the Imagist anthologies that appeared later in that decade. The imagist movement itself had petered out by the end of the decade - but the influence of its principles upon poetry and literary modernism endured. It became the norm in both England and America for poets to write short, concisely expressed lyric poems with hard, clear images at their emotional epicentres; but, equally importantly, imagism fed into the way in which novelists approached the task of writing their fiction. Ulysses seems like a concatenation of hard, bright images when viewed in the light of those principles; some of the greatest passages from Women in Love derive their impact from the way in which DH Lawrence seems to make the images of natural things speak for themselves. And it is also to be blamed and praised in about equal measure for much of the notorious obscurity. of 20th century poetry, from TS Eliot's Waste Land to Pound's Cantos - those super-imagistic exercises in which all pretence at discursive, linking commentary has been abandoned almost entirely, to the shock and bewilderment of a thousand uninitiated A-level candidates. The poetry and prose of Ezra Pound are published by Faber and Faber. The poetry of HD is available from Carcanet Press.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> RIDGELINE PROTECTION QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> County officials have verified that a citizens' group has gathered enough  signatures to place a ridgeline protection ordinance before Laguna Niguel  voters.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the Laguna Niguel Ridgeline Protection and Preservation  Committee delivered almost 5,000 signatures to City Hall in support of an  initiative designed to protect undeveloped hilltops throughout the city. County  officials found that 922 signatures were invalid, but enough valid signatures  were verified to call a special election.  </P> <P> Committee members have said they will pursue a special election unless the City  Council approves their ridgeline preservation proposal. A separate proposal to  protect ridgelines and govern hillside development has been prepared for the  city by Lawrence Associates of San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> In addition to differing setback requirements, the consultant's hillside  development ordinance would give city officials discretion in dealing with  individual projects. City officials say the committee's ordinance is too  strict, rendering some property "undevelopable" and placing Laguna Niguel at  legal risk.  </P> <P> Planning commissioners took their first look at the two plans at their Aug. 14  meeting. City officials have indicated that they will continue considering both  ordinances, possibly incorporating the best elements of each plans. The  Planning Commission is expected to again consider the ordinances Sept. 11.  </P> <P> Should the council reject the initiative at its next meeting on Tuesday and  approve a separate ordinance, a special election would be called in about 90  days. If the ridgeline protection ordinance were approved by voters and the two  ordinances were to conflict in the future, the voter-approved ordinance would  take precedence, City Atty. Terry Dixon said.  </P> <P> With organizational help from the county, a special election in Laguna Niguel  would cost taxpayers about $25,000, said assistant registrar of voters Rosalyn  Lever. Without county assistance, the cost could rise to $60,000, City Clerk  Juanita Zarilla said Wednesday.  </P> <P> While many city ridgelines are already sprouting construction, committee  members say their ordinance could preserve other hilltops "currently at risk"  of being developed. The proposal targets skylines visible from "scenic  highways" such as Coast Highway and Crown Valley Parkway. The initiative  pinpoints hilltops between Pacific Coast Highway and Pacific Island Drive --  such as property next to the Monarch Point housing development -- and  ridgelines between the southwestern area of Laguna Niguel and San Juan  Capistrano.  </P> <P> An attorney for owners of land that borders South Laguna, commonly known as the  Binion property, said land would be "dramatically affected" by either  ordinance. A tentative tract map for 32 homes on that parcel was recently  submitted to the city. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

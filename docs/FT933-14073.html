			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / EC bank 'will go to Frankfurt' EUROPEAN Community heads of government have agreed to locate the proposed European central bank in Frankfurt, according to the German business newspaper, Handelsblatt. A formal decision will be taken at an EC summit in Brussels in the autumn, the newspaper says in a report today, quoting government sources in Bonn. The central bank, the European Monetary Institute, will begin operating in Frankfurt from the beginning of next year, it says. The newspaper claims Mr John Major, UK prime minister, has asked other government heads to delay an announcement until after Britain has ratified the Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union. In Bonn, the general view is that Britain has for the past 12 months been the only EC member state fiercely resisting Frankfurt as the best site for the European central bank. The German government has argued that it needs Frankfurt to be the site to overcome public doubts in Germany about the wisdom of creating a single European currency, eclipsing the D-Mark, and a single central bank replacing the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank. But, in Brussels, EC officials last night expressed doubt about the reported understanding between EC heads of government. They pointed out that member states were finding it difficult to agree on a successor to Mr Jacques Attali as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The site of the EMI was even more controversial, they said. Choosing Frankfurt would boost its standing considerably as a financial centre to rival Paris and London. EC leaders have agreed informally to try to strike a deal on the bank's site and its president before the end of the year. In London, Whitehall officials dismissed suggestions that EC leaders had already agreed on a location and disputed that a majority favoured Frankfurt. Mr Major is determined to resist the bank going to Frankfurt, largely because of the impact on London as a financial centre. He believes other EC leaders are also worried about furthering Germany's economic dominance.</p>

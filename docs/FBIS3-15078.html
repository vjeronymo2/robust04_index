The problematic situation on the occupied Palestinian  territories, the result of the barbaric crime of an Israeli  extremist in Hebron, encourages Russia to make further active  moves in order to overcome the present crisis phase in the peace  process in the Middle East -- which appear under threat, the  statement says.    The document also points out that Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev maintains permanent contact with the Palestinian  and Israeli leadership to look for optimal forms of Russian  assistance for the sake of returning to a peaceful settlement.  Russia's first deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was sent to  the Middle East on the private instruction of the Russian  president to meet with the PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and  Israeli leadership.    Moscow believes that the idea of sending international  supervisors to the West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip  "deserves serious attention." "This would facilitate bringing  about Palestinian self-management there," says the statement.    The new "obstacle" in the Middle Eastern talks demonstrates  that there is a need for "a new international impulse" to  reconcile the Arabs and Israelis. Another plenary meeting of  the Madrid conference on the Middle East, on the level of  Foreign Ministers, could become such an impetus, believes Moscow.    Speaking about the nearest prospects, the statement says  that  Russia advocates continuation of bilateral negotiations to be  conducted in places convenient for their participants.</p>

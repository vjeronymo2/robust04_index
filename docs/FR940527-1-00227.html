			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In our previous discussions of an efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment, we suggested that the adjustment should take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account two considerations. One is that capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inputs, unlike operating inputs, are generally fixed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short run. The productivity target in the revised operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> framework operates on a short-term, year-to-year basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Targets for capital efficiency and cost-effectiveness,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, must operate on a longer term basis. The other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration is that, prior to the adoption of the capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment system, Medicare payment policy for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital-related costs, as well as the policies of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payers, did not provide sufficient incentives for efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and cost-effective capital spending. As a result, capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs per case, and therefore base year prospective capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates, may be higher than would have been consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital acquisition policy in more efficiency-oriented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markets. A guiding principle in devising an efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment is therefore that Medicare capital prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment rates should not provide for maintenance of capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in excess of the level that would be produced in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency-oriented competitive market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a preliminary examination of this issue, we analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the change in actual Medicare capital cost per case for FYs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986&hyph;1991 in relation to the change in the capital input  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price index (which accounts for change in the input prices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for capital-related costs), and the other adjustment factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that we were then proposing to include in the framework.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (The other adjustment factors are the increase in real case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mix and the increase in intensity due to quality-enhancing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological change and within-DRG complexity.) We found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates of increase in spending per case that exceeded the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate of increase attributable to inflation in capital input  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices, quality-enhancing intensity increases, and real  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case-mix growth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economic theory suggests that an industry with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranteed return on capital (such as the hospital industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to prospective payment for capital-related costs)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have a tendency to be overly capitalized relative to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more competitive industries. This is because the incentive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for firms in such an industry is to compete on the basis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more capital-intensive production processes than firms in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other industries. As a result, capital costs per case, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore base year prospective capital rates, may be higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than would have been consistent with capital acquisition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy in more efficiency-oriented competitive markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our analysis was designed to examine whether hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had in fact responded to the incentives of the cost-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement system for capital by expanding beyond what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was necessary for efficient and cost-effective delivery of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. The analysis confirmed that volume and intensity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of capital acquisition far outpaced the increase in capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> input prices during the years between the implementation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prospective payment system for operating costs and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction of the capital prospective payment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even accounting for real CMI increases and increases in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensity attributable to cost-increasing but quality-enhancing new technologies, there remains a large excess of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital-related spending.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following table shows the results of our most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recent analysis, based on the most current data available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the most recent projections. Differences between this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> table and the tables in previous discussions in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are due to revised figures for average capital cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per case increases, based on the most recent data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projections, and on our revised CIPI. We have also expanded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the analysis incorporated in this table to include FY 1985  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and FY 1992, thus encompassing all but 1 year of the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the implementation of the prospective payment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for operating costs to the implementation of the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment system for capitals costs. (For FY 1984, sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data is not available to compute capital cost per case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases and intensity increases.) The results of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis in Table 4 are substantially similar to the results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of previous analyses. In Table 4 real case-mix increase is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed to be 1.0 percent annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

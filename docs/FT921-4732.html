			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: The alternatives to nanny - The pluses, minuses and costs of different kinds of baby care THE RECENT incident of the two British babies who were seriously injured by a bogus nanny underlines the fact that you cannot be too careful whom you choose to look after your children. However, the recession in the UK has forced many working parents to economise on childcare. Qualified, experienced nannies are a costly luxury, and many parents are looking at cheaper options, such as day nurseries, childminders, mother's helps and au-pairs. But are they as good? The great thing about au-pairs is that you can ask them to do anything in the house while you enjoy yourself with the children; with trained nannies, it is the opposite. But how much can you trust an au-pair to do? Should you leave your children with one? Agencies report that more and more employers are leaving au-pairs in charge of their children every day while they work. 'They can be great as another pair of hands,' says Jilly Davis, of the Complete Nanny Agency, 'but the reality is that many are unable to cope in an emergency.' Her view, which seems sensible, is that most au-pairs are not ideal as full-time sole carers for small children. The main problem with au-pairs is that frequently their English is not very good. After all, many become au-pairs in order to learn English, although many are often keen merely to see England (London in particular) and to get away from home. Apart from the difficulties and potential misunderstandings which may arise (ours cooked a Waldorf salad last week), it can be hard for them to communicate well with children of talking age. Another drawback is that few have much experience of looking after children. The other evening, the 18-year-old au-pair of a friend gaily gave a two-year-old a boiled sweet and then laughed innocently as he choked on it. But au-pairs are still the cheapest form of domestic help you can find - although remember that you will have to feed them. Our German au-pair has a healthy appetite, but other nationalities are apparently more frugal. The minimum wage is Pounds 25 a week, but the standard wage seems to be around Pounds 35 for a 30-hour week and two evenings babysitting - a bargain considering that many babysitters charge Pounds 3.50 an hour. The typical au-pair will - naturally, perhaps  - not be totally devoted to her work and her main priority is having a good time. This at least means that she is unlikely to mooch around your home like a lost soul, getting in the way, but unless you are quite strict, you may find her wandering in with the milk each morning bringing home a new boyfriend. In theory, an au-pair is a greater responsibility than a nanny because she is supposed to be treated as part of the family, so you may find yourself lying awake and worrying that her 18-stone excitable Latin papa will come over and take you to task if she elopes with her boyfriend. However, many au-pairs are students, so they are often bright and interesting. Having an au-pair can be a good chance to learn a foreign language, too. A mother's help should also be prepared to help in the house and may be an ideal carer for children who are at play school for part of the day, or in families where mothers do not work or work part time. Jilly Davis says: 'Literally, mother's helps are girls who aspire to be nannies but have not got into nanny colleges, or are those who took up working with children when they were older.' As such, they are cheaper than qualified nannies; salaries start at Pounds 80 a week (live-in), rising to Pounds 100 or more with experience. A recently qualified nanny will cost between Pounds 130 and Pounds 200 a week, live out, and between Pounds 90 and Pounds 150 living in. Wages may be higher in parts of central London. Many mother's helps are devoted to children but others are doing the job simply because they do not know what else to do. And, as Davies says: 'They are often very happy for a year working a a reduced salary until they find friends who are nannies who are earning more.' If you dislike the idea, or do not have the room for live-in help, and you are organised enough to get yourself and all the clutter your child needs for the day - plus the child  - a child-minder or nursery might be a better option. Childminders are usually mothers themselves, and, unlike nannies or mother's helps, they tend to stay in one place because they are rooted to their jobs and homes by their families. They are more likely to be flexible if you are late home than staff at a day nursery, and while few childminders are formally trained, they should be registered with the local social services. Average hourly rates are Pounds 1.30 for up to 50 hours a week, although pay varies from borough to borough. You must be absolutely certain, however, that the childminder's house is suitable for small children. One mother found out that the toys which were out when she first came to interview the childminder had been borrowed just for the occasion. A social services supervisor told me she often had to remind childminders about locks which an inquisitive child could open or about other potential dangers in the home. 'Child-minders are great for babies and toddlers,' says Caroline Thomas, a civil servant, whose daughter Chloe went to one until she was two. However, Thomas felt it was difficult for a childminder looking after several children to provide the attention and intellectual stimulation for older children, and that she would invariably comfort her own child first. The greatest advantage of nurseries is that staff should be highly trained and the facilities are often excellent. 'The best thing was that the staff only had to look after the children - they didn't have to cook, shop, clean or do anything else like most mothers or nannies, ' says a former nursery mother convinced her child gained from being with other children. But you would be stuck every time your child is ill, which may be a least once a month. Most nurseries cannot cater for sick children, so you are called out to collect your ailing child, leaving an important meeting, only to discover when you reach home that little Horace has staged a remarkable recovery. Day nurseries are also wonderful germ exchanges, where babies catch everything and then give it to their parents in more severe form. But the greatest drawback with a day nursery - unless it is near your home - is travelling with a small child. My idea of a living nightmare would be taking a tired toddler in the rush hour every day on the Underground across London, and probably the rest of the carriage's, too. When employers subsidise the cost of a nursery place, these drawbacks are probably unimportant. But unsubsidised places are not cheap: in Nottingham, for example, one will cost Pounds 60 upwards for a week, in London Pounds 120 to Pounds 130. Places are scarce; those in free local authority nurseries tend to go to children with special needs. An alternative to a childminder or a nursery may be a nanny-share with another family. Juliet Rix, a freelance broadcaster, is enthusiastic about this arrangement. The key thing, she says, is to be in at the beginning to set your terms to the other family as well as the nanny. Put more bluntly, nanny-shares can often work better for one family than the other. If the other family offers juicier perks, such as a better car, you quickly become the poor and less attractive employer. It is bad enough arranging your holidays to coincide with the nanny's (yes, it is usually that way round) without having to worry about the other family as well. If the nanny is looking after two children from two families together, it is usual to pay a little over the usual hourly rate. Do not consider sharing a nanny if you are not a good negotiator and skilled diplomat. Ultimately, the kind of childcare you look for will depend on what you can afford and what you need. Few solutions are perfect, but most are better than nothing for tired, harassed mothers - providing your children are in safe hands and are happy, of course. The key point, as the precocious 11-year-old daughter of a friend told me is: 'It just depends on the person.'</p>

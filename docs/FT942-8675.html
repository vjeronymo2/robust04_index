			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / National Power drives annual payout up 18% National Power, the UK's biggest electricity generator, yesterday shrugged off a sharp decline in market share to increase its dividend by a higher than expected 18 per cent. Pre-tax profits for the year to March 27 advanced 9 per cent to Pounds 632m, excluding a Pounds 45m exceptional gain. The announcement sets the tone for what is likely to be an impressive results season for electricity companies in England and Wales. PowerGen, the other large generator, is expected to at least match its rival's dividend growth when it unveils results on June 9. The regional distribution companies may be slightly more restrained ahead of a regulatory review of their prices in the summer, but are expected to increase dividends by well into double figures in percentage terms. National Power increased its final dividend to 8.75p (7.3p) to make a total of 12.5p, against 10.6p. It confirmed plans to reduce dividend cover from three times earnings to 2.5 times. Earnings per share before exceptionals were 37.3p, against 32.9p. Analysts upgraded forecasts for this year's dividend with, for example, Kleinwort Benson pencilling in 14.6p instead of 14.4p, and SG Warburg Securities moving to 14.5p from 14.3p. Mr John Baker, chief executive, said the effect of the recent cap on prices in the electricity trading pool would be 'less than material'. National Power's pre-tax profits of Pounds 677m (Pounds 580m) included a Pounds 45m exceptional gain related to pensions. Turnover fell 16 per cent to Pounds 3.64bn (Pounds 4.35bn). The company said it had reduced coal stocks by 7m tonnes to 12m tonnes and cut jobs in the UK from 7,400 to fewer than 6,000. It was about to start work on its fourth and largest combined cycle gas station at Didcot, Oxfordshire. The 1,400MW project is likely to be followed by a fifth at Staythorpe, Nottinghamshire, which would take the company's CCGT capacity to 5,000MW by the end of the decade. National Power emphasised its plans for overseas expansion following moves last year into the US and Portugal. American National Power contributed Pounds 1m after interest. Mr Baker said overseas profits would be more than 10 per cent of the group total by the end of the decade. Last year UK market share fell from 41 to 35 per cent. The company expects the level to stabilise at about 30 per cent. Lex, Page 24; Awaiting clarification, Page 26</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Barclays may not pass on rate cuts BARCLAYS BANK yesterday indicated that it would not pass on base rate cuts to business borrowers if the base rate, now 6 per cent, falls below 5 per cent. The bank announced that it was cutting the minimum interest rate for its 200,000 business borrowers from 6 per cent plus the customer's lending margin to 5 per cent plus margin. But Mr Bill Gordon, banking division managing director, said any further reduction in the bank's minimum interest rates 'would make it difficult to provide its depositors with a satisfactory return'. National Westminster, the other leading lender to small and medium-sized businesses, has already indicated it may not pass on base rate cuts below 5 per cent, saying that a decision on whether to do so would depend on personal savings rates. Both banks have been careful to reduce minimum rates in advance of base rate cuts over the past year. They have faced controversy - and a Bank of England inquiry - over the passing on of interest rate cuts.</p>

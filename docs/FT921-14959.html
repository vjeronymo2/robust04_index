			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Nissan buyers meet their maker: The new dealerships set up by the car producer AT SEVEN o'clock on New Year's Eve, Reg Vardy, the publicly owned north-east England car dealer group, had no building from which to start selling Nissans. At 7.20pm, after a final inspection, Vardy directors accepted bright new showrooms just three miles from the Nissan manufacturing plant in Sunderland. By 9.45am on New Year's Day the first of two transporters from the plant arrived. At 10.30am, after a flurry of polishing, cars had been dewaxed and pushed into the showroom. A few seconds later the first dealer in the new network set up by the Japanese carmaker was in business - and a 21-year era ended for Nissan in the UK. Nissan Motor (GB), the manufacturer's new distribution organisation, has already delivered 3,000 cars to the 150 dealers - many of them part of large public groups - that make up the new network. The new-cars pipeline that from 1970 ran between Nissan and Mr Octav Botnar's Nissan UK import and distribution organisation and his AFG dealer network is dry, fractured by the row between Nissan and Mr Botnar last year. But as Nissan Motor (GB) showrooms opened in increasing numbers this week, the question uppermost in executives' minds was whether they faced an immediate, savage price war with Mr Botnar's operation. AFG has 20,000 Nissan cars in stock, which matches the size of the Nissan Motor (GB) network. With a cautious sigh of relief, the new dealers have concluded that predictions of Mr Botnar's flooding the market with cut-price cars in revenge for his franchise being terminated are unfounded. In Sunderland, just 600 yards from another Reg Vardy site, a large AFG dealership is stacked with cars. 'But there's no evidence of any extra sales drive,' says Mr David Williams, a Reg Vardy executive. 'People were looking to AFG to give cars away and the evidence is that they're not.' In the Greater London area, Ancaster Group, which has switched its four dealerships to the new Nissan network after 20 years of selling Nissans supplied by the Worthing-based Botnar companies, also detects no sign of imminent warfare. Mr Robert Cole, managing director, said: 'There's an AFG outlet very near us in Croydon and they don't seem to be into any aggressive selling.' With hindsight, Nissan Motor (GB) dealers say that, considering that AFG has a finite and dwindling stock of vehicles while Mr Botnar seeks alternative franchises for them, it never did make sense for a price war to add to an already vicious battle for sales in a deeply depressed new-car market. For potential buyers, the situation is already confusing enough. There are two separate networks selling mainly identical cars with slightly different specifications and badges. The new model designations Nissan has introduced make it difficult to compare prices exactly, but the differentials are mostly not large and the price advantage varies between the networks. If Nissan Motor (GB) dealers had expected a rush of customers once the 'under new management' sign was hung up over the franchise, they have mostly been disappointed. According to Mr Williams, 'Most people who have come in simply don't understand, or even know about, the row. The main worry of those who do, and have previously bought Nissans, is whether their manufacturers' warranties will be honoured.' Nissan is expected to contact 400,000 Nissan owners, advising them that the Nissan Motor (GB) outlets will process official warranty claims wherever cars were purchased. Mr Cole describes the customers who are visiting the new dealerships: 'Their concern is not with Nissan politics but with price, service - the conventional things.' Meanwhile, posters in Bradford proclaim: 'The Sun is Rising on Canal Road.' The posters urge Nissan drivers to phone a certain number. Doing so connects them with the Appleyard Group's new Nissan dealership, the first of what Mr Mike Williamson, the chairman, intends will be five or six Nissan Motor (GB) dealerships. Appleyard, one of 21 publicly owned groups taking on the Nissan Motor (GB) franchise, is investing several million pounds in the outlets but, says Mr Williamson: 'It's very much for the long term - we know it's going to be a long, hard slog, certainly for this year.' Bradford has long been a Nissan stronghold, and still houses three AFG dealers. The logic of the location from Appleyard's point of view is that Mr Botnar's operation will have bequeathed a large population of Nissan motorists - and thus a large potential market - once the AFG dealers' new Nissan activities fade over the next few months. The other Appleyard sites are in strong AFG territories for the same reason, in what can be regarded only as an ironic tribute to the Worthing enterprise. As Mr Williamson concedes: 'Whatever Nissan say about Botnar, he did a cracking job for them when it came to actually selling cars.'</p>

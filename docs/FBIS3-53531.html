Reacting to the U.S.-Russia  joint declaration issued in Moscow yesterday at the end of the  summit talks, New Delhi perceives that the basic orientation of  the declaration echoed the objectives emphasized by India at the  United Nations.    A statement issued by the External Affairs Ministry  spokesman  said that while India wants objectives of comprehensive test ban  pursued expeditiously within a specified timeframe, it should be  applicable to all members of the international community. In  view of this, New Delhi has pursued confidence building measures  with its neighbors and participated in a series of bilateral  discussions with different countries. However, as far as a  suggestion of the Moscow declaration that the NPT should be  extended indefinitely and unconditionally in the present form,  New Delhi is of the view that it needs to be altered on  nondiscriminatory lines. It should take into account  international developments of the last three decades and the  imperative necessity for complete disarmament to end all weapons  of mass destruction.    The declaration issued after the talks between Mr. Bill  Clinton and Mr. Boris Yeltsin said that the two countries will  support efforts to set up a multilateral forum to deal with  nonproliferation problems in South Asia. It also called upon  India and Pakistan to join the treaty banning nuclear tests and  the proposed convention on banning the production of materials  for nuclear arms.</p>

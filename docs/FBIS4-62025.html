			<p>BFN     [Text] It has not been decided when Russia is going to sign  the NATO Partnership for Peace program. Work is under way in  this direction and documents earlier drafted by Russia are being  polished. This was disclosed in an interview with Interfax by  the head of a Russian Foreign Ministry department Yuriy Ushakov.    He said the documents should reflect the latest  developments,  including the ideas expressed during a recent debate in the  State Duma. He said amendments are being made to the  presentation document which has the working name "Basic  Parameters of Cooperation with NATO".    Ushakov emphasized that diplomats are working hand in hand  with colleagues from the Defense Ministry and other interested  agencies. "I cannot say for sure what Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev meant when he spoke of working on a new document on  relations between Russia and NATO. We drafted the documents  that are now being finalized but the foundation remains the  same," he said.    Ushakov announced that a mixed commission on cooperation  with  NATO chaired by Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin held a  regular session on Tuesday. It consists of representatives of  the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Finance and the  Interior as well as the Security Council and the Foreign  Intelligence Service. The essence of cooperation was discussed  as well as various ways of reflecting the special role of Russia  in cooperation with NATO. Participants agreed that cooperation  with NATO should be expanded and the Partnership program should  not be given up despite all its shortcomings, restrictions and  shapelessness. The program is not ideal, the diplomat said, and  Russia is going to make considerable changes in a document that  is going to be worked out between Russia and NATO.    When asked what he meant by Russia's special role Ushakov  replied: "This means equal partnership at all levels when the  opinion of such a side as Russia must be taken into account  before making decisions on key matters concerning acute  situations in the world. This is the first and foremost  consideration."</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GM: MIDEAST WON'T DETER SALES  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. said today that it is maintaining its 1990 U.S. auto  industry sales projection of 14.7 million vehicles despite the potentially  ominous consequences of the current Middle East crisis.  </P> <P> GM President Lloyd E. Reuss told reporters the company was still projecting  that U.S. auto makers will produce between 14.7 million and 14.8 million cars  and trucks this year.  </P> <P> But he conceded that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent rise in  oil prices could affect GM's product mix.  </P> <P> That shift would be away from large cars to smaller vehicles. "There may be  some shift, but I don't see a major shift," he said.  </P></p>

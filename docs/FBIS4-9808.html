			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega G.] </F>   [Text] Panamanian Public Force, with the aid of the U.S.  military and in coordination with Colombian authorities, have  destroyed at least 10 coca fields in Darien Province and  detained an undisclosed number of people. Operation Tornado,  directed by Major Santiago Fundora of the National Air Service  (SAN), was confirmed to LA PRENSA by President Guillermo Endara  himself, who thanked the newspaper for not reporting on the  operation before its completion, even though the newspaper had  received all of the information well ahead of time.    Operation Tornado was launched Saturday morning when three  teams -- one from the SAN, one from the National Police, and one  from the Institutional Protection Service (SPI) -- flew to  Darien aboard several SAN helicopters to destroy the coca  fields, whose acreage was not disclosed. The groups also  destroyed coca-processing labs in the region along the border  with Colombia.    On 27 March, Fundora reported that the operation had been "a  complete success" to Endara because at least 10 coca fields had  been destroyed. Endara said the Panamanian authorities also set  fire to several huts presumed to be small coca-processing labs.  He also confirmed that several people were caught and handed  over to the proper authorities.    One source, who asked to remain anonymous, said Operation  Tornado was carried out quickly and without any clashes. Those  arrested were taken by surprise in the afternoon and evening of  last Saturday. The operation was nearly complete yesterday,  Sunday morning, although several coca fields, allegedly planted  by Colombians, had yet to be destroyed.    The source said Panamanian and Colombian authorities took  part in the operation, along with the U.S. Government's  logistical support through the U.S. Embassy in Panama. The  source also told LA PRENSA that the authorities are looking for  a hacienda worth several millions of dollars located somewhere  in the Darien jungle. Endara said: "I have been told that the  operation was a complete success. The second stage consists of  burning other fields that were found."    Members of the special teams that participated in Operation  Tornado are still in Darien. They are expected to begin  returning to Panama City today provided no trouble arises with  guerrillas in the Palle area who have threatened to shoot down  Public Force planes and helicopters. Endara did not reveal the  size or exact location of the coca fields destroyed or the  number of police who took part in the operation. An official  report is expected to be released today, however.    Panamanian and Colombian security forces have been carrying  out a coordinated work against drug trafficking and to heighten  border security to prevent a number of crimes perpetrated in and  around the jungle. This type of work started to be carried out  in the framework of good-neighbor commissions that Presidents  Endara and Cesar Gaviria installed last year. As part of the  effort, a number of Pamamanian agents have received police  training in Colombia.    In addition to fighting drug trafficking, the two countries  have been implementing a process of rapprochement and  cooperation on energy, trade, culture, and agriculture and  livestock, according to official reports of the two governments.</p>

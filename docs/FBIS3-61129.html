			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Declaration of program goals of the Liberal Convention of </F> Moldova (abridged version)]    [Text] The election campaign, which is unfolding in  the republic on a fundamentally new, multiparty basis, is  stimulating political processes in society and the emergence of  new political organizations and citizens associations.    The constituent conference of the Liberal Convention of  Moldova, a social and political organization uniting in its  ranks representatives of the intelligentsia, youth, business  circles, and the industrial complex, was held on 11 November.  The conference adopted the bylaws and formulated the program  goals of this new movement. The Liberal Convention advocates the  consolidation of all reform forces of society and the creation  of real conditions for the extrication of Moldova from the  socioeconomic crisis and the surmounting of the contradictions  of the transitional period leading to a free economy and an  open, democratic society. Not participating in the elections  directly, the Convention will support political parties  operating from liberal and progressive positions. Below we  reproduce the text of the Declaration of the Liberal Convention  of Moldova.    The collapse of the totalitarian system in Europe and the  disintegration of the last empire have created conditions  conducive to the people of Moldova's return to a civilized and  democratic path of development.    We, the citizens of this country, are now faced with a  vitally important task, the essence of which is the formulation  and practical implementation of an efficient and viable  model for the further evolution of society.    The experience of the dramatic existence under the  conditions  of self-assertion as a sovereign and independent state  accumulated by the Republic of Moldova permits the conclusion  that society's aspiration to self-organization has  two paths--that of evolution based on the dynamism of  social and political processes or the path of degradation, that  is, conversion into a primitive system of the  administrative-distributive type, in other words, totalitarian.    Parties formed in the majority of cases per the industrial  principle or in corporate interests are predominant in the  country's political life. The absence of a real confrontation of  ideas and the confusion in ideologies are entailing confusion  also in political actions and the conceptual approaches to a  surmounting of the crisis and internal contradictions of the  transitional period.    One more or less clear direction--the so-called "social  market economy," which frequently directly echoes the trend  toward a return to the administrative-command system--is being  manifested in Moldova's sociopolitical reality. The main  shortcoming of this direction is the attempt to preserve the  absolute role of the state and the public sector in people's  economic and social activity, enabling the oligarchy  nomenklatura, incompetent and bankrupt under the new complex  conditions, as a rule, to retain power.    The elaboration and creation in Moldova of a socioeconomic  and political system capable of stimulating the efficiency  and dynamism of the country's new evolutionary development  may be realized on the basis of the creative application of the  basic principles that ensure the efficiency and dynamic balance  of democratic, industrially developed countries.    In this context, the ideas of liberalism could bring our  society, deformed for so many years by the totalitarian regime,  closer to the political, economic, and social culture of  civilized countries. Being a copy of modern Western  civilization, liberalism represents the core and  essence of liberal democratic reforms.    On the threshold of the election of a new supreme  legislative  body of the country, a need for the consolidation of all forces  advocating liberal democratic reforms in the united  Liberal Convention of Moldova has arisen at the  present time. The purpose of the Convention is  effective support for political forces capable of embodying in  practice real liberal doctrine and stimulating social  development, creatively and consciously employing to this end  the principles of liberalism as a philosophy of social being,  spiritual condition, and sociopolitical practice.    The Liberal Convention of Moldova will operate in the name  of  realization of the following goals:  <H5>  In the Political Sphere: </H5>   The consolidation of the state independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Republic of  Moldova--the objective conditions and constitutional framework  necessary for securing the economic progress of the Moldovan  people and the liberalization of political life and the economic  activity of the country's citizens.

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORALITY OF MARKETPLACE IS FIT SUBJECT FOR BUSH;  </P> <P> INAUGURAL SHOULD SET THE TONE AGAINST GREED AND SLEAZE IN FINANCIAL ARENA  </P> <P> When the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. pleaded guilty  to six counts of mail, wire and securities fraud a few weeks ago, a sad chapter  was added to the excesses of Wall Street in the late 1980s. As he takes office,  George Bush should speak out against such crimes.  </P> <P> The Drexel saga, which follows convictions of Ivan Boesky and Dennis B. Levine,  among others, is not over. There are civil charges to be settled with the  Securities Exchange Commission; the fate of Michael Milken, Drexel's junk-bond  king, is still undetermined. But it is not too early for a President to set the  tone for ethics in the financial marketplace, and the upcoming inaugural  address would be the right time and place.  </P> <P> There are many other scandals around, of course -- bribery of political  officials, drug-running in schools, malpractice in hospitals, fraud in the  savings-and-loan system. But Drexel-type sins deserve special presidential  attention because of their potential impact on all parts of the country.  </P> <P> After all, Wall Street is not just a few square blocks in Manhattan. It is not  just young traders who are glued to their computer monitors by day and who race  around in BMWs at night. Nor is it simply the battlefield for RJR Nabisco-type  deals, in which big egos and big money clash.  </P> <P> What is at stake is the integrity of the nation's capital markets, the  mechanism that sets rates for mortgages and car loans and turns savings  accounts into schools and roads. It's these same markets that deflate or jack  up the dollar and hence help determine the competitive position of American  industries in the world arena. And it is on these markets that pension plans  and trust funds depend for their safety and growth.  </P> <P> In the end, this financial system is no more than hundreds of thousands of men  and women, buying and selling bonds and stocks, and making decisions about  someone else's money. What could be more basic for the President than to say,  simply, that he expects that the standards of these people should be as high as  his well-known expectations for public servants.  </P> <P> In upcoming congressional hearings, we will hear a lot about the  conflict-of-interest dilemmas facing the big investment banks in an era of  regulatory laissez faire and vicious international competition. It will become  clear, too, that Drexel's sins are not at all typical of Wall Street behavior.  But lawmakers will be bogged down in technically arcane issues, and it will  take years for new legislation to emerge, if it ever does. In the meantime, the  only way to at least arrest growing public cynicism is for someone who counts  to address the American people on the basic questions of right and wrong in the  financial arena.  </P> <P> In our system that "someone" can only be the President. No senator or  congressman has the national standing. The mandate of top regulators is too  specialized. Business leaders are lying low.  </P> <P> Morals should not be legislated, but top officials can have an impact by  highlighting their importance.  </P> <P> Of course, Bush should not wrestle with the nuances of insider trading,  self-dealing, or any specific case such as Drexel; these are matters best left  to the SEC and others. But he could express disapproval of greed, which  inflicts damage on the public. He could instruct the Congress and the  regulatory agencies to give priority to rooting out conflict of interest in the  financial marketplace. He could ensure the investors on Main Street -- who have  been leaving the stock market in large numbers -- that in his eyes the  financial markets should not be rigged.  </P> <P> Bush said that he wanted a kinder and gentler nation; presumably this means one  whose major institutions are fairer as well. He said that he wanted to be known  as the education President; surely this extends beyond improving the nation's  science and math curricula to the enhancement of the population's most basic  values.  </P> <P> A presidential message should not upset the markets if it is put in the context  of continued support for sensible financial deregulation and the recognition  that the overwhelming number of men and women who constitute the market are  "clean." On the contrary, it would be the clearest evidence of a man who  understands what it is to lead.  </P> <P> After all, modern-day Presidents have little leeway to do much but inspire.  Franklin D. Roosevelt inspired Americans to persevere. John F. Kennedy  instilled pride in public service. Ronald Reagan encouraged self-reliance and  entrepreneurialism.  </P> <P> But our current President seemed oblivious to ethics in the business world and  thereby helped stimulate the worst type of excesses. This gives Bush a great  opportunity. He can build on Reagan's economic revolution, and at the same time  distinguish himself by saying "no" to sleaze in the capital markets.  </P></p>

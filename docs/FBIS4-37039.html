			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 15, IRNA -- Deputy foreign minister for  Euro-American affairs Mahmud Va'ezi here Wednesday brushed aside  the view that there was rivalry between Iran and Turkey in the  region.    Va'ezi, who was speaking to Turkish Foreign Ministry  Director  General for Caucasus and Balkans affairs, (Omer Ersun), said  Tehran has always welcomed cooperation with Ankara in the  Caucasus and Central Asia.    He saw adoption of comprehensive measures and cooperation  among all regional countries as key factors for peace and  regretted that efforts made so far to peacefully settle crises  have proved futile.    Va'ezi welcomed consultations between Iranian and Turkish  officials on issues concerning the Cacasus and Central Asia and  said Tehran and Ankara could help restore peace and stability in  the region especially in the Caucasus in view of their common  stands. He warned that continuation of crisis in the region  would lead to escalation of tension, and underscored joint  efforts by regional states to end the ongoing crisis.    (Ersun) in return referred to "bright" prospects of  Tehran-Ankara political cooperation, and hoped that it would  help restore peace and stability in the region.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE REPORTS $1.445-BILLION DEFICIT  </P> <P> The state ended the 1987-88 budget year last summer with a deficit of $1.445  billion calculated under generally accepted accounting principles, the auditor  general's office said today.  </P> <P> The Deukmejian Administration said the state treasury had a slim surplus of $4  million when the budget year ended June 30, 1988, but a variety of other state  fiscal experts have disputed that finding. The $1.445-billion figure offered by  acting Auditor Gen. Kurt Sjoberg was the highest yet in assessing the state's  financial condition for 1987-88, when a $1-billion revenue shortfall  materialized in April in personal and corporate income tax receipts.  </P> <P> The perilous condition of the treasury was exacerbated, Sjoberg said, by a  $1.1-billion tax rebate that Californians received a few months before the  shortfall surfaced.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Koslov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- Grigoriy Karasin, head of the  Press and Information Department of the Russian Foreign  Ministry, described the Russian president's visits to Corfu and  Brussels as Russia's and the EC's contribution toward preventing  the division of the European continent and establishing a  prosperous and secure Europe. Both events, he noted, will not  just determine the course of future relations with Russia in  many ways, but also positively affect the general climate of  international relations.    The 'Partnership for Peace' program and the protocol that  was  made public in Brussels which give impetus to the process of  further development of the `Russia-NATO' bilateral program of  deeper cooperation are fully in the national interests of Russia  as a great power, in the view of their specific features and the  general mood in Europe, which reflects the desire for deeper  trust and stability. According to Karasin, the signing of the  Brussels documents signifies a mutual agreement between Russia  and NATO as two major partners in European and global security.    The upcoming conclusion of the full-scale agreement on  partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and  the EC will bring cooperation between Russia and the EC to a new  level, Karasin said. "This will be of enormous potential  benefit for the Russian economy, access of our goods to the  European markets, and for the deepening of the mutually  beneficial processes of economic development in the European  region. The EC too, might draw tangible benefits from closer  cooperation with Russia, such as a boost to its economy, easing  the unemployment problems, and opening up new markets," the  Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses subdued by economic outlook WITH no surprises from the Bundesbank, bourses drifted lower again as they considered the outlook for national economies and corporate profits, writes Our Markets Staff. At UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, economists updated their projections for Germany and France. For the former, they said that interest rates will have to stay high  -if not as high as they are now - to ease inflationary pressures on the economy. For the latter, they forecast real GDP growth of just 1.1 per cent in 1993 after 1.8 per cent this year. Merrill Lynch economists expect more downgrades on the corporate front, and that fundamental earnings estimates for next year reflected in August IBES data are still 10 to 15 per cent too high. However, they say, a significant portion of the downgrades has been discounted and markets could offer a 15 to 20 per cent upside on a 12-month view. FRANKFURT ended little changed after the Bundesbank news with the DAX 5.10 lower at 1,453.43 and interest rate-sensitive bank shares were broadly neutral. Mr James Cornish, the County NatWest strategist, thinks that there is room for improvement after a visit last week to the Bundesbank, which attached considerable importance to the 'solidarity pact' which government, industry and the unions are discussing, to place the financing of German unification on a sounder footing. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, re-elected this week as leader of the IG Metall engineering union, told the meeting which confirmed him that the union was ready, subject to conditions, to accept that wages should rise no faster than inflation over the next five years. The Bundesbank contribution, says Mr Cornish, would have to be lower interest rates, and he maintains his forecast of another cut in December. Meanwhile, he says, County has built earnings reductions of 18 per cent into a current p/e of 13.5 for the market. This compares with an average of 14.2 over the past five years, and on a yield basis the market is also cheaper against bonds that it was six months ago. PARIS lost 1.1 per cent, weighed down by the Bundesbank news and a lower opening on Wall Street. The CAC-40 index fell 17.91 to 1,650.02 but turnover was limited once again, at FFr1.5bn. The biggest falls came in second-line stocks, with Accor dropping FFr44.10 or 8.4 per cent to FFr482.9 on rumours that a leading broker had issued a negative report on the company. Moulinex dropped FFr6.50 or 6.7 per cent to FFr90 on fears that it would announce first half losses of between FFr30m and FFr40m. In the event, Moulinex announced a deficit of FFr11m, and brokers expect the stock to rebound today. Among leading stocks, Euro Disney fell back FFr2.05 to FFr74.45 after its recent rally while Saint-Gobain lost a further FFr15.40 to FFr466.60. MILAN turned upwards after a weak start on renewed hopes of an early cut in the discount rate. The hopes were fanned by news that the average rate at the Bank of Italy's repurchase tender eased from 15.01 per cent to 14.98 per cent, to stand just below the discount rate of 15 per cent. However dealers said there was little logic to the rally, which was fuelled by domestic buying while foreigners continued to stay away from Italian equities. The Comit index rose 4.39 to 409.15 in turnover estimated at L250bn after L225.6bn on Wednesday. Shares in Italcementi shot up on hopes that the company and its parent, Italmobiliare, would be compensated for any losses resulting from the takeover of Ciments Francais. Italcementi rose L920 or 12.5 per cent to L8,300 while Italmobiliare added L200 to L33,000. Trading in Italmobiliare savings shares was suspended when they shot up to L14,900 in after-hours trading, compared with an official fixing of L13,500, up L300. Trading in the shares will resume today. STOCKHOLM was pulled down by higher domestic interest rates and negative impulses from abroad. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 12.6 to 662.3 in turnover of SKr364m after SKr354m. S-E Banken reported a a pre-tax loss of SKr2.61m in the first eight months, but its C unrestricted shares added SKr0.50 to SKr13. OSLO fell 2.2 per cent on the weaker dollar and disappointing results from Kvaerner, the shipbuilding and engineering group. The all-share index closed 7.25 lower at 328.66 and Kvaerner A ended NKr8 down at NKr129. Fine tuning was seen in VIENNA, where the ATX index closed up 0.97 at 779.7, and in AMSTERDAM, where the CBS Tendency index lost 0.6 to 106.1. .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 15                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes              Open      11.30     12.00     13.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        984.96    987.08    988.86    989.35 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1059.82   1061.07   1062.89   1063.84  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Oct 14        Oct 13       Oct 12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         992.09        999.62       984.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1074.77       1085.38      1069.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              14.00     15.00     16.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        986.96    985.49    986.08    986.39 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1058.07   1057.85   1061.63   1061.28  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Oct 9         Oct 8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100            987.08        986.33 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1070.52       1060.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  989.70  ; 200 -  1064.99 Low/day: 100 -  983.75 -  1055.62  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] During an evening debate with the Jewish community  on 13 June, PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz  Inacio Lula da Silva said he, like the Jews, is a "survivor."  He said: "I survived the starvation war in the northeastern  region." He included something new in his government proposal,  saying: "I will negotiate the foreign debt directly with the  presidents." He added: "I will contact U.S. President Bill  Clinton because I know he is more sensitive to the social  situation resulting from our debt." He criticized the current  Brazilian foreign policy, saying: "We are important enough to  play the international power game, yet all we do is run after  the ball."    Lula and Jose Dirceu, the PT candidate for the governorship  of Sao Paulo State, kicked off a series of candidate debates  sponsored by the Sao Paulo Israeli Federation at the Hebrew  Club. Progressive Renewal Party presidential candidate  Esperidiao Amin and Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, the Popular Party  candidate for state governor, will participate on 27 June.  Brazilian Social Democracy Party candidates Fernando Henrique  Cardoso and Mario Covas are scheduled for 8 August, and Orestes  Quercia and Barros Munhoz for 22 August.</p>

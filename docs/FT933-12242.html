			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / PM's revelations hit hopes for party unity MR JOHN MAJOR'S efforts to call a truce in the Tory party's civil war over Europe suffered a setback yesterday, as fresh battles loomed after revelations by the prime minister himself about tensions within his cabinet. Renewed bouts of sniping between the Eurosceptics and the Euro-enthusiasts were inflamed by the publication in the Observer newspaper of a taped, private conversation in which Mr Major spoke bitterly of the 'poison' being spread by former rightwing ministers and the problems of managing a tiny parliamentary majority. 'We don't want another three more of the bastards out there,' he said when asked why he did not sack three cabinet ministers who threatened to resign if he accepted the social chapter as the price for being able to ratify the Maastricht treaty. The latest setback comes as many Conservatives expect a humiliating defeat in Thursday's by-election at Christchurch. Factions within the party are already jockeying for position to influence the government as it makes advance preparations for next June's elections to the European Parliament and in its approach to future EC summits. A further revolt by the Eurosceptics is threatened when the government brings forward legislation on EC finance, in November. The bill will implement the agreement which was reached at the Edinburgh summit, increasing national governments' contributions to the Commission. Though ministers describe it as a good deal, they concede that some hardline rebels will probably oppose it. The latest events cast a shadow over today's Anglo-French summit in London, and comes just hours before the High Court is to hear the legal challenge to the ratification process brought by Lord Rees-Mogg. Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, yesterday denied that the cabinet was split over Maastricht, though he made it clear that any minister who had serious reservations about the government's European policy should consider his position. He also called on Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, to set up an urgent inquiry into how the conversation had been published. It was allegedly recorded by the BBC during Mr Major's media interviews on Friday. The BBC had earlier said that the material had been widely available: 'Any number of places could have been the source of the story.' The impression of discord was fuelled by Lord Tebbit, the former Tory party chairman, who said that 'many ministers - perhaps most' hoped that the Maastricht treaty would never come into effect. On BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost, he also hinted that the European elections could be good for the Tory party. Perhaps it would make the extreme Europhiles understand that the British people do not want to be 'dragged into a union', he said. The delicacy of trying to keep a balance within the Tory party was underlined as it became clear that Mr Bill Cash, a leading Eurosceptic, had not been offered a formal role in a 'new group' to be set up by Mr Douglas Hurd, to determine the UK's policy in the run-up to the inter-governmental conference in 1996, as had been reported. Instead, Mr Hurd's aides said, Mr Cash had been offered a meeting with the foreign secretary, whose door was open to all shades of opinion in the party. Fuel aid plans rejected, Page 7</p>

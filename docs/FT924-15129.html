			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: ERM turmoil keeps pressure on bourses Continued turmoil in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and disappointment that the Bundesbank did not lower its interest rates kept the pressure on European bourses last week. The FT-Actuaries World index lost 2.6 per cent in local currency terms, burdened by falls in Europe and by the 5.4 per cent drop in Japan. The worst performer was France, which fell by 7.3 per cent on fears that foreign exchange speculators had not given up their fight with the French authorities. The consequent rise in short-term money market rates to protect the French currency, to around 13 5/8 per cent from 10 1/8 per cent before Black Wednesday, has severely depressed the bourse. Mr David Harrington at James Capel in Paris has detected net selling by UK and US institutional investors, perhaps as asset allocators increase their weightings in favour of bonds. A spate of poor interim results and a growing consensus that 1993 earnings estimates could be too high have also prompted investors to sell. 'In the short-term, there is not a lot of scope for the French market,' says Mr Harrington, though he does not rule out a trading bounce. However, the longer-term prospects for French equities are better than elsewhere on the Continent. Spain came a close second in the worst performance stakes, losing 7 per cent after an announcement by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, that it might lower its credit rating on Spanish foreign debt paper reduced an already enfeebled stock market to a wreck. In a week when there were few gainers, Mexico stood out with a rise of 6.5 per cent, fuelled by end of quarter cross-trades and the Treasury bill auction which resulted in unchanged longer-term rates, except the 28-day rate which rose by 25 basis points to 19.25 per cent. Some operators had been fearing a higher increase in rates.</p>

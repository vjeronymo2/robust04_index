			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (8): Woodcare products  -no backwater sector / Consumers are willing to pay more for easier-to-use, water-based coatings The cat depicted walking along a fence on cans of Cuprinol's 'Garden TimberCare' isn't there as a piece of whimsy. Nor are the flowers gaily flourishing along the bottom of the fence. The illustration's intended message is: this product won't hurt either your pets or your plants. Cuprinol's research showed this was consumers' first concern  -even more than the safety of their children (it may be charitably assumed that if people believe a product is safe for animals, that includes offspring.) The sales growth of such water-based fence coatings was nearly 12 per cent in Britain last year. Other exterior woodcare products are flourishing: Roncraft says its water-based woodstain increased sales by 45 per cent in 1993. This has countered static or declining sales in other sectors of the market, although Roncraft, the market leader in interior varnish, is encouraged this year by the strengthening of the housing market. Overall, the consumer market - mostly through do-it-yourself stores - is estimated to have expanded last year by 4.5 per cent to Pounds 111m. In addition, there is the trade market of around Pounds 50m and an industrial market of about half that - 'woodcare products are assumed to be a bit of a backwater in the surface coatings industry - but that couldn't be further from the truth,' says Mr Jim Byrne, Cuprinol's marketing director. 'It is a quarter the size of the paints industry - and growing. It is a dynamic, thrusting industry, in contrast to the surface coatings industry which is very staid.' He admits woodcare has had a prosaic image compared with paint. It is one the industry leaders seek to counter with television advertising campaigns, capitalising on the broadening appeal of natural wood within the home and its increasing exterior use for window frames. The market itself ranges from products which prevent decay to decorative finishes. Cuprinol, which is based in Frome, Somerset, and was acquired by Williams Holdings in 1988, and Roncraft, owned by the US company L &amp; F Products, each have about a quarter of the consumer woodcare market. With smaller shares of the retail market are Sikkens, Sadolin and Dulux (ICI), although these three have larger shares of the trade market. Innovation is being stimulated by the trend away from solvent-based products to water-based products with low-odour formulations. The driving force for this is the consumer: water-based products are quick-drying and brushes can be washed out. They also cost more and, in most cases, the performance has yet to equal solvent-based products - they do not penetrate as deeply and are not as durable. The water-based formulations are more complex but the consumer is prepared to pay a premium to have the convenience. In contrast, Mr Byrne says, the professional trade still has 'considerable resistance' to water-based products as it is more concerned with performance and price. In the retail market, where consumers make only occasional purchases, it is the convenience, rather than environmental factors, which is at the forefront of their buying decisions. Mr Ged Shields, marketing director of Roncraft, says: 'Our research shows consumers are much more concerned with the home environment, rather than the wider environment.' Mr Shields says it is generally agreed that water-based products are in fact more environmentally friendly, although the equation is complicated. Solvent-based products, using mainly white spirit, evaporate into the atmosphere where they mix with vehicle emissions to cause smog. On the other hand, water-based products, being less durable, will need to be used more frequently, which has implications for energy and packaging use. Then there are the chemicals which are washed out of the brushes and into the drains. Health and safety legislation affecting UK woodcare products was virtually non-existent only a decade ago, but now, says Mr Byrne, 'we are one of the most heavily regulated industries within the do-it-yourself sector.' The main legislation on the use of pesticides is the Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985. A product which makes any claim as a preservative has to be registered with the Health and Safety Executive; in 1990, it banned the use in consumer products of lindane, pentachlorophenol and tributyltin oxide. Cuprinol, the preservative market leader, had already replaced these with acypetacs-zinc and permethrin. More reforms are coming with European directives on formulations, labelling and containers. Mr Byrne points out that while manufacturers have to ensure their products will not harm, for example, bats in belfries or bees in hives, consumers want to know a preservative is effective, especially because the combination of the damp UK climate and low-quality softwood encourages decay - 'a claim of potency is a good marketing claim,' he says. 'We have to make the product as effective as possible while as safe as it can be - there is a trade-off there.'</p>

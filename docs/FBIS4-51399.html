			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 25 (XINHUA) -- North China's biggest  industrial city of Tianjin has gained a record influx of  overseas investment of more than one billion U.S. dollars in the  first quarter of this year.    This marks the city as one of the hottest attractions in  China for thousands of worldwide investors, according to the  latest official data.    Analysts here attributed the fast expansion of overseas  investment in Tianjin to a good environment for cooperation and  the local government's policies of opening wider to the outside  world.    Peter K. Hahnel, German general manager of the Tianjin  Henkel Detergent and Cleaning Products Co., Ltd., said that  Tianjin has better infrastructural facilities, including  transport and telecommunication, compared with other cities  across the country. In addition, it has richer water,  electricity and raw materials resources.    What is more important, he said, is that the city has laid a  good foundation for the development of both heavy and light  industries.    "We can find our best partners here," said Hahnel.    The company, a joint venture funded by the German-based  Henkel Company, was set up last year. It has an annual  production of 92,000 tons of detergent, both for industrial and  daily use, with sales of 330 million yuan yearly.    He said, "the reason that we could put our new company into  operation in a short period of less than six months is mainly  because the Tianjin detergent factory had been the biggest and  the best manufacturer in north China."    "The reason we chose Tianjin to invest in is very simple,"  Sentaro Negoro, director general manager of the Tianjin (Earth)  Chemical Co., Ltd., told XINHUA.    "It has a world first-class tin-making manufacturer that  enables our products to enter China's market with high quality  and low cost," he said.    "Earth" is one of the biggest insecticide producers in  Japan,  employing more than 800 people and registering annual sales of  37 billion yen. It put a total of 830,000 U.S. dollars into  the Tianjin venture to develop six kinds of insecticides.    While many overseas investors value the industrial bases in  the city, other transnational high-tech firms are attracted to  the abundance of well-educated workers provided by the numerous  institutions of higher learning and research institutes here.    After a seven-year investigation throughout China, the U.S.  firm Motorola decided to build its company in Tianjin.    C. W. Ko, manager of Tianjin Motorola's Human Resource  Department, said that the majority of the 1,000 Chinese  employees of the firm are graduates from universities and  colleges, and many of them have received master's or doctor's  degrees.    "In Tianjin, we can make contact with all kinds of  professional workers our company needs," he said.    He said that Tianjin is an old industrial city. The  dedication of Tianjin's workers benefits the long-term  investment here.    Not long ago, after careful scrutiny into the investment  environment here, Novo Nordisk, the world's biggest producer of  industrial enzymes, invested 250 million U.S. dollars in  Tianjin to build a modern biological products plant.    Almost all the transnational companies in Tianjin spoke  highly of the efforts by the local government to create a good  environment for foreign investment.    The German Manager Hahnel said the government here knows  very  well what to do for the foreign investors and how to help them  start a business and run it well.    An overseas-funded food company said that the government  always pays close attention to suggestions and complaints the  joint ventures raise, regarding such matters as environmental  protection.    However, much remains to be done to improve the investment  environment in the city. It is not so easy for overseas  investors and visitors to find comfortable apartments or office  buildings. They often have to wait a long time for  accommodations after first arriving.    As a result, the city has now stepped up the pace on  construction of such buildings. A dozen new buildings are now  under construction and expected to be completed in the near  future.    Some overseas real estate investors have contracted for  building luxury hotels here, according to a local official.</p>

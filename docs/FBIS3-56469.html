			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by journalist Irina Savvateyeva under general </F> heading: "Resignation of `Father of Reforms' Could Cause  Government Crisis"]    [Text] One must think that on Sunday Viktor Stepanovich  Chernomyrdin had already laid out the government cards preparing  to name his four vice premiers. But Yegor Gaydar muddled up all  the premier's cards by refusing to take the post of first vice  premier in the reorganized government.    Why? This post was guaranteed him through the endeavors of  the president. Initially it was believed he would be in charge  of 13 federal organs, including the ministries of the economy,  finances, and foreign policy relations and the  Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Administration of  State Property]. But experience of work with Chernomyrdin over  the past four months (also in the post of first vice premier,  incidentally) has given Yegor Timurovich no grounds for  illusions.    "Gaydar had nothing to do. He had no functions left.  Chernomyrdin had plugged every hole for him," one high-ranking  government official commented on the position of the "father" of  Russian reforms in the present cabinet of ministers.    Obviously, before 13 December Yegor Gaydar was gambling on a  victory for his bloc at the elections. The press was engaged in  a thorough discussion of the possibility that he would be  nominated for the post of prime minister.... The results of the  elections buried all hopes. Most of all they reinforced the  positions of Chernomyrdin, who after the victory of Zhirinovskiy  and the success of the Communists, remained in the role of a  "centrist" -- a favorite and honored role among Russian  politicians and soviet directors.    To all appearances Gaydar's position would in no way have  been strengthened in the "renewed" government. The  Goskomimushchestvo was dropped from the list of departments  under his control after Chubays was appointed vice premier by  Yeltsin personally. And what does being in charge of the  Ministry of Finances mean when Boris Fedorov is alive? Or in  charge of foreign economic relations when Aleksandr Shokhin is  in good health? (Rumor has it that Chernomyrdin favors Shokhin  more than Gaydar -- probably after Aleksandr Nikolayevich also  declared himself to be a centrist and began to abuse Yegor  Timurovich). And, finally, what does it mean to be in charge of  the Ministry of the Economy, controlled by we do not understand  what, when all sectorial industrial departments are subordinate  to top-ranking First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets? Probably the  true role which Viktor Chernomyrdin intended for the second  first vice premier was the role of whipping boy. After all,  when prices leap after the unification of the Russian ruble with  the Belarusian "hare" there will have to be someone to blame for  the "ill-considered consequences of the shock reforms."    Will Yeltsin accept Gaydar's resignation?    To judge by the tone of the statement made by Vyacheslav  Kostikov, the president's press secretary, on Sunday, Boris  Nikolayevich would very much like to refuse it. But to refuse  it would mean not simply leaving Gaydar and repealing (or  deferring) a decision on the unification of the Russian and  Belarusian monetary systems and putting a ban on the  construction of the parliament building. To refuse Gaydar's  resignation would mean embarking on strengthening the reformist  wing in the government. And ultimately embarking on  confrontation with Chernomyrdin who has essentially become the  second man in the country and who, incidentally, relies on the  support of two very powerful lobbies -- the industrial and  agrarian lobbies. The president can hardly allow himself such  whims in the present political situation.    Incidentally, if you compare this with September 1993, when  Yeltsin imposed Gaydar on Chernomyrdin (although the latter  hastened to state that it was his own initiative) then the  difference is not only in the strength of the president's  political positions. At the time the economic situation was  somewhat different: The country was sliding toward  hyperinflation. But today, not least thanks to Gaydar's  efforts, the ruble does not look that bad. So that there would  seem to be no urgent, insurmountable need for so-called  "monetarists." In addition Boris Fedorov is still in the  government for the time being.    Incidentally, if Gaydar goes the post of first vice premier  will be free. And the prime minister could very well offer it  to the finances minister. If, of course, Viktor Stepanovich or  Boris Nikolayevich is interested in Fedorov remaining in the  government. Then, you see, the Zaveryukha-Fedorov conflict would  be resolved, even if only partially.    It is true that this would scarcely make any easier the  further fate of the Ministry of Finances leader in a government  of sector lobbyists. But if you consider that in the present  situation the positions of Boris Fedorov's long-standing  opponent, Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, are  automatically strengthened, then it may be supposed that  following Gaydar and Social Protection Minister Ella Pamfilova,  the Ministry of Finances leader will also think of resigning.</p>

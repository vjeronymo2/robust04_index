			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION OF MAYOR BRADLEY  </P> <P> In response to "Mayoring On Into the Boredom Zone" by Phillip E. Present, Op-Ed  Page, Sept. 7:  </P> <P> Prof. Present opines that our last two mayors' lack of scruples and  indifference to the needs of their constituency should be shrugged off with the  excuse, "They got bored." Present also suggests that voters make their future  choices at the polls by attempting to second-guess an incumbent's enthusiasm  for his job, as this mayoral ennui can lead to "mismanagement, lapses in  executive judgment, unethical practices or possibly worse." What is this -- the  "give Koko a tire swing and he won't tear up his cage" theory of political  science?  </P> <P> Rather than formulate lame rationalizations, perhaps Prof. Present could  instead clarify why Bradley finds so little challenge managing the "mundane,  tedious, low-visibility-yet-essential administrative duties" of the  second-largest city in the United States. And no matter how stupefyingly dull a  man might find his job, to simply state that "indifference to the nuts and  bolts of day-to-day city management can create problems" in no way explains nor  excuses unresponsiveness to the community and gross conflict of interest.  </P> <P> If Mayor Tom is bored, maybe it's because so little work of a truly challenging  nature crosses his desk. Considering the enormity of the job he was elected to  perform, it would be nice to know exactly who, then, has been handling (or  mishandling) the important problems for him.  </P> <P> D.

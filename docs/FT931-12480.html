			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Fiscal virtue, but not yet please British budgetary policy this year will be more interesting than usual. There will be two Budgets - the last of the tax-only ones this March and the first of the new-style ones bringing spending and tax together in December. More important, the chancellor faces a medium-term problem - an entrenched budget deficit that is not just the result of recession. There is a good deal of uncertainty - intellectual as well as political - about just how large the correction should be, by what means it should be carried out and when to undertake it. Sound finance advocates got a lot of egg on their faces by predicting disaster from Ronald Reagan's budget deficits. The main danger is not so much a sterling crisis or an inflationary explosion, as a process of creeping debilitation, as in the US, where budgetary stringency has become the main influence on foreign and defence policy, and where more of the Budget has to be devoted to debt servicing. The latest Green Budget, Tax Options 1993, just published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in collaboration with Goldman Sachs, provides the best available insight into the UK problem. It also marks the first appearance of political correctness in this series. 'If an executive knows that she is going to buy a machine next year, it costs her little to buy it this year instead if it saves tax.' The Green Budget authors trace three possible fiscal paths. In the base line case there is, as the Treasury hopes, a modest recovery in the economy in the next financial year followed by 3 per cent average growth in the years to 1997-98. This growth rate is regarded as sufficient to reduce unemployment slowly. Suppose the government stuck to existing public spending plans and did nothing but adjust tax thresholds and specific duties for inflation? On the baseline projection, the public sector borrowing requirement would rise to about Pounds 55bn in the next two financial years - more than 9 per cent of gross domestic product if privatisation proceeds are excluded, with only minimal improvement in later years. In the optimistic case, the PSBR falls to below Pounds 20bn in 1997-98 and is then set to fall further. But this case is based on a rather unrealistic model. The pessimistic one, where the PSBR rises to more than Pounds 80bn by the later 1990s, is unfortunately more believable. To the moralistically minded, even the baseline prospects will be self-evidently scandalous. The Green Budget, however, rightly goes into some detail on just how much correction is required. A sensible long-term objective would be to stabilise the ratio of public sector debt to GDP once the economy is on its normal growth path - whatever that may be. The gross national debt to GDP ratio is now just over 40 per cent, but is rising at 5 percentage points a year. No remotely feasible measures can prevent it climbing further in the next few years; but it will eventually have to be stabilised to avoid an Italian or Greek-style debt trap in which the deficit threatens to explode under the weight of the increasing interest rates required to service it. The green paper authors estimate that to stabilise the debt ratio at, say, 60 per cent of GDP, the PSBR will have to be brought down from a prospective 6 or 7 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to some 3 per cent later. Their target is thus the same as that in the Maastricht treaty. To achieve it could require spending curbs or tax increases of some 2 to 4 per cent of GDP, or Pounds 20bn to Pounds 40bn a year. When should the chancellor move? The arguments for acting in December rather than now are not those of fine tuning. There is still a threat of a prolonged depression with slow spending, falling asset prices, and rising unemployment, all feeding on each other. As they showed with Tuesday's 1 percentage point base rate cut, the Treasury and Bank of England have this time not been deceived by the supposedly favourable January CBI survey. The improvement relates to confidence and expectations rather than orders; and the comparison is with last autumn's Black Wednesday gloom. The case for strong measures to curb the budget deficit will only come into its own when recovery is established. But the chancellor still needs to outline the dimensions of the problem and how he intends to tackle it. What will have to happen eventually? If the basic, lower and higher income tax rates were all raised by 2 pence in the pound, if all allowances and limits were reduced by 20 per cent, if the excise duties were raised by 20 per cent and if VAT were increased by 2 percentage points, then the chancellor would raise in a full year Pounds 22bn. This ignores, of course, all the adverse effects on demand and confidence from such a package, as well as the riot which would be likely on the backbenches. One green paper idea is to extend the tax base by abolishing VAT zero rating, with higher social benefits to offset the regressive effect. Such a package could eventually yield Pounds 5bn a year. On top of this there could be revenue from taxing financial services and environmental measures such as the proposed carbon tax. There is, of course, no reason why the savings required should all be obtained by tax increases. The IFS authors do discuss various spending curbs. Some proposals, such as using private finance for public capital projects, are dismissed as creative accounting 'constructive only as far as the PSBR provides an inappropriate target'. If the burden on the public purse is to fall there would have to be a shift from tax finance to fees, which need not be confined to capital projects, and could, for instance, cover road use. In the longer term a diminution of state pensions, relative to private provision, should yield large sums. Unfortunately the IFS public spending ideas are broad brush, while all the minute study is lavished on the tax side. Policy should be more even handed. The government's target division of national expenditure is 45 per cent public versus 55 per cent private, which must be a rough guide to public preferences as revealed in the ballot box. Even this formula exaggerates the required rise in tax rates, because the tax-take automatically rises more than in proportion to the national income - 'real fiscal drag' in the jargon. There is, however, one intellectual difficulty that neither the IFS authors nor anyone else seems to have faced. Suppose the more pessimistic projections are realised for the few years immediately ahead? Then the green paper arithmetic suggests that much larger budgetary curbs - say of Pounds 50m - would be required to reach the Maastricht target. Believers in the old-time religion would say this means we would then need even more tax increases and more public spending curbs. Traditional Keynesians would say that on the contrary we do not need them, as under conditions of depression high budget deficits are required as a stimulus. May I suggest the following exercise to some economic modeller (not for the busy executive)? If in conditions of depression a higher budget deficit enables more output to be produced than otherwise, the gains from this increase have to be set off against the transfer costs to future generations of a higher inherited government debt burden. For this exercise, monetary policy - however defined - must be assumed to be constant and only fiscal policy be allowed to vary. As no agreement is likely on whether fiscal policy can stimulate economy in the medium term, a sensitivity analysis needs to be done showing how the costs and benefits vary according to differing assumptions about its effects. Some degree of debt trap would be worth enduring for a real growth boost and it would be helpful to have some idea of what the trade-offs might be.  ------------------------------------       EFFECTS OF TAX INCREASES  ------------------------------------                               Revenue                                 gain*                           (Pounds bn)  ------------------------------------ 1p rise in all income   tax rates                       2.4 10% cut in all allow-   ances and limits                3.7 10% rise in excise   duties                          2.6 1 point rise in VAT               2.4 Total                            11.1  ------------------------------------ *Achieved by 1994-95  ------------------------------------ Source: Autumn Statement  ------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: "RAIN BOY"?  </P> <P> A young man springs his emotionally disturbed brother from an institution and  heads out on the road. In the course of their travels, he discovers and  exploits his brother's unique gift. Sound familiar?  </P> <P> No, it's not "Rain Man II," but Universal's "The Wizard," starring Fred Savage  of TV's "The Wonder Years." In David Chisholm's screenplay, Savage kidnaps his  younger brother, who's traumatized while witnessing their sister's drowning.  Though virtually speechless, kid brother turns out to be a video game wiz. They  head for L.A., via Las Vegas, and an international tournament.  </P> <P> Scheduled to film locally and in Utah in June, "The Wizard" is directed by Todd  Holland and produced by Chisholm and Ken Topolsky.  </P> <P> Chisholm was out of the country and unavailable for comment. A studio exec  insisted similarity between "The Wizard" and "Rain Man" was only "superficial"  -- and mentioned "Tommy," with its pinball story, as just as likely a  comparison.  </P> <P> "I believe the project's been around for some time," said the source, "and it's  geared to a different kind of audience in its tone and style."

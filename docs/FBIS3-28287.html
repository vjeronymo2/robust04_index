As for the stock  market, share prices began the decline from early 1990 ahead of  the real economy and subsequently, though trading is more active  that at one time, the turnover is approximately 300 million  shares (daily average trading volume during September) or less  than one-third of that during the peak period. Thus, the stock  market is still in the wintry season, but there are encouraging  signs. Subscriptions to JR [Japan Railway] East Japan shares  surpassed initital estimates and showed a glimpse of the  potential investors' strength.    One would like to blame the current recession of the real  economy as the main and sole reason why the stock market has  been sluggish for such a long period, but if the developments  leading up until now are analyzed carefully, one notices that  many causes lie in the securities sector itself, and they have  been contributing greatly to market stagnancy. Overshadowed by  the severity of the economic recession, these problems are  becoming less noticeable, but to recall potential investors to  the exchange and build a strong market, the problems of the  stock market itself must be resolved fundamentally.    At the request of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Regular Members  Association, this research institute organized the "Research  Committee on the Future Securities Market and Securities  Industry" (chairman, Osaka University Professor Shoichi Royama)  in October 1992 and had been conducting discussions and  research, and the results have now been compiled into a report  for release. The report points out the problems of the  securities market and proposes measures that should be taken to  develop the market and also presents a view of the future  securities market and industry.    Portions of the report are presented below.  <H5>  Future Stock Market as Seen From Qualitative Standpoint </H5>   In the report, the future image of the stock market is  visualized from both the qualitative and quantitative  standpoints. The future stock market, as seen from the  qualitative standpoint, is discussed first.    Changes in the Trading System    Heretofore, the securities trading system followed by the  main advanced capitalist countries, including the United States,  the United Kingdom, and Germany, has centered on stock exchanges  and was generally similar to Japan's trading system. However, in  recent years, this traditional trading system has been  undergoing drastic changes on a worldwide scale.    As causes for the change, the growth of institutional  investors, development of electronics, competition among  exchanges, etc. can be mentioned. The growth of institutional  investors has caused changes in the rules affecting fixed  commissions, market concentration requirements, restrictions on  dealings by brokers, etc., while the development of electronics  has made possible transactions that do not require a trading  floor. Also, the trading system is changing drastically because  of competition among exchanges, whether domestic or foreign, to  attract transactions. Japan is not an exception. These changes  will probably have various effects on the securities industry in  the future. For example, the execution function in dealer  operations might become less important, the management service  function might become more significant, and the importance of  the dealer's role as a market maker, which was not seriously  regarded up until now, might increase in the future.    Expand Business Sphere of Securities Industry    Through advancement of liberalization, the business sphere  of  the securities industry might expand. As reasons for the  potential expansion, first, the development of financial  transactions in the form of negotiable securities to preclude  assumption of indirect financial institutions' operational costs  can be considered. Other reasons that can be mentioned are:  Through mutual entries permitted by financial system reform,  commercial products which could not be handled up until now can  be offered; since the definition of securities was widened  through revision of the Securities and Exchange Law, the  development of new securities is possible; because of complete  liberalization of deposit interest rates, investment trusts and  bonds have become relatively advantageous; and, through  functional diversification of financial services, the fields in  which securities companies can participate will expand.    On the other hand, however, liberalization will bring to the  securities sector competition that differs from the past.  Business strategies important to "normal industries," such as  pricing and marketing, which had tended to be ignored in the  past will have to be taken seriously by brokerages in the  future. Also, through liberalization, securities companies will  acquire the freedom to engage in various types of operations but  to survive, the selection of business activities (freedom to  reject) will probably become an important point.    Stock Market--Little Hope of Continuous Growth    During the phase of spiraling stock prices until late 1989,  the increase in stock prices was not founded on expansion of the  real economy; investment activities as well as fund procurement  operations based on optimistic expectations for the future were  noticeable in the market. Subsequently, with late 1989 as the  historic peak, stock prices declined steadily until August 1992  and turned slightly upward as comprehensive economic measures  were undertaken.    However, the drop in corporate profits caused by the rapid  yen appreciation subsequently thwarted the rise in stock prices  and a long-term stalemate has emerged. From the standpoint of  long-range price fluctuations, the time is judged to be  favorable for a swing upward, but, reflecting stagnant real  economic growth, a continuous rise as in the past is probably  too much to expect.    Bond Market--Increased Ratio of Local Government  Bonds    Because the organization and buildup as well as the  deregulation of Japan's bond market started with national bonds,  a market that is extremely slanted to government bonds was  created. However, in recent years, because efforts were placed  on the growth of the corporate bond market and also because of  banks' reluctance to extend loans and the sluggishness of equity  financing, the standing of the corporate bond market rose  rapidly in the bond and debentures market. Through further  deregulation, the issuance of ordinary corporate bonds will  probably increase even more in the future. Also, as the role  played by regions increases in public investments, the ratio of  local government bonds is expected to increase.    Activating the bond market means increasing bond circulation  and, to accomplish that, it is important to organize and  strengthen the market as well as revise various procedures and  simultaneously enhance the marketability of bonds. As measures  to revise local government bonds, the following can be  considered: simplify name transfer procedures; increase the  issuance lot; employ the lump sum redemption system at  maturity; issue tax-exempt bonds; and issue variable interest  bonds as in public offerings. As for ordinary corporate bonds,  measures to energize the market are producing results, but  further deregulation and strengthening of market-making  operations are desirable.    Derivative Market--Needs Continue To Increase    As evident today, the growth of the derivative market has  been impeded temporarily by stricter controls but if the highly  unstable environment continues, new innovations will probably  appear to circumvent the regulations and neutralize the  controls. The derivative market is a market that emerged in  response to the demands of the age. The conditions which made  the derivative market necessary, such as the globalization of  financial markets, progress of institutionalization and  increased need for risk management, might continue to intensify,  but they will not weaken. In addition, prerequisites to  development of the derivative market, such as elevation of  financial skills in risk management, computerization, etc., are  in place.    Nevertheless, the derivative market is not entirely free of  problems. Though charges that it is the hotbed of market  manipulations and illegal transactions are not founded on firm  evidences, such criticisms have a certain persuasiveness and the  fact that they have been circulating for a long period creates a  problem. The market must be able to give the confidence to  participants that "this is the arena for fair games played under  specific rules." Regulatory agencies, exchanges, and independent  governing bodies should establish rules based on actual  conditions and supervise their enforcement.    Institutional Investors--Reassessing Systematic  Investments    In Japan's stock market, there had been hardly any  institutional investor in the traditional sense of the term. By  traditional institutional investors we are referring to  financial brokerages, in a broad sense, which collect funds from  ultimate investors, like individuals, and invest in portfolios  with the optimum risk-and-return combination suited to the  investment goals.    Today, the stock investment environment surrounding banks,  life insurance companies, etc., is changing noticeably. Because  the risks of stock investments were revealed by the bursting of  the "bubble," and banks and insurance companies, which had  depended on assets like Japanese stocks for most of their  earnings through capital gains, are losing the income base to  retain them, systematic investments prioritizing dealings with  corporations are being reassessed. As a result, these investors  are reemerging as institutional investors in the traditional  sense. The activities of these institutional investors will  probably exert a strong influence on the future stock market.    Individual Investors--Possess Investment Reserve    Individual investors are being eagerly awaited because of  the  expectation that individuals have steadily accumulated financial  assets and they make investment decisions that are different  from those made by institutional investors and that widens the  scope and increases the efficiency of the stock market. The  table compares the percentages of monetary asset accumulations  and equity investments between Japanese and American individual  investors. Judging by this table, it can be said that  considering the monetary asset accumulations, stock investments  by individual investors in Japan are at a low level. In short,  there is believed to be an adequate reserve for investments.    Table 1. U.S.-Japan Comparisons of Individual Monetary Assets and Stock  Investments                                             Japan              United States   Individual savings      1960              17.4%              5.0%  rate   1970                    18.2              8.2   1980                    19.2              6.2   1990                    14.1              7.3   Individual monetary     1960              0.82 times         1.90 times  assets (versus GNP)   1970                    0.98              1.96   1980                    1.39              1.72   1990                    2.18              2.53   Savings (versus         1960              47.2%              17.3%  individual monetary  assets)   1970                    51.8              22.0   1980                    60.6              29.9   1990                    50.8              20.2   Stocks (versus          1960              11.0%              41.2%  individual monetary  assets)   1970                    6.4               38.3   1980                    2.0               26.2   1990                    8.9               14.4   Note: Prior to 1980, Japanese stocks at book value.      Then, how can individual investors be persuaded to  participate in the stock market? As incentives, the elimination  of double taxation of dividends or the introduction of the  imputation system as an easing measure and the lowering of  commissions for individuals or drastic reductions in minimum  investment requirements, etc., can be mentioned.    Corporations--Information Disclosure Encouraged    Criticism is heard from various quarters about the fund  procurement activities of corporations during the "bubble"  period, but, from the standpoint of cost of funds, one can say  that those operations had been rational. In retrospect, the  responsibility for the causes of excessive investments should  not be placed only on corporations but on the entire market  organization which continued to hold misplaced expectations for  a long time.    When similar situations arise in the future, it can be fully  anticipated that corporations will take identical actions (as  judged, too, by the actions now being taken by U.S.  corporations). A step that can be taken is to prevent faulty  expectations from dominating the market for a long period. To  accomplish that, it is essential to fully disclose to investors,  in an easily understandable form, correct information on future  corporate earnings.  <H5>  Future Stock Market as Seen From Quantitative Standpoint </H5>   The scale of the stock market in the year 2000 was estimated  using an econometric model. Estimates were made in two steps. In  the first step, the six macro variables of GNP, money supply,  current account balance, stock prices, long-term interest rates,  and exchange rates were estimated according to the Bayes  multivariate time-series analytical method. Next, in the second  stage, the structural equation was projected from past data into  which estimates of macro variables predicted in the first step  were inserted and numerical values associated with the stock  market were forecast.    Relative to results of the first step, as for the nominal  GNP, an average annual growth of 3.8 percent is estimated from  1992 until 2000, and for M2 + CD, which is the representative  index of money supply, an average annual rise of 4.8 percent is  predicted. To point out the main item among the estimated values  related to the stock market in 2000, TOPIX (Tokyo Stock Price  Index) will be at the level of 2,061. This is equivalent to 80  percent of the 1989 average, which was the highest level  recorded. Also, stock transaction volume will amount to  approximately 320 trillion yen, about the level of 1988. Bond  trading will amount to approximately 7,000 trillion yen,  equivalent to the 1987 level, which was the historic high.    In the forecasts, dummy "bubble" variables were used, so  when  the "bubble" period is used as the base, there is a possibility  of underestimation. Also, the effects of listing JR East Japan  stock were not considered so, after it is put on the market,  that aspect should be taken into consideration.  <H5>  Develop Acceptable Stock Price Mechanism </H5>   One of the conclusions reached by this research committee is  that, "in Japan's stock market, a mechanism that will enable  stock prices to reflect the real economy has not been fully  established." To establish prices that conform to actual  conditions--for example, so that price levels will not be  determined by only relative relations between land and stock  prices or futures and spot prices--a market that will properly  evaluate stock price levels in relation to other economic  variables must be developed. As shown by the response to public  offerings of JR East Japan stock, investors have considerable  interest in and reserve funds to invest. There should be many  investors who want to invest in stocks if they find the price  mechanism acceptable.    Furthermore, as pointed out earlier in the section on  liberalization and transaction system changes, the securities  business sphere is expanding and development of new operations  is possible. On the other hand, however, the reassessment of  past operations is deemed to be necessary. For example, this  comment was heard recently. "In the sales of JR stock,  brokerages are paying for such expenses as the distribution of  applications out of their own pockets." Heretofore, dealings  that might be considered coercive were being transacted to  attain the quota; however, it appears that business was being  conducted loosely with the attitude that nothing more needed to  be done as long as the balance was in the black.    Presently, what the securities circle should do is not to  adopt a passive attitude of only awaiting the recovery of  corporate performance, but to draw blueprints of the future  stock market and translate them into actions which will make the  image a reality. In that event, we hope that this report will  serve as a reference.</p>

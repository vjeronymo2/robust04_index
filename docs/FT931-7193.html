			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Hong Kong and China Gas ahead 20% HONG KONG and China Gas, Hong Kong's monopoly gas supplier controlled by the Lee family's Henderson Investment, yesterday announced a 20 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 936m (USDollars 121m) in 1992, up from HKDollars 779m in the previous year. Earnings were boosted by 12 per cent growth in Towngas sales. The results were in line with expectations, but the share price reacted favourably to the announcement of a one-for-five bonus share issue. There was a 7 per cent increase in gas tariffs from the start of 1993, and Mr Lee Shau Kee, chairman, predicted an increase of 70,000 customers during the year and double-digit sales growth. The company's enlargement of its Tai Po plant will double capacity to more than 11m cubic metres.</p>

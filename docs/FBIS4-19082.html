			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, April 13 (AFP)--An extreme Greek nationalist  weekly called Wednesday [13 April] for the seizure of the  southern Albanian port of Sarande, situated opposite the Aegean  island of Corfu.    The publication, STOKHOS, hailed an attack launched Sunday  by  a nationalist commando on an Albanian Army barracks in which two  people were killed, sparking a diplomatic crisis between Tirana  and Athens.    It dismissed as a forgery a leaflet claiming the attack by a  Greek group calling itself the Northern Ipirus Liberation Front.    Northern Ipirus is the traditional name for southern  Albania,  which has a substantial Greek-speaking minority.    "We are going to take Sarande from them whatever they do  because we are stronger than they are and we have the law on our  side," the publication said.    STOKHOS, which has a 10,000 print run, also called on the  Greek Army to attack Skopje, capital of The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia, with whom Athens is in dispute over the  name of the country which is also that of its northern province.    Last month STOKHOS said that "self-defence groups" had been  formed in eight villages in southern Albania with large  Greek-speaking populations.    On Tuesday Albania asked the United Nations Security Council  to condemn the attack, which it said was launched by a "Greek  terrorist commando of six to seven persons" wearing Greek Army  uniforms. The commando attacked a barracks for new recruits  about four kilometers (2.5 miles) inside Albanian territory. A  sentry and captain were killed.    Albania recalled its ambassador to Athens for consultations  and expelled the Greek consul general from southern Gjirokaster  following the attack, sparking a tit-for-tat expulsion of an  Albanian diplomat from Athens.</p>

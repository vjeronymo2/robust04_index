			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond sales remain at near-record level Sales of rough (uncut) diamonds remain near record levels but the market is still in turmoil and cutters continue to complain about lack of profitability. That was the message yesterday from De Beers, the South African group whose London-based Central Selling Organisation accounts for at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough diamonds. The CSO said its sales reached USDollars 4.25bn (Pounds 2.59bn) this year, 2.7 per cent below the record set in 1993 but still the second-highest total ever achieved. Nevertheless, the CSO made it clear that all is not well in the market. It cited: 'Leakages' of high-quality diamonds from government stockpiles in Russia, in breach of the contract between Russia and the CSO, that are continuing from time to time and having a depressing effect on sentiment in the cutting centres. There are also uncertainties because the CSO's contract with the Russians ends in 1995 and negotiations about a new one have not been going well. A build up of stocks at the cutting centres, particularly of small polished stones from India. The CSO reduced its supply of small stones from the second quarter of this year but the raw material the Indian cutters need is plentiful following sales from Russian and US strategic stockpiles. These diamonds were considered suitable only for industrial use when they were stockpiled but the subsequent development of the Indian industry, which can cut small stones economically, means that many of the stockpiled diamonds are cutable. The CSO has not increased prices since February, 1993. That increase was of only 1 1/2 per cent and was the first since 1990. Producers with CSO contracts have been asked to cut deliveries from previously-agreed levels and the CSO said yesterday this quota would remain at 85 per cent. On the other hand, the CSO said sales of diamond jewellery had been resilient during recent difficult world trading conditions and retail diamond jewellery sales in 1994 were likely to match last year's record USDollars 42bn. It pointed out that supplies of cut diamonds from India had fallen substantially because of the recent outbreak of pneumonic plague, which started in Surat, a region that provides more than one third of India's cut diamonds. Some factories, deserted by frightened, fleeing workers, still had not reopened. 'Time will take care of the oversupply,' a CSO official insisted. Mr Michael Coulson, analyst with Nedcor Securities, suggested that the CSO's profit margins were being squeezed and he expected De Beers' 'diamond account' profits for 1994 to be down a little. However, De Beers' net profits, after other income was taken into account, were likely to be ahead of those for 1993. He said world diamond sales were likely only to 'inch ahead' in 1995 and he hoped the CSO would give up its policy of saturating the market in the first half. He predicted the Russians would sign a new contract with the CSO but on more favourable terms. De Beers also is convinced that Russia will stay in the diamond cartel. It recalled that Mr Harry Oppenheimer, former chairman of De Beers, said recently: 'Demand in the world for diamonds is stronger and more firmly established than it has ever been and co-operation between all the major producers is beyond doubt in the interests of them all.'</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Management: Untangled web reaps its reward - Why Coats took top prize for its published accounts 'You have to be comfortable in exposing yourself,' says Neville Bain, chief executive of UK-based textiles group Coats Viyella, with just a touch of smugness. Only a few years ago, the idea of Coats reaching the shortlist for, let alone winning, the annual Stock Exchange and Chartered Accountants award for published accounts would have been unthinkable. The company was more notorious for concealing information than revealing it. So for New Zealand-born Bain, and finance director Russell Walls - both appointed to their current positions in 1990 - the recent award is especially sweet. Bain's claim to have banished secrecy and opacity - barely a page in the winning report is free of reference to disclosure - will not necessarily convince the City sceptics. Helen James, textiles analyst at James Capel, remarks: 'It's sycophantic in the extreme. I'm not surprised they won after they put all that goody-goody rubbish in it.' But she also gives credit where it is due. 'There used to be about 200 reporting divisions so no one knew what was going on,' she says. The Coats conversion to Cadbury principles of corporate governance, environmental reporting and early adoption of the Accounting Standards Boards changes on financial statements - some of the items that caught the judges' eyes - has been a gradual process, even under the muscular new management team. The 1989 and 1990 reports, for example, were long on glossy photographs but still short on disclosure. In 1991, things began to look brighter. Bain had taken on a design consultancy, Merchant Corporate Design, and a slogan: 'The Colourful World of Coats Viyella'. Divisional reporting was clearer - much needed, given the spread over six business streams from fashion retail to precision engineering - and the company's executive structure was better explained. The most important innovation was a comprehensive financial review, partly to address speculation about the goodwill and fair value adjustments that accompanied Coats' successful contested bid for Tootal that year. The award-winning 1992 report built on these improvements and went a stage further. 'Our brief from Neville Bain was to produce a structured document that showed exactly how the divisions contributed to the whole, that showed the company was keen on disclosure, and a new emphasis on the importance of design and customer service,' says Catherine Samy, managing director of Merchant. Pages of advertisement-style photographs, accompanied by short texts, are designed to highlight aspects of Coats' closeness to the customer. The divisional reporting is crisper, and the financial review is clear and detailed. Richard Sykes QC and his panel appear to have been most impressed by Coats' obvious desire to conform with accounting best practice. Sykes warmly praised the 'full notes' on the introduction of the 1992 accounting standard FRS3 and the early adoption of FRED3, both of which affect the presentation of the results of UK companies. 'Coats Viyella's accounting change is to be applauded,' he said. Corporate governance had been 'dealt with very well' - with a full statement on the Cadbury report - as had the company's section on environmental policy. As Coats plunges into the production of its 1993 report - the report team does not write any 'filler' text before the figures are in - one question remains. Did Coats win because it has gone in four short years from being one of the most uninformative on the Stock Exchange to a model of disclosure  -or because it was simply the best? 'The report is very, very detailed,' says James. 'They have improved their presentation dramatically. But they are not particularly ahead of anybody else.' So one suspects that Coats' report is being rewarded for two things: most improved performance on disclosure, and a gorgeous cover.</p>

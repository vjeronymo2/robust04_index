			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Occhetto and Berlusconi Are in Favor </F> of Intervention"]    [Text] Rome -- The war in Bosnia is leading to strange  rapprochements. In fact, as regards the possibility of military  intervention in former Yugoslavia, [Democratic Party of the  Left] Secretary Occhetto has found himself holding a similar  position to that of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and the MSI  [Italian Social Movement], whereas Communist Renewal has  declared itself against armed intervention. Occhetto said he  was in no doubt that "we must intervene in Bosnia, and the  international community must take up an active position. We  cannot be helpless bystanders in witnessing such an atrocious  war." MSI Deputy Cristiana Muscardini also stated where her  party stood on this matter: "We have had enough words, enough of  war! We Italians, and all Europeans, have the duty to commit  ourselves resolutely so as to achieve a solution to the Bosnian  conflict." For Berlusconi, on the other hand, peacemaking  actions in Bosnia must be backed by military force, and Italy  must support, within the European Community, the "line of  determination," making available "its prestige and its military  bases" to this end. The only voice against armed intervention  was that of Communist Renewal member Ersilia Salvato, who stated  that her party was definitely against the use of force in former  Yugoslavia.</p>

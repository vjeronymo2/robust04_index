This was stated at a joint session of the Russian Ecology  and  Natural Resources Ministry collegium and republic State  Sanitation and Epidemiology Inspectorate. According to the  collegium's data, no territory in the Volga area has health and  hygiene and microbiological standards for the quality of  drinking water. The ecological situation has become most  unsatisfactory in the Cherepovtsy, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara,  Saratov, Volgograd, and Astrakhan industrial centers, where  there is a high level of pollution due to petroleum products,  phenols, and other compounds.</p>

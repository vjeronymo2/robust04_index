			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Industry heated over CFC ban International agreement to prevent damage to the ozone layer was hailed as one of the last decade's environmental successes. A further tightening of the rules is likely to result from a three-day meeting in Copenhagen, ending today, of the 93 countries which signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol. But the chemical industry argues that the new rules may be unrealistically tight by threatening to ban newly discovered substitutes and so jeopardising future investment. The thinning of the earth's protective ozone layer was detected in the late 1970s. The depletion has been linked partly to man-made chemicals - particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used widely in refrigeration, and halons, used in firefighting. The Copenhagen conference is likely to advance the date for their phasing out from 2000 to 1996. Reaction to the 1987 treaty was fast - the developed countries' consumption of CFCs and halons fell by some 30 per cent between 1986 and 1990. Mike Harris, external relations manager of ICI's fluorocarbons operation, expects that by 2000 half of the original CFC market will have gone to ammonia, propane and other existing chemicals, a sixth to HCFCs (20 to 50 times less damaging than CFCs but five to seven times more costly) and a third to HFCs, not implicated in ozone damage but claimed to contribute to global warming. The scale of that change in the market demanded rapid development by the producers. Since 1986, Du Pont has invested Dollars 450m (Pounds 300m) to develop replacements and expects that to reach Dollars 1bn by the end of 1995, when it plans to stop CFC production. It says CFCs accounted for only 1 per cent of its annual revenue of some Dollars 38bn, but it had to find a replacement as it could not afford to be out of the air-conditioning market. Du Pont expects the payback on the investment to take at least 10 years. ICI has spent some Pounds 260m since 1986, particularly on HFCs for car air-conditioning. It intends to phase out all Montreal Protocol-controlled chemicals by the end of 1995. Although Harris will not comment on the payback on that investment, he says it has made cashflow for the division negative. Given the scale of their investment, the companies oppose any control of HCFCs and HFCs. Tony Vogelsberg, Du Pont's environmental manager, says he does not expect international action yet against HFCs, but this could occur nationally through concern over global warming. 'We certainly regard our investment in CFC substitutes as being at risk. Society needs to be careful or it could block the solutions it is trying to find.' These arguments do not impress environmental groups. 'It's nonsense - there are non-damaging alternatives for all these products,' says Chris Rose of Greenpeace. The antagonism between environmental groups and chemical companies is one of the environmental debates' longest-established features. When chemical companies are coy about the return they expect on their investments, one should be sceptical of taking at face value their claims that incentives are not high enough. But the success of the five years of the Montreal Protocol has been based on the easy availability of substitutes; the trickiest points in Copenhagen have come where further substitutes are not available. The chemical companies' emphasis on the cost of developing alternatives is a useful reminder that change costs money.</p>

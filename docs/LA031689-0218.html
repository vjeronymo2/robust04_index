			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAXICARE FILES BANKRUPTCY PLEA, WILL SELL CALIF. HMO  </P> <P> Debt-ridden Maxicare Health Plans Inc., a major provider of health coverage  serving 1 million Americans in a dozen states, filed today in Santa Ana for  bankruptcy court protection and indicated that it will sell its HMO serving  California.  </P> <P> The company, which operates under the names Maxicare, HealthCare USA and  HealthAmerica, announced that it sought protection from its creditors under  Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> Maxicare promised to keep serving its patients and to continue paying doctors  and hospitals.  </P> <P> Included in the filing are the Los Angeles-based parent company and operations  in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, North Carolina,  Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Washington.  </P> <P> Maxicare, saddled by debt and generally tight times in the HMO business, has  been losing money for some time. In recent months it has sold a number of  health plans in various states in an avowed effort to pare down to a solid  "core" business.  </P> <P> However, in announcing the bankruptcy filing, Chairman Peter S. Ratican  revealed Maxicare was negotiating sale of the HMO serving California,  previously said to be part of the core.  </P> <P> In the first nine months of 1988, the company lost $250.5 million. Final 1988  results haven't been reported.  </P> <P> The company, burdened with debt that included, in December, $150 million in  bank loans and $295 million in bonds, has pinned its recovery hopes on paring  down to a "core" of solid businesses. As of Dec. 6, Maxicare had cut membership  from a high of 2.3 million to 1.4 million. Several plans in various states have  been sold this year, and in its announcement today, the company put membership  at 1 million.  </P></p>

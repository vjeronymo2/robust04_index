			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Labour reveals Railtrack sale plan The government plans to privatise Railtrack, which owns railway track, signalling and stations, with a stock market flotation early in 1996, according to leaked ministerial memos obtained by Labour, Charles Batchelor writes. The plan is expected to be announced tomorrow by Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary. One City estimate says Railtrack's privatisation would raise between Pounds 3.3bn and Pounds 4.3bn. Mr Mawhinney, in a letter to Mr John Major, the prime minister, says: 'We have agreed that, for internal planning purposes, our target date for flotation should be the first quarter of 1996, but that our public stance should be only that Railtrack will be floated during the life of this parliament.' In a separate letter, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, supports the target date. Mr Michael Meacher, Labour transport spokesman, said: 'Railtrack's privatisation will produce the money for the tax-cut bribes in the first quarter of 1996 in time for the next general election.'</p>

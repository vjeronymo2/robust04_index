			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   De Klerk, Pioneer -- Considered a "stolid apparatchik" when  he became leader of the National Party, De Klerk "slowly but  surely" "led his party to face up to true democracy," notes an  editorial in the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 3 May on  page 10. Still a president, about to become a deputy president,  in making that transition "and in making it the way he did, F.  W. de Klerk has secured a unique slot in history. He deserves,  especially at this moment of profound change, tribute for his  courage." "Most presidents are remembered for the manner of the  conduct of their presidency. Frederik Willem de Klerk will be  remembered above all for the manner of the laying down of his  presidency. His new role as deputy to his erstwhile captive will  automatically be historic. May it also be blessed with respect  and distinction."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   New Freedom -- "For Viljoen and the Freedom Front, the  election result is a double-edged sword," notes an editorial in  the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 3 May on page 8.  Although it "will be able to claim that several hundred thousand  people want a volkstaat [homeland], a closer look at voting  figures confirms the larger picture which always made the idea  an impossible dream in a post-apartheid South Africa." The  Front's "strongest showing is in areas like the Northern,  Eastern and the Northwestern Transvaal and the [Orange] Free  State -- areas where the ANC's own support mostly exceeds 75  percent." The results demonstrate that "volkstaaters exist  within tiny islands scattered around a multiracial country" and  the most Viljoen "can expect is that the so-called volkstaat  council" can be established "as a more or less permanent body"  that is "charged with looking after the cultural and linguistic  interests of those Afrikaners who seek that protection." If some  are dissatisfied with "this limited agenda," a "5 percent  grouping" "could not make much headway" against a "movement  representing 60 percent of the population."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Watershed Elections -- While the election bill is "more than  half the budget expected for housing," and could go higher, "it  was money well spent," concludes an editorial in Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 3 May on page 8. More good news about the  way the elections were conducted "is that every party and every  other commentator is complaining. They must have been, if not  entirely without hitches, at least quite fair." "We will look  back at the clumsy birth of democracy with great fondness" and  "many legends will come from this watershed in our history."  "The economy of South Africa will not only pick up after the  elections but we are likely to get fair amounts of investment  from the rest of the world" as the world's "enthusiasm has been  sparked by the peaceful way in which these elections were held."    Regional Leaders -- Most leaders set to become premiers of  the regions "are well-known people with good track records," a  second editorial of the 3 May SOWETAN notes. Toyko Sexwale is a  "well liked, well respected man who has the image, in more ways  than one, to lead the most important region in the country" --  the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. Popo Molefe, who  has been "a hard working man and mostly eschewed the glare of  the spotlight, justly deserves his election to lead the North  West Region." Matthew Phosa "is amply qualified to head the  Eastern Transvaal Region, and Terror Lekota is a natural for the  Free State." "Notwithstanding the fact there is a nagging fear  of an overblown governance for the future, the leaders will be  forced to assume a hands-on job with their communities, bringing  government closer to the people."</p>

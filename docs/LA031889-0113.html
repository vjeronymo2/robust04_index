			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANCIENT FESTIVAL OF PURIM IS A JOYOUS JEWISH OCCASION  </P> <P> The ancient festival of Purim, which commemorates the victory of an endangered  Jewish community over its Persian enemies, will be observed this weekend.  Generally, the occasion is accompanied by songs, dancing and special foods, and  the Book of Esther, also known as the Megillah, is read in temples and  synagogues.  </P> <P> In Jewish tradition, about 2,500 years ago, a man named Haman, who had just  become the chief adviser to Persia's King Ahasveros, was upset because  Mordecai, a leader of the Jewish community, had refused to bow down before him,  as decreed by the king to honor Haman's elevation. Notified of this, the king  declared that such disobedience deserved severe punishment, and Haman made  preparations to have all the Jews in the kingdom killed. He drew lots (Purim is  Hebrew for lots) to determine the day the Jews should be destroyed.  </P> <P> Fortunately for the Jews in Persia, the niece of Mordecai, whose name was  Esther, had just become the king's favorite wife. At the risk of her own life,  she revealed her ancestry and pleaded for the lives of her countrymen. The king  was moved, but according to law, a royal decree of that type could not be  countermanded. So the king issued another decree, giving the Jews permission to  defend themselves, and on the fatal day, Haman and his cohorts were defeated.  Haman himself ended up on the very gallows that he had built for Mordecai.  </P> <P> Today, Jewish girls dress up as Queen Esther, while boys take on the roles of  Mordecai or Ahasveros -- hardly anybody ever wants to play Haman. Women bake  Hamantaschen (Haman's Purses -- pastries filled with prunes or other fruit and  folded over to resemble Haman's hat). Children always look forward to the  rattling of groggers (noisemakers) whenever the name of Haman is mentioned  during the reading of the Purim story.  </P> <P> Because Purim has become one of the most joyful festivals on the Jewish  calendar, many places of worship and Jewish community centers are planning  festivities for children and adults.

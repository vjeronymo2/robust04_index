			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Article by Ye. Kalinicheva: "Only Mountain Summits Are More </F> Abrupt Than the Head of the City of Moscow"]    [Text]  <H5>  A. Chubays Versus Yu. Luzhkov </H5>   A modest press conference held by Anatoliy Chubays took  place  on Friday evening, 27 May, and was devoted to his differences  with Yuriy Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, concerning  privatization. By the way, that press conference extended  clearly beyond the framework of that issue. The discussion  concerned the fact that a new comet with a tail appeared in the  Russian firmament and it is impossible to know what to expect of  it. Chubays characterized the actions of the mayor of Moscow as  a game not played by the rules.    The chairman of the State Committee for the Administration  of  State Property declared that also in the past the well-financed  propaganda shows of the Moscow city chief, aimed against  progressive market reforms, appeared indecent for a man  declaring himself to be a fervent supporter of the president.  Now the situation has gone completely out of control and is  becoming catastrophic. Chubays directed the attention of the  journalists to the fact that every new step by the president and  the government aimed at deepening the reforms met with  opposition from the mayor of Moscow. The glory of a hero of the  October events and defender of democracy apparently introduced  new colors in the bright image of Luzhkov and granted him new  rights. Luzhkov believes that he has the right to correct laws,  presidential edicts, and government decrees. In that manner he  essentially halted the privatization of real property in Moscow,  and blocked the inclusion of land in the overall privatization  program. With a slight time shift after the presidential edicts  Yuriy Luzhkov proclaimed his decisions, which totally negated  presidential decisions.    The latest example of Luzhkov's independence is the  antiprivatization constitution, as Chubays called the Moscow  privatization program, and stressed that it is merely a  selection of unparalleled opportunities for arbitrary action by  officials in the capital. That was how Chubays put it and one  cannot deny him his eloquence.    Luzhkov, however, is no fool either. His actions it would  appear have an economic underpinning as well. For example he  announced that he could obtain one trillion rubles from Moscow  privatization, while the entire privatization campaign itself,  according to estimates by the Committee for the Administration  of State Property, is expected to yield a revenue of one  trillion rubles for the treasury. Moreover, Moscow authorities  reached the conclusion that privatized enterprises have economic  indices inferior to those of state enterprises. Studies by  sociologists hired by Luzhkov's people indicated that only six  out of a 1,000 directors of privatized enterprises can perform  the functions that were formerly handled by the ministries.  Luzhkov plans close alliances with producers. The alliance with  ZIL, with AZLK [Moscow Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant], and  with other Moscow giants can serve as an example of that.    Chubays rejected these assertions at the press conference.  Results of market research conducted by the State Committee for  the Administration of State Property indicated that the overall  investment demand in the country comes to 2.6 trillion [currency  not specified]. Half of these funds will go to the already  privatized enterprises. Only 15-20 percent will go into the  federal budget.    Society, yet another time, can see that figures argue with  each other just like people do. They are prejudiced and,  unfortunately, cannot serve as criteria of the truth.    Against the overall behavioral background of the city chief,  the fact that Luzhkov simply prohibited the registration of  joint-stock companies in Moscow appears to be a minor matter. By  April the Moscow State Committee for the Administration of State  Property blocked the privatization of all state property within  their jurisdiction. Privatization in Moscow is carried out only  with the permission of federal authorities. Luzhkov received  good support from the Russian Federation Committee on Land  Resources and Land Management and an extensive Moscow  officialdom that certainly does not wish to live under rules  written by another hand. The power of Moscow officialdom is  greater than the power of law.    According to Anatoliy Chubays a social explosion may occur  in  Moscow, the responsibility for which will rest squarely on the  conscience of Yuriy Luzhkov.    By the way, Anatoliy Chubays did not limit himself to the  press conference, but also wrote a letter to Chernomyrdin, the  prime minister, and to President Yeltsin describing his position  with regard to Luzhkov. According to Chubays the letter to the  premier was well received and Luzhkov was given three days to  make corrections. Chubays, however, according to his statement,  also sent a letter to the procurator general of the Russian  Federation demanding that order be established and lawlessness  eliminated in Moscow.</p>

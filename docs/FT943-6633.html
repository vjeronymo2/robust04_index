			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When a wife must work from home My wife is a market research supervisor and uses one room of our flat wholly for work purposes. When completing her 1994/95 tax return, I claimed one-third of the council tax as an expense against her 1993/94 research earnings. But the inspector will not allow the claim and says a deduction can be made only for heating the room. Similarly, he will not allow any expenses against telephone rental despite the fact that much of her time is spent ringing people. (The cost of the calls is paid by her employer). Is the inspector correct? The inspector appears to be right on the second point but might be wrong on the first one. We cannot say more than this on the basis of the limited data you have given us. Your wife should ask the inspector how he reconciles the proposed disallowance of the proportionate council tax with paragraph 9 of the Revenue press release of March 16 1993 entitled 'Council tax - income tax and corporation tax implications.' This covers employees who are required to work at home, and says: 'The duties of an employment may require an employee to work at home in circumstances in which a deduction may be claimed for a proportion of domestic expenses such as lighting, heating and cleaning. In such cases, a room may be used exclusively for work purposes. In these cases, employees may be due a deduction against their income for a proportion of the council tax.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Laird bucks sector trend with 43% rise to Pounds 21m LAIRD GROUP, the car components and industrial products company, has defied the trends of a globally depressed automotive market to report a 43 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 20.5m. Sales for the half year ended June 30 rose a more modest 15 per cent to Pounds 295m. The results came in slightly better than analysts had been expecting, and the shares rose 9p to close at 266p. Laird, which has spent three years investing heavily in plant and expansion, benefited from the introduction of the new Volkswagen Golf and Vauxhall Astra models last year. The group helped to develop and now supplies the systems for sealing windows and doors on these models. Operating profits in the sealing systems division, which supplies car manufacturers mainly in Germany and France, more than doubled from last year's depressed levels to Pounds 13.7m. The return was buoyed by the absence of last year's Pounds 2m first half start-up costs relating to the new model systems, and a return to the double digit margins achieved in 1989. Last year margins had fallen to about 7 per cent. Mr Charles Barton, finance director, said that although car sales in Germany were declining from the high levels of 1991, production at this stage appeared to be holding firm. Laird continued to invest in new models, although the finance director said the group's current projects did not include vehicles with the high volumes of the Astra or Golf. Laird's plastics distribution and packaging business, which operates mainly in the US, proved a disappointment with profits tumbling 34 per cent to Pounds 3.5m. Mr Barton said there was no sign of an easing in the difficult economic conditions in the US. However, the small Scottish company which provides products and services to the UK computer industry achieved higher profits in the first half. The industrial products operation, which supplies plastic and rubber vehicle components, increased operating profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 7.1m. The interim dividend is being increased to 4.2p (4p). Earnings per share, after adjusting for the bonus element of the Pounds 41m 1-for-5 rights issue last April, rose from 8.3p to 11.7p. See Lex</p>

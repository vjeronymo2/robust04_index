			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> WEST GERMAN CAPTURES UPSET GOLD IN DOWNHILL  </P> <P> Hansjoerg Tauscher of West Germany, a non-winner in three seasons on the World  Cup circuit, won the gold medal in the weather-delayed men's downhill today at  the World Alpine Ski Championships.  </P> <P> Tauscher, 21, continuing a tradition of unexpected finishes in World  Championship competition, was timed in 2 minutes, 10.39 seconds.  </P> <P> Switzerland's Peter Mueller, the defending world champion in the downhill and a  favorite in this race, finished 19-hundredths of a second back at 2:10.58 to  take the silver medal, and Swiss teammate Karl Alpiger won the bronze in  2:10.67.  </P> <P> Swiss skiers claimed the next two places as well, with Daniel Mahrer finishing  fourth in 2:10.91 and William Besse fifth in 2:10.94.  </P> <P> Two other favorites, Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg and Pirmin Zurbriggen of  Switzerland, finished out of the top 10.  </P> <P> Tauscher's best previous finish in a World Cup race was fifth in a downhill at  Laax, Switzerland, on Jan. 6.  </P> <P> No one expected Tauscher's gold-medal breakthrough today. He had finished no  higher than sixth in any of the four training runs.  </P> <P> The race, originally scheduled for Saturday, was postponed when three feet of  snow inundated Beaver Creek. Earlier, high winds interrupted training and  contributed to a crash by Zurbriggen, leaving him with a bruised upper back and  bruised ribs.  </P> <P> Crews managed to clear the course of most of the fresh snow, but today's  winning time was about two seconds slower than early training times on a  harder, icier surface.  </P> <P> Mahrer, with what was considered a disadvantageous start number (2) because  early racers had to plow through more loose snow, posted a quick time that  stood up until Tauscher, with bib No. 9, came down.  </P> <P> Tauscher was a full second behind Mahrer at the second intermediate clocking  but had narrowed the gap to two-hundredths at the fourth intermediate, then  made up the difference on the bottom part, which featured numerous bumps and  rolls and some tight turns.  </P> <P> Mueller, running 11th, and Zurbriggen, starting 15th, could not catch him,  although Mueller was slightly faster through the fourth intermediate clocking.  </P> <P> Unofficially, Norway's Atle Skaardal placed sixth in 2:10.99, followed by three  Austrians: Helmut Hoeflehner in 2:11.24, Peter Wirnsberger in 2:11.52 and Roman  Rupp in 2:11.60.  </P></p>

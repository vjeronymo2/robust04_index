Along with the two diplomats, about 1,000 others are also  being held hostage at the palace. Some 700 of these people are  employees of various government ministries that have offices in  the palace, and the rest were people visiting the various  offices. The Chilean and Paraguayan ambassadors were at the  Guatemalan Foreign Ministry, which is housed on the first floor  of the Government Palace, when the siege began. [passage omitted]</p>

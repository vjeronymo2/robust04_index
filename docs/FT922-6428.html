			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Arts: A new game show - Off the wall IN DAYS gone by if you wandered into Sotheby's in Bond Street wanting to pop an antique worth less than Pounds 1,000 you were politely directed towards more mundane auction houses. That has all changed. Next Wednesday bids of Pounds 500 or less might well capture a Chinese vase or a Persian rug in Sotheby's first 'Arcade' sale of oriental art. The saleroom has gone suddenly and dramatically down market. The traditional view at Sotheby's was that if it had to handle run-of-the-mill antiques it should be done decently away from central London. Eighteen months ago it announced plans to build a vast new auction house within dealer distance of Heathrow. At the same time it was to close down its provincial outposts at Chester and Billingshurst. This seemed a sensible compromise. In its ideal world Sotheby's would concentrate on bringing in over Pounds 100m an hour selling Van Goghs and Renoirs to the Japanese. But now there have been second thoughts. Sotheby's profits have disappeared as rapidly as the Japanese collectors and there is no relish for a big property investment. Billingshurst has been reprieved and specialist sales are to reappear at Bond Street aimed at the modestly rich who might contemplate collecting Islamic pots, or silver, or watercolours in the Pounds 250-Pounds 2,500 price range. We have been here before. A few years ago Sotheby's tempted Yuppies with evening sales of decorative antiques to furnish a Fulham terrace house or a Kent cottage. They never caught on. But a research survey of 10,000 of its customers has convinced Sotheby's that it must shake off its elitist image and try and nurture the younger, less affluent, buyers, some of whom in time might become rich collectors. The 'Arcade' auctions mean that Sotheby's will process another 10,000 lots a year which might eventually contribute Pounds 20m to turnover. Not only will the new auctions be attractive to dealers, currently keen to sell off surplus stock at auction to pay off their bank loans, but the promise of payment within six weeks of offering antiques for sale makes Sotheby's an attractive alternative to the pawnbroker. The new approach is the work of Roger Faxon who came from New York last October to run Sotheby's Europe. Another of his initiatives surfaced last week when anyone watching Super Channel on May 15 would have seen a Sotheby's auction of the Applied Arts televised live, with an off the rostrum commentary by David Battie. This was not just cheap television, or a PR boost for Sotheby's, but a glimpse into the future. Within ten years, only a few diehards will actually attend an auction. Potential buyers will follow the action on television and bid from home. Indeed last week a German viewer was so taken by a 19th century bronze that he phoned through a successful bid. Of course he was not a total stranger to Sotheby's. You have to have an approved credit rating before you can join in this new game show. The British Museum has a pleasant problem - what to do with the space to be vacated by the British Library as it starts its slow move to its new Pounds 400m home on the Euston Road? The Library actually absorbs 40 per cent of the Museum, including its most architecturally famed hub, the Reading Room. The Reading Room's eventual re-incarnation is still the subject of dispute, but on Thursday a deal was signed which allows the Museum to start re-developing some BL offices. The Korean Foundation has come up with Pounds 1.2m which will finance the British Museum's first Korean gallery in the vacated space. The Foundation is funded by the Korean Government to spread the nation's culture and this is its first donation. The deal is the latest in a succession of coups which has enabled the BM to completely refurbish its holdings of Asian art. The first was for a Japanese gallery, paid for with Pounds 5m mainly contributed by Japanese companies and institutions. In the autumn the new oriental gallery will re-open. Stretching 110 metres it will be the longest single gallery in the UK. It has cost Pounds 3.2m to refurbish, of which Pounds 2m came from the Hong Kong businessman, Joseph Hotung. The gallery embraces both Chinese and Indian art and culminates in a specially constructed air conditioned section to house the Amaravati marbles from a Buddhist temple near Madras, in their way as striking as the Elgin marbles. The British Museum has been able to tap the growing prosperity of Asia. It will be less easy to find the money to renovate its galleries of Western art. Its immediate task is to find Pounds 3m to transform the other great space soon to return to its control, the magnificent King's Library. Mary Allen is to be the new deputy director of the Arts Council, replacing Margaret Hyde who stuck the job for only a year. Mary Allen, who comes from running the Waterman's Arts Centre, should have a longer stay - David Mellor willing. The attitude of the new Minister of the National Heritage to the Arts Council is unpredictable. On one hand he is opposed to a Quango which takes some of the funding decisions that he likes to exercise: this suggests the Council's role will be down graded. On the other hand Mellor is a centralist and needs the Council to fund those arts companies that are now less likely to be devolved to the care of Regional Arts Boards. Everything might turn on the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Mellor used to be on its board and has always nurtured it. The LPO does not want to be delegated to the London Arts Board. If Mellor backs its intransigence, other large arts organisations will also be reprieved, and the Arts Council, and Mary Allen, will continue to have a job.</p>

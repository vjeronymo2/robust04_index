			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> READY MONEY: The heyday of easy capital for high-tech industries is over, but  that doesn't mean capital isn't available, says Newport Beach investment banker  Gregory E. Presson (D6). . . . With 20 to 30 well-connected venture capital  firms here, "there is an enormous amount of venture capital available in Orange  County that wasn't available 10 years ago," he says. "A lot of the high-tech  companies here . . . haven't scored as well as Silicon Valley's high-tech  firms, but in fairness they haven't been around as long."

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Asia's capital of deprivation seeks the capital of hope - After decades of economic decline, Marxist-run Calcutta is trying to attract foreign investors CALCUTTA, with its dirt, decay and human deprivation, breeds a gritty sense of determination. Thus there was little surprise that the city's businessmen went ahead this month with their first international trade fair despite the turmoil of the Ayodhya crisis. Officials of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry freely admit crumbling roads and buildings, crowds, noise and pollution make Calcutta one of the world's least attractive cities for first-time visitors. As they say in a report, any newcomer 'would be psychologically put off immediately and decide to leave the city as quickly as possible'. Nor are business visitors likely to be encouraged by the frequent power cuts or the grim posters of Marx, Lenin and Stalin put up by supporters of West Bengal's Communist-led government. The fair's organisers pressed on with the event despite the violence which hit the city following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. They took comfort from the fact that the riots in Calcutta were relatively small, causing 43 deaths compared with hundreds in Bombay. The fair, which ended this week, attracted 2,000 business visitors, less than the original target of 3,000 but enough to justify holding the event and to prompt the chamber to consider making it an annual event. Mr Pradip Dasgupta, the chamber's secretary, says: 'In the prevailing circumstances, it has been very satisfactory. We got 1,000 enquiries.' It will take time for such enquiries to turn into firm orders let alone into decisions to invest in the city. Nevertheless, after decades of economic decline, Calcutta is trying to stop the rot. Encouraged by the national government's free-market oriented reforms, even West Bengal's Marxists have been persuaded to embrace capitalism. Mr Jyoti Basu, the Marxist chief minister who has been in power since 1977, says that the capitalism he once fought no longer exists: 'We welcome business.' Unfortunately, business has so far been less than fulsome in its response. The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, a state economic agency, proudly lists 254 investment plans filed by entrepreneurs since the central government announced economic liberalisation in July 1991. The agency claims that the investments total Rs53bn (Pounds 1.2bn) and would generate 63,482 jobs. The list is headed by a Rs32bn scheme for a petrochemicals complex at Haldia, a greenfield site near Calcutta, to be built by West Bengal state in partnership with the Tata group, India's largest private conglomerate. Other large schemes include a Rs7.5bn pig iron plant proposed by S K Birla, a leading Calcutta group, and a Rs3.9bn plastics factory to be built by Reliance, a textiles and chemicals group. Construction work on the Haldia project, which was first mooted long before the 1991 economic reforms, is due to start this year, about 12 months later than planned. But it is not yet clear when some of the other large schemes will be realised. Most of the investments are modest; for example, the expansion and small-scale modernisation of forging, steelmaking and engineering industries, all long-established in Bengal. Foreign investment is also of limited scale, such as a Rs300m factory for refractory bricks used in steel-making to be built this year by Vesuvius, a subsidiary of Cookson, the UK chemicals maker. The reluctance of businessmen is easily understood. Calcuttans long accepted the city's decline as the result of the burdens imposed by floods, and of refugees from war and natural disasters. Mr Basu's state government tried to fight poverty as it thought best, but its efforts compounded Calcutta's difficulties by promoting over-powerful trade unions and alienating business. To make matters worse, India's ruling Congress (I) party felt little inclination to divert state investments to West Bengal. Calcutta's industrial groups kept their head offices in the city, but new investments have mostly gone into other parts of India. According to the Chamber of Commerce, industrial investment in West Bengal, which grew at an annual rate of 9 per cent as late as the mid-1960s, was shrinking by 0.5 per cent in the mid-1980s. Factories, roads and sewers crumble through lack of investment, and a choking smog permeates the air. What was once the richest city in Asia has become a monument to urban poverty. It will take time to overcome the effects of years of stagnation. Top of many businessmen's concerns is the state's acute shortage of electricity since power cuts occur daily. Similarly, although the city's roads and public services were the envy of India as late as the mid-1960s, the long years of neglect have taken their toll. Calcuttan businessmen have to think hard to come up with some advantages to match the city's manifest disadvantages. They talk of the high skill levels of Bengali workers and are proud of the city's historical international commercial links, especially with Britain. But, as Mr Biji Kurien, president of the chamber of commerce, says: 'It is hard to sell Calcutta and even harder when other cities in India are also trying to attract investment.'</p>

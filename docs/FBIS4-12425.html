			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Mr. Clinton! Who Are the Enemies </F> of Peace in Palestine?"]    [Text] We should not permit the enemies of peace to be  victorious! This was a remark by U.S. President Clinton at the  conclusion of his talks with the prime minister of the Israeli  regime at the White House.    Regardless of the fact that, in itself, this remark is quite  correct and logical and, in practice, one should prevent the  enemies of peace from becoming victorious in Palestine, one must  first see who are the "enemies of peace."    These enemies of peace are none other than the Zionists and  their supporters. It has become clear to world public opinion  today that the debacle of the slaughter of the Muslims in  al-Khalil [Hebron] did not take place without the direct support  of the Israeli armed forces. The Israeli press and Western  supporters have also admitted this fact.    The slaughter of fasting Muslim worshipers who were  prostrate  in the mosque of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) has ripped  the mask from the visage of the true enemies of Islam and  revealed their repulsive faces. Are the enemies of peace anyone  other than those who for many years have usurped the first  qiblah [direction in which Muslims say their prayers] of the  Muslims and kill the Muslim youth residing in those areas every  day?    The U.S. President, who is a champion of human rights,  ignores all these crimes and shamelessly alleges that PLO  leaders should not permit incidents such as the al-Khalil  [Hebron] carnage to hinder progress toward peace and not expect  greater concessions from Israel for resumption of talks!    Is support of a criminal not tantamount to being an  accomplice? The United States is as much responsible for the  shedding of the blood of innocent Muslims in Palestine as Israel  is, as it not only prevents their condemnation at international  forums but encourages this terrorist regime by various kinds of  economic and political assistance.    After many years of psychological war and adverse propaganda  against those they describe as "enemies of peace," the United  States and Israel should note that such opinions will not in any  way affect the determination of the Palestinian Muslims all over  Palestine for the liberation of dear Jerusalem.    Clinton should realize that the era of such efforts to  deceive the people has ended. How is it possible that the  greatest criminals in history and their supporters speak of  peace and consider themselves peace-seekers? The day is not too  far away when the true enemies of peace, security, and freedom  will face a disgraceful defeat.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Brazil's beached playboy bows out: Collor fails to evade impeachment THE VOTE by Brazil's Senate last night to press on with the impeachment of President Fernando Collor de Mello, following hard on the heels of his resignation, brings to an end the Dallas-style saga of greed and family feuding that has paralysed the world's ninth largest economy. Mr Collor, Brazil's first directly elected president for 30 years, had been suspended from office since September when Congress voted to authorise his impeachment over corruption charges brought to light by Mr Collor's jealous younger brother. Originally hoping to enter the history books for his 'modernisation revolution', Mr Collor now joins the sorry ranks of Brazilian presidents who, through suicide, coup, or death, have failed to complete their mandates  -only one civilian president in the last 67 years had lasted a full term. But his attempt at avoiding the humiliation of becoming the world's first impeached president by resigning on the day of his judgment failed, and with it his last hopes disappeared of being able to salvage what once seemed the most promising political career in Latin America. That had seemed like a long shot. Mr Collor still faces criminal charges and, although Brazilians do not expect high standards of morality from politicians they are deeply resentful that while he was preaching austerity amid the worst recession in a decade he was arranging a Dollars 2.5m landscaping of his gardens, apparently on a pre-tax salary of around Dollars 22,000 but allegedly paid for with the proceeds of a multi-million dollar kickback scheme. Now spending his days reading books on mind control in a shabby library surrounded by mementoes from the presidency, Mr Collor is left to contemplate his folly. Only two years ago he seemed to have everything going for him. A political unknown from Alagoas, one of Brazil's most backward north-eastern states, he won the 1989 elections without any party backing on the banner of modernisation and clean government. The glamorous former playboy quickly caught world attention with his love of dangerous sports, free market rhetoric and daredevil acts such as freezing 80 per cent of the nation's bank accounts on his first day in office. Never afraid to tackle vested interests, Mr Collor did introduce important changes. He began opening up one of the world's most protected economies, started privatising state companies and introduced words such as productivity, competitiveness and quality into the businessman's lexicon. But behind the modern facade, the Mont Blanc pens and Hermes ties, his ways of working were pure Alagoas. His alleged front man was said to be busy accepting kickbacks from the very businessmen Mr Collor was attacking, and so arrogant were those running the scam they kept details on computer disk. Mr Collor's two economic plans failed to reduce inflation and his imperial style meant no one was sorry to see him under fire. It must now be asked whether his demise spells the end of the modernisation programme. His successor, Mr Itamar Franco, has already suspended the privatisation programme. Mr Alexandre de Barros, a Brasilia-based risk consultant, warns: 'These guys are disorganising the economy at a fantastic rate. All the bad signs are there but people just don't want to believe them.' With monthly inflation now pushing 30 per cent, the economy is expected to worsen. In the meantime Mr Collor, who has continually denied the charges, will be watching and waiting, portraying himself as a victim of the interests he challenged and taking advantage of the short memories of Brazilians in hoping that by the next elections in 1994 he will be regarded as a hero.</p>

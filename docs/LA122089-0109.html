Authorities initially thought the man was one of the  bodyguards slain during a gun battle with police at a coastal ranch. But Luz  Mary Celades, the wife of Rodriguez Gacha, identified the body as that of  Gilberto Rendon Hurtado, reportedly the No. 8 man in the cartel. Rendon Hurtado  was wanted for extradition to the United States, but he was not on the  so-called dirty dozen list of top drug traffickers wanted by the U.S.  </P></p>

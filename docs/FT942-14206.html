			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Eastern Europe on show More than 1,000 exhibitors from more than 20 countries will gather in London's Earls Court next month for the first Central and Eastern European Technology and Investment Exhibition (Ceetex)*. The trade exhibition will be the first large-scale showcase of technology, investment and joint-venture opportunities in former Soviet Union countries, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Hungary. Main industries represented will include oil and gas, aviation and space, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, and machine building. Other stands will be devoted to areas where eastern expertise is less developed, for example white goods and consumer durables. Some exhibitors will be hoping to arrange sales directly to the west, says Michael Summers, managing director of the exhibition's organisers, Stirling Publishing. 'Others will be demonstrating what they presently produce with a view to forging links with western businesses who can then move into their part of the world - it's a two-way process.' One of the pavilions at the exhibition, containing 30-40 stands, will be for western companies already involved, or looking for involvement in central and eastern Europe. These include AEG, Saab Scania, Rank Xerox, Ford, Lufthansa and Amoco. Almost half of the stands will be taken by Russian exhibitors, many of whom will never have exhibited in the west. Stirling held seminars in Moscow on how to produce brochures, display material, and even advice on appropriate dress. The event, which is expected to draw 10,000-15,000 visitors, is being supported by two EU programmes, Phare and Tacis, which are designed to help the move from centrally-planned to market economies in central and eastern Europe. *Ceetex, 9-12 May, Earls Court.

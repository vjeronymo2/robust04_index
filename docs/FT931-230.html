			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Boost in business property market CONFIDENCE IN the commercial property market has risen markedly, according to a survey of property lenders. Nearly three quarters of the 69 banks and financial institutions questioned by Chesterton Financial, the chartered surveyor, expect an improvement in the market during the next year. Last July, by contrast, fewer than half the bankers polled expected a recovery over the following 12 months. The recovery is thought unlikely to take hold until the autumn. Only 22 per cent of respondents see an improvement in the next six months. Lenders were more optimistic about an improvement in the market than at any time since the survey was started in July 1991. But most property lenders report growing problems with bad debts. A majority expect the number of receiverships to rise over the next six months. The Association of Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce yesterday criticised the Association of British Insurers and the Department of Trade and Industry for their response to providing cover for terrorist damage. Ms Liz Taylor, who chairs the risk managers, said Pool Re, the terrorist damage insurance pool, had been devised without consultation with clients or brokers. 'Pool Re has been hastily conceived with considerable government strictures,' she said, adding that the managing director had few resources to assist his work. But she called for support of Pool Re and warned that it might otherwise founder. Chesterton Financial/CSW Confidence Barometer. Chesterton Financial Services, 54 Brook St, London W1. Free</p>

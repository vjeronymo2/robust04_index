			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Books: Killer king of the Khmer Rouge - The secretive life of communist despot Pol Pot BROTHER NUMBER ONE: A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY OF POL POT by David Chandler Westview Press Pounds 16.95, 254 pages AS A schoolboy, he played the violin and was moderately good at basketball and soccer. As a teacher, he was liked by his pupils. He impressed them with his gentle, musical style of speaking French. 'He was clearly drawn to French literature in general and poetry in particular - Rimbaud, Verlaine, de Vigny,' one of them recalled. Later he seized power in Cambodia and presided over the deaths of more than one million of his fellow citizens in one of the most brutal revolutions in history; one in seven Cambodians died. Such is Pol Pot, the enigmatic Khmer Rouge leader and former teacher, whose real name is Saloth Sar. David Chandler is the most scholarly writer on present-day Cambodia, but two years ago he ended his previous book (The Tragedy of Cambodian History) with the baffling conclusion that the curtain had fallen on the careers of both Pol Pot and Prince Sihanouk. 'The times transformed these heroes, without their knowing it, into those left behind by the tragedy and therefore, in a sense, into clowns,' he wrote. The wrongness of this earlier assertion makes Chandler's new biography of Pol Pot all the more welcome. Khmer Rouge guerrillas loyal to Pol Pot are making a mockery of the 1991 Paris peace accords signed by the main Cambodian factions (including the Khmer Rouge). They are flouting the ceasefire, refusing United Nations forces access to their territory and in some cases shooting at UN helicopters. Khieu Samphan is nominally the Khmer Rouge leader, but the 64-year-old Pol Pot is still believed to be running the organisation from his headquarters on the Thai border with a view to taking power again. Prince Sihanouk, meanwhile, wants control of whatever government emerges after the UN-sponsored elections in May, believing that he is best placed to unite his country and reconcile the rival political factions. A biography of the loquacious prince would have been much easier to write. Pol Pot, a dedicated communist untouched by glasnost, has made a habit of secrecy. He was identified as Saloth Sar by Cambodia-watchers only when he made a state visit to China in 1977 - two years after the Khmer Rouge takeover - and he casually admitted his real name only after being overthrown by the Vietnamese invasion in 1979. Yet it is the very scarcity of readily available information that makes it fascinating to follow, with the sleuthing Chandler, the development of this 'sweet-tempered, equable child' into a man demonised the world over as the overseer of Cambodia's killing fields. For the general reader, leafing through Brother Number One is also a more palatable way of absorbing Cambodia's complicated history than digesting Chandler's earlier and longer historical work. We glimpse - or think we glimpse - Saloth Sar, whose cousin was attached to the royal ballet, hanging around the palace compound as a child in Phnom Penh. We see him taught at French colonial schools and we watch him leave by ship with the privileged few for further education in Paris. In France he apparently joined the French communist party, and was certainly caught up in the excitement of student politics and the post-war debate about leftism. There was nothing very remarkable about that, or about his poor academic performance. After returning to Cambodia and becoming a teacher in the 1950s, he was apparently never questioned by the police. He never spent a night in jail. Chandler (a former US diplomat) says the US embassy had no biographical information on him, although it had files on hundreds of suspected communists. What was remarkable was Saloth Sar's will to power. In secret he worked his way up through the ranks of the local, Vietnamese-sponsored communist movement, and went into hiding in the bush in 1963. Twelve years later, helped by the chaotic finale to the Vietnam war and the American withdrawal from Indochina, Khmer Rouge guerrillas captured Phnom Penh and Pol Pot emerged at the head of the Cambodian revolution. There followed the notorious killings, the evacuation of the cities, the abolition of money, the Stalinist purges and the growth of Pol Pot's antagonism towards his former Vietnamese patrons, culminating in the Vietnamese invasion of 1978-79 and the return of the Khmer Rouge to guerrilla warfare. The problems of constructing a biography out of such flimsy material - an anecdote here, a leaked communist party document there - are obvious, and Chandler, forced to speculate, is often reduced to such phrases as 'It is easy to imagine . . .' But Chandler is not one to leap lightly to conclusions, and he is the first to confess that the question of what motivates Pol Pot, what drives him on, has yet to be answered. 'Perhaps,' Chandler writes, 'as he sits at night in his clearing in the forest, he has a faint perception (or a bleak, horrifying vision) of the suffering he has inflicted. Perhaps he does not.' Even a couple of hours of discussion with Pol Pot himself would have helped, but Pol Pot has not been available for interviews. Until he is, this book is likely to be the best and most comprehensive biography of him - and one of the best introductions to Cambodia's tragic history - that we are going to get.</p>

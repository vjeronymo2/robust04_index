			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / People: Southern increases geographical base Eight months after an internal reorganisation at NatWest Markets, Garry Southern, managing director of international development, is moving across to Standard Chartered Markets into the newly created position of chief executive of the capital markets division. Southern will assume responsibility for debt capital markets and derivatives business worldwide. The bank's focus on Asia meshes well with Southern's love of the region and he claims to have become tired of the 'basis point business' that characterises mature capital markets. His is the most senior appointment made to date by John McFarlane, who heads Standard Chartered Markets. McFarlane, who joined from Citibank 18 months ago, has had to spend much of his time reorganising the Asian operation in the aftermath of a series of scandals, notably in Bombay and Hong Kong. Brought up in South Africa, Southern, who has just turned 50, began his professional life in London as a barrister. He quickly moved into the Euromarkets - on the advice of his cousin Alastair Morton, (now Sir Alastair and running Eurotunnel). In the 1970s he worked for the consortium bank Rothschild Intercontinental specialising in Asian project finance before moving to Manufacturers Hanover where he ran the North American banking operation, principally concentrating on derivatives. He joined what was then County NatWest in New York in 1986; he moved to London in 1989, and headed the capital markets operation until April 1994. Having arrived at County NatWest around the time of the Blue Arrow affair, he will probably not be unduly put off by Standard Chartered's difficulties. 'Either you join a firm that is running like a Rolls-Royce or you join one that has enormous potential,' is his view.</p>

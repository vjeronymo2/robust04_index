			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] The attorney general of the Republic and the  finance minister have commented on the ruling issued by the 3d  Court for Tax Issues and agreed it does not invalidate the  collection of the value-added tax [IVA]. Instead, it urges the  Executive Branch to better publicize the law.    [Begin recording] [Attorney General Ricardo Ernst Contreras]  The law is still in effect. A court ruling in connection with a  request submitted by anyone does not derogate a law. Laws are  only derogated by other laws. Laws are also derogated when  someone submits an appeal for annulment because the law violates  the constitution -- and the appeal has sufficient grounds. This  can involve the whole law or some of its provisions.    Also, a law can be rescinded in connection with a given  process because one of the interested parties claims the law  violates the Constitution. However, the ruling issued by such a  court in connection with such an appeal obviously cannot  derogate a law. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

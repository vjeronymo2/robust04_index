			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Mandarins turn their attention to a question of cash: Economists are divided over ways of monitoring money supply WITH Britain likely to be in no hurry to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism, Treasury mandarins will be working overtime this week answering an important question: what is the best way of monitoring the money supply? Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, gave a clear hint yesterday that the supply of money - an important indicator of demand and inflationary pressures - would have a bigger role in determining the direction of base rates, which many politicians and industrialists would like to see brought down quickly from 10 per cent. The chancellor's comments will be both a relief and a challenge to monetarist economists. While many have been angered by the progressively smaller importance accorded to monetary targeting during the late 1980s, they also find it difficult to agree on precisely which measure of the money supply provides the best method of monitoring demand. Professor Patrick Minford, a monetarist economist at Liverpool University and long-time opponent of the ERM, said Britain should make M0 - a narrow measure of money, which mainly comprises notes and coins in circulation, the best known form of 'ready money' - the centrepiece of its targeting policy. Prof Minford believes demand is so weak that Britain could safely cut base rates to as little as 4 per cent without causing the pound to drift too low or triggering an unpalatable rise in inflation. In the opposing camp are other monetarists, including Professor Tim Congdon, economic adviser to discount house Gerrard &amp; National, who says greater weight should be given to targeting broad measures of the money supply. Such measures comprise not only cash in circulation but monetary deposits. Those can be drawn on for purchasing goods and services, and so provide an additional representation of demand. Of those measures, the best known is M4, which is cash in circulation plus sterling deposits in banks and building societies. Somewhere between devotees of 'broad' and 'narrow' money are economists including Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, the investment house. Mr Spencer favours an eclectic measure of money which he calls 'divisia money'. It accounts for cash together with monetary deposits in banks and other institutions, with the amount of money in the deposits given a 'weight', depending on the degree to which they represent ready money as opposed to funds being kept to gain interest. Under Mr Spencer's system, for example, current accounts in banks - which many people draw on virtually all the time for purchases and so have a big effect on the rest of the economy - would be given a weight of close to 100 per cent. Many kinds of savings deposits, on the other hand, would be given a zero weighting because the owners of such money have little or no imminent intention of releasing it into wider circulation. In the early 1980s, Britain used a range of methods to target the money supply. Sir Terry Burns, formerly the government's chief economic adviser, who is now Treasury permanent secretary, was brought into Whitehall in 1980 primarily because he favoured monetary targeting. But since the mid 1980s, monetary targeting has become a much less important part of UK economic policymaking, with the Treasury switching instead after ERM entry nearly two years ago to a full-blown method of targeting the exchange rate. The Treasury still formally targets M0, saying it should ideally be growing at between zero and 4 per cent a year to keep the economy ticking over at optimum level. In the year to the end of August, M0 grew 2.4 per cent, indicating a continuation of a slack economy. However, the Bank of England has always been sceptical about the value of M0 and has been more keen on broad-money targeting. One UK official said recently that M0 targeting had little practical relevance to steering the economy and had been kept mainly 'for presentational reasons'. Assuming the Treasury can agree with the Bank precisely which monetary measures to target, it will then probably try to decide on the target range, a far from easy job. It was the continual need to revise money targets - because of problems in working out the link between specific measures of the money supply and inflation - that led Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, in the mid 1980s to drop money targeting as a central plank of economic policy. Mr Giles Keating, economics director at Credit Suisse First Boston, the Swiss bank, said that, given the government's need to build up credibility with financial markets after the debacle of the ERM suspension, the Treasury should provide a 'clear statement' about the precise form its monetary targeting should take. He said: 'The Treasury should publish some definite rules about what it has in mind. It will not be enough to make some vague promise about the government from now on taking into account monetary aggregates.' If the government follows Mr Keating's suggestion, the UK will follow many other European governments in having explicit targets for the money supply. The wheel would then have turned full circle for Sir Terry, who would find official government thinking on the need to monitor this variable back to what was the Treasury line 12 years ago.</p>

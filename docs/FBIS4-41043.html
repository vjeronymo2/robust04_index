			<p>BFN     [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev met at his residence  today with representatives of leading German communications  companies--Alkatel-Stel, ERST, and Bundes-Os Telecom. They have  been working in Kazakhstan for three years in accordance with  agreements that were signed as a part of a German credit line.  They are building international, intercity, and local telephone  exchanges in 10 regions of our republic.    Last year, such exchanges were built in Zhezkazgan, Arkalyk,  Aktau, and Kostanau. They are assembling equipment in  Petropavlovsk, Kokshetau, Karaganda, Shymkent, and  Ust-Kamenogorsk. A satellite direct communication line has been  built recently to connect Akmola and Frankfurt-on-Main. They  familiarized the president with the results of their activities  in Kazakhstan and suggested a draft plan for joint work in  future. According to the business representatives, the  communications system in Kazakhstan must be privatized. The  earlier it happens, the bigger the profit will be for the  republic.    Telecom, a joint Kazakhstan-German venture, has been set up.  It installs electronic international switchboard systems. The  German side also spoke about the increase in investments to the  republic. Nazarbayev assured German representatives of his  support. With regard to the privatization of communications  systems, the president said that an international tender is due  to be announced soon for the right of foreign companies to  cooperate with enterprises of this branch of industry. He  expressed hope that German companies will participate in the  tender.    Also attending the meeting were Prime Minister Sergey  Tereshchenko and Foreign Minister Saudabayev.</p>

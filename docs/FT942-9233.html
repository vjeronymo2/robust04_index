			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Revisionism on pensions The conventional wisdom among pensions experts in the UK has long favoured final salary related occupational pensions over schemes that peg benefits to average salary, or to the returns on the investment of fixed contributions to a fund. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) can thus expect a sceptical response from the pensions establishment to its latest report on pensions policy, which argues that the risk in defined contribution schemes has been overstated, and that the defined benefit system may be delivering a worse deal to a majority of people. Others will welcome the IFS's pioneering attempt to quantify the different returns to pensioners under defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements respectively. This, together with a readiness to question longstanding assumptions, is overdue. The prejudice in favour of defined benefits has its roots in the experience of rising inflation in the 1960s and 1970s, when the link to final salary provided a measure of badly needed protection against rising prices, and employment patterns were relatively stable. Antipathy towards defined contribution pensions, meantime, was strengthened by the experience of stock market crashes in 1974 and 1987. Renewed inflation Today circumstances are very different. No one, admittedly, could afford to ignore the threat of renewed inflation for the purposes of long-term pension planning. But the pattern of employment in the UK is no longer so heavily geared to large companies providing long-term stable employment. The financial markets are able to provide a wider array of instruments with which to hedge against market volatility. And the political climate is more hostile to the paternalism that has been the driving force behind an entirely desirable build-up in private-sector occupational pensions. In essence pensions are a form of insurance. The IFS authors make the important point that the two main forms of private pension provision insure against different things. Defined benefit plans, which take the form of a promise related to final pay, insure against uncertainty about capital market returns. Defined contribution schemes, in contrast, insure against the risk of fluctuating earnings and the loss of jobs. Using data from the 1988-89 UK retirement survey, and on a plausible set of assumptions, the authors conclude that three-fifths of the people in a sample of 3,500 would have enjoyed higher benefits in a defined contribution plan. A privileged minority of mainly better off, male, long-staying employees, they find, have been feather-bedded by the majority. Wider concerns This is not particularly surprising, in that so-called early leavers are known to have made a substantial subsidy to long stayers because of inadequate inflation-proofing of deferred pensions. But the extent of the cross-subsidy appears greater than many had assumed. Can the legitimate requirement of paternalistic employers to attract and retain good employees really justify such a hugely redistributive process, especially when there are wider policy concerns about the adverse impact of the cross-subsidy on labour mobility? It is still possible to argue about the relative merits of the two systems in the light of different assumptions that could be made about inflation and investment returns in future. But in practice defined contribution schemes are growing rapidly because they match the requirements of today's labour market better than the alternative. And even if the economic arguments are deemed inconclusive, subject to further research, the wider case for defined benefits is strong. Such schemes are transparent and preclude cross-subsidy. They do not incorporate any incentive to sack older workers, whose pension rights become more expensive in defined benefit schemes as retirement approaches. They cannot be so easily milked by directors who bump up pre-retirement salaries at huge actuarial cost to the fund and thus to shareholders. More work needs to be done to find ways of reducing the capital market threat to the value of the pension on the date of retirement. But when City ingenuity provides a satisfactory answer to that problem, the government should give greater encouragement to comp-any-backed defined benefit plans.</p>

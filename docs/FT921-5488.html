			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Future of tax reform WHEN NORMAN Lamont rises to deliver his budget next Tuesday, he will also shape the election campaign. For what he says will tell the electorate far more about his party's vision of the future than about the immediate economic prospects of the UK. On the role of public spending, Mr Lamont is, unfortunately, sure to be silent. Nor can he respond to informed public discussion of medium-term fiscal options. Not only does the British chancellor continue to purvey two half budgets a year, but he also disappears into 'purdah' prior to the great day. While Mr Lamont has been more flirtatious than usual, electioneering, not more informed public discussion, has been his motive. The British tax system faithfully reflects the lack of coherent public debate and the partisan politics that surround it. It is why, for example, the focus is on the basic rate of income tax. Yet this is much ado about nothing. Not only does income tax generate only a quarter of public revenue, but the basic rate of 25 per cent is among the least distorting taxes in the entire system. Mr Lamont should try to rise above the limitations of British budgetary theatre. He should do more than offer a few electoral bribes. What is needed is an agenda for reform. Impractical commitment For reform is still needed. Mr Lamont should, for example, admit that Nigel Lawson's commitment to a comprehensive income tax was impractical. It has, in any case, not happened. The drift has been in the direction of taxation of expenditure. That development can be taken further, if not through a comprehensive expenditure tax, at least through the extension of the assets included in personal equity plans. Meanwhile, the tax deductibility of mortgage interest must, on no account, be raised in order to 'kick start' the housing market. A fully fledged system for the taxation of expenditure would fit with the abolition of capital gains tax, a tax that is largely voluntary and also entails double taxation of retained earnings. But such a change would be unacceptable without reform of inheritance taxation. The ideal here would not be its abolition, but rather the taxation of large receipts, whether as gifts or bequests. Treatment of inflation remains anomalous. Capital gains are index-linked, but that is true of neither depreciation nor interest income. The former defect is important in the corporation tax. The failure to provide adequate depreciation allowances creates a further bias against investment. Integrated system Then there is integration of taxation, national insurance and social benefits. National insurance, for example, generates almost two-thirds as much as income tax. Yet the tax bears no relation to individual entitlements. What it does do is allow the government to focus on the 25 per cent basic rate of tax, while ignoring the 34 per cent marginal tax on those earning less than Pounds 20,280 per year (42.6 per cent if employers' contributions are taken into account, as they should be). No less troubling is zero-rating of VAT on clothing, food, fuels and fares. Complete abolition could raise as much as Pounds 12bn. If the proceeds were used to fund additional welfare benefits and lower tax rates, the result could still be substantially more progressive than at present. It can never be said too often that subsidising particular goods is never the best way to help the poor. If this does not provide Mr Lamont with an adequate agenda, he can go green. How, for example, should he respond to the car industry's bleats about car tax? He should abolish it, making up the difference by increasing taxation of petrol. An increase in the latter of at least 10 per cent would do it. Nobody expects an ideal tax system; but the chancellor should propose one that is more coherent than the UK's. Everybody expects political debating points; but the chancellor should recognise the importance of fiscal stability. Few expect a complete philosophy of fiscal reform, but Mr Lamont can do far better than a penny or two off the basic rate, increased mortgage interest deductions, and tax deductibility for Norland Nannies.</p>

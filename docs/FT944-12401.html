			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Biogen stops development of one experimental drug Biogen, the genetic-engineering concern, yesterday said it was stopping development of one of its two most promising experimental drugs. The decision represents a big blow to the company's efforts to become a fully integrated drug manufacturer. The company said it had decided it would no longer pursue efforts to market an anticoagulant known as Hirulog, which is made from a chemical produced by leeches. Biogen, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said it would take a Dollars 25m pre-tax charge in the third quarter to cover expenses related to the move. Including the provision, the company posted a net loss of Dollars 26.4m, or 80 cents a share, for the three months to the end of September. In the corresponding period of 1993, it earned Dollars 11.3m, or 33 cents, on revenues of Dollars 37.3m. Sales in the most recent quarter were down nearly 15 per cent at Dollars 31.8m. Shares in Biogen closed up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 49.</p>

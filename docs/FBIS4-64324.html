			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Conrad Seidl: "EU Opponents More Determined Than </F> in the Past"]    [Text] Linz -- The opponents of membership in the European  Union [EU] are now more determined in their negative attitude  than in December. This was discovered by Market Institute  expert Astrid Koller when she compared two polls about the date  of accession to the European Union.    The Market Institute has repeatedly conducted polls for the  European Barometer of DER STANDARD, asking when the most  appropriate date for accession to the EU would be. In the M-35  poll last December only one out of two EU opponents said that  Austria should "not at all" join the European Union -- in the  M-39 poll now, after the negotiations, already two-thirds of the  EU opponents are committed to a definite "no."    "A classical case of polarization," Koller says. The other  results make it clear that 46 percent of the population are  still of the opinion that Austria should join the EU in 1995 at  the latest.    A potential postponement of the referendum and of the date  for accession is favored by about 15 percent of the followers of  the Social Democratic Party of Austria and the Austrian People's  Party [OeVP] respectively. The "never into the EU" is advocated  by 28 percent of Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] followers and  21 percent of OeVP followers.    The Liberal Forum, which is close to the FPOe but in favor  of  the EU, warned last week against making the EU referendum a  referendum on the government; Bruno Kreisky made this mistake in  1978. The bill will be presented to the government only at the  Nationalrat elections.    This week the issue of the EU and the date of accession will  be dealt with by the parliaments, by the European Parliament in  Strasbourg and by the Nationalrat. Austria will not have the  opportunity to join the European Union at any time, Salzburg  Governor Hans Katschthaler stated. If membership is rejected  now, he expects a delay of 10 to 15 years.</p>

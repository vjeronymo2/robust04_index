			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Young Man Accused of `Military </F> Exercises'"]    [Text] At the Serbian court in Gjilan [Gnjilane], the  trial has begun of Mejdi Qerimi from Gjelekara near Viti  [Vitina], accused of the crime of so-called "hostile activity."  A report in the newspaper JEDINSTVO states that Mjedi Qerimi is  charged with allegedly having learned how to use weapons at a  camp near Elba Ban in 1993. The accusation charges him with  having trained for a possible war in Kosova. Because the  defense counsel insisted on the presence at the trial of two  witnesses who are at present in Nis military prison, the trial  was adjourned until 14 June.</p>

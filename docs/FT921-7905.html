			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Internatio confident despite loss INTERNATIO-MULLER, the diversified Rotterdam-based trading, transport and engineering group, fell into the red in 1991 but predicted that 1992 would bring a return to profits. It posted a net loss of Fl 120m (Dollars 65m) compared with a net profit of Fl 2.6m in 1990. Turnover was unchanged at roughly Fl 3bn, with the effect of divestments balanced by internal growth and acquisitions. In 1991, Internatio divested or deconsolidated 32 companies with a combined turnover of Fl 600m to focus on two core businesses: trading and technical installation contracting. The sharp profits decline in 1991 was due mainly to Fl 90m in reorganisation provisions and book losses on the sale of subsidiaries. Internatio also booked a separate provision of more than Fl 25m to cover losses incurred in developing an automated navigation system for eight frigates ordered by the Dutch navy. Internatio said its divestments and reorganisation had set the stage for a recovery. It said it would not pay a cash dividend for 1991. It omitted its cash dividend for 1990 but paid a 2 per cent stock dividend.</p>

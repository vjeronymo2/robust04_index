			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / MP calls for water supply reforms A large difference between water charges paid by families living on two sides of the same street last night prompted a Tory MP to call for changes in regulations governing the industry. Mr Richard Ottaway, MP for Croydon South, wants the government to change regulations under the Water Industry Act to make it easier for companies to supply residents beyond their borders. In a Commons adjournment debate, Mr Ottaway said his interest in the issue had been triggered when a constituent discovered that her bill from East Surrey Water was more than Pounds 100 a year more than the one received by families on the other side of the road. She asked the local council to lobby for supplies to be received from Thames Water, which was providing the cheaper water. However, the council discovered that Thames Water was prevented from doing this because of a threshold imposed by Ofwat, the industry regulator. Mr Ottaway said Thames Water would have to prove it could supply 250 megalitres a year to the area, but average family consumption was 0.15 megalitres. He called for the threshold to be reduced.</p>

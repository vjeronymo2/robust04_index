			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Libyan offer leaves UN unmoved LIBYA has offered to hand over to Tunisia, or some other neutral country, two men suspected of the 1988 bombing of an American airliner, but the proposal is unlikely to stave off UN sanctions due to come into effect on Wednesday, writes Tony Walker in Cairo. It was also reported last night that Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi told Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak he agreed in principle to abide by UN resolution 731 urging Libya to hand over the two men, accused of bombing a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, an Egyptian official said. Scheduled flights from Tripoli are reported to be heavily booked over the next few days before the deadline expires for the imposition of UN sanctions resolution 748, which includes an arms and air embargo. Libya said it would sever all contact with the outside world for the 24 hours before the sanctions begin. Arab foreign ministers, members of a special seven-member Arab League committee, were meeting in Rabat today in an effort to fashion a last-minute compromise.</p>

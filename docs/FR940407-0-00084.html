			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were many comments from industry and State and local agencies in support of the proposed flexibility in setting baselines. These comments generally supported the concept of considering the use of allowable emissions in setting EIP baselines, provided the EIP is consistent with RFP and attainment demonstrations. The commenters did not, however, address how such consistency could be achieved or demonstrated. Some State agencies commented that if allowable emissions baselines are used, they should not lead to more actual emissions, in the aggregate area-wide, than allowed under a traditional plan. The commenters felt that this flexibility would allow States to select baselines that were the most practicable and equitable to all sources involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative view was expressed by an environmental group which advocated that the final rules should require an actual emissions baseline for all EIP's until the attainment demonstration is approved. This comment was premised on the belief that an allowable emissions baseline would violate the requirements for attainment as expeditiously as possible and for noninterference with attainment. The commenter asserted that relying only on a RFP demonstration and a commitment by the State that a future attainment demonstration would be consistent with the EIP baseline was a wholly inadequate constraint to ensure expeditious as practicable attainment. Further, this commenter expressed the view that ``surplus'' reductions should be defined relative to those reductions which are necessary to achieve attainment. As a result, the commenter concluded that the EPA should not approve any EIP's based on emissions trading prior to approval of an attainment demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rules and guidance focus on consistency between progress plans and EIP baselines. The rules recognize that RFP requirements are defined in terms of actual areawide emissions reductions and annual progress. Although such consistency and requirements may be made more difficult by the use of an EIP baseline which incorporates allowable emissions, the final rules provide States flexibility in designing an EIP to achieve these requirements. Further, the final rules encourage the development of EIP's as part of an overall attainment strategy that lowers the cost of attainment. The final rules recognize that attainment strategies that incorporate EIP's can reflect both environmentally and economically sound policy choices. Therefore, the final rules retain the proposed baseline flexibility and definition of surplus, while requiring States to demonstrate in their EIP submittal that the EIP baseline is consistent with their progress plans <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and RACT requirements, when applicable, and to commit that such consistency will be reflected in any subsequent progress plans and attainment demonstrations. The State should describe how the EIP baseline will be integrated into a subsequent attainment demonstration. The EPA takes the position that an allowables baseline, when consistent with a submitted, complete, and potentially approvable RFP plan generally is permissible. It is true, as one commenter emphasized, that consistency with RFP does not automatically assure consistency with attainment when additional reductions are needed for attainment. However, the EPA takes the position that an allowables baseline that is consistent with an RFP submittal does not specifically interfere with attainment under section 110(l). The State's commitment that the attainment demonstration, when submitted, will be consistent with the allowables baseline lends additional support to the EPA's position. The inducement to States to complete the attainment demonstration that is presented by the sanctions/FIP requirement, as well as the fact that emissions limits allowed under the EIP may be tightened if they unexpectedly develop into impediments to attainment, further support the EPA's positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has concluded that it is not necessary in this notice to define RFP with any greater specificity than found in the statute; that is, it is not necessary to identify the extent, if any, of annual emissions reductions needed to comply with the statutory RFP requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated above in paragraph IV.B.1., the EPA is developing guidance that addresses baselines for EIP's implementing new NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT requirements. Further, the EPA intends to work with States who want to develop trading-based RACT programs to incorporate the requirements of the EIP rules and related guidance into EIP's that are environmentally sound and administratively efficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Emission Quantification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Criteria for Adequacy of Approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rules and guidance were based on the premise that the development and use of credible, workable, and replicable methods to quantify emissions are necessary elements of any quantifiable EIP. The proposed rules require EIP quantification methods to have a level of certainty comparable to that for source-specific standards and traditional methods of control strategy development. The proposal explicitly allowed States to develop alternative approaches to meet these emissions quantification requirements. The proposal solicited comments on adequacy criteria for various types of source categories, recognizing that no one approach is the most appropriate, or even technically feasible, for all source categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

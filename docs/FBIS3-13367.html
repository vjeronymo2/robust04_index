In a statement it issued today, the committee stressed that  this aggression is a grave escalation of the attempt to divide  Egyptians and threaten their national unity, adding that it is  an aggression against Egypt's Muslims and Christians.    The statement appealed to Muslim and Christian forces and  bodies to rise to responsibility, condemn this criminal act and  its perpetrators, confront this trend, and work assiduously for  the unity of all Egyptians under the slogan of: Religion belongs  to God and the homeland belongs to everyone.

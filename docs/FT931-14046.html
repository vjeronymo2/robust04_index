			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rises on arbitrage buying TECHNICAL trading dominated activity yesterday, and share prices posted moderate gains on arbitrage buying and small-lot purchases by public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 181.40 at 16,798.64 having fallen to the day's low of 16,645.23 in the first hour before advancing on constant arbitrage-linked buying and hitting the day's high of 16,798.74 just before the close. Volume remained thin at 180m shares against 140m with dealers and public fund managers being the only notable players as most large-lot investors remained on the sidelines. Advances led declines by 638 to 254 with 202 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 9 to 1,276.07 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.32 to 1,045.22. Brokers said that most investors remained cautious over the future of the economy while foreign investors have also been absent. Mitsui Mining and Smelting drew heavy buying interest and gained Y10 to Y470 after the Metal Mining Agency of Japan confirmed the existance of a gold vein discovered last year, in which the Mitsui has a major stake. Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, rose Y44 to Y358 on active buying. Real estate issues advanced on rumours of government plans to ease its land policy. Mitsui Fudosan gained Y10 to Y995 and Mitsubishi Estate rose Y10 to Y915. High-technology issues were higher on hopes of an early US economic revival. Toshiba rose Y5 to Y612 and Sony Y80 to Y4,210. NEC jumped Y35 to Y665 on reports that it would enter the personal computer price war by launching new low priced models. Canon rose Y20 to Y1,370 after announcing a new 24-inch liquid crystal display development. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 91.23 to 18,143.51 in volume of 71.7m shares.

The banking sector was active with 7.2m shares traded. Westpac lost 6 cents to ADollars 2.79, after a low of ADollars 2.76, as investors registered their disappointment that the bank did not appoint a new managing director at the annual meeting. In contrast, news that the Advance Bank had posted a 38 per cent rise in half yearly net profit to ADollars 28.4m lifted its stock 26 cents to ADollars 6.36.

The shares fell Rp100 to Rp9100. The official index eased 0.79 to 277.15.

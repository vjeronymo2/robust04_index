			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Sumitomo fined in Canada A Canadian court has fined the local subsidiary of Japan's Sumitomo Chemical CDollars 1.25m (Pounds 641,000) for taking part in an international conspiracy to rig the market in forest insecticides, reports Bernard Simon from Toronto. The fine against Sumitomo brings total penalties imposed on three multinationals involved in the arrangement to CDollars 5.4m. Chemagro, a subsidiary of Bayer, the German chemicals group, was earlier fined CDollars 2m for two separate infringements. Both companies pleaded guilty. Sumitomo and Chemagro arranged in the late 1980s to share the market for a chemical insecticide used by provincial forestry agencies and private companies in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The conspiracy was uncovered when US-based Abbott Laboratories disclosed its involvement in another arrangement with Chemagro.</p>

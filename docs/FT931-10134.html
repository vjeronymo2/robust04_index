			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Ready, willing but still unable: A proposal to give Germany a role as peacekeeper There should be German troops in Northern Ireland. It might not solve the Northern Irish problem, but it could well be the solution to the German problem. Some readers may be surprised to hear that there is still a German problem. Others may suppose that today's German problem is an economic one. But if you had been at the annual Munich Conference on Security Policy last weekend, you would know that the new German question is about German troops serving outside the Nato area. It falls into several parts: Where can the troops go? What can they do when they get there? What colour helmets should they wear? Is a constitutional amendment required? Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to be free to send German troops anywhere, and for any purpose - 'peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace-enforcing' - required by the United Nations. He does not think an amendment is needed, but has agreed to seek one, in deference to his Free Democratic party coalition partners. The trouble is, he cannot muster the requisite majority without the support of the Social Democratic (SPD) opposition. The SPD, for its part, thinks the Bundeswehr should be available to the UN only for 'blue helmet missions' - a phrase generally understood in Germany to refer to traditional UN peacekeepers, who can use force only in their own defence. The SPD parliamentary leader, Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, said his party had accepted 'the now very much wider spectrum of such operations . . . including the monitoring of embargoes, underpinning humanitarian operations, setting up protective zones and the preventive stationing of blue helmets, that is, approximately 90 per cent of all the missions that have occurred so far'. Mr Klose added that he himself 'would be in favour of having the Bundeswehr participate in all such missions of the UN or regional organisations under its mandate, even where - to accomplish the set goal - force had to be used as well'. He would take exception only to missions 'whose goal is the use of force'. Since it is hard to imagine the goal of any mission being defined as the use of force for the heck of it, this formulation took Mr Klose within spitting distance of the chancellor's position. It caused a ripple of excitement, but only a ripple, since it appears Mr Klose has no chance of carrying his party with him; and even he said he would be stricter than the government in insisting on a 'definite link with a specific and lasting UN mandate'. Everyone in Germany seems to agree that the use of force, other than in direct defence of yourself or your allies, has to be somehow legitimised by the UN. Only non-official English-speaking visitors at the conference were so ungracious as to point out that this means making any military action by western countries, whether to rescue people from genocide or to prevent a local war from spreading, dependent on the whim of the Chinese and Russian governments. Not only Germans but Europeans in general seem to agree that German troops cannot be used at present in the former Yugoslavia. It was therefore discouraging, for those who see American troops as an essential ingredient of any serious effort to end the war in Bosnia, to hear a prominent Republican senator, Mr William Cohen, say that Congress was unlikely to sanction direct US military involvement unless there was German participation 'not just in Awacs (surveillance aircraft) but behind artillery pieces and perhaps in tanks'. As things stand, even the German crew members on the Nato Awacs aircraft now monitoring the no-fly zone in Bosnia will have to be withdrawn if and when the Security Council authorises military action to enforce it. Europeans have come to accept Germany's inability to join any military action in the former Yugoslavia as a fact of life, not least because they know the arrival of German troops would be exploited in Serbian official propaganda. But many speakers did question Mr Kohl's rationale for not joining when he said 'there are places in Europe where it is out of the question for German divisions to be sent, because there are people still alive who have a very concrete experience' of the second world war 'and all the horrors connected with it'. Americans especially, but some Germans too, said it was quite wrong to equate today's democratic Germany with yesterday's Nazi Germany, or the Bundeswehr with the Wehrmacht. On the contrary, Germany's past war crimes gave it all the greater obligation to involve itself in efforts, including military efforts, to preserve the peace in Europe now. If the chancellor's argument were to be accepted, said Mr Josef Joffe, foreign editor of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the German newspaper, the only place in Europe where German troops could be deployed would be Sweden. Perhaps he is right, but I think Northern Ireland might be prepared to put up with them, in spite of its memories of German bombing. It is clearly inside the Nato area, and with a bit of effort Germany could field units comprising equal numbers of Catholics and Protestants. And then 12 British battalions based in Northern Ireland, with plenty of 'peacekeeping' experience and no constitutional inhibitions about serving anywhere, would be free to do their bit for the new world order.</p>

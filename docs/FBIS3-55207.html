			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The chief editors of virtually all newspapers  published in Moscow have decided to strike on 10 January. They  have taken this action because publishing houses have increased  by several times the cost of their services, referring to a  government decision on reassessing production assets. According  to the editors, this will make the future existence of their  publications impossible. KOMERSANT, which is not worried about  any price rises, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, which is restrained by army  discipline, the NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER, which does not cooperate  with the government and wants nothing from it, and the  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, which believes that it is not the government  but the printing trades who have incorrectly fixed tariffs that  one should be fighting, will not be taking part in the strike.</p>

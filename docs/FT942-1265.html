			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (6): 'We'd survive a No vote' - The prime minister replies to questions put to her by Hugh Carnegy Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland first became prime minister in 1981, and has gone on to become the dominant figure of her generation in Norwegian politics. Since leading her Labour party to victory in last September's general election, her overriding concern has been to achieve approval for Norwegian entry into the European Union in a referendum due on November 28 this year. It is a project that flies in the face of heavy popular opposition. If she fails to win a Yes vote, her future as prime minister will inevitably be cast into doubt. Mrs Brundtland answered the following questions for this survey: Q: What are the issues upon which you will fight the campaign for a Yes vote in November? A: The accession treaty (agreed with Brussels in March) shows that Norway is welcome in the EU. It includes satisfactory solutions to issues of vital importance to us, such as control over natural resources and an active regional policy. Norway would benefit from participation in the decision-making process in the EU, and would use its influence to intensify co-operation to promote employment, equitable social development, environmental protection and peace between the countries of Europe. As a member of the EU, we would continue to pursue the main lines of the economic and foreign policy we have followed throughout the post-war period. Norway has a natural place in this forum. Q: If Norway votes No, as it did in 1972, what will be the consequences for the country? A: If the country votes against membership, we shall have to build on our membership of Nato, our associate membership of the WEU (Western European Union) and on the EEA (European Economic Area) agreement. This would obviously be a second-best solution and would give Norway less influence on developments in Europe, developments on which we are extremely dependent given our open economy and strong ties to Western Europe. Q: In 1972, the No vote was devastating for Labour. What would be the consequences for you personally and for the party if you fail once again? A: The Labour party has conducted a thorough, open and broad-based debate on the EU issue for several years. Despite disagreement (within the party) on the issue, the way it has been dealt with has helped to strengthen the party. At the same time, the party leadership and the government has made it clear that the referendum will decide the issue, and the result will be respected by all our members. The Labour party is thus also prepared to continue in power in the event of a No vote. The country needs stable leadership and firm government and, in the current political situation, the Labour party is the political force that can provide this. Q: As a member of the EU what would Norway's attitude be in the debate about the future shape of the Union? A: The EU is based upon close co-operation between independent states. This co-operation must be developed gradually, with a view to meeting challenges and resolving problems that cannot be dealt with by countries on their own. We are in favour of stronger decision-making mechanisms in areas where it is necessary to intensify efforts to promote sustainable development and stimulate employment. At the same time we subscribe to the principle of subsidiarity. Q: With oil production soon set to start falling, there appears to be an inherent weakness in the mainland economy which threatens the long-term prospects for the economy as a whole. What are you doing to address this? A: The government has pursued a policy in which the fiscal and structural policy measures have been designed precisely to stimulate economic development and employment in the mainland economy. There are many signs that this is now yielding results. We are making active use of the public budgets to increase employment, strengthen the private sector and invest in expertise and other infrastructure. Now that the economy has entered a phase of relatively vigorous growth, it is important to strengthen the country's financial position. The deficit on the fiscal budget will also be reduced this year and further next year. It is true that our oil production will be reduced in a few years' time, but given the increase in gas production, the production on the Norwegian shelf will continue to be a mainstay of the economy for many years to come. Increased production on mainland Norway will therefore enable us to maintain balanced growth. The cost-competitiveness of the Norwegian economy has improved considerably, and the prospects for the mainland economy are better now that they were a few years ago. This means we are becoming less dependent on oil.</p>

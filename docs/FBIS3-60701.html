			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``Pressler Returns''] </F>   [Text] A U.S. Congressional delegation that includes  Senator Larry Pressler of the discriminatory Pakistan-specific  Pressler Amendment fame, will be visiting Pakistan towards the  middle of this month. Though, according to our Foreign Office,  the visit is part of routine tours that the Congressmen  undertake to areas of their interest during the Congressional  recess, given the intensity of the United States' renewed focus  on the nuclear non-proliferation issue, it is not hard to figure  out that the point of their interest in this case is to bring  around Pakistan to a rollback of its nuclear programme. On our  part, successive governments have repeatedly made it clear to  the U.S. that they would be willing to sign the NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty] provided India agrees to a simultaneous  ratification of the treaty or accepts Pakistan's proposal for a  five-nation conference to achieve a regional non-proliferation  regime. There is no ambiguity whatsoever in this country's  stance on the issue that may need further clarifications or  elaboration. And on the other side too, Sen. Pressler has  continued to stick to his guns in subjecting this country to a  discriminatory law of which he himself is the author. In fact  he came visiting a couple of years ago also but that did not  help him to see things in a fair and rational perspective. One  wonders what more can Pakistan tell him about its position on  the nuclear issue, or he to Pakistan on where he stands, that  this nation already does not know through his consistent  criticism of its nuclear programme and a punitive law that  denies it eligibility to U.S. aid in some important defence  equipment. Hence when Pressler comes again, along with some  other members of the Congress, there is little the two sides can  be expected to add to each other's knowledge on the chief issue  of contention between them.    The one hope for optimism in the visit though may be that  the  Senator might have learnt something from the failure of his  efforts at forcing this country into accepting what is  unjustifiable by any standards of fairness. Then there is also  the fact that face-to-face meeting among people tend to help  them better understand each other's points of view. In that  respect discussions with the other members of his delegation may  lead to a productive exchange, and Sen. Pressler, having  realised the futility of his exercise against Pakistan, might  also be willing this time around to listen with an open mind and  revise his position vis-a-vis both India and Pakistan. Other  than this hope, there is not much that can be expected to come  out of the Congressional visit.</p>

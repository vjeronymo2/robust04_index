			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / People: Wm Low loses property director William Low, the Dundee-based food retailer, has been having an unhappy time of things recently, and the departure this week of property director Ramsay Johnson may not hearten spirits. With its margins squeezed by the continuing supermarket price war conducted by its larger rivals, Low reported in April this year that operating profits fell by more than 25 per cent in the six months to mid-March. Other recent gloom has been a 10 per cent cut in head office staff, and a decision to scale back plans for new retail space, from the intended 80,000-100,000 square feet per annum to not more than 40,000. Traditionally strong in Scotland, Low responded to the price war last September, by announcing its own '500 prices down' promotion. Perhaps it is not surprising therefore that yesterday Harvie Findlay, finance director, would add nothing to the company's formal statement about Johnson's departure, which noted that 'bearing in mind the reduced level of activity in property development in retail and non-retail assets, no successor is being appointed in the meantime'.</p>

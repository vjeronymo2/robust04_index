			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): S African group set for first unbundled result - Barlow South African industrial conglomerate Barlow, formerly Barlow Rand, releases interim results today. These will be its first since unbundling its main operations late last year. CG Smith and Reunert, the two other big companies created in the unbundling, have had a mediocre six months, and Barlow's figures also are unlikely to be good. Analysts say Barlow's results are difficult to forecast. The pro forma numbers released after the unbundling are no longer a good guide to overall performance because of various sales during the past six months. Of the group's remaining assets, Barlow's Pretoria Portland Cement subsidiary had an excellent first half. Analysts expect its figures to improve still further this year because of the boom that is likely to follow the new government's reconstruction and development programme. But the unit's first-half gains are likely to be largely cancelled out by the dismal performance of UK subsidiary J Bibby and sons, which reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.4m for the six months to March 26. The deficit was due to a decision to withdraw from the agricultural feeds business. Trading in Spain and Portugal also remained weak during the period, although since February the company reported a small improvement in the order book level for new equipment.</p>

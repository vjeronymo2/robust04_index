Borgstrom, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of National Environmental Policy Act Oversight, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;4600 or (800) 472&hyph;2756. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Pantex Plant is located in Carson County, about 17 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas, and central to the panhandle of Texas. As a component of the national nuclear weapons research, development, and production complex administered by the Department of Energy, the primary mission of Pantex is the assembly, disassembly, and surveillance of nuclear weapons. Within the disassembly portion of the Department of Energy mission, weapons are returned to Pantex from the Department of Defense, disassembled and the plutonium pits stored at Pantex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two factors combine to create the need for increased interim storage of pits. First, decisions to reduce the size of the nuclear weapons stockpile have accelerated the accumulation of pits. These pits need to be stored on an interim basis until decisions can be implemented on the long-term storage of plutonium required for national security purposes and on the disposition of surplus plutonium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, pits are no longer being shipped from Pantex to the Rocky Flats Plant, near Golden, Colorado, to be recycled. This function was temporarily halted at the Rocky Flats Plant in 1989 to make improvements in the operations and facilities. In January 1992, pit recycle operations were suspended indefinitely. Subsequently, the Department has decided to no longer maintain a nuclear component production capability at the Rocky Flats Plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Action Described in the Environmental Assessment and Decision: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed action as described in the Environmental Assessment was to provide additional storage beyond the present pit storage capacity (6,800 pits) for up to 20,000 pits for an interim time period. In response to comments received from State and local officials and other stakeholders, the Department has decided to increase the interim storage of pits at Pantex under this Finding of No Significant Impact to no more than 12,000 pits. There would not be a need to construct or demolish any additional facilities; nor would there be any increased generation or management of wastes, uncontained plutonium handling, or plutonium processing as a result of this decision. The Department will implement this decision in the same manner as described in the proposed action for storage of 20,000 pits with one exception, the number of magazines that will be utilized. Approximately 31 magazines will be used instead of 49. The operations will remain the same in that inspections and inventories of pits will be carried out in the same manner, the method of storage will remain as described in the proposed action, and the number of pits stored in each magazine will remain the same.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two types of magazines exist at Pantex. There are 18 Modified-Richmond magazines, and 42 Steel Arch Construction magazines. Currently, Steel Arch Construction magazines are not utilized for pit storage. Dismantlement activities at Pantex will continue and pit storage will be expanded to include the Zone 4 Steel Arch Construction magazines consistent with the Environmental Assessment and the Final Safety Analysis Report for Zone 4 and all magazines will use the preferred interim storage configurations in the Environmental Assessment. The preferred interim storage configurations are either multiple stacking of containers placed horizontally on pallets or a single layer of containers placed vertically on the floor with aisles to facilitate access for inventory and surveillance activities. Because of its overall advantages, storage eventually will be accomplished using the multiple stacked configuration. After successful completion of the Department's Operational Readiness Review for horizontal stacking, scheduled for mid-February 1994, storage using this configuration will begin. Until then, storage will be undertaken using the vertical configuration previously described. The number of pits that could be held within each of the 18 Modified-Richmond magazines will increase from 378 pits to a maximum of 440 as accomplished by using a horizontal palletized multiple stacking configuration. In addition, each Steel Arch Construction magazine will hold up to 384 or 392 pits, in the vertical single-layer or horizontal palletized multiple stacking configurations, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

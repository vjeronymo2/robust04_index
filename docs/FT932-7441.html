			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Ministers meet to dispel gloom over Ulster talks BRITISH AND IRISH ministers will tomorrow try to dispel some of the gloom over the prospects for talks on the political future of Northern Ireland following last week's local elections in the province. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, will discuss in Dublin with Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, how unionist and nationalist political leaders can be persuaded to resume the negotiations which collapsed in November last year. Even before last week's local elections, which saw a better-than-expected performance by the hardline Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, ministers from both governments were envisaging another Anglo-Irish conference before talks would resume. Now they may reconsider putting off the restart of talks still further. With the Reverend Ian Paisley, DUP leader, insisting his party will not return to talks until the Irish Republic compromises on its territorial claim to the north, the sense of political polarisation has increased. The moderate Ulster Unionist Party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, is also expected to be more cynical about talks. Sir Patrick has not commented on the local elections but the mood at the Northern Ireland Office at the weekend was that whatever the impact of the elections, there was no alternative to pressing ahead with restarting talks as originally hoped. It is also clear that Sir Patrick's personal initiative for restarting talks  -a paper being drawn up which will set out British government proposals for how Northern Ireland might be governed - will not provide an immediate catalyst to the resumption of negotiations. The proposals for a new devolved government in the province will not be presented to participants for some time. These suggestions may divide rather than unite them, by satisfying the demands of neither unionists nor nationalists. A crumb of comfort for Sir Patrick is the relatively good performance last week of the non-sectarian Alliance party in Northern Ireland.</p>

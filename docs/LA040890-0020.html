			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSCAR MEMORIES  </P> <P> The clips from the Akira Kurosawa movies showed a bunch of people being shot  with arrows and some nice young women being cruelly killed off.  </P> <P> For me as a viewer, and I'm sure for other viewers, these scenes were painful  and just plain pointless.  </P> <P> The whole attitude involved -- that by showing man's inhumanity to man you make  us all better -- is really boneheaded. All it does is give people nightmares.  </P> <P> Let's quit acting like Kurosawa is teaching people something they don't already  know. Grossing people out to make a humanitarian point is like punching someone  in the stomach to try to explain that being hit is painful.  </P> <P> JOHN SIMONS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

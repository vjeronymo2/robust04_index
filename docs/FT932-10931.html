			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Stora issues warning for full year STORA, Europe's leading pulp and paper group, yesterday reported a SKr78m (Dollars 10.5m) loss after financial items for the first quarter as it warned that market conditions were unlikely to improve significantly before 1994. The result compared with a SKr49m profit in the same 1992 period, but represented a sharp improvement on the SKr926m deficit which the group recorded in the final quarter of last year. The group expected average prices in local currencies to be lower in 1993 than in 1992, with volume growth held to below 1 per cent by the economic downturn in Europe. It noted that prices for many of its main products appeared to have stopped falling, and said cost-cutting measures and the weakening of the krona would have a positive impact on its result. Group sales rose to SKr12.95bn from SKr12.45bn. The group's biggest unit, Stora Feldmuhle, returned a SKr47m operating profit, after a SKr65m loss in the first quarter of 1992, as sales rose to SKr3.86bn from SKr3.28bn.</p>

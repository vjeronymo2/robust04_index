			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RARE-COIN THEFT CASE CONTINUED TO JUNE 25;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: LAWYERS FOR A CORONADO HEART SURGEON ACCUSED OF THEFT BY A PRESTIGIOUS  MANHATTAN COIN SOCIETY ARE STILL NEGOTIATING A PLEA-BARGAIN STANCE.  </P> <P> Plea-bargain negotiations continue in the case of Coronado heart surgeon Dr.  Juan Suros XII, who has been charged by New York authorities with stealing more  than $1 million in rare coins from a prestigious Manhattan coin society.  </P> <P> At a hearing Friday in New York State Supreme Court, the case against Suros,  48, was continued until June 25, when both sides are expected to agree on a  plea.  </P> <P> Suros, who also uses the name Juan XII, Count of Besalu, was charged with grand  larceny and possession of stolen property last September after allegedly  stealing about 71 coins, mostly rare Spanish and Mexican ones, from the  American Numismatic Society's Manhattan offices. If convicted, Suros faces 25  years in a New York prison.  </P> <P> Don Birnbaum, Suros' New York attorney, declined to comment on the case except  to say that "further discussions are ongoing."  </P> <P> Gloria Montealegre, spokeswoman for the New York district attorney's office,  said Tuesday that the two sides have been negotiating a plea bargain for  several months. A trial date could be set June 25 if an agreement is not  reached by then, she added.  </P> <P> Suros, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Spain. He was graduated from the  University of Barcelona. Widely known as an able heart surgeon, Suros has an  office in Chula Vista and a home on Isabella Avenue in Coronado.  </P> <P> According to reports in New York City newspapers, Suros told police in a  videotaped interview that he stole the coins because he "loved them and had to  have them." Investigators said Suros planned to add the stolen coins to his  collection.  </P> <P> All of the coins were recovered, some of them in Suros' home and office,  including a gold Roman coin from 134-138 A.D., six gold Visigoth coins minted  between 586 and 609 A.D., and six 18th-Century coins and medals from Spain and  Mexico.  </P> <P> New York police said the thefts occurred between December, 1988, and April,  1989. Society officials told investigators that coins would mysteriously  disappear every time Suros handled coin trays. As a member and contributor to  the society, Suros was allowed to handle the rare coins.  </P> <P> Suros was arrested April 15, 1989, in his room at the Harvard Club in  Manhattan, where police said they recovered 13 of the stolen coins. His arrest  came hours before he was scheduled to receive an award from the society at the  Knickerbocker Club. Suros was among several benefactors who were feted for  their financial contributions to the society's endowment.  </P> <P> Jonathan S. Maiman, one of Suros' attorneys, said last year that his client had  contributed more than $100,000 to the society. He joined the organization in  1984.  </P></p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Observer: Silk purse Britain's Conservative party is keen to hold on to its lone parliamentary seat on Tyneside. Since the start of the year, its marginal Tynemouth constituency has been a favourite visiting place for heavyweight Tory figures, starting with the prime minister. Now, without warning, the government has done a U-turn and announced that it will after all upgrade the 122 miles of the A1 between Newcastle and Edinburgh into a dual carriageway. The two Tories who made the joint announcement - transport secretary Malcolm Rifkind and James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish roads minister  - are both defending marginal seats in Edinburgh. And the local Tyneside Tory MP's name is Neville Trotter. A blatant piece of pre-election pork-barrel politics . . .?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's speech at a mosque </F> in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 10 May, edited by Nadav  Shragay and Yosi Torpstein; all notations between parentheses  are editors' notes]    [Text] In the name of Allah the merciful and compassionate.  My brothers, I must thank you for allowing my to come here to  pray together. Allah willing, we will soon pray in Jerusalem,  the first site (chronologically speaking) of Islam. My  brothers, it must be understood that after the Gulf war the main  conspiracy was to completely eliminate the Palestinian problem  from the international agenda. It was not easy, because our men  paid the price of the Gulf war, as you know.    Our community in Kuwait, which was one of the largest and  richest, was kicked out of Kuwait. Not only that, but later we  were presented with the Bush initiative on the Madrid  conference. And, it was not easy to agree to go to the Madrid  conference, because of its very difficult conditions. Why? So  as not to give them a reason and an excuse to ignore the  question of Jerusalem and the question of Palestine. This must  be understood. Now, after this agreement, which is the first  step and nothing more than that, believe me -- a lot remains to  be done.    The jihad will continue. Jerusalem is not only of the  Palestinian people, but of the entire Islamic nation. You are  responsible for Palestine and for Jerusalem. "The land that was  promised to God's fearful." ('Arafat quotes a Koran verse in  which Allah addresses Abraham on this issue.)    After this agreement you must understand that our main  battle  is not to get the maximum out of them here and there. The main  battle is over Jerusalem, the third most sacred site of the  Muslims. Everybody must understand it. Therefore, I insisted  before signing (on the Gaza and Jericho agreement in Cairo) to  get a letter from the Israelis that Jerusalem is one of the  items for discussion in the negotiations. We are not talking  about (a discussion of) Israel's permanent status. No. We are  talking about the permanent status of Palestine. It is very  important that everybody understand it.    In this letter, which they wrote and I have in my possession  although I have not divulged it so far, I insisted that they  mention that we are responsible for all the holy sites,  Christian and Muslim. I insisted that the name of the Christian  holy site be mentioned before the name of the Muslim holy site,  because I must be faithful to the agreement between Caliph 'Umar  Ibn-al-Khattab and Patriarch Sophronius. Therefore, I insisted  that they mention in the letter the Christian holy places next  to the Muslim holy places.    Here we are, and I must speak candidly. I cannot do it on my  own, without the help of the Islamic nation. And I cannot say  like the Jews: You and your god fight alone. No. You must  come to fight, to begin the jihad to liberate Jerusalem, your  first shrine. It is very important. Therefore, me and my  colleagues insisted on mentioning in the agreement that the  negotiations about Jerusalem will start no later than the  beginning of the third year, and that immediately after the  signing of the agreement we will start the negotiations about  Jerusalem. About the future of Jerusalem.    You saw me when I hesitated (in the signing ceremony in  Cairo). I did it because I insisted on mentioning Jerusalem. I  did not want this promise from Rabin, but from the two  cosponsors of the process, Christopher and Kozyrev, and the  witness, President Mubarak. And this was done. Everybody must  understand that there is a constant conspiracy against  Jerusalem. As mentioned, in the next three years,  (negotiations) will start no later than the beginning of the  third year. They (the Israelis) will try to wipe out and change  the demography of Jerusalem. This is very important.    We must be very careful and give it priority, because there  is no higher priority than Jerusalem. We must give it top  priority, not just as Palestinians and not just as Arabs, but  also as Muslims and as Christians. I mentioned it before to the  Archbishop of Canterbury. I told them that if they want the  Holy Sepulcher and the Christian holy sites they must not only  talk to the Israelis but also to the Jews.    We are not against the Jews. We must remember what the Koran  says: "Within the people of (the prophet) Moses there is a  nation (a group) that believes in justice and lives by it." For  your information, there are two Jewish sects in Palestine: The  Samaritans in Nabulus and the Neturey Karta in Jerusalem. They  refuse to recognize the State of Israel and regard themselves as  Palestinians. I am saying this to prove that their statements  that Jerusalem is their capital are wrong. It is not their  capital.    It is our capital and yours. It is the first most sacred  site of Islam ('Arafat is referring to the first sacred place to  which the Muslims turned in their prayers; later the direction  of their prayers was changed to Mecca). But, we need your  support. This is the message of the people in Palestine and our  population in Jerusalem. They are calling on you and on  everybody everywhere. I am sure that sooner or later we will  pray in Jerusalem, together.    I regard this agreement as no more than the agreement signed  between our prophet Muhammad and the Quiraish (tribe) in Mecca  ('Arafat is referring to the Treaty of Hudaibiya in the year 628  in which Muhammad promised peace for 10 years, but violated it  two years later when he conquered Mecca which had been ruled by  the Quiraish). We must remember that Caliph 'Umar refused to  accept this agreement and considered it "an inferior peace  agreement." However, the prophet Muhammad accepted it, and we  now accept the peace agreement, but (this) in order to continue  on the way to Jerusalem. Together and not alone.    We must say clearly that circumstances are very, very  critical. I will give you one example. Do you remember what  happened after the massacre in Hebron? For 22 days the UN  Security Council hesitated to pass a resolution condemning this  massacre. Do you remember? Twenty-two days because of one word  I insisted on including in this resolution; (namely, adding to  the term) "the occupied territories" (the words) "including  Jerusalem." They tried to argue with me to omit Jerusalem, but  I refused and got my way.    Once again, I must thank you from the bottom of my heart and  I am speaking to you with sincerity, from one brother to  another. We need you as Muslims and as mujahidin (jihad  warriors). It is a pleasure for me to thank my old friend and  elder brother, Nelson Mandela, for inviting me to visit South  Africa for the first time.    My presence here is part of your struggle. I am telling him  on your behalf and on behalf of the Islamic nation that we will  be by his side, and we are sure he will continue to be by our  side. Once again, I must say "they will enter the mosque as  they entered it before" ('Arafat is quoting a Koran verse).  Until victory, until Jerusalem, until Jerusalem, until  Jerusalem.</p>

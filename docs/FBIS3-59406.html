			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Butkovic: "Tomislav Mercep's Death Squad, </F> Operating From a Base in Pakracka Poljana, Has Been Executing  Serbs and Croats!"]    [Text] Mihajlo Zec (age 38), a butcher, a Serb who came  from Bosanska Krajina, and said to be a member of the HDZ  [Croatian Democratic Union], was murdered on 7 December 1991 in  Poljanicka Street on Tresnjevka in Zagreb. The killers kidnapped  his wife, Marija, who owned a little cafe on Dolac which the Zec  family had obtained in the past thanks to good connections with  powerful people, mainly Serbs in the communist system, and his  daughter Aleksandra (age 12). Marija and Aleksandra were later  shot and killed. The bodies were found near the Adolfovac  mountain lodge on Sljeme.    A week after that crime the Croatian police arrested  suspects  who confessed to the murders during the investigation. They were  Nebojsa H., Munib S., Sinisa R., and Igor M., who took part in  Zec's murder and the kidnapping of his wife and daughter, and  Suzana Z., who accompanied the murderers.    In mid-December of the year before last, all the suspects  were already in prison pending the investigation. It was learned  from police circles that they had confessed to that and certain  other crimes. The Zec case seemed to have been solved.    But some 10 months after the murder of Mihajlo Zec, his wife  Marija, and his daughter Aleksandra, charges were dropped  against the arrestees because of procedural mistakes in  investigatory proceedings. Their lawyers felt that there was a  good chance of an acquittal even if there had not been those  procedural mistakes, because under the conditions of an  immediate danger of war (and those conditions prevailed in  Croatia in the fall and winter of 1991) even members of the  reserves of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MUP] had the right  to use firearms in a number of critical situations, for example,  if a person attempted to flee to avoid arrest.    All those suspected of having murdered the Zec family were  members of a reserve unit of the MUP whose commander was  Tomislav Mercep. This is Mercep's famous unit that played a  decisive role in the defense of Gospic and liberation of part of  western Slavonia; it was initially founded back in the time of  Vukovar, when Mr. Mercep was responsible for defense of that  city, and from time to time serious violations of the rules of  war have been attributed to its members.    At the time of the crime against the Zec family, there was  talk in Croatia about the disappearance of a certain number of  Serbs from Zagreb. There was also talk about the mysterious  disappearance of certain Croats well-known to the public.    The best-known of these cases was the disappearance of Mrs.  Marina Nuic, president of the Kraljevica branch of the HDS  [Croatian Democratic Party]; nothing is known about her fate  even today.    Not only that, but several members of the Croatian Armed  Forces, most of them members of the MUP reserves, have also  disappeared.    Two years after these enigmatic disappearances, some of  whose  victims were relatively well-known, representatives of the  United Nations want to do some digging in the area of Pakrac,  where it is said that several murdered Serbian civilians have  been buried.    According to the information we have obtained, those buried  in the zone of Pakracka Poljana are not only Serbs, but also  Croats, indeed distinguished Croatian nationalists who in the  dramatic months toward the end of 1991 seemed dangerous to  someone.  <H5>  How the Zec Family Was Killed </H5>   The Croatian police have reacted promptly and effectively to  a number of the mysterious disappearances. The contents of an  extensive police investigation were submitted to a few of the  highest officials of the Croatian Government some six or seven  months ago. That "report" ran to 13 typed pages and was  classified as a state secret.    "The report was written by one of the Croatian intelligence  services," says a government official who has had it in his  possession.    The full title of the document, which we obtained from the  very top leadership of the government, reads: "Report Drafted  Concerning the Criminalistic Workup of the Murder of Mihajlo  Zec, His Wife Marija, and His Daughter Aleksandra, and Also  Related to Information About Persons of Serbian Nationality  Taken From the City of Zagreb and Other Areas to the  Headquarters of a Reserve Unit of the MUP of the RH [Republic of  Croatia], Where Several of Those Persons, as Well as Members of  the Reserve Unit of the RH MUP, Were Killed." The "Report"  begins with a description of the murder of the Zec family. It  states precisely that on or about 2300 hours on 7 December 1991  members of the MUP reserves in camouflage uniforms were taken in  a van and a VW Golf automobile to No. 22 Poljanicka Street in  Zagreb.    According to the police report, which was later published in  all the major Croatian newspapers, they were Munib Suljic, who  was age 32 at the time; Sinisa Rimac, age 19; Igor Mikola, age  20; Nebojsa Hodak, age 25; and Snjezana Zivanovic, age 20.    Because Mihajlo Zec attempted to flee from the house, one of  these five members of the MUP reserve unit killed him with  rounds from an automatic rifle. Following the murder, the  persons in camouflage uniforms took about 30,000 dinars from the  house and took away the murdered man's wife and daughter. They  took them to the Adolfovac, where they bound, gagged, and  blindfolded them and then killed and buried them.    The statement by Munib Suljic, who allegedly led the  suspects, is quoted in the "Report." According to that  statement, at the Zagreb fairgrounds, where the equipment  storehouse of their unit was located, he was given the  assignment of finding and bringing in Mihajlo Zec by the  commander Zvonko Trusic in the presence of Tomislav Mercep.    When the police searched the house of the Zec family, they  found a threatening letter sent to Zec from Zagreb on 29  November 1991. We quote the letter in its entirety:    ``1. You have until 24 December, and by that date you must  leave Croatia. Beginning on 25 December and thereafter, your  life will not be worth anything.    ``2. You may not convey your house and other real estate  (Tresnjevka Opstina and the Assembly of the city of Zagreb have  been notified). It will all be turned over to the Croatian state  to care for Croats who have been the victims of genocide.    ``3. We know that you have sent out foreign exchange along  with your gold, but because this was taken from Croatia there  will also be punishment for that.    ``HOP    ``Croatian Defense Movement    "It is our sacred duty to cleanse Croatia within a period of  24 months so that not a single peasant sandal [opanak] treads  any longer on this holy land."    The police officials who drafted the report added that the  HOP [Croatian Defense Movement], along with certain people from  abroad, had been established by certain well-known politicians  of the Republic of Croatia so that they could operate outside  the legal and political system of the Croatian state.    The case of the Zec family was obviously an occasion for the  Croatian security services to devote serious attention to  discovering those responsible for the disappearance of several  people of Serbian and Croatian nationality. Some of those  disappearances are described in detail in the "Report."  <H5>  The Horrible Deaths of Ivosevic, Paic, and Gruic </H5>   The case of Milos Ivosevic is the first one mentioned after  the killing of Mihajlo, Marija, and Aleksandra Zec.    According to the "Report," on 31 October 1991 members of the  reserve unit of the MUP already mentioned picked up Ivosevic,  who headed the customs office in the Zagreb railroad switchyard,  whose address was No. 81 Rudeska Road, and took him to the  Zagreb fairgrounds along with Rado Paic and Marko Gruic, whom he  knew. Ivosevic, Paic, and Gruic were later taken to Pakracka  Poljana. A fairly new Golf automobile, 20,000 dinars, and about  300 German marks [DM] were taken from Ivosevic.    The "Report" said that Ivosevic, Paic, and Gruic, along with  nine other persons unnamed from Pakracka Poljana, were taken to  the basement of a house in the village Bujavice near Pakrac,  where B.M., J.A., A.A., Z.A., and a person known as "Bego,"  members of the reserve unit of the MUP which has been mentioned,  shot and killed them.    The bodies of those killed were found in the village  Bujavice  and were taken to the Bureau for Forensic Medicine and  Criminalistics in Zagreb, where an autopsy was performed, and  after that they were taken by their families.    It is of particular interest that the automobile of the  murdered Milan Ivosevic was found in the possession of those  suspected of having murdered the Zec family. The police returned  that car to the Ivosevic family. According to the testimony of  one of the members of the MUP reserve unit who was interrogated,  Milos Ivosevic was arrested by order of Zvonko Trusic.  <H5>  The Murder and Robbery of Stevan Brajenovic </H5>   The next case that the "Report" describes in detail concerns  another customs officer, Stevan Brajenovic, head of the Dobovo  customhouse, who on 8 November 1991 was taken from his residence  at No. 14 Djuro Simunic Street in Zagreb by B.T., M.B., and two  other members of "Mercep's unit."    According to the "Report," the auxiliary police also drove  away Brajenovic's Toyota Corolla. Brajenovic was taken to the  Zagreb fairgrounds and then to Pakracka Poljana, where on 12  December 1991 he received a wound in the abdomen. He was shot by  a guard nicknamed Karlo. At the time when the "Report" was  written, Brajenovic's car was being used to meet the unit's  needs, and the money taken from Brajenovic (about DM10,000) was  delivered to P.Dj., an active employee of the Police Department  in Zagreb, who for a time was commander of the unit in Pakracka  Poljana.  <H5>  The Murder of Ina Zoricic-Nuic </H5>   The authors of the "Report" make reference to the statement  by M.S., who said that Brajenovic was arrested by order of  Zvonko Trusic. The following case, which the "Report" describes  in detail, does not involve Croatian citizens of Serbian  nationality, but a Croatian woman, whose disappearance has been  frequently discussed in our media. We are referring to Ina  Zoricic-Nuic, known as Marina Nuic, born 1960. Marina Nuic was  the head of the HDS in Kraljevica. Her father was a member of  the HDZ, and Mrs. Nuic was responsible for the housing of  refugees from Slavonia in the coastal area known as Primorje.    According to the "Report," she was arrested on 3 November  1991 near the Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb at the funeral of Pavo  Mlinaric, a member of the MUP reserve unit that has been  referred to here.    The authors of the "Report" think that Ina Zoricic-Nuic was  arrested because she had prepared an assassination attempt on  Tomislav Mercep. In any case, she was also taken to the Zagreb  fairgrounds, where she was interrogated by P.Dj., the unit's  commander who has already been mentioned. Following the  interrogation, Ina Zoricic-Nuic, the "Report" explicitly states,  was taken to Pakracka Poljana by order of Tomislav Mercep  himself. J.A. and S.R., members of the MUP reserve unit, shot  and killed her in Pakracka Poljana. Ina Zoricic-Nuic, according  to the "Report," was buried approximately 1 km from the  improvised prison in Pakracka Poljana in the direction of Janja  Lipa.  <H5>  The Murder of Aleksandar Antic </H5>   One other Croat was killed at that time in Pakracka Poljana.  This was Aleksandar Antic, who himself belonged to the MUP  reserve unit. Aleksandar "Sasa" Antic was allegedly killed  because he had taken from Tomislav Mercep's car "a sizable  number of blank identity cards of reserves of the MUP of the  Republic of Croatia." The "Report" says that Antic was killed by  I.M. and S.R., members of the same unit, and that the commanders  of that unit knew about the murder.    The "Report" also states that N.P. and B.V., Serbs from  Kutina who had to dig the grave in which Aleksandar Antic was  buried, were present at the murder of Aleksandar Antic.    N.P. and B.V., Serbs from Kutina, are the only victims whose  names we are not publishing, solely because these are people who  survived Pakracka Poljana. According to the police report, they  were arrested by K.P., a member of the MUP reserve unit who  owned a private butcher shop in Zagreb, with the help of several  persons whom the police had been unable to identify at the time  when the report was written.    Two Mercedeses and one BMW were taken from the Kutina Serbs,  as well as appliances and equipment from their homes. N.P. and  B.V. spent about a month in prison without any court order  whatsoever. During that time, according to the "Report," they  were tortured (electric current was applied to them, wire and  nightsticks were forced into their rectum, and so forth). They  were released on 18 December 1991. One of them spent some time  in Zagreb hospitals, where he was treated for injuries received  while he was in prison.    The "Report" says that several dozen persons from the area  of  Zagreb, Kutina, and other towns were taken to the prison in  Pakracka Poljana, "from what we know now." The drafters of the  "Report" suggest that the persons taken were mainly quite rich,  and "quite valuable personal property" was taken from them at  the same time.  <H5>  The Murder of Djuro Dobrota and Nedeljko Igric </H5>   Certain cases of the unclarified disappearance of Croatian  citizens in other parts of the country are also mentioned near  the end of the "Report." It says first that "the unit of the MUP  RH reserve unit under command of Mr. Tomislav Mercep" took part  in military operations in the region of Vukovar and then in the  region of Gospic. It says that on the territory of Gospic that  unit operated the same way it had on the territory of Pakrac. It  refers to several cases of murder or kidnapping.    Thus, in Karlobag, according to the "Report," members of the  MUP reserve unit that Tomislav Mercep formed took custody of and  arrested the retired policeman Djuro Dobrota, whose personal car  they confiscated. S.J., M.I., and R.S. shot Dobrota on the road  between Velebeni and Ostarija.    These same reserve policemen, members of the special Mercep  unit, arrested in Karlobag Nedeljko Igric, whom, according to  the "Report," they beat with a metal rod in a police Landrover.  Then they executed him before a firing squad.    The automobile of Momcilo Cipcic of Gospic, who was taken to  Karlobag with his wife Veselinka and two Croats, was also found  in the possession of members of that unit. The Ciplic family and  their friends, who disappeared in the autumn of 1991, had not  been found by the time when the "Report" was written.    The "Report" also mentions a case from Vukovar, where  Tomislav Mercep was the principal organizer of the city's  defense until the arrival of Mile "Hawk" Dedakovic, who is being  tried right now in Zagreb for having embezzled money.    The authors of the "Report" believe that a person nicknamed  "Gango" in the group of M.P., one of the leaders of the defense  of Vukovar in the summer of 1991, murdered the director of the  SDK [Social Accounting Service] in Vukovar and took from the  safe a large amount of money (the figure of no less than DM20  million is mentioned!), as well as jewelry, gems, and works of  art.    At the very end of the "Report" it is said that the cited  information was obtained through talks with the murder suspects,  who were all members of the MUP reserve unit under the command  of Tomislav Mercep.    The suspects were arrested and detained in the rooms of the  police administration headquarters in Zagreb on the basis of the  Decree on Internal Affairs in Wartime or Time of Immediate  Threat to the Independence and Unity of the Republic of Croatia.    It should also be emphasized that the drafters of the  "Report," operatives in one of the Croatian security services,  mentioned the possibility that the members of the MUP reserve  unit, which was stationed in Pakracka Poljana, had lists of  people they were supposed to arrest and execute. Those lists  included names of Serbs and Croats, including even certain  employees of the Zagreb Police Department and the MUP of the  Republic of Croatia.  <H5>  Will Any Members of the HDZ Be Charged With War Crimes? </H5>   Members of the unit in Pakracka Poljana obtained the  necessary information about employees of the Zagreb Police  Department and the MUP by telephoning the Zagreb Police  Department, according to the information of the authors of the  "Report," mainly after 2100 hours. It is also important that  some members of the reserve unit, who had been under suspicion  of having actually committed murders, kidnappings, and  robberies, were recorded in police files even earlier as  criminals and thugs.    The Croatian police obviously took extensive steps to combat  the lawlessness and violence that existed in certain parts of  the Croatian Government. Much of the information published in  the "Report"--which is classified as a state secret--was  gathered back in late 1991 and early 1992.    The "Report" itself was submitted to several of the highest  officials of the Croatian Government this past spring.    Before we came into the possession of one of the few copies  of the "Report," one of the ministers in the Croatian Government  warned us that in view of the interest of UN representatives in  war crimes on the territory of Croatia some of the Croatian  politicians might soon find themselves before an international  court!    If certain Croatian political leaders received the "Report"  back in the spring, it is logical to put the question: Why was  nothing undertaken by the judiciary, especially the state  prosecutor's office? Did Stjepan Herceg have to resign because  he did not win a single important case, or because he did not  want to act against people suspected of serious crimes who at  the same time had played a heroic role in the homeland war?    One of the most difficult postwar problems in Croatia is the  attitude toward those volunteers in the homeland war who  violated international war conventions (which Croatia has  adopted) and who committed crimes which cannot be justified from  the civilian and peacetime standpoint.    This problem is especially serious if any politicians still  active are among the perpetrators.    One of the most complicated aspects of the conflict in the  Croatian Democratic Union concerns the fact that certain  distinguished members of the incumbent party may be charged with  war crimes as well as with wrecking the political and legal  system of the Republic of Croatia.    The leadership of the government and party still have not  found the strength to face this danger.</p>

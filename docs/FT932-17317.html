			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Grampian Holdings GRAMPIAN Holdings, the Glasgow-based pharmaceuticals, transport and sports company, announced maintained profits for last year; however, the figures would have been well down without exceptional profits from the sale of sporting goods maker Mitre. Pre-tax profits increased 2 per cent to Pounds 11.4m in the 1992 year. Excluding a net exceptional gain of Pounds 4.81m, pre-tax profits on continuing business fell 31 per cent to Pounds 6.64m. Mr Bill Hughes, chairman and chief executive, said the company suffered from difficult trading conditions and depressed margins. Included in the exceptional figure was a loss of Pounds 3.7m to cover restructuring charges in the Patrick subsidiary. Mr Hughes said further restructuring moves under way at the pharmaceuticals division would lead to costs of at least Pounds 1m this year. Turnover increased 11 per cent to Pounds 141.3m. The pharmaceuticals division continued to increase its share of overall group profits, despite a near 20 per cent fall in the division's profits to Pounds 5.2m. In the sporting goods division, restructuring and weak consumer demand led to a sharp fall in profits from Pounds 1.29m to Pounds 16,000. The transport division, affected by lower demand from the construction industry, saw profits fall from Pounds 1.96m to Pounds 1.56m. Earnings increased 15 per cent to 14.71p (12.77p). Excluding the exceptional gain, they would have fallen to 7.18p. A second interim dividend of 3.8p makes an unchanged total for the year of 5.5p.</p>

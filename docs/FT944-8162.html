			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (31): Heavy burdens of history - Quentin Peel / An era ends, but German foreign policy stays cautious When the last Russian troops marched past the giant Soviet war memorial in East Berlin last August, followed a week later by the beating of the retreat for the western allies, it marked more than the end of an era. It symbolised the recovery of sovereignty for a united Germany. The two events to celebrate the final departure of the erstwhile troops of occupation - still too sensitive to be combined in a single ceremony, in spite of the end of the Cold War - drew a clear line under the post-war period. They also highlighted the fact that four years after unification, the debate on Germany's national identity, its national interests, and its proper international role, is still unresolved. The calls for such a rethink are coming from all sides. At home, they have been made from left and right, from such distinguished figures of the past as former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, as well as from the present generation of politicians, like Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of the ruling Christian Democrats (CDU). The international community, from US President Bill Clinton to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general of the United Nations, is also urging Europe's most powerful State to assume its full international responsibilities. Given the importance of the issue, it is perhaps surprising that it did not play a larger role in this year's marathon election campaign. The whole theme of unification, its costs and domestic consequences, was paramount. Yet the foreign policy consequences failed to emerge as a cause of dispute. One reason is no doubt because foreign policy has traditionally been an area of cross-party consensus, with the pursuit of unification its prime focus. The main parties of the political establishment - the Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and Free Democrats - have always agreed on the need for ever closer integration into the European union. It was seen as the other side of the coin to German unification, the essential reassurance for the rest of Europe that a unified Germany would be no threat. And it worked. A second reason for the lack of real popular debate is the instinctive desire, which runs deep through the German population, for foreign policy initiatives to be cautious and re-active, not adventurous and pro-active. The devastating experience of Nazi rule and wartime defeat has left a deep suspicion of anything which might smack of German high-handedness, in spite of the stereotypes still peddled in parts of the foreign press. Hence the resistance to any serious discussion of the 'national interest' in foreign policy. In spite of all that, the discussion is well under way in the smoke-filled rooms of Bonn. Inevitably, Europe is the dominant focus - but now with the opening of western Europe to the east quite as important an issue for German policy-makers is the continuing integration of the European Union in the west. Germany is the one member of the EU which is equally committed to widening and deepening simultaneously, unlike the French, who are primarily interested in deepening, or the British, who really just want the widening. In a key-note paper, Reflections on European Policy, published by the CDU group in the Bundestag in September, the rationale was clearly spelt out: 'The only solution which will prevent a return to the unstable pre-war system, with Germany once again caught between East and West, is to integrate Germany's central and eastern European neighbours into the (west) European post-war system, and to establish a wide-ranging partnership between this system and Russia,' it said. 'Never again must there be a destabilising vacuum of power in central Europe.' It adds: 'Germany has a fundamental interest both in widening the EU to the East, and in strengthening it through deepening. Indeed, deepening is a precondition for widening. Without such further internal strengthening, the Union would be unable to meet the enormous challenge of eastward expansion. It might fall apart, and once again become no more than a loose grouping of States unable to guarantee stability.' The latter is Germany's horror scenario - a weakening of the western institutions which have underpinned security and stability since 1945, just as eastern Europe is itself under enormous strain. For Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his absolute commitment to the cause of European integration has been a key factor in persuading him to stay in office at least until 1998. He intends to be a driving force for another big step towards European integration at the 1996 EU intergovernmental conference. However, German policy-makers are keen not to frighten their partners - not least the British - from the conference table. 'Let us look for practical policies to resolve practical problems,' says a senior German diplomat. The practical problems are jobs and competitiveness; peace and stability in Europe; and overcoming the divide between rich and poor, which threatens to engulf western Europe in a new wave of migration from both south and east. Then he argues that none of those problems can be resolved by the traditional nation-state: they require trans-national solutions. Yet even if the European integration process is common ground, there are clear divisions in Germany about how it should proceed. There are also differences over how the opening to the east can be accomplished. And there is still disagreement over just what role Germany should be playing in the wider peace-keeping process on the world stage. The Christian Democrat paper on Europe argued that a 'hard core' of European integrationists, encompassing Germany, France and the Benelux countries, was inevitable, because only they would be able to join economic and monetary union (Emu) in 1999. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, immediately rejected the idea as by implication, if not intention, too 'exclusive'. Mr Kinkel, a Free Democrat, is also at loggerheads with Mr Volker Ruhe, the minister of defence, who is urging rapid membership of Nato for Poland and the other central European states, but the clear exclusion of Russia. The foreign minister is far more concerned not to offend Moscow, nor to leave the defenceless Baltic republics isolated, by creating a new European divide on the Polish border. As for the whole process of peace-keeping, Mr Ruhe and the Christian Democrats are most concerned to give the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces, a new role by widespread participation in UN exercises, while both Mr Kinkel's FDP and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) are more cautious. Each occasion will require the specific approval of the German Bundestag, and each time there will undoubtedly be a huge debate. These are the issues which will continue to divide the political establishment as it seeks to define Germany's new role. But in outline, perhaps, that role is already clear: Germany will be the swing power in Europe, involved in an eternal balancing act between east and west, seeking to reconcile and integrate. It will do so with one hand still tied behind its back. For it will still be loath to lead, and merely seek to react to the initiatives of others.</p>

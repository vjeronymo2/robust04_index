			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Cathay Pacific to acquire 75% stake in Air HK Cathay Pacific Airways, the Hong Kong airline controlled by Swire Pacific, is to acquire a 75 per cent stake in Air Hong Kong, an air freight carrier based in the colony, from Shun Tak Holdings, the Macao jetfoil, property and restaurants group. The purchase remains subject to a due diligence review. Cathay Pacific plans to run the business as a stand-alone operation, similar to the Dragonair model. However, there will also be economies of scale in areas such as maintenance, marketing and route planning. Air Hong Kong currently leases a fleet of three Boeing 747 freighters.</p>

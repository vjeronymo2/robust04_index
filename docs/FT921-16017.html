			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report NICKEL prices touched seven-week highs at the London Metal Exchange yesterday before meeting profit-taking in after-hours trading. The three months delivery price peaked at Dollars 7,405 a tonne in thin afternoon trading as a rise encouraged by short-covering touched off stop-loss buying orders. Traders noted that sentiment had been changed by Friday's late news of possible production cuts by Falconbridge of Canada. The profit-taking trimmed the price back to Dollars 7,385 a tonne at the final kerb close, but that was still Dollars 157.50 up from Friday's close. Copper prices were in retreat until the equalling during the afternoon of last May's 1991 lows (in dollar terms) encouraged support buying. Dealers said Far Eastern buying was also supportive. At the close the cash position was quoted at Pounds 1,134 a tonne, down Pounds 16.50 on the day, while the three months delivery position was at Pounds 1,162.75 a tonne, down Pounds 17. Zinc prices were also under pressure but, like copper, finished off the bottom. Dealers said the market again fell prey to long liquidation in fairly brisk afternoon trade. The cash price, which fell Dollars 26 on Friday, lost another Dollars 28 to close at Dollars 1,117 a tonne, while the three months quotation was Dollars 19 down at Dollars 1,086.50 a tonne.

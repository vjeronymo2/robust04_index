			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Accidental release of an arsenic compound at a Hewlett-Packard Co.  manufacturing facility in north San Jose injured five workers, fire officials  said. Five production workers at the plant were overcome by fumes released by a  malfunctioning gallium arsenide reactor, officials said. Four victims were  treated at a hospital and released, a company spokeswoman said. Another worker  was treated at the scene. Gallium arsenide, a mixture of gallium and arsenic,  is used in the production of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the spokeswoman  said. LEDs are the illuminated digital readouts on clock radios, other  electronic appliances and automobile instrument panels.  </P></p>

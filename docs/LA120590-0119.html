Bob Johnson, retiring after 13 years as El Toro High School's football  coach (C1), may be remembered best for making 1987's most spectacular catch. .  . . That fall, Johnson sneaked away from football practice and up to an RV  parked nearby, swung open the door and found one of his former players  videotaping El Toro's plays. . . . It turned out the tapes were going to the  coach at archenemy Capistrano Valley High School, and that cost that coach his  job. Tom Hamilton and Cathy Curtis  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 2. What supporting information should be submitted to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an institution has the administrative resources to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with its program responsibilities?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The financial information concerning each branch campus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an institution should be evaluated, without simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relying on the financial information of an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a whole. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Employee biographies with social security numbers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be provided. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. What level of financial resources are needed to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an institution can meet potential refund and repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations, and should institutions be required to set aside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds for these purposes?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An institution should be able to provide for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment of refunds that could occur over a 30-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, but the institution should not be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set aside funds specifically for this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The statutory provisions for institutions to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cash reserves unless they are covered by State tuition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery plans should be sufficient. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No requirements are necessary. The Department should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the discretion to review and establish amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when necessary. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Section 498(c)(2) requires that, notwithstanding section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 498(c)(1), if an institution fails to meet the criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed by the Secretary with respect to operating losses, net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worth, asset-to-liabilities ratios, or operating fund deficits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution must provide the Secretary with satisfactory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence of its financial responsibility in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 498(c)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues that the community was asked to address and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community's views:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What standards should be set for each of these criteria?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;One standard should not be applicable to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Institutions should be allowed to explain their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statements before decisions in this area are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reached. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The institutions financial condition should be examined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over a certain time period so that decisions regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its financial responsibility are based on a trend.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Department should particularly consider an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's statement of cash flow. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ratios that are used to measure stability in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business world should be used. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Current standards should be used with Departmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Standards for these criteria should be: a ratio of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets to liabilities of 1:1, showing a positive net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worth, and not having two consecutive years of negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cash flow or its equivalent for fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting purposes. These should be indicators of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility, not absolute minimums. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance of each criteria should be given its proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Section 498(c)(3) provides that the Secretary may find an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to be financially responsible, notwithstanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure under 498(c)(1) and 498(c)(2), if the institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provides third-party guarantees of at least one-half of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual potential liabilities, (2) is backed by the full faith and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit of a State or its equivalent, (3) establishes that it is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> going concern capable of meeting all its obligations, or (4) has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met comparable standards set by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues that the community was asked to address and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community's views:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What type of third-party guarantees will be acceptable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Acceptable third-party guarantees should include bonds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional collateral, or a tuition recovery fund. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Acceptable third-party guarantees should include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance bonds, letters of credit, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable instruments.

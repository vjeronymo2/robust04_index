			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Customs efficiency International air travellers at Washington's Dulles airport are getting cleared through customs more rapidly without any let-up in catching drug smugglers, according to US treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Bentsen says it took an average 35 minutes to clear a passenger through customs at Dulles in 1992, against five minutes now. Inspectors are better trained to look for smugglers, he suggests, adding that airlines are pointing officials towards likely smugglers. There were nine large seizures of heroin totaling 16lb at the airport two years ago, compared with 19 that yielded 59lb so far this year.</p>

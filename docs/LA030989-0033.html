			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES: SAN DIEGO COUNTY  </P> <P> TRW said the previously announced sale of its La Jolla-based TRW LSI Products  division to KDT Industries has fallen through. As a result, TRW will retain  ownership of the operation.  </P> <P> TRW LSI employs more than 300 people and manufactures large-scale integrated  circuits used in medical instrument, broadcast video and defense applications.  Its Cleveland-based parent said previously that it would divest itself of the  LSI unit and other electronics operations in a bid to restructure along  aeronautics, information and automotive product lines.  </P></p>

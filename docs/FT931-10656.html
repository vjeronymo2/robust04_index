			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Workers at warship yard go on strike WORKERS at the Yarrow warship yard on Clydeside have gone on indefinite strike for the first time since 1985 after rejecting the company's pay offer and their union officials' recommendation to accept it. The 1,300 strikers, who are employed at the most successful of Britain's bigger warship yards, want a substantial increase on their basic weekly rate, now Pounds 218 for a skilled man. The company's two-year offer would give them a Pounds 300 lump sum payment immediately followed by a 3.8 per cent rise in July. In return, the company wants some changes to working practices, including the abolition of a Friday morning tea-break. Strikes are now rare at the once militant Clyde shipyards, and in the UK as a whole there were only 21 stoppages in November 1992, the last month for which figures are available. The strike at Yarrow is unlikely to herald a new wave of industrial action. Public sector workers appear reluctant to take action against the government's 1.5 per cent pay norm and, according to the Confederation of British Industry, nearly one company in three is freezing pay or at least deferring the annual pay rise. The CBI data are contested by pay analyst Incomes Data Services, which says that only one settlement in six is being frozen. National Westminster and Lloyds banks have decided to award no general increase. Yarrow, owned by Britain's General Electric Company, is in a relatively comfortable position, with orders for five Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy and two for the Malaysian navy. But the company said there was no more money to offer and that any strike would have an adverse effect on future orders in the tight defence market. It recently made 400 workers redundant at the yard, which employs a total of 2,300 people. Mr Ernie Horan, convener of the unions at Yarrow, said: 'We have accepted some unpalatable deals over the last few years, when we have been fighting for our lives. Clearly people feel that with the orders there now there's a bit more leeway.' Pay rates were last increased by the rate of inflation in July 1991 as part of a two-year deal.</p>

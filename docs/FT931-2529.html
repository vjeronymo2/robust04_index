			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Pounds 100m stadium to be centrepiece of Manchester's Olympic bid The futuristic Pounds 100m stadium proposed for Manchester. A centrepiece of the city's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games, the stadium will seat 80,000 people. The overall project - worth Pounds 150m - includes a separate 6,000-seat facility for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics with a mix of retail and leisure facilities. The designers envisage that access roads approaching the stadium will form a 'Catherine wheel' to encourage commercial development near the complex, instead of drawing it away. The plan for the 121-acre facility has been drawn up by architects Sir Norman Foster and Partners. It will be about a mile from the city centre</p>

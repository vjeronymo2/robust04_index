			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 4 (AFP) -- France, Germany and  Britain rejected demands from the European Parliament here  Friday [4 March] to add ECU400 million (450 million dollars) to  a five-year research budget of ECU13 billion (15 billion  dollars).    Diplomats said an EU [European Union] research ministerial  council had called a meeting of a special conciliation committee  created under the Maastricht Treaty to arbitrate differences  between the council and the Euro-parliament.    The parliament wants more money spent on research, but the  diplomats quoted the French, German and British research  ministers as saying there was no excuse for lavish spending in a  time of economic recession. The council had originally budgeted  ECU11 billion (12.4 billion dollars) for research spending  between 1994 and 1998, and the Parliament had demanded ECU14  billion (15.8 billion dollars). Eventually the council settled  on ECU12 billion plus a "reserve" of another billion -- 400  million dollars less than what the Parliament decided was its  bottom line.    The conciliation committee comprises 12 EU ministers and 12  Euro-MP's. It has 12 weeks to find a compromise. The budget  aims at funding research mainly in information, communication,  industrial and environmental technologies.</p>

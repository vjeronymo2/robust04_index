			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Sterling expected to keep ERM level MOST FUND managers expect sterling to make it through 1992 without a realignment within the European exchange rate mechanism, according to a survey by Smith New Court, the securities house, and Gallup, the polling organisation. Sterling has recently been at the bottom of its ERM range, prompting fears that the government might be forced either to devalue the pound or raise interest rates to defend the currency. A total of 75 per cent of the fund managers polled do not expect a realignment during the year, with only 3 per cent predicting a devaluation before the general election. If Labour wins the election, 4 per cent expect an immediate realignment and 17 per cent believe there will be a post-election devaluation, regardless of who forms the next government. Nor do the fund managers appear to expect a rise in base rates from the present 10.5 per cent. The fund managers' average expectation for base rates is 10.2 per cent after three months and 9.5 per cent after 12 months. There is only mild optimism about the UK economy in 1992, with just 14 per cent of interviewees expecting the economy to get 'a lot better'. A total of 77 per cent think the economy will get 'a little better', and only 1 per cent expect it to get 'a lot worse'. Over the next 12 months, the balance of fund managers favour building up their UK, European and Japanese equity positions and winding down their holdings of US equities and cash. The survey was conducted on January 6 and 7, with 10 institutions taking part, managing funds totalling Pounds 533bn.</p>

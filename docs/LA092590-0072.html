			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> JET PARTS: CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM;  </P> <P> SUPPLIERS ARE FREE TO INSPECT THEIR OWN PARTS. SUCH QUALITY CONTROL LEEWAY  LEAVES THE TESTING INDUSTRY OPEN TO FRAUD, AND AIR TRAVELERS VULNERABLE TO  TRAGEDY.  </P> <P> The crash of a DC-10 jetliner last summer in Sioux City, Iowa, which killed 112  people and miraculously spared 184, was ordained 18 years earlier.  </P> <P> In 1971, a titanium disk was installed in a General Electric jet engine, which  was later mounted onto the DC-10. But the disk had a flaw, one that would go  undetected in one inspection test after another.  </P> <P> On July 19, 1989, the disk disintegrated, knocked out most of the jet's control  system and sent the plane cartwheeling down the runway -- earning the accident  a grim distinction as one of the most deadly failures of quality control  testing in U.S. aircraft history.  </P> <P> Although there is no evidence of wrongdoing, a federal investigation has  revealed that GE and its subcontractors had concerns from the beginning about  whether its quality control tests were adequate.  </P> <P> The disclosure comes amid growing concerns that the system for testing  commercial and military aircraft components is deeply flawed and can have  tragic consequences.  </P> <P> Industry experts point to basic deficiencies. There are no mandatory standards  for individuals or companies that conduct tests. And the testing process turns  on an honor system, leaving manufacturers free to pass judgment on the quality  of their own parts.  </P> <P> "The need for improvement is . . . obvious," said Desmond D. Dewey, executive  director of the American Society for Nondestructive Testing, the leading  technical organization for U.S. testing standards.  </P> <P> At its worst, the system appears wide open to fraud. In dozens of felony cases,  aerospace contractors have been convicted of falsifying tests on such products  as aircraft castings, missile welds, cockpit instruments, engine bolts and  missile guidance systems -- parts that can cost anywhere from 50 cents to  $10,000 apiece. In some cases, federal officials don't know where the defective  parts have ended up.  </P> <P> Owners of aerospace subcontractors describe a system where financial pressures  have had a corrosive effect. If parts are rejected as substandard, suppliers  can lose bonuses for prompt deliveries; so suppliers cover up their quality  problems.  </P> <P> Suppliers often threaten to take business away from independent labs if they  don't certify their parts. Although most labs resist the pressure to certify  bad parts, some in Southern California are known as "Certs R Us" shops, as one  machine shop owner describes them. Inspectors who stand their ground are often  fired.  </P> <P> "I suppose government authorities will address this subject when we slam a 747  into an office building and it is attributed to falsified tests and  certification on a component of the airplane," said Ron Cedillos, owner of  Cedillos Testing Co., a Long Beach lab.  </P> <P> There is some movement toward reform. The testing society is seeking to  establish national standards for inspectors. And Rep. Dana Rohrabacher  (R-Lomita) instructed the Federal Aviation Administration in a House report  this year to look into a system that would require independent lab testing of  aircraft parts.  </P> <P> Future legislation is likely to require not only that independent labs conduct  tests, but also that tests be paid for by prime contractors rather than their  suppliers. Prime contractors presumably would insist that parts be top-quality  and suppliers wouldn't be able to shop for accommodating labs. Very few  aerospace contractors have such a system today. One exception in Southern  California is General Dynamics' Pomona Division.  </P> <P> Although aircraft are made of several hundred tons of aluminum, as a general  rule their structures are supposed to have no defect larger than the head of a  pin -- more precisely, 3/64ths of an inch.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Testing Expensive  </P> <P> Much of a plane's critical primary structure -- the ribs, spars and frames  whose loss could cause an accident -- must be free of any detectable defect.  That means no voids, cracks or contamination of the metal or composite  plastics.  </P> <P> Assuring those standards depends on non-destructive testing, a procedure in  which a part is not cut apart or otherwise destroyed to determine quality. By  some estimates, 5% or more of an aircraft's cost can be attributed to the  expense of testing parts. With jetliners costing up to $125 million apiece,  testing can cost $6.25 million.  </P> <P> At the heart of quality control testing is the quality of those who do the  tests. An estimated 80% of the nation's 12,000 top inspectors -- so called  Level III test technicians -- have been qualified only by their own employers  and have never passed tests administered by technical societies.  </P> <P> Level III inspectors are the most capable, supervising Level II inspectors and  writing procedures for them to follow. Level I inspectors, often considered  trainees, have limited responsibilities.  </P> <P> There are no rules about what must be covered in written exams for inspectors,  and parts suppliers are able to hire anyone they want to administer exams to  inspectors and certify them.  </P> <P> "There are . . . unethical people out there" who will administer examinations  of any degree of difficulty that a company wants, said Ron Selner, manager of  technical services at the American Society of Nondestructive Testing. "We have  even seen documents that . . . say if a guy fails a Level II exam and gets 60%  of the answers correct, then he is a Level I . . . You ought to go back and  give him a Level I test. He may not be any better on a Level I."  </P> <P> The current system of quality control testing gives enormous responsibility to  inspectors. They face enormous pressures as well. Honest disagreements over the  quality of parts can turn into heated confrontations. If inspectors stand up  for what they believe, they risk getting fired.  </P> <P> Consider Michael Lee Meadows. The veteran aerospace inspector refused to  certify a Navy missile casing based on his evaluation that it had signs of a  crack. His boss at El Segundo-based Airite Division of Dover Sargent Co., a  forging house, disagreed with the conclusion. "He asked me if my opinion would  be any different if I were standing in an unemployment line," Meadows recalled.  </P> <P> Meadows, 38, refused to certify the part and was fired last year as a Level III  non-destructive test technician. He now lives in Mojave and works for the Air  Force.  </P> <P> Richard La Chance, Airite's general manager, said the $10,000 missile casing  that Meadows wanted to reject was good and that Airite's metallurgist sided  against Meadows. La Chance said the company had earlier destroyed another  missile casing in a special destructive test to satisfy an assertion by Meadows  that it was bad. La Chance said the destructive tests showed the unit was good,  but Meadows said that the test proved that casing to be defective.  </P> <P> "The question was, when I have a referee -- and then another referee -- and I  still can't get parts moved, what do I do at that point?" La Chance said. "He  refused to be a part of the team."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A High Price  </P> <P> Leading quality-control experts say such incidents are not uncommon. "I lost my  own boy three jobs in quality control simply because I taught him don't take  anything that is second best and don't stand for any unethical practices by  management," said Selner, the executive at the American Society of  Nondestrutive Testing. "Because he wouldn't sign off for (defective) things, he  got ditched. Now that was not the purported reason that he got laid off or  fired, but that's why he lost his job."  </P> <P> There are a range of quality-control tests. The most widely used include:  fluorescent penetrant inspections, in which parts are dipped into a dye that  exposes cracks under a black light; magnetic particle inspections, in which  magnetic fields combined with a dye help to expose cracks; radiography, in  which parts are X-rayed; and ultrasonic tests, in which sound waves detect  flaws in the grain of the metal.  </P> <P> The tests are sophisticated, but the cover-ups are simple.  </P> <P> One inspection process requires that only a sample of parts be tested, but if  any one part in the sample fails, then the whole batch must be tested. Getting  around that requirement is easy. When a bad part shows up, throw it back into  the batch, pick out another part and keep testing until you have all the good  test parts you need. In one variation of the scheme, the same good parts are  used over and over in X-ray examinations.  </P> <P> Cases of outright fraud are increasing. VSI Inc., a leading supplier of  aerospace rivets and other fasteners, pleaded guilty in May to four counts of  falsifying test results. Two former quality control supervisors at the firm's  Voi-Shan unit in Chatsworth also pleaded guilty.  </P> <P> Voi-Shan possessed an approval stamp for "Inspector 11," but there was no  Inspector 11. Rather, the stamp was used to approve defective parts, said Tom  Runion, one of two Voi-Shan inspectors whose allegations led to the criminal  probe. An estimated 37,000 certifications were made using the Inspector 11  stamp, according to Runion's attorney, Will Ramsey.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Northrop paid a record $17-million fine earlier this year  when it pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it falsified tests of guidance  systems for nuclear-armed cruise missiles.  </P> <P> In Tampa, Fla., Aerodyne Investment Castings pleaded guilty last year to  criminal charges that it certified castings for warplanes and tanks made with  scrap metal rather than the required virgin alloy.  </P> <P> Derek J. Vander Schaaf, the Pentagon's deputy inspector general, says phony  testing is one of his top priorities in investigating defense fraud. "We have  had dozens and dozens of cases that have been pressed over the years," he said.  </P> <P> But many Pentagon officials in the field view fraudulent testing as a minor  problem.  </P> <P> "We like to think of (fraud) as more of an exception than the rule," said  Robert Gibson, a branch chief for quality assurance at the Pentagon's Defense  Contract Management Region office in Los Angeles. "We deal with 5,000 (firms in  the Southern California) region. If we thought they were all fraudulent, we  would need an organization as large as the industry to police it."  </P> <P> The Pentagon has a local staff of 636 quality assurance representatives and  specialists, who receive eight weeks of formal job training and then go on to  audit contractors and conduct actual inspections of parts in some cases.  </P> <P> Fearful of fraud and sloppiness, some private firms are getting tougher on  suppliers. Boeing, the world's leading aircraft producer, has tightened  surveillance of suppliers in recent months, though it asserts that Boeing  aircraft are safe. The company has recently assigned six workers to a special  unit for investigating allegations of flawed products and improper testing.  </P> <P> "The industry has had a lot of problems with fraud cases, and we felt that was  an untenable situation," said Bob Bogash, Boeing's director of quality  surveillance. In addition to the fraud unit, Boeing has a contingent of several  dozen quality-control representatives in Southern California.  </P> <P> Warren Rose, owner of Bell Gardens-based V&amp;W Castings, discovered the hard  way about the Boeing quality-control representatives. On a routine inspection  several weeks ago, a Boeing man spotted an unauthorized welding repair being  performed on a V&amp;W casting. As a result, Boeing disqualified V&amp;W as a  supplier, Rose said.  </P> <P> Boeing will permit such welding repairs, Rose said, but only if it gives  authorization -- something he didn't get. "They saw the welded casting, and at  that point they blew the whistle," Rose said. Despite the problem, he asserted,  "I have integrity. I fly on airplanes myself. I don't want to go down because  of a defective part."  </P> <P> Although faulty parts won't necessarily cause an aircraft to crash, the failure  of some critical parts poses major safety risks. The jet engine disk that  ruptured in the Sioux City DC-10 accident was one such part.  </P> <P> The disk started as a billet of titanium cast at the Titanium Metals Corp. of  America in New Jersey and then was forged into a 27-inch disk at Alcoa Corp. in  Cleveland. The last stop was at GE's jet engine plant in Kentucky. It was  apparently inspected at each factory, but the flaw was never detected.  </P> <P> When the disk failed, metal fragments disabled three hydraulic systems on the  DC-10, leaving the jumbo jet with virtually no controls.  </P> <P> Since the disk was made 19 years ago, General Electric and its vendors have  changed their processes, and company officials testified in a government  hearing that a flaw such as the one at issue in the Sioux City crash is now  less likely to occur. General Electric officials declined to be interviewed.  </P> <P> The accident hearings, however, have raised questions about whether tests were  capable of detecting the flaw even if performed correctly. Memorandums  uncovered by federal investigators indicate that GE and Alcoa officials had  questions about the adequacy of the tests dating back to 1972.  </P> <P> Moreover, serious discrepancies were found in GE's quality control records. Six  so-called "sister disks" from the same batch of titanium were still operating  in other engines at the time of the crash, according to production records. But  when federal investigators recalled those disks, chemical analysis showed that  they could not have been from the same batch, a spokesman for the National  Transportation Safety Board said. The mystery remains unsolved.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the FAA is concerned about what the Sioux City accident says about  shortcomings in the system of parts testing. Leading outside experts are  dismayed. Says Dewey, the testing society official, "We cringe when we see  those kinds of things."  </P></p>

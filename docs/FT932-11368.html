			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Threat of US mine strikes THE United Mine Workers union is threatening strike action at the US's largest coal mines, in a stand-off over job security, reports Laurie Morse from Chicago. Mr Jim Grossfeld of the union said miners worked without a contract yesterday after a contract extension expired at midnight on Monday. Owners, represented by the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, met union officials on Monday, with federal mediators. No more meetings were scheduled yesterday, Mr Grossfeld said. 'The story is, barring a settlement, every mine of every BCOA operator becomes a strike target,' he added. The BCOA is refusing to guarantee in a new national contract that its members will employ union workers at their new mines. As older coal mines shut and new ones open with non-union labour, the United Mine Workers has been losing its support base. The union targeted Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson of the UK, for a strike on February 2 when the national contract first expired. The strike ended and negotiations resumed on March 2.</p>

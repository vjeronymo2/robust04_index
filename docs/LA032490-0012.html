			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE PLAN TO OFFER CREDIT CARDS  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has scheduled a news conference for  Monday to unveil its plan to offer MasterCard and Visa credit cards in a bid to  boost revenue from consumers, industry analysts said.  </P> <P> An AT&amp;T spokesman confirmed that the company has planned a news conference  for 1 p.m. EST Monday for "a major consumer service" announcement but declined  to give further details.  </P> <P> The company has said it is investigating financial services products and  recently hired several top-notch people from the credit card and financial  services industry.  </P> <P> "People are speculating it is either a MasterCard or Visa," said Greg Sawers,  an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. Analysts previously said AT&amp;T  has hired a financial services banking firm to process credit card services  initially.  </P> <P> Analysts also said they expect there will be some start-up costs that could  shave a few cents off AT&amp;T's 1990 and 1991 earnings but that the cards  should eventually boost profits.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T shares, which trade ex-dividend Monday, closed up 12.5 cents at $41.50  and were the most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P></p>

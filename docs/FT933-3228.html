			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Redefined production alters the shape of recovery THE FALL in manufacturing output towards the end of last year was not as pronounced as previously reported and the rise in the first half of this year was much shallower, redefined production figures showed yesterday. The alteration to the shape of the recovery in manufacturing was the result of a decision by the Central Statistical Office to reweight the components of industrial production and to introduce an export-price deflator. According to the rebased series, manufacturing output grew by 1.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the fourth quarter of last year, rather than by 2 per cent. In the second quarter of this year growth was 0.6 per cent, rather than 1.4 per cent. In the three months to July, the latest available figure, output was up by only 0.1 per cent compared with the previous three months. The series also shows, however, that output in the final quarter of last year was flat rather than fall-ing. These revisions and the most recent figure appear alarming, but year-on-year growth rates have barely altered and still show that manufacturing output is growing at a faster rate than other areas of the economy. In the three months to July output grew by 2.2 per cent compared with the same three months a year ago. The index has been reweighted to reflect more accurately the composition of manufacturing and energy output in the UK. The biggest change since 1985 - when the weightings were last altered - is that the weighting given to oil and gas extraction has been reduced by more than two-thirds because of the sharp fall in oil prices since 1986. The weighting of coal mining has also been halved. Manufacturing now accounts for 85 per cent of overall industrial output, while mining, quarrying, electricity, gas and water supply - those parts not classified as manufacturing - make up 15 per cent. This compares with 70 per cent and 30 per cent under the 1985 weightings. Meanwhile, the CSO has introduced a new definition of manufacturing which takes in coke ovens, mineral oil processing and nuclear fuel production but excludes mining and the quarrying of minerals. The weaker growth in the first half of the year was not entirely because it was being compared with a higher base. It was also due to the introduction of an export-price deflator, used to estimate volumes The new series takes into account the difference between domestic prices and export prices in deflating the sales data used to construct the index of production. Previously home prices were used to deflate all the figures which could be misleading, since export prices often behave differently.</p>

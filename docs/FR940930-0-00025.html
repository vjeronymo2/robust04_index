			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Delta suggested minor changes or clarifications to some of the definitions in the proposed rule. Delta recommended RSPA clarify whether days mean calendar days or twenty-four hour periods. Delta also recommended RSPA revise ``diverted flight'' to read: ``A diverted flight means a flight which is not operated from the originating point(s) to each of the destinations set forth in the carrier's published schedule.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with Delta's comments concerning the definitions, and has amended the definitions in the final rule to show ``days'' mean calendar days; and ``diverted flight'' means a flight operated from the scheduled origin point to a point other than the scheduled destination point in accordance with the carrier's published schedule. Also, since the ensuing flight segment from the nonscheduled destination airport is not a scheduled departure, that flight segment is not reported under Part 234.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Directive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Technical Directive was issued with the original rule in 1987 (Appendix I-Reporting Directive-Office of Aviation Information Management, RSPA, 52 FR 34073, September 9, 1987), which instructed carriers on the proper reporting format. Since then, the Technical Directive has been updated by other accounting and reporting directives, which were issued by OAS. RSPA will reissue the Technical Directive to the industry concurrently with the publication of this rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The reissued Technical Directive includes the changes made in this rulemaking and other effective revisions made in previous Accounting and Reporting Directives. The major revision in the Technical Directive is in the ADP area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, was subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule is considered significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). The purpose of the rule is to improve consumer information on carrier on-time flight performance while, at the same time, reducing carrier costs for providing such information and providing the FAA with the necessary data to reduce flight delays. These objectives will be achieved by amending 14 CFR Part 234. The savings would be derived from the decrease in air traffic delays, resulting from FAA's more efficient management of air traffic. The FAA estimated a mere 1 percent reduction in delays would produce a cost savings of $85 million to the public and industry. According to a study conducted by FAA's Information Systems Branch, the total cost of air traffic delays for calendar year 1990 was $8.5 billion. More recently, on May 27, 1993, in testimony before the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry, Mr. Joseph M. Del Balzo, the FAA's Acting Administrator, stated the ATA estimates that air traffic delays impose annual costs of $8 billion on the nation's airlines and air travelers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

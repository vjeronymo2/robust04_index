			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The U.S. Government identified eight Japanese  industrial sectors -- wood products, paper, plate glass,  computers, supercomputers, electric telecommunications, medical  equipment, and insurance -- as candidates subject to retaliatory  action under the Super 301 trade provision (designed to impose  sanctions on trading-partner nations which employ unfair trade  practices). Companies in all of the sectors -- except for  insurance, which comes under the control of the Finance  Ministry's administration of issuing licenses and permits, and  telecommunications, which enjoys an excess of exports over  imports -- are perplexed and oppose the announcement. It seems  that the plate glass and wood product industries, whose imports  exceed exports, are having difficulty understanding what the  United States' true intentions are. Many of these firms feel  bullish, partly because of a lull in the appreciation of the yen.  <H5>  Plate Glass </H5>   According to 1992 customs clearance statistics, Japan  imported plate glass worth 4.5 billion yen from the United  States, and the United States imported 1.6 billion yen of plate  glass from Japan. The difference is that Japan spent 2.9 billion  yen more than did the United States.    Yasuhiko Kogawa, managing director of Asahi Glass Company,  which is the largest glass producer in Japan, did not hesitate  to express his dissatisfaction. He said: "Japan's imports  exceed exports as far as the flat glass trade with the United  States is concerned. Moreover, the scale of the glass trade  between the two countries is small. Why is the United States so  insistent about the plate glass sector?" In response to a  request made by the United States, the Fair Trade Commission  [FTC] investigated the realities of business practices in the  industrial sectors. As a result, the FTC pointed out that  business ties between glass manufacturers and their special  agents are firm and that there was room for improvement.    However, three plate glass companies maintain that the  progressive rebate and postdiscount systems known as unfair  traditional business practices, which are the cause of keiretsu,  were successively abolished. Therefore, they say that "we no  longer have the systems that can be improved further" (according  to the same managing director).  <H5>  Paper Products </H5>   The same thing can be said about paper products, of which  Japan imports more than it exports. Since a settlement was  reached for the time being following the conclusion of the  Japanese-U.S. paper accord, Takashi Mano, managing director of  the New Oji Paper Company, said: "The use of imported paper is  increasing. Our customers are making their own decisions as to  how to use the imported paper. They are using imported papers  to print newspapers, telephone books, and other items. However,  foreign manufacturers need to make greater efforts to improve  the quality of their products and to meet their promised  delivery dates. We have no cases of unfair traditional business  practices."  <H5>  Electric Telecommunications </H5>   Japan exported telecommunications equipment worth 304.8  billion yen to the United States in fiscal year 1992, but Japan  imported telecommunications equipment worth 70.5 billion yen in  the same year. The United States does not produce fax machines,  which make up one-third of the telecommunications goods that  Japan exports to the United States. As far as network  equipment, such as switchboard machines, is concerned, Japan is  steadily increasing its imports. In fiscal year 1987, Japan  exported 2.7 times as many switchboard machines as it imported.  In fiscal year 1992, however, the situation became reversed,  and the export of network equipment became 0.8 times greater  than imports. The imbalance was corrected. The  Telecommunication Machine and Industry Association gives this  refutation: "The situation improved in fiscal year 1993 as  well. Imports will increase more because a system under which  customers will be able to buy their own mobile telephones  [rather than renting them] will be introduced in April."  <H5>  Wood Products </H5>   Japan is importing 75 percent of the lumber it needs.  Moreover, lumber produced in the United States holds 27 percent  of the market in Japan. Because of this, the National  Federation of Lumber Associations [NFLA] is of the opinion that  "we do not think Japan is a closed market." However, the import  rate of U.S. lumber grew by only 2 percent while Japan's lumber  imports increased by 17 percent in the two-year period of  1992-93.    The United States is demanding that Japan remove all tariffs  on imported lumber, but Japan is saying that "the issue of  tariff rates was settled at the Uruguay Round talks late last  year" (according to the Forestry Agency). The NFLA says: "The  market share of U.S. lumber is lower than that of Canadian  lumber simply because it does not meet the needs of Japanese.  We just cannot understand the U.S. countermeasures."  <H5>  Supercomputers </H5>   Currently, only three Fujitsu and one NEC supercomputers are  being used in the United States, according to Fujitsu Ltd. and  the NEC Corporation. Compared to this, nearly 40 supercomputers  made by Cray Research Inc. of the United States are in use in  Japan. Computer industries are at a loss, saying, "We do not  know why we are subject to the instances of retaliation because  this is an area where imports exceed exports."    Fujitsu said: "The Defense Department, the Energy  Department,  and other U.S. Government agencies are buying U.S.  supercomputers. In reality, it is the United States which is  forcing foreign supercomputer makers out of the U.S. market. We  just do not understand why the United States is attacking only  Japan in the supercomputer field."  <H5>  Medical Equipment </H5>   According to the results of a survey conducted by the  Toshiba  Corporation, Japan exported to the United States medical  equipment worth some 100 billion yen in fiscal year 1992. At  the same time, it imported about 800 billion yens' worth of  medical equipment from the United States. Toshiba complained  about the U.S. action, saying, "We do not understand why the  United States thinks that we are an unfair trade partner." As  for Japan's small automatic blood analyzers and other medical  equipment which are being sold in the United States, some  Japanese companies are saying that "U.S. consumers will suffer  if these types of equipment become subject to retaliatory  action" (according to Hitachi).  <H5>  Computers </H5>   Japanese and U.S. computer makers are actively supplying  their products to each other and are promoting technological  cooperation. Fujitsu said: "Depending on the product, it is  difficult to tell if it is made in Japan or in the United  States. Retaliation is impossible."  <H5>  Insurance Services </H5>   Being conscious of the Finance Ministry, which acts as the  responsible authority, life insurance and nonlife insurance  companies are avoiding commenting on the recent "identification"  of the business sectors. The Sumitomo Life Insurance Company  and other insurance firms say that "we would like to remain calm  and to continue observing the development of the situation."  However, Toshitaka Urakami, chairman of the Life Insurance  Association (and chairman of the Sumitomo insurance company),  commented on the breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. trade talks by  saying: "We avoided the worst-case scenario, in which both  countries would agree to establish numerical targets without  having a thorough understanding of the situation. We could not  help but do this."</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Threat to Heron interest meeting A Heron International bondholder is threatening a legal challenge to the meetings being held tomorrow to approve a delay in interest payments. Heron, which completed a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing last September, has hit problems meeting interest payments. Mr Gary Klesch, a dealer in distressed debt, has written to Law Debenture Corporation, the trustee for the bonds, demanding a separate meeting for those holders of the 7 1/2 per cent bonds which are also lenders to Heron Corporation, a subsidiary of Heron International. He claims their interests are different from investors who are only bondholders. Last night Law Debenture said it would be taking advice on the question today. However, an expert said that Mr Klesch's demand for 'separate class meetings' was questionable since bondholders form one, indivisible class. As they are bearer bonds, the trustee is not entitled to know the beneficial owners behind the bonds.</p>

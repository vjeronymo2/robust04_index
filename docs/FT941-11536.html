			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns lower as Kuala Lumpur surges 3.7% Share prices eased after an 8.8 per cent gain over the previous two days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 166.31 off at 20,250.03 after a day's low of 20,099.41 and a peak of 20,399.24. The Topix index of all first section stocks relinquished 15.44 to 1,627.66. Investors adjusted their positions ahead of the government's economic stimulus package due to be announced today. The Nikkei rose in the afternoon on arbitrage linked buying, but large-lot profit-taking by corporate and financial institutions ahead of the March book closing eroded the gains, as well as selling by dealers and short term traders. The rise in the yen against the dollar also hurt export oriented high-technology stocks. A surge of buying by foreign investors had pushed up the yen over a period of days, and fears of increased US pressure over bilateral trade talks also triggered buying by currency traders. However, later in London, Japanese stocks rallied on a recovery in the dollar and the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 18.97 at 1,356.34. Volume totalled 670m shares, against 950m. Declines outpaced advances by 664 to 391, with 140 issues unchanged. Foreign investors were buyers in a busy automotive sector. Fuji Heavy Industries, the most active stock of the day, moved ahead Y14 to Y393 and Nissan Motor advanced Y21 to Y841. Suzuki Motor, however, retreated Y110 to Y1,340 on profit-taking; and Honda, which owns 20 per cent of Rover, fell Y80 to Y1,620, with investors discouraged by BMW's acquisition of the UK carmaker. The rise in the yen depressed Matsushita Electric Industrial by Y40 to Y1,690 and Sony Y230 to Y6,170. Canon, the precision maker, slipped Y40 to Y1,580 and Citizen Watch declined Y15 to Y730. Banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y30 to Y3,310 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank eased Y20 to Y1,990. Higher gold prices supported Sumitomo Metal Mining, which added Y11 at Y911. Speculative issues were also bought, Sanrio climbing Y160 to Y1,770 and Hanwa, the steel trader, jumping Y62 to Y715. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 163.71 to 21,957.94 in volume of 96.7m shares. Turnover rose on active trading by investors realising profits on long term holdings in bank shares. Roundup Some sharply higher market indices were seen around the Pacific Rim. KUALA LUMPUR reflected strong institutional buying of blue chip stocks as the composite index forged ahead 41.05, or 3.7 per cent, to 1,148.04. Ekran, which has been awarded the huge Bakun hydro-electric power project, surged MDollars 8.40, or 44 per cent, to MDollars 27.50. SEOUL climbed to a 52-month high, helped by massive liquidity on the back of increasing customer deposits and in spite of Won170bn of sales by the stabilisation fund. The composite stock index advanced 14.16, or 1.5 per cent, to 974.26. Customer deposits at brokerage houses were estimated to have hit a record Won4,200bn on Tuesday. Fears of moves by the government to cool the market brought profit-taking in some blue chips, but the sales were immediately digested by aggressive buyers. AUSTRALIA saw strong overseas buying, particularly from Asia, push the market to another record close after overcoming some early weakness. The All Ordinaries index ended 2.0 higher at 2,312.1, having slipped to 2,285.0 in early trade. BOMBAY rose 2.3 per cent, as domestic mutual funds returned as heavy speculative buyers after nearly a week's absence. The BSE 30-share index finished 88.78 up at 4,036.64, having opened lower on mild selling prompted by a government move on Tuesday to raise petrol and diesel prices. TAIWAN was helped ahead by a strong gain in Formosa group shares, which were supported by unconfirmed local newspaper reports that the group would expand the size of its planned petrochemical complex. Formosa climbed TDollars 2.50 to TDollars 56.50. The weighted index was finally 82.30, or 1.3 per cent, ahead at 6,259.21 in heavy turnover of TDollars 96.6bn, against Tuesday's TDollars 101bn. MANILA moved forward in a technical rally, in spite of worries sparked by Tuesday's bombings at three oil companies. The Manila index strengthened 70.65, or 2.5 per cent, to close at 2,906.14. HONG KONG saw a flurry of late selling linked to the futures market which erased early gains and dragged stocks slightly lower. The Hang Seng index finished a net 41.06 down at 11,785.83, having hit an early high of 11,970. NEW ZEALAND paused after six consecutive days of gains and the NZSE-40 capital index fell 4.94 to 2,418.68. SINGAPORE was mixed in spite of a buoyant Malaysian market, and the Straits Times Industrial index shed 11.0 to 2,338.08. BANGKOK picked up from a sharp early fall which saw the SET index almost 30 points lower and ended just 2.14 off at 1,453.44 amid renewed demand for finance stocks. KARACHI finished lower after adverse political news, little institutional support and only cautious buying by foreign funds. The KSE 100-share index fell 19.37 to 2,254.44.</p>

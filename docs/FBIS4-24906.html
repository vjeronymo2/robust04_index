			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Si Liang (1835 5328): "The Mainland Steps Up </F> the Crackdown on Kidnapping Gangs"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 23 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the  beginning of this year, the number of kidnapping cases of  various types has increased substantially, and the law and order  situation has become rather serious. The public security organs  are analyzing deeply the causes and backgrounds of the crimes,  intensifying their investigations to crack the cases, and  striving to check the increase in kidnapping activities in order  to guarantee social stability and to ensure the smooth  development of reform and opening up.    According to materials provided by the police, in the last  few years, kidnapping cases have increased substantially. In  particular, such cases have doubled and redoubled in the coastal  areas and in Guangdong's Zhujiang Delta. For example, in the  first quarter of last year, the kidnapping cases handled by the  procuratorial organs in Shanghai alone increased by 50 percent  over the previous year; and in the first half of last year, more  than 200 kidnapping cases occurred in Guangdong, including 54  cases in Guangzhou, or 125 percent of the figure in the previous  year, and 52 cases in Foshan, or 550 percent of the figure in  the previous year. According to the mainland police, in the  first four months of this year, at least two major kidnapping  cases occurred every month, and most of such cases occurred in  Guangdong.    Gangsters in the mainland mainly kidnap individual business  proprietors, private entrepreneurs, and businessmen from Hong  Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. They demand from several tens of  thousands of yuan to several hundred thousand yuan ransom. In  some cases, the kidnappers even demand several million or over  10 million yuan. For example, the most serious kidnapping case  over the past more than 40 years occurred in Guangdong in April  1993. Six kidnappers kidnapped the director of an aluminum  product factory and his wife in Nanhai City, Guangdong, and  demanded ransom of 10 million yuan. The victims were robbed of  their Lexus car, Rolex wristwatch, gold jewelry, cellular phone,  and other belongings with a total worth of more than 1 million  yuan when being kidnapped. As another example, the police in  Fuzhou City cracked a kidnapping case in April this year in  which the boss of a karaoke lounge was kidnapped and the  kidnappers demanded $400,000 in ransom. In another case, a Hong  Kong businessmen, who invested in a number of projects in the  mainland, was kidnapped by four armed gangsters last January in  Shenzhen, and 800,000 yuan ransom was demanded. Then, in April  this year, the Hong Kong boss of a metal plant in Shenzhen's  Nanshan was kidnapped by four gangsters, who demanded 200,000  yuan ransom.    According to information from the cracked cases, many  kidnappers acted in an organized way, and the crime syndicates  bore the character of secret societies. They collaborated  closely through division of work; acted surreptitiously; and in  some cases even possessed firearms. They also used cellular  phones, pagers, cars, and other modern means of communication  and transportation in the act. The kidnappers were cruel and  merciless in their treatment of their victims, and often  recklessly killed them. For example, the police cracked a case  late last year in which the son of a criminal police team leader  in Liaoyuan City was kidnapped and killed; the Daya Bay Public  Security Bureau cracked a case in March this year in which an  individual business proprietor was kidnapped for 3.6 million  yuan ransom and was later killed; and the police in Zhuhai City  recently cracked a case in which a Macao businessman was  kidnapped in Gongbei for 360,000 Hong Kong dollars ransom and  was later killed.    A more shocking fact was that cases of youngsters being  kidnapped by youngsters occurred from time to time. In late  1993, in the suburbs of Yancheng, Jiangsu, in order to extort  50,000 yuan from a rich family, three young people from 14 to 16  years of age kidnapped a nine-year-old boy by imitating the plot  of a videotape. In March this year, an 18-year-old secondary  school student in Xixia County, Henan, even kidnapped a  12-year-old boy for 60,000 yuan ransom, and the victim, who was  the son of a police officer of the county's public security  bureau, was later killed by the kidnapper.    However, "the net of Heaven has a large mesh, but it lets  off  nothing evil--justice has a long arm." Most kidnapping cases  were cracked by the public security personnel, and most  kidnappers were brought to justice. In the first eight months  of last year, more than 30 kidnappers were arrested, tried, and  sentenced in Guangdong. Five of them were sentenced to death;  two were sentenced to death with suspension; two were sentenced  to life imprisonment; and seven were sentenced to imprisonment  of various terms. Capital punishment was inflicted on all four  kidnappers in the most serious kidnapping case involving 10  million yuan ransom in Guangdong.</p>

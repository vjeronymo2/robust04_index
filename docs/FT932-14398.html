			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / First Boston and Merrill Lynch win YPF mandate FIRST BOSTON and Merrill Lynch, the US investment banks, have won the mandate to act as global co-ordinators in the privatisation of YPF, Argentina's national oil company. The sell-off will be Argentina's largest privatisation. Mr Daniel Marx, Argentina's top financial negotiator, said no decision had yet been taken on the price or amount of shares to be included in the initial public offering. The offering is planned for June or July. YPF has an estimated net worth of Dollars 8bn and the government will sell 70 per cent of the company in stages. The First Boston-Merrill Lynch team was widely expected to win the privatisation mandate after it won a contract last year to join a team of consultants and auditors to prepare YPF for an initial public offering. First Boston has been heavily involved in Argentina's privatisation programme, usually in alliance with other banks. Together with Kleinwort Benson of the UK, it is advising on the sale of hydroelectric companies.</p>

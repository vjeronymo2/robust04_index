Such cooperation ties have been established between nine  counties and cities, each with annual revenue of over 100  million yuan, and their counterparts with annual revenues below  20 million yuan.    With the progress in the reform and economy, this coastal  province has become one of the most developed areas in China.  But the gap between its coastal and inland areas has enlarged  because of historical and natural reasons.    The provincial government decided to forge cooperation  between the above mentioned nine counties and cities and nine  poor counties in the fields of the development of natural  resources, and exchange of technologies, cadres, technicians,  laborers and information.    The main methods include the rich counties providing funds  for the poor based on a share-holding system.    The funds have been mainly used in service sector such as  real estate, commerce and tourism.    Some joint-venture factories have been founded to exploit  local natural resources.    Meanwhile, the provincial government has formulated  preferential policies to help the development of such  cooperation.    For example, Fuzhou, capital of the province, has helped  shouning county to sell and export tea, stone slabs, and stone  and wood carvings. And Shishi City has agreed to find work for  5,000 laborers from the poor county of Zhenghe.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Race for the White House: Japanese adjust to idea of 'President Clinton' - Challenger is seen as more realistic about the causes of US problems THE PROSPECT of Mr Bill Clinton riding in from Arkansas to take up the reins of presidential power in the White House could have been tailor-made to highlight the differences between politics in the US and Japan. It is inconceivable that a young, untested outsider could rise from the political shadows as governor of one of the poorest regions of Japan to within reach of the most powerful post in national politics. In Japan access to the top political jobs is so tightly regulated that the choice of the cabinet can be calculated almost by a formula. Despite the cultural shock a young US president might deliver to a Japanese political leadership generally at least 20 years his senior, the Tokyo elite is learning to tolerate the prospect of change in Washington. Japanese attitudes towards the US presidential race have gone through several phases this year. At the outset it appeared the looming Japanese trade surplus might play an important role in the election, especially as President George Bush choose to kick off his campaign in January with an ill-fated visit to Tokyo. Even so, Japanese officials were adamant that Japan needed the continuity of a Republican White House committed to free trade. The entry of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent, provoked fears that the US might succumb to economic nationalism, with Japan as the main victim. Briefly, over the early summer, stopping Mr Perot was seen as the main priority. After the Democratic convention the mood changed. Mr Clinton's impressive lead in the polls - later much diminished - persuaded Tokyo analysts that Mr Bush's defeat was almost inevitable; they had to learn to tolerate Mr Clinton. Two schools of thought run through Japanese politics, the bureaucracy and business about the impact of a Clinton presidency. The pessimists are apprehensive on several counts. The uncertainty of change would be highly unsettling to Tokyo policy makers. Japan has done well from Republican presidents. Its economy was given a hefty kick start by the Korean and Vietnam war efforts in the 1950s and 1960s. In the past decade Japan's economic power grew hugely during the Reagan-Bush years, partly because of the rise in the US federal deficit and the growth of the Japanese trade surplus. The pessimists acknowledge that the US has made increasingly insistent demands upon Japan over bilateral trade and foreign policy issues such as Japan's contribution to the the Gulf war. Yet Republican foreign policy has generally provided a familiar framework for Japan to rely upon, particularly as its gropes for a broader international role in the wake of the end of the cold war. But the pessimists fear a Clinton presidency would fall prey to protectionists in the Democratic party who call for industrial policy to be matched by an aggressive trade policy targeted at Japan, with quotas for imports into the US and market opening in Japan. However, over the past few weeks a growing number of Tokyo policy-makers have become optimistic that a Clinton victory could pave the way for more equitable relations with the US. Their optimism is encouraged by the belief that the election campaign has marked a significant shift in Americans' perceptions of the US economy's strengths and weaknesses. Tokyo optimists believe US politicians are becoming more realistic about the domestic factors behind declining US competitiveness, particularly poor education and training and low savings and investment, and think this new realism will lead the US to moderate its demands on Japan. This belief has several sources. Protectionism has played far less of a role in the campaign than many in Tokyo feared. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, commented: 'The election has shown a strong common sense in the US about the importance of avoiding protectionism.' Mr Clinton's stress upon a revised industrial policy to promote US competitiveness also strikes a chord. An active state policy to boost competitiveness would be more recognisable to Japanese policy makers who have never shared the Republican ideological zeal for the free market. A senior official at the Ministry of Finance goes even further, predicting that if he wins Mr Clinton might put trade relations on a more stable footing: 'The trouble with the Bush administration's approach to trade was that it started from the premise that the problem lay in Japan, with Japanese unfairness. The Clinton team start from the premise that the main problem is in the US. That is a fundamental shift. We might be more willing to help if the US is really making an effort to restore its competitiveness.' The possibility of Democratic control of both the White House and the Congress also encourages the optimists that 'Japan-bashing' will become less powerful. As a senior US businessman in Tokyo put it: 'The Bush trade initiatives have been an economic failure but a political success because they were primarily designed to head off political pressure in Congress. With a Clinton administration there would be less political window dressing and more emphasis on what can be done practically.' This optimism has not reached into the popular press, whose commentators issue daily warnings of the dire consequences which lie in store for Japan from a Clinton victory. But the Tokyo professionals are more pragmatic; they are quietly clearing the ground to allow them to shift their allegiances if Mr Clinton wins.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At this evening's continuation of the Frankfurt  round of Croatian-Muslim talks, the mutual standpoints are  drawing closer together. Both delegations, it has been learned,  have accepted the model of the cantonal organization of the  future Bosnia-Herzegovina, but some of their standpoints are,  nevertheless, different. The Muslim side sees the cantons as  the basis for the development of a future state while the  Croatian side sees them as only a framework guaranteeing the  appropriate participation of both nations in the government. In  this connection, stress is laid on the U.S. initiative on the  territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into seven cantons.    Of the concrete agreements, stress is placed on the  forthcoming meeting between military commanders General Ante  Roso and Rasim Delic, which should provide a definite cessation  of hostilities between the Croatian Defense Council and the  Muslim army, something that will make further negotiations  easier. Both delegations agreed with the U.S. approach to the  talks -- that first there should be an agreement between Croats  and Muslims on Bosnia-Herzegovina before an agreed proposal is  put to the third side, the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

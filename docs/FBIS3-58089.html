			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vuoristo: "The Last Leninist"] </F>   [Text] When, at the beginning of the 1970's, Pekka  Tiainen's generation matriculated in the universities, the  revolution was already well under way.    The ground-breaking work had already been done, and one was  considered a progressive if one accepted the results. The  supporters of Taisto Sinisalo (the Stalinists) took care of the  movement's details, as they had seized the initiative in the  civil war raging within the Communist Party. The struggle over  administrative control of the universities yielded a feel for  the practical side of the revolution.    Many a middle-class youth briefly thrust himself into the  front lines of the revolution, became frustrated and withdrew,  and today reminisces over these days, either with humor or  wistful longing. But not Pekka Tiainen. His story was  different, because he was more diligent than the others.    Vietnam and Das Kapital    Pekka Tiainen's father was the head of Savonlinna's  Telephone  Company and represented the Conservative Party as a city  councilman, and his mother was a registered nurse. The  atmosphere in their home was described as open and liberal.    As a young man, Tiainen was interested in chess, athletics,  and hiking. There were some Social Democratic and Conservative  youth groups in the school, but the other students laughed at  them behind their backs.    Matters took a different turn in 1965, when the United  States  started to bomb North Vietnam. U.S. imperialism was soon  condemned at the Savonlinna Upper Secondary School. At the same  time, communism, which previously had been taboo, became a  subject of interest.    The goings-on evoked an interest within Tiainen to know  more.  Before matriculating at the University of Helsinki, he had waded  through Allardt's book, Sociology, and he had also  familiarized himself with Marx's Das Kapital, which  was a book that many a good Marxist never had the energy to  peruse.    During the summers, Tiainen had also traveled in Europe. The  nights spent on the dirt floor of the subway construction site  in Munich, in the company of foreign workers, introduced him to  the life of the proletariat.  <H5>  Ideology and Practice </H5>   At the university, Tiainen realized that his opinions  coincided with the views of the communists on various matters.  Almost immediately, he joined the Academic Socialist Association.    In connection with the support collections during the strike  winter of 1971, Tiainen saw how the intelligentsia could join  forces with the working class at the front lines of the  struggle, and in the summer of that year, he joined the  Viisikulma Section of the Communist Party. The student communes  in that part of the city ensured a Stalinist majority in the  section.    Of the Stalinist students, some focused on the revolution,  others on changing scientific research according to Marxist  dogma, while some others concentrated on their studies. Tiainen  had all three impulses. He was both a diligent study group  member and an energetic party activist, as well as a  conscientious student.    Tiainen did not become a front-line scientist, but neither  did he become a Stalinist dogmatic, nor a political organization  leader. Instead of taking part in the struggle between political  factions, he was interested in the economy, and such a man is of  limited use in a war.    Tiainen's best period as a member of the Communist Party  came  about 20 years ago, when, based on demands voiced by the  Communist Party in the USSR, an attempt was made to join the  warring factions together. While preparing economic and  employment policy analyses for the party, Tiainen tried to find  issues that the factions agreed on and avoided controversial  subjects. Everybody acknowledged Tiainen's contributions.  <H5>  Major and Minor Issues </H5>   As a member of the feisty Communist Workers' Party, Tiainen  is now one of the last real Leninists. He is not driven by an  unquenchable revolutionary zeal. When asked, he certainly  supports the revolution, but he prefers to talk about his  bailiwick, the economy, and avoids Marxist argot.    The election campaign is conducted under the auspices of the  Potemkin village organization, "The Popular Front Against the  EC." During the campaign, Tiainen's speeches have been lacking  in vision, as his vision is socialism, a subject he prefers to  avoid.    Tiainen's membership in the last group of Leninists is due  to  his perseverance and serious nature. These are his basic  character traits. After deciding to become a Leninist, he never  changed his mind, even after nations crumbled, but would rather  be the last Leninist. It is unavoidable for such a person to end  up in the minority within the minority, especially when he  always ends up defending the right of each minority to remain  with the organization.    One is hard-pressed to consider Tiainen's political career  as  an indication of any particular talent as a statesman. On the  other hand, Tiainen has finally been able to achieve a role of  political leadership within the Communist Workers' Party. In  other organizations, the comrades soon realized that, in his  vision, he, in spite of his perseverance and seriousness, has  difficulties in separating major and minor issues from each  other.    This third basic character trait was well known by the  Vantaa  Municipal Council, where it is told that the meeting hall became  empty each time Tiainen stepped to the rostrum. This can also be  gleaned from his curriculum vitae, distributed for the  presidential campaign, which, in its 13 pages, contains  everything, including data processing extension courses.    Tiainen's characteristics have been useful in his research  work. His analyses have been met with uniform praise, as they do  not omit a single point of view. But if one attempts to see the  larger picture, it is deleterious even for a researcher to get  bogged down in details. Tiainen's doctoral thesis is living  proof of that, as it promises to be scientifically meritorious,  as soon as the professors are able dig out the hidden gems.  <H5>  Pekka Tiainen </H5>   Pekka Tapio Tiainen was born in Helsinki on 3 August 1951.  In  1956, the family moved to Savonlinna.    Tiainen graduated from Savonlinna Upper Secondary School in  1970. He received his Licentiate in Political Science from the  University of Helsinki in 1983, majoring in economics. He is in  the process of completing his doctoral thesis regarding the  factors of economic growth in Finland in the 20th century.    Tiainen's professional career has been as a special  researcher at the Ministry of Labor, to which position he was  appointed in 1982. Before that, he conducted research at, among  other places, the Environmental Protection Department of the  Interior Ministry and the bank Kansallispankki. He is considered  one of the country's foremost experts on employment issues, and  the list of studies prepared by him is impressive.    Tiainen was a member of the Finnish Communist Party during  the period 1971-88, and since then he has been a member of the  Communist Workers' Party. While a member of the Finnish  Communist Party, he held various positions on a local and  district level, and within the minority faction of the Communist  Party, he was subsequently a substitute member of the Central  Committee and a member of the Economic Policy Section. He  currently serves as vice chairman of the Communist Workers'  Party.    Tiainen was a member of the Vantaa Municipal Council during  the period of 1984-92, first as a representative of the Finnish  People's Democratic League (SKDL) and later representing  Democratic Alternative (DEVA).    Tiainen's military rank is lieutenant. He separated from the  church in 1969.    Tiainen has been married since 1976. His wife Ritva is  employed as a social worker in an institution. They have a  15-year-old son and a 11-year-old daughter. The family lives in  Lansimaki in Vantaa.    Tiainen's hobbies are chess and running--he runs a few  thousand kilometers a year.</p>

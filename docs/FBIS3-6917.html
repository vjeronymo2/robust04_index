This is a provocative step to drive the situation into  extremes by screwing up the tensions on the Korean peninsula.    Out of an intentional scheme to create an atmosphere of  confrontation against the DPRK, the United States totally  reversed the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and the  U.S. at the New York contact on February 25 and broke off the  DPRK-U.S. talks and now has become all the more undisguised in  its military threats and pressure against the DPRK, saying the  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises would be resumed.    Clinton's order of the deployment of Patriot missiles in  South Korea is a grave threat to the DPRK, and it clearly shows  that the United States is pushing the situation of the Korean  peninsula to the brink of war.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (27): Quality not quantity - Coal COAL miners, once the proletarian elite of Polish socialism, now face an uncertain future. The subsidies which severely distorted production and consumption of Poland's main source of energy are to be phased out. Reducing Poland's reliance on coal - it accounts for more than 75 per cent of primary energy consumption compared with 24 per cent in western Europe and 27 per cent in the US - is also a significant plank in the country's environmental protection programme. Output has already dropped to 147.4m tonnes last year from the claimed peak of more than 190m tonnes in the late 1980s. This year production is likely to be only 144m tonnes. Mr Tadeusz Demel, general director of the State Coal Agency, says the industry will shift its emphasis from quantity to quality - and profitability. Mines will no longer be kept open simply to provide employment. Many of Poland's 68 mines are old and highly inefficient, and a study is under way to establish which are no longer viable. Mr Demel refuses to disclose how many mines might face closure. Last year, 48 enjoyed what he describes as a 'positive financial status' after paying dividends and income tax. But that, he says, does not mean they are profitable overall because the figures exclude investment costs. Declining heavy industrial production has already meant a decline in domestic demand. But exports also face a crisis. Mr Jan Baranski, director of Weglokoks, the Polish coal export agency, says rising production costs, the combination of a fixed exchange rate and high domestic inflation, and a 20 per cent turnover tax on exports, mean that prices may have to be increased this year.' We've reached break-even point,' he says. 'If our costs increase much more, without a change in the exchange rate, we'll have no choice but to increase prices.' If this happens, Mr Baranski fears a large drop in sales - worth around Dollars 1.5bn last year - with possible long-term consequences. Weglokoks may try to ride out the storm by concentrating on markets closest to Poland, thus reducing transport costs. 'To lose a market is very easy,' he says. 'To come back is very difficult, even if it's possible at all. We must not burn the bridges we have built up over many years.' At home, miners who lose their jobs will face difficulties in moving to other areas to find work because of Poland's acute housing shortage. Those still in work have come to terms with the fact that they are no longer the storm-troopers of socialism. 'I am first a Catholic, and then the general director of the coal agency,' Mr Demel says. 'Closing these mines will not be easy for me. I'm not a politician, I am just a mining engineer. I live here and I have to look these people in the eyes.' There is already unrest among miners. The wages tax or popiwek that penalises employers who pay more than government-permitted wage increases means that miners' wages have not kept pace with inflation. This has already led to strikes and angry delegations to president Walesa. However, without lower real wages unemployment would be greater, as in the former East Germany. The ending of subsidies is a key to establishing real cost and profit levels in the industry. Last year, 9,600bn zlotys (Dollars 1bn) was spent on subsidising coal output. This year, the subsidy will be reduced to 7,300bn zlotys. The goal is to end the system of flat-rate subsidies to all mines based on output, and switch to limited subsidies to specific mines for specific reasons. Finally, Poland's coal mines, which gained their freedom to operate independently last year, are to be taken under the wing of a new state holding company, along the lines of those that exist in many western countries. 'It is stupid to maintain that individual mines, of differing ages and working in very different conditions, should compete against one another,' Mr Demel says. Understandably, some miners are strongly opposed to the move, suspicious that it will mean a return to the bad old days of central planning. The workers' councils are reluctant to give up their newfound freedom. 'Sometimes I speak at mines to explain my ideas, and the miners whistle and stomp,' Mr Demel says. 'I say, I don't have to be here. Someone else, one of you, could be here, and you would start to think the same as me.' No-one wants to see a return to the old ways, especially as a few truths are starting to emerge. There is some doubt, for example, over whether Poland's coal industry was ever quite as big as was claimed. 'Speaking delicately, there were certain discrepancies when coal output was measured, ' Mr Demel says quietly. 'During the times of central planning, mines would add stones to their coal to make sure they met their targets. I have worked in the coal industry for many years, I know what went on.'</p>

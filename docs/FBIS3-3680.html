"China believes the specific problems concerning the  inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities should be solved  through discussions between North Korea and the IAEA," the  spokesman said.    "In this light, China abstains from commenting on the  determination made by the IAEA," he added.    The IAEA, which ended two weeks of inspections in North  Korea  on March 15, reported interference by the Korean side and has  since referred the entire issue to the UN Security Council.    North Korean officials have denied such interference.    Tuesday evening, Chinese Premier Li Peng reiterated China's  position that the issue should be solved peacefully through  dialogue.</p>

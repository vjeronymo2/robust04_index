			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Loss deepens at Brazilian clothier SAO PAULO Alpargatas, Brazil's largest footwear and clothing manufacturer, suffered a loss of Dollars 83.2m last year, compared with a deficit of Dollars 37.7m the previous year. Last year's sales of Dollars 479.2m were down by 11 per cent, with exports accounting for Dollars 33.3m. 'The loss was principally due to lower sales volumes and tighter margins, exacerbated by the adjustment of stocks to lower market values and costs related to company restructuring,' said Mr Diego J. Bush, Alpargatas chairman, in a stockholder statement. Embratel, the state-controlled long-distance telecommunications company, announced profits of Dollars 240m in 1992, up from Dollars 153.3m in 1991. The company invested Dollars 528m, 80 per cent of which was funded without borrowing. It plans Dollars 700m of new investment this year, including the laying of optic fibre transmission lines between some of Brazil's major cities. Usiminas, the steel producer privatised in 1991, announced profits of Dollars 123.4m in its first full year as a privately-owned company. The result was up by 95 per cent from 1991.</p>

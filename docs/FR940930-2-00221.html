			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class over another in the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. LFBDS will adopt compliance standards regarding when a class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. LFBDS will require its registered representatives and all broker-dealer firms with which it enters into selling agreements and all financial institutions with which it enters into agency agreements regarding the Funds to agree to conform to such standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive relief is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees of the Funds with respect to the Multiple Distribution System will be set forth in guidelines that will be furnished to the Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Each Fund will disclose in its prospectus the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, contingent deferred sales loads, conversion features, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The shareholder reports of each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to the classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value and public offering prices will present each class of shares separately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The applicant acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to their Plans in reliance on the exemptive order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Purchase Class shares will convert into Target Class shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice) and/or shareholder servicing fee, if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee and shareholder servicing fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees of the Fund, including a majority of the Independent Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of the monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Board of Trustees, and the Board of Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its Plans that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Target Class shares under the Plans, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to the existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. The New Target Class or the New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to Federal taxation. In accordance with Condition No. 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class or the New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by Citibank and LFBDS. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. The Administrative Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' CDSC Condition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the condition that applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act (Release No. IC&hyph;16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

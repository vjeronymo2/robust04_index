			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Fear of job losses is part of mixed reaction Fears of widespread job losses in the electricity industry were voiced yesterday as industry, consumer groups and politicians gave a mixed reaction to Prof Littlechild's review. The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, which has 40,000 members in the industry, warned that there could be a further 14,000 job cuts because 'every price review seemed to be followed by redundancies'. It would fight enforced redundancies. Mr Sol Mead, deputy head of Unison's 30,000 electricity members, said: 'Companies will be under great pressure to maintain dividends to shareholders and provide the same rate of golden handshakes for bosses.' A more positive response was given by the Major Energy Users' Council. The group, which represents many of Britain's biggest companies, said the price reductions were a step in the right direction. The recognition that the regional companies' capital spending must be financed by a balanced approach and not just consumer exploitation was welcome news, it added. However, Mr Ken Green, electricity purchasing manager for Imperial Chemical Industries, said: 'Once again Offer has failed to deliver a solution which fully embraces customer interest.' He said the price control would not present power companies with big enough incentives to improve efficiency. The National Consumer Council said the reductions were not good enough and customers had been overcharged since privatisation. The chairmen of the Regional Electricity Consumers' Committees, which represent the interests of electricity consumers, said they welcomed the announcement but were disappointed that the cuts did not go further. 'However, having met him to discuss his proposals, we understand his difficulties in reconciling quite different approaches,' they said. Yorkshire Electricity said yesterday that the controls were tough and challenging. Customers were already reaping the benefits of privatisation through lower charges. Mr Malcolm Bruce MP, the Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, yesterday called on Prof Littlechild to introduce an immediate cut in electricity tariffs in Scotland. He said Scottish electricity customers had been 'ripped off too much for too long'. Prof Littlechild is thought likely to announce the outcome of his review of Scottish distribution and supply charges towards the end of next month. Unlike regional electricity companies in England and Wales, Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric are vertically integrated, generating as well as distributing electricity. The Scottish companies were both given negative X-factors (the percentage by which their charges are permitted to increase in relation to the retail prices index) at privatisation whereas the others received positive X-factors. Hydro-Electric and Scottish Power yesterday dismissed Mr Bruce's remarks. Scottish Power pointed out that its tariffs had fallen by 4.8 per cent in real terms since privatisation in 1991. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, said the companies were both 'guilty of the same profiteering as Offer is trying to curb'.</p>

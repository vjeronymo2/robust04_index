			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 5, RIA -- "Yeltsin was his old self  again," said Dr. Bella Denisenko, head of the parliamentary  health committee, after he received spokesmen of Russia's Choice  parliamentary group yesterday. "He was eager to cooperate with  all reformers, especially Russia's Choice Party, currently in  the making [as received] on our group's basis."    Information of MPs back from their constituencies shocked  the  president. He heard about local election returns forged,  statistics held back, bosses' arbitrary action, and a new ruling  class emerging from among executive and legislative officers.  Russia's Choice thinks the president ought to be more choosy  with official appointments.    Despite all latest rumours, Dr. Denisenko found Mr. Yeltsin  in the best of health.</p>

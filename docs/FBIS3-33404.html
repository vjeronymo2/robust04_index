			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Central Army is taking steps to implement the  instructions given by the Minister of the Revolutionary Armed  Forces to support the conservation of unused agricultural  equipment. In this extensive territory that comprises five  provinces, thousands of tractors and trucks that have been  paralyzed because of the lack of fuel and spare parts or as a  consequence of the recent transformations that have taken place  in agricultural industry will be properly maintained to prevent  their deterioration and to ensure operation when circumstances  permit. Contacts have been made between delegations of the  Ministry of Agriculture in Matanzas, Villa Clara, Cienfuegos,  Sancti Spiritus, and Ciego de Avila, so that, in the near  future, classes can be held to demonstrate the proper  maintenance of agricultural equipment.</p>

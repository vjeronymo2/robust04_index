			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican  Attorney General's Office (PGR) announced today the arrest of  the country's main heroin drug trafficker who is also the chief  of a drug-trafficking band in the northern State of Chihuahua.    The PGR reported in a communique Rosario Pina Carrillo,  alias  "El Callado," was arrested 11 June based on an arrest warrant  issued against him for crimes against health and for charges of  planting, growing, and harvesting marijuana.    According to the PGR, "El Callado," also known as "El  Huarache de Oro," operated in Sinaloa and also directed a band  of drug traffickers in Casas Grandes, Chihuahua State, which  borders with the United States.    The group, headed by Pina Carrillo, consists of brothers  Leonardo and Roberto Pina Valenzuela, Pina Chito, and the  Morenos, against whom arrest warrants have been issued, and they  are also believed to have links with the band "Borunda Ponce,"  the report indicated.    The "Borunda Ponce" band consists of drug traffickers from  the northern State of Sinaloa who are considered dangerous.    The criminal organization "Borunda Ponce" operates in Casas  Grandes, Chihuahua. They finance the planting, transportation,  and commercialization of narcotics, from which they make large  profits, the source reported.    The PGR said Pina Carrillo's arrest will make it possible to  arrest other drug traffickers in the near future and thus  disarticulate both bands, something that would be a hard blow  for the Sinaloa and Chihuahua drug cartels.</p>

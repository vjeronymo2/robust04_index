			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: TAKING STEPS TO THANK NEW YORK CITY BALLET  </P> <P> "This is Belmont!" Peter Martins said, laughing. The New York City Ballet's  master-in-chief was comparing his company to a stable of racehorses, the same  way he did when they appeared in Costa Mesa four years ago.  </P> <P> Actually, it was George Balanchine -- founder of the NYCB -- who originated the  comparison, said the Danish-born Martins (devastatingly handsome in black tie).  "Racehorses are very strong animals with fine, slender legs and small ankles.  One misstep, and it's over!"  </P> <P> Martins was among 200 guests kicking up their heels at the Westin South Coast  Plaza on Sunday night after the company's final performance at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> The ballet master swept into the gala fashionably late and took his place near  Center President Thomas Kendrick at the A table, next to the dance floor. Also  joining Martins for a sit-down dinner was ballerina Kyra Nichols, Center  General Manager Judy Morr and ballet buffs Elaine and Bill Redfield.  </P> <P> Members of the Center Dance Alliance -- a Center support group -- staged the  bash, which for $150 per person included dining, dancing and the chance to rub  elbows with some of the country's most brilliant dancers. A steal.  </P> <P> Its theme was Stars and Stripes Gala, after a work choreographed by Balanchine  to music by John Philip Sousa. The party saw guests waxing ecstatic over the  dancers and the dancers waxing ecstatic over the chance to perform again in  Orange County.  </P> <P> "It's lovely being here," said Alexandre Proia, a Paris-born dancer. Proia said  he planned to do some social dancing at the party. How did he compare social  dancing to ballet? No comparison. "Ballet is art," he said.  </P> <P> Art indeed. Act III featured "Vienna Waltzes," with music by Johann Strauss.  For this sequence, the stage at Segerstrom Hall featured a mirrored backdrop  and gigantic shimmering snowflakes suspended from the ceiling. The beautiful  ballerinas whirled about in billowing white satin gowns, escorted by dashing  men in black tie. Breathtaking.  </P> <P> Even ballerina Jenifer Ringer, 17, was still starry-eyed over appearing in the  number. "Doing that dance fulfills the dream," Jenifer said, "the dream of  dressing up and dancing with a very handsome man."  </P> <P> Ballerina Jennifer Fuchs, 21, was featured in the "Explosions -- Polka"  sequence, also by Strauss. "It was fun," she said. "When I dance in it, I can't  stop smiling. You hope you're on the music, because it's so fast!"  </P> <P> Gala chairwoman Martha Morgan dressed up the hotel ballroom with long-stem red  rose bouquets and gold-edge black ribbon. Gold stars were scattered across each  table.  </P> <P> "We didn't want a literal interpretation of the Stars and Stripes," Morgan  said, noting the party's elegant red, gold and black theme.  </P></p>

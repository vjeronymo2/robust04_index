			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T, MCI advance before charges American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the leading US long-distance telephone company, yesterday reported a 15 per cent increase in fourth quarter income before special items, while MCI Communications, its smaller rival, announced a 24 per cent rise. AT&amp;T's results were helped by cost-cutting in long-distance and strong growth in its network equipment business, while MCI was boosted by long-distance volume growth of nearly 16 per cent, roughly double the industry average. AT&amp;T made Dollars 982m, or 72 cents a share, in the quarter, after previously announced restructuring charges at its NCR computer subsidiary and a non-cash change in accounting methods. This compared with net income of Dollars 1bn, or 75 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Revenues rose 5.5 per cent to Dollars 18.46bn. Excluding the charges, net income totalled Dollars 1.15bn, or 85 cents a share. NCR, which the group is renaming AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, reported a 20 per cent rise in sales of computer products and equipment, while its total revenues rose 7 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn. Excluding Dollars 190m of pre-tax restructuring charges, it had operating income of Dollars 61m. For the full year, excluding accounting and restructuring charges, the group reported net income of Dollars 4.26bn, or Dollars 3.15 a share, on revenues of Dollars 67.16bn, compared with income of Dollars 3.81bn, or Dollars 2.86 a share, on revenues of Dollars 64.9bn in 1992. MCI reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 107m, or 18 cents a share, down from Dollars 160m, or 30 cents, in the same period of last year, after taking a Dollars 150m realignment charge. Excluding the provision, earnings rose to Dollars 199m, or 34 cents a share. Revenues rose more than 13 per cent to Dollars 3.13bn, while traffic rose 16 per cent. For the full year, MCI reported earnings excluding charges of Dollars 731m, or Dollars 1.30 a share, up from Dollars 1.11 in 1992.</p>

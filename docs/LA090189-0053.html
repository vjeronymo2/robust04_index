			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Thunderstorms battered the north-central part of the nation, flooding streets  in northern Minnesota and dumping hail the size of golf balls in North Dakota.  More than 9 inches of rain fell at Callaway in northwestern Minnesota, the  National Weather Service said. Nearly 4 1/2 inches was reported at Park Rapids,  while 3.25 inches fell at Aitkin and about 2.2 inches at Fargo-Moorhead. Storms  produced 2 inches of rain in 20 minutes at Moose Lake, where flooding was  reported, the weather service said. In North Dakota, up to 3 inches of rain  fell between Jamestown and Fargo. In Mapleton, an inch of rain fell in 15  minutes. Level wind patterns and a warm front contributed to the formation of  the thunderstorms, forecasters said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It is being reported from the UN Headquarters that  in letters to President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  will stress that the 21 March UN document is the final method to  implement the confidence-building measures, and will clarify the  points that were discussed with Denktas last week. This  information was included in a report from the REUTERS News  Agency, citing diplomats at the UN Headquarters. According to  the same report, Butrus-Ghali hopes that his letters will help  both sides to finally accept the confidence-building measures.    The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reported  from New York that either Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's  special representative in Cyprus, or Alternate UN Secretary  General Marrack Goulding, is expected to convey the letters to  Kliridhis and Denktas next week.    Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the government  has no official information that the UN secretary general  intends to send letters to Kliridhis and Denktas.</p>

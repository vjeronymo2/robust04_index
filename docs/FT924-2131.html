			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Rabin takes tough line on hostage ISRAELI prime minister Mr Yitzhak Rabin last night demanded evidence that an Israeli paramilitary policeman kidnapped by Palestinian Islamic fundamentalists was alive before he would consider releasing their jailed leader. He denied he was prepared to negotiate over the kidnappers' demands. But he said in a television interview the government must be shown 'signs of life' as a precondition for any talks on the matter. Mr Rabin said Israeli security forces were pursuing every means of finding the border policeman, Sgt-Maj Nissim Toledano. The man was abducted while walking to work early on Sunday in the central Israeli city of Lod. He was taken by Qassam, the military wing of the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement from the occupied territories. The authorities sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, placed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians under curfew and arrested dozens of Hamas supporters. All police leave was cancelled and helicopters were brought in to the search operation. Mr Rabin said no direct contact had been made by last night with the kidnappers, who were demanding the release of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the crippled Hamas leader who was jailed for life last year on charges of ordering the killing of Palestinian collaborators. The prime minister said the Islamic movement was seeking to destroy the Middle East peace negotiations in Washington and warned Israelis to expect more attacks as the talks continued. But he reiterated his strong commitment to the peace process. 'We will not be deterred by kidnappings and shootings,' he said. Senior figures in Gaza linked with Hamas suggested 57-year-old Sheikh Yassin could be freed on medical grounds - he is disabled and in poor health. But releasing him would be seen both by Hamas and by Israel's right-wing opposition as a sign of weakness in Mr Rabin. Editorial comment, Page 14</p>

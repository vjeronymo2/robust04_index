			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Long gilts weaken as inflation and supply worries resurface Inflation and supply worries depressed the UK government bond market yesterday, pushing prices down by between half and three-quarters of a point at the long end. The release of a survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, yesterday caused jitters by indicating a sharp increase in the number of managing directors who expect to raise prices in order to restore profit margins. 'The news rather spooked the gilt market,' said Mr Kit Juckes, bond analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities, adding that the survey had led to some consternation over whether inflation would edge up again. On the supply front, the gilt market expects the Bank of England to announce its next gilt auction soon, with dealers predicting that the new stock will be a long-dated one. A low wage settlement for Germany's chemical industry workers gave a firm boost to the German government bond market yesterday, although the market later drifted down to close a touch lower on the day. The chemical industry union agreed to a 2 per cent pay rise for 1994. 'This is the first of the main wage settlements and it looks quite good  - if we continue in this vein it will be good for inflation prospects,' said one bund dealer. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 101.12 and traded in a range of 100.99 to 101.26 before ending at around 101.04. Italian government bonds opened on a weak note following Monday's slide in prices, but bounced back up to end the day nearly half a point higher. Dealers said a rise in German government bond prices prompted the recovery in Italian bonds. The Italian market was weak on Monday due to political uncertainties and dismay over the delay in the long-awaited interest rate cut. The Liffe March futures contract settled up 0.43 at 117.53. Traders said the market would be focusing on the political situation today with Mr Carlo Ciampi, the prime minister, expected to face a vote of no-confidence in parliament. Among the other high-yielding markets, Spain saw strong buying interest from foreign investors and ended the day higher. The release of unemployment figures showing a slight increase in the jobless rate at 17.5 per cent in December, against 17.4 per cent the previous month, had little impact on the market, dealers said, as they were roughly in line with expectations. Japanese government bond prices declined on the back of new supply in the four-year area and receding hopes for an imminent rate cut. The stock market's recent strength has led bond market participants to push back their hopes of an easing by the Bank of Japan, dealers said. New supply in the four-year area did not help market sentiment yesterday. The Finance Ministry auctioned Y735.7bn of 2.2 per cent four-year bonds at an average price of 99.79 to yield 2.257 per cent. However, dealers said the auction did not go particularly well. The key March futures contract, which closed at 118.30 on Monday, opened yesterday at 118.00 and traded in a range from 117.99 to 118.38 before closing at 118.06. US Treasury prices edged higher across the board in light trading yesterday as dealers and investors awaited the week's inflation data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  3/16 at 100 1/4 , to yield 6.226 per cent. The two-year note barely moved all day, and was up just  1/32 at 100 11/32 , yielding 4.049 per cent. In the absence of important economic news, trading was subdued throughout the day, although there was some mid-afternoon selling following news of strong department store sales. Demand from municipal authorities, however, helped prices recover later in the day. Otherwise, the market's attention was clearly focused on the December inflation data, which are due out today and tomorrow.</p>

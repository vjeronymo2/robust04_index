			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacek Czarnecki: "Arms Industry; Empty Pockets"] </F>   [Text] The arms industry today employs half as many people  as it did in 1988. Exports have dropped by 85 percent, and  orders from the Polish Army have plummeted catastrophically.  Over the past four years, the arms industry has lost its  "traditional" markets in the Middle East and East Asia, as well  as in the former Soviet Union. One year ago, the indebtedness  of the special enterprises came to 12 trillion zlotys [Z]; today  it already exceeds Z15 trillion.    It is difficult to see any chance to change this situation.  Exports are still effectively blocked by the so-called negative  list of countries to which arms cannot be sold, as well as by  the atmosphere of scandal related to the Polish arms trade. The  Ministry of National Defense will spend only about Z4 trillion  for the purchase of new equipment. Experts from the Central  Planning Administration say that, to improve the condition of  the arms-industry sector, the Army should buy Z7 to 8 trillion  worth of equipment in 1994.  <H5>  Exports Without Significance </H5>   The arms industry is not getting any money for  restructuring.  The production potential, the maintenance of which requires  billions of zlotys a year, would be sufficient to meet the needs  of a 500,000-member army. Only 20 percent of this potential is  now being used. It is not known what should be done with the  rest, as well as with the people employed at defense industry  enterprises.    Before 1990, as many as 80 companies worked to meet the  needs  of the defense industry. The main recipients of armaments were  the almost 500,000-member Polish Army, the armies of the Warsaw  Pact, and the countries of the Middle East and East Asia. From  1965 to 1990, the Polish arms industry supplied 11,000 tanks,  5,800 self-acting howitzers, 1,600 artillery tractors, 8,600  armored transports, 6,000 helicopters, 1.5 million guns and  machine guns, as well as vast quantities of ammunition. Between  1984 and 1991, Poland exported armaments worth $1.8 billion and  7 billion transferable rubles. In the years 1979-89, tank  exports alone yielded $2.5 billion. Over 80 percent of the arms  were sent to the former Soviet Union.    The disintegration of the Council for Economic Mutual  Assistance and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact spelled the  end of the "golden times" for our arms industry. As a  consequence of the imposition of a UN embargo on Iraq, Libya,  and Serbia, the arms-producing factories have lost hundreds of  millions of U.S. dollars. Sejm deputies have recently been  trying to force the idea of suspending the negative list, which,  according to the arms-industry enterprises, is too long. It  includes countries not found on the UN embargo list, such as  Burma, Somalia, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Mozambique, Sudan, and  Taiwan.    Polish arms are no longer playing a major role on world  markets. According to the Stockholm-based Peace Research  Institute (SIPRI), Poland's share in the world arms trade does  not exceed 1 percent. Former "fraternal armies," which once  received a large portion of our products, now have arms  surpluses of their own.  <H5>  Arms Industry to Civilian Life </H5>   Arms-producing enterprises could not endure such a sudden  and  drastic limitation of their markets. Currently working for the  Army are 31 companies that have acquired special status. They  are burdened with the task of maintaining the defense reserve  (RO) in the event of a war, as well as the production of  equipment to meet current needs and--most willingly--for export.  The other factories must switch over to production for the  civilian market. This task is also imposed on the enterprises of  the "thirty." Easier said than done, the directors of the  companies say. The factories do not have enough money for  investment in the civilian sector of production; however, some  of them get on somehow.    The Mesko factory in Skarzysko-Kamienna manufactures, aside  from ammunition and rocket missiles, light agricultural machines  and electric-light fixtures, among other products. The Machine  Enterprises in Tarnow, aside from small guns and heavy machine  guns, produces machine tools and cooling aggregates, also for  the civilian market. The Kasprzak Radio Company, in addition to  military electronics, also manufactures cassette recorders and  radios. To maintain a given company's positive earning  capacity, production for the civilian market in arms-producing  factories should constitute approximately 60 percent, whereas  military production, along with RO, no more than 40 percent.  The snag is that most of the arms industry companies do not  have appropriate technologies that would allow them to  manufacture "civilian" commodities competitive as far as their  quality is concerned.    In most of the companies, adjustment of the production  volume to the volume of orders and limitation of manufacturing  capacities resulting from the lack of demand for the "civilian"  products, often entail considerable limitations in employment.  For example, in the Machine Enterprises in Tarnow, only some  900 workers will remain, out of the 2,400 working there now.  This is at least what is suggested in the program of  restructurization and conversion prepared at a cost of 690,000  German marks by the German company Cognos AG and the Institute  of Organization and Management in Industry (ORGMASZ).    The arms industry is not guaranteed any social protection  for  the laid-off employees; therefore, it is hard to predict the  course of practical implementation of the program of conversion  to civilian production.    The Department of Defense Affairs in the Ministry of  Industry  and Trade has not revealed the expected costs of conversion of  the defense industry as calculated for the entire industry  branch. The scale of the financial needs is shown in the  estimated data concerning the costs of the implementation of the  program of restructurization and conversion in Tarnow. ORGMASZ  estimates that this company will require approximately Z2  trillion. Similar sums are also needed by other plants.  However, it is no secret that there is no money in the budget.  <H5>  Poor Ministry of National Defense] </H5>   Over the past four years, the volume of Polish Army orders  for the industry's products has decreased four times. Even  though, during that time, the manpower of the Polish Army has  decreased from 500,000 to fewer than 300,000, some experts say  that the decrease in expenditures was relatively much larger  than the reduction in manpower.    In 1990, MON [Minstry of National Defense] spent Z13.8  trillion (in comparable prices) for new equipment and technical  outfit. In 1993, the ministry could allocate for this purchase  only Z3.4 trillion--that is, approximately 74 percent less.    This year's budget envisions Z47.1 trillion for MON. It was  assumed that no more than Z4 trillion can be spent for  purchases. In practice, this means several Orliks and  approximately 10 Hard tanks. The purchae of two modern MiG-29  fighter planes, of which we have too few to be able to defend  ourselves effectively, would cost us approximately Z1.5 trillion.  <H5>  To a Superior Instance </H5>   MON, whose budget is less than modest, has not yet put in  its  full orders for 1994. The lack of orders from the Army, which  made it impossible to begin the production process, was the  indirect reason for the protest of union activists of the arms  industry (staged on 6 May--the demonstration on the streets of  Warsaw). Military officials who were present at the meeting with  unionists at Skarzysko-Kamienna in early May of this year  promised that 100 percent of the orders would have come to the  factories by the end of this May.    The unionists also demand that the costs of maintaining RO  from 1990 to 1991 (several billion zlotys) be returned to them;  more specifically, they want the government to compensate the  mutual debts of the arms industry, the budget, and the Social  Security Agency. In 1992, the government earmarked  approximately Z1 billions for RO; in 1993, a little more. The  arms-producing factories claim that they must pay for the  state's security with the money from their own, empty pockets.  The arms industry merely managed to obtain compensation for the  losses incurred as a consequence of the imposition of an embargo  by the United Nations on Iraq and to retrieve some of the money  for the equipment sold to the former Soviet Union.    Some more desperate factories, with a view to retrieving the  money they lost through exports to the former Soviet Union,  decided to sue the Government of Poland. In early March of this  year, the Warsaw Rawar company won a trial case against the  Office of the Council of Ministers [URM]. The company demands  that the government give it back Z125 trillion, which Rawar lost  after the Bielecki government broke the contracts with the  Russians. URM has appealed the ruling.</p>

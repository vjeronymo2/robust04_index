			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Alcan joins review of Kemano project ALCAN Aluminium is joining a public review of its plans to complete the Kemano hydro expansion in British Columbia. The company has spent CDollars 500m (USDollars 391m) towards completing the project and will invest more than CDollars 500m on further construction. Kemano's first stage was built in the 1950s to support Alcan's 272,000 tonnes-a-year smelter nearby. Alcan's Canadian smelting capacity is 1.1m tonnes. The company suspended work on the Kemano project in 1991 after a federal court ruled the project must go to federal environmental review. This was reversed by the appeal courts, which found Alcan had fully met a 1987 agreement with the federal and British Columbia governments. Last January the provincial premier Mr Michael Harcourt said the British Columbia Utilities Commission would conduct the public review and report by September 13.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Docklands body to cut 40% of staff THE London Docklands Development Corporation, the government-funded regeneration body, yesterday announced plans to shed 40 per cent of its staff over the next two years. The corporation, which has 456 staff, expects to make half the cuts by the end of next March. High staff turnover and short-term contracts will limit numbers of compulsory redundancies needed. The corporation said no decision had been made on where the redundancies might fall. The decision follows a long review of the corporation's role and staffing needs. The review, which was approved 10 days ago, called for a new management structure. It involves the appointment of several assistant chief executives and senior managers to focus on specific tasks and the pooling of the rest of the staff into a 'task-orientated resource group'. The recession in the property market, which was earlier and more severe in the Docklands than virtually any other part of the country, has created financial difficulties for the corporation. Heavy spending on transport schemes meant that in the year ended March 31 1990, expenditure of Pounds 279m exceeded income by Pounds 4.2m. At the year end, it had a cash balance of more than Pounds 3m and reserves in excess of Pounds 115m. The corporation said that the commissioning of the staffing review pre-dated the arrival of Mr Eric Sorensen, a civil servant from the Department of the Environment, who became chief executive two months ago.</p>

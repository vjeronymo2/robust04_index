			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Brokers defiant as exchanges try to reopen BROKERS throughout India refused to resume trading yesterday after the four main stock exchanges reopened for trading after more than a month, Shiraz Sidhva writes from New Delhi. Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta brokers demanded immediate action on disputed shares after exposure of the Rs3.5bn (Pounds 63.6m) Bombay financial scandal. A cut-off date, to be announced by a special court this week, would allow brokers to change their transfer deeds and help them convert the tainted shares into good shares. 'Members are apprehensive that the shares they deal in today may be tainted tomorrow,' said Mr MR Mayya, executive director of the Bombay Stock Exchange. He hopes markets will resume trading tomorrow following an informal meeting of stockbrokers this afternoon.</p>

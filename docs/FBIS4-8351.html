			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, welfare minister and chairman </F> of the Christian Democratic People's Party, by Pal Reti; place  and date not given: "Silence and Espousal"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Reti] Your party succeeded  in causing a sensation last week with the privatization issue,  which has become the party's number one campaign issue. Why is  the leadership of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]  -- a party that wants to present itself as a careful center  party -- demanding a radical step like a complete and almost  immediate stop of the privatization process?    [Surjan] This proposal is nothing else but to encourage some  thoughtfulness. We are not particularly happy if a state  enterprise is sold at a price that is four times higher than the  declared price, like in the case of the Budapest Kozert because,  in this case, the real value can be even ten times higher than  the original price. The KDNP views on privatization are  different from those of the other two coalition partners, but  this in itself should not lead to the breaking of our  friendship. The symbolic break of a few weeks in signing  contracts between the last day of the current Parliament and the  first day of the new Parliament can also be interpreted as a  gesture to the Hungarian parliamentary life. However, I hope  that no one will see the KDNP as a party that denies the need  for privatization. [passage omitted]    [Reti] When it became clear that, contrary to its bigger  coalition partner, the KDNP is basing its campaign on criticism,  rather than mainly on the embellishment of the past four years,  you often declared that you accept as much from the past as your  share in the coalition. What is the acceptable one-seventh of  the coalition of Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]-Smallholders'  Party- KDNP?    [Surjan] One could also put this question even more nastily,  namely whether we accept everything that is good and nothing  that is bad. If the activity of this coalition is ever analyzed  objectively, and not in the heat of the election campaign, the  balance will clearly be positive. Take, for example, the  poverty issue. The poorest 20 percent of Hungarian society has  advanced as much as the richest 10 percent since 1988. The  percentage of welfare expenses related to the GNP increased from  14 percent to 18 percent. Obviously, we had to withdraw these  funds from production, and if we want a lasting development in  the next four years, we will have to rethink the welfare  distribution as well. [passage omitted]    [Reti] According to opinion polls that you do not value too  highly, the KDNP was at the top in the fall of 1993. At that  time the party "signed up" big names like former finance  minister Ferenc Rabar, industry minister Janos Latorcai, and  state secretary Pal Becker. Your party's popularity has been  dropping since then. Have you, perhaps, started the campaign  too early?    [Surjan] I would not like to send the "message" to opinion  pollsters that I do not appreciate them, but it is a fact that  they regarded us at around 2 percent in the previous elections.  If the KDNP again gets three times as much as the "predicted"  4-8 percent, we will be in quite a good position. As for the  early campaign, we had quite a good publicity in the fall of  1993; then, when our ways parted with the MDF, the KDNP began  receiving less publicity in the media. Television reports on  the party and me were not aired, and important events in the  party were not reported, or were reported insufficiently. All  this is reflected in the opinion polls. [passage omitted]    [Reti] However, the KDNP has a good chance to overcome the  changes. None of the parliamentary parties rejects the KDNP as  a possible partner. As for your economic program -- a "not  hasty" privatization and a "social sensitivity" -- it mostly  resembles that of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP].  However, so far, KDNP leaders have only answered with disdain  to the MSZP approaches and mentioned their "quilted jacket" past.    [Surjan] I can only rejoice at any common elements in any  party's program, because this increases the chances of  implementing these programs. However, the quilted jacket is a  symbol, a symbol of the organization that continues to live in  the MSZP and thus, it is a continuation of the Hungarian  Communists' Party [MKP] and the Hungarian Workers' Party [MDP],  but has not apologized for their crimes. At the same time, the  MSZP is one of the most complex parties: It includes the  national-populist Tabajdi, Annus, and Szuros, who played a  positive role in the past too, but I do not know how they will  be able to cooperate with the Hajdu-group; nor do I know how the  liberal wing close to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]  will cooperate with the Sandor Nagy-group. In principle, a  social democratic party is capable of partnership with both  liberal and socialist parties. Therefore, this is not a  principled rejection. But, the way many people questioned our  real Christian democratic line until I was elected deputy  chairman of the European Christian Democratic Union, the same  way we can also say that the MSZP, which has only an observer  status in the Socialist International, has not yet received a  similar international legitimacy.    [Reti] Would you accept the position of prime minister in a  government coalition in which a current opposition party has  more votes than the KDNP?    [Surjan] Yes I would, but with certain conditions, namely to  refrain from having to make unprincipled compromises for power.  The new coalition must be functional with 55-60 percent of the  votes.    [Reti] After some detours, the KDNP has again included the  direct election of the president of the republic into its  program. Who is your candidate?    [Surjan] The authority of the president of the republic is  well formulated in Hungary today, and we do not want to broaden  his authority. It is too early to nominate a candidate, but it  is sure that the position requires a different person if he has  to be accepted by the whole country through an election  campaign, instead of only being elected by Parliament.</p>

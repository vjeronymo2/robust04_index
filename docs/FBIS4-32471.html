			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on  22 June on page 1 carries a 300-word "eb"-signed report entitled  "Foreign Certificates Will Suffice as of 1 July for Imports of  Fruit and Vegetables." According to the report, the Slovak  Office for Normalization, Metrology, and Testing issued a decree  on 21 June, under which, with effect from 1 July, importers of  fruit and vegetables will no longer have to produce a quality  certificate issued by the Slovak testing authority. The above  decision is also the subject of a 650-word Stefan Mistrik  commentary, entitled "Inadmissible Concession," in Bratislava  SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 22 June on pages 1 and 4.    The NARODNA OBRODA report notes that, as of 1 July, Slovakia  will recognize certificates issued by the OECD, the European  Union [EU], or the "certification authority" accredited in the  country from which the goods come. The Slovaks reportedly took  this "accommodating step" on the basis of a protocol on the  recognition of OECD certificates that was signed by Minister of  Agriculture Koncos and the EU "at the beginning of June."  NARODNA OBRODA notes that the previous requirement for a Slovak  certificate "had greatly complicated and, as a result,  drastically limited imports of fruit and vegetables, including  those that do not grow in Slovakia or of which there is  shortage." According to the paper, importers welcome the new  decree as a "step that will move us closer to the practices used  in fruit and vegetable trade in the world."    Stefan Mistrik opens the commentary by saying: "The Slovak  agricultural public has the right to be enraged. On 10 June  1994, Minister of Agriculture Pavol Koncos yielded to the  European Union commissioner during talks on the recognition of  OECD and EU states' certificates for imports of selected types  of fruit and vegetables. This is an inadmissible concession,  whose consequences for the Slovak economy are scarcely  calculable today. We have opened wide the doors of the Slovak  agricultural market, creating conditions for its inundation with  imported vegetables and fruit."    According to Mistrik, OECD and EU certificates for the  following items will be recognized as of 1 July: potatoes,  tomatoes, onions, garlic, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower,  carrots, cucumbers, green peppers, bananas, citrus fruit,  grapes, watermelons and cantaloupes, apples, pears, apricots,  peaches, cherries, as well as nuts and frozen fruit. According  to Mistrik, this measure will put Slovak growers at a  disadvantage because their produce will still have to meet  strict domestic norms.    Because Minister Koncos "yielded to the pressure of EU  commissioners," Mistrik continues, "the Czechs can laugh because  they have now achieved what they did not achieve in direct talks  with Slovakia only a few weeks ago. What they wanted has been  accomplished for them by EU commissioners."    Besides expressing concern at the "millions of korunas of  which Slovak farmers will be deprived" as a result of the new  decree, Mistrik is also worried about its impact on citizens'  health: "The question arises about the place of the Slovak  citizen in all this. His government does not protect his health.  Last year our inspection authorities ascertained that our  market is flooded with food that is damaging to health. In some  cases, substandard quality goods made up 70 percent of the  imported volume."</p>

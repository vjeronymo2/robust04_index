			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the Act. It contains enforceable emission limitations, it requires monitoring, compiling, and analyzing ambient air quality data, it requires preconstruction review of new major stationary sources and major modifications to existing ones, it provides for adequate funding, staff, and associated resources necessary to implement its requirements, and requires stationary source emissions monitoring and reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B. Part D Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before the Parkersburg, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled applicable requirements of part D due as of the date of the State's redesignation request. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Parkersburg, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area was classified as moderate. (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.347.) Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, West Virginia must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D_specifically sections 172(c) and 176_as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D_due as of the date of the State's November 13, 1992 request for redesignation. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) to mean that for a redesignation request to be approved, the State has met all requirements that applied to the subject area prior to or at the time of the submission of a complete redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come due subsequently continue to be applicable to the area at those later dates (see section 175A(c)) and, if the redesignation of the area is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B.1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable no later than 3 years after an area has been designated as nonattainment under the Act. EPA has determined that these requirements were not applicable to ozone nonattainment areas on or before November 13, 1992, the date the State of West Virginia, submitted a complete redesignation request and maintenance plan for Parkersburg. Therefore, the State of West Virginia is not required to meet these requirements for purposes of redesignation. West Virginia has, however, completed and submitted a 1990 base year emissions inventory for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its ozone nonattainment areas (including the Parkersburg area) in accordance with EPA's guidance. It is also important to note that upon redesignation to attainment, the preconstruction new source review requirements for prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) would apply in the Parkersburg area. EPA approved West Virginia's PSD SIP program on April 11, 1986 (51 FR 12517).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B.2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of title I informed States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to &sect;51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and &sect;51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B.3. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182 Provisions for Ozone Nonattainment Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment area is classified as moderate and is subject to the requirements of section 182(b) of the Act. As of November 13, 1992, the date West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request for the Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment area, the Parkersburg, West Virginia area was required to meet the provisions of section 182(a)(2)(A) to correct its Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements in effect prior to enactment of the 1990 amendments to the Act. The State of West Virginia submitted those RACT corrections as SIP revisions to EPA on June 4, 1991. A notice of final rulemaking approving these RACT corrections was published on September 17, 1992 (57 FR 42895).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that West Virginia had failed to submit either a full or committal SIP revision for a basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for its ozone nonattainment areas. On January 18, 1994, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that West Virginia had failed to submit a 15% rate of progress plan SIP revision for its ozone nonattainment areas. Upon the effective date of a final approval by EPA of West Virginia's redesignation request, these findings will be automatically rescinded in the Parkersburg nonattainment area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated previously, EPA has approved the RACT corrections noted above. Therefore, the State of West Virginia has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above. Therefore, the redesignation requirement of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii) has been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

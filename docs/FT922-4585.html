			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Observer: Ill met However unlucky it may be to re-name a ship, the Royal Navy must be considering doing just that to one of its Oberon-class submarines. With the world's top admirals assembled to watch the RN's Sea Days exercises  -a showpiece for the efficiency of British naval equipment - the vessel collided with a container ship while surfacing in the fog-bound Channel. Although neither was badly damaged, and there were no casualties, the submarine apparently came off worst. Its name? HMS Opportune.</p>

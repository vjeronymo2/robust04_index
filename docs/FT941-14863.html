			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sunkyong seeks control of Korean Mobile Telecom Sunkyong, South Korea's fifth-largest conglomerate, is to drop out of a proposed consortium to operate the country's second cellular telephone network and hopes instead to become the main shareholder in Korean Mobile Telecom (KMT). Forty-four per cent of KMT, the only existing cellular telephone operator, will be sold by auction next week by Korean Telecom, the state-supported telecommunications agency, as part of a privatisation programme. Sunkyong won the licence to operate the second mobile telephone project in 1992, but was forced to give it up after allegations of nepotism under the previous government of President Roh Tae-woo. Allegations of official favouritism have continued; last December the government appointed the Federation of Korean Industries, the country's main business organisation whose head is Sunkyong chairman, Mr Chey Jong-hyon, to form a consortium for the new mobile telecom network by the end of February. Mr Chey said Sunkyong was abandoning the second mobile telecom project to remove suspicions about the biased selection of its partners. Analysts estimate that Sunkyong will have to spend Won300bn (Dollars 369m) to gain a controlling stake in KMT, which is one of the favourite Korean stocks among foreign investors. It has been trading with a premium as high as 95 per cent among foreign investors on the over-the-counter market after its 10 per cent foreign shareholding limit was filled in 1992. The high premium reflects the growth potential for the cellular telephone market in Korea, which has seen an annual doubling in subscribers during the last few years. Sunkyong's decision to bid for KMT will affect the strategy of other Korean companies wanting to enter the mobile telephone market. Pohang Iron and Steel, the country's leading steelmaker, and Kolon, a textile group, were also expected to bid for control of KMT. But analysts believe the departure of Sunkyong from the second mobile telecom project will persuade them to take over that network instead, and avoid a costly bidding war for KMT. Both companies competed against Sunkyong for the second cellular network contract in 1992. KMT is the second state-owned telecommunications company to be privatised recently. In November Korea Telecom sold its controlling interest in Dacom, its only competitor in international telecommunications services, to the Tongyang group.</p>

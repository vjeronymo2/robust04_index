			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Joseph Mace-Scaron: "The Left: Homogeneous </F> or Fragmented?"]    [Text] Until now, the Left has managed to resist the sirens  of division because it included one dominating party, the PS  [Socialist Party], which had a presidential candidate. As these  two pillars have been dealt a serious blow by the results of the  European election, the system appears today on the verge  collapse.    Paradoxically enough, yesterday the Left could be made to  look strong still if one referred to its performance in the  European election of June 1989: 33.7 percent. And yet it never  appeared more fragile, probably because of its fragmentation. A  fragmentation that cannot be blamed solely on the presidential  ambitions of the men leading its various lists -- "European  Solidarity" [headed by PS Secretary General Michel Rocard],  "Radical Energy" [Bernard Tapie], and even "Alternative Policy"  [Jean-Pierre Chevenement]... -- but on significant differences  in methods, rhetoric, and even platforms, to such an extent that  one comes to wonder whether the Left remains a single entity or  it has truly lost its cohesion.  <H5>  New Strategy </H5>   Can this situation pave the way for [European Commission  President] Jacques Delors' return, so often announced and  postponed just as often? By claiming throughout the campaign  that he would run for president "no matter the results on the  evening of 12 June," Michel Rocard had finally impressed his  determination on those who make up the very fabric of a  Socialist Party that increasingly resembles the  Radical-Socialist party of the early 1900's: the mayors.    However, those Socialist leaders who were invited to attend  a  joint meeting with Michel Rocard and Jacques Delors at the  Lutetia Hotel last Friday came out of it with the disquieting  feeling that Michel Rocard had paled into a meek novice when  faced with Jacques Delors' supreme determination and confidence.    Worse for the former advocate of the "second Left": by  proposing a "new alliance" as the campaign was nearing its end,  he jeopardized the only structure he managed to build: the  "Conference for Social Change." Bernard Tapie and Jean-Pierre  Chevenement's negative answers were hardly a surprise for  Socialist policy makers.    However, the biting reply of Communist Party [PCF] Leader  Robert Hue, who still has not been granted a meeting with Michel  Rocard, does not bode well for the would-be alliance.    And it is no secret that most Socialist and Communist  leaders  and elected officials have focusing on the May 1995 presidential  election, and also (above all?) on the municipal election  scheduled to take place shortly thereafter. What the mayors  need is not so much a leader as a new strategy.    The results of 12 June clearly showed that the Left cannot  continue along the same road as the one followed by Michel  Rocard, a leader discredited after the parliamentary election of  March 1993. It is now too late to provoke a "big bang." Indeed,  if there was one, it took place in the ballot box. Left-wing  parties must now come up with something new. Who is to be their  leader this time?    Will it be with or without the party apparatus? Or with or  without Bernard Tapie? The field is wide open for those who  often chose to bet on imagination, but never has time been in  such a short supply for them.</p>

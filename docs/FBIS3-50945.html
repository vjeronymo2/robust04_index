Furthermore, "many Bolivians are walking about with Cuban  kidneys," Cuba's ambassador, Angel Gustavo Bruguez Perez, said  yesterday.    At the end of a formal farewell visit to Bolivian President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the Cuban diplomat completed his  mission with a report on his 10 years in La Paz.    He spoke of the health care programs his country's  government  has supported in Bolivia, including the establishment of three  intensive care facilities for children in the cities of La Paz,  Santa Cruz, and Sucre, where the lives of 5,000 children have  been saved. He said that thousands of Bolivian citizens are now  walking about with Cuban kidneys. These people went to Cuba for  specialized medical treatment.    Bruguez was decorated with the "Condor of the Andes" medal  with the Great Cross, in recognition of his work to benefit  Bolivia during the 10 years he headed his country's diplomatic  legation.    Certain that he will return to Bolivia, the diplomat said he  will again stroll along Avenida Buenos Aires or the Rodriguez  Market. He said he has established a home in La Paz and that his  children are studying in Bolivia. He also spoke of Cuba's  cooperation in sports, especially for Bolivian participation in  the Bolivar Olympic Games.    Minister of Foreign Relations Antonio Aranibar said:  "Despite  the enormous difficulties facing the Cuban people, their  government has provided significant cooperation in the fields of  education, health, and sports."</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE HOME SELLERS GET A DOSE OF REALITY;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: SOFT MARKET HAS OWNERS REDUCING PRICES, ENDURING LONG WAITS. BUT  DON'T BREAK OUT THE HANKIES.  </P> <P> No more long lines of wild-eyed clients writing checks on the sidewalk. No more  open-ended bidding wars. No more weekend frenzies involving capacity crowds at  open houses.  </P> <P> Reality has set in on Southland real estate -- even on the property-rich  Westside, where last year the $340,000 two-bedroom, one-bath fixer became a  familiar part of the coastal landscape.  </P> <P> But analysts and real estate agents say it's not quite time to break out the  hankies for property owners in the Westside and other high-end housing areas.  While home prices in other parts of the country are sliding down like pinballs,  Westside real estate still remains decidedly out of reach for most. However,  for the first time in years, a soft market has led to a glut of homes for sale,  forcing sellers to reduce prices or face long waits as potential buyers hunt  for bargains.  </P> <P> Rather than predicting doom -- the latest Newsweek cover story focuses on the  national real estate bust -- economists say that there will continue to be a  gradual decline in the California housing market, although the cycle may shift  again by this time next year.  </P> <P> "What's happening now is very predictable, since real estate is such a cyclical  industry," said Michael Salkin, an economist and senior vice president at First  Interstate Bank. "We haven't seen the bottom yet, but I don't think it will  slip much further. The market will bottom out, and then it will shift upwards  again."  </P> <P> Salkin said the low end of the market, which on the Westside means homes in the  $300,000 to $400,000 range, will continue to do reasonably well, whereas the  higher-priced models, between $400,000 and $1 million, will move very slowly  during the ongoing recession.  </P> <P> That assessment is borne out by the latest figures on single-family home sales  reported through multiple-listing services. The "more affordable" Westside  homes -- ones in Westchester, Culver City, Mar Vista and West Hollywood -- sold  more quickly, and proportionally closer to their asking price, than other more  expensive Westside properties.  </P> <P> Compared with the frenzied market last year, however, homes in those  neighborhoods remained on the market nearly a month longer. Real estate agents  in those communities, searching for ways to deal in a buyers market, say they  are increasingly turning to lease options or asking sellers to price their  homes for a quick sale.  </P> <P> At the same time, the million-dollar mansions in Beverly Hills, Bel-Air,  Malibu, Pacific Palisades and Brentwood show a widening discrepancy between  asking and selling prices. In Beverly Hills, the difference was $1.1 million;  the listing and selling gap for a Malibu beach house was $1.7 million. Figures  compiled by Jon Douglas Co. show that the average single-family home in those  communities remains on the market an average of four months, nearly 40% longer  than during the third quarter of 1989.  </P> <P> Despite the slowdown, analysts agree that the market for homes priced over $1  million remains largely recession-proof, since those rich enough to afford  those estates are rarely concerned about their next paycheck.  </P> <P> "In a normal world, where people have regular jobs and work every day, the  market is weak," said Burl East, a securities analyst at Bateman, Eichler, Hill  and Richards. "When you're dealing with homes $1 million and up, it's not Buffy  and Chip working as lawyers anymore. You're talking about people whose  financial status is not driven by normal parameters. These are newly minted  starlets and people concerned about whether their latest movie is a hit. I call  it the la-la factor."  </P> <P> Agents working in the "estate divisions" for large real estate firms say the  general slowdown has been fueled in part by homeowners reluctant to sell unless  they get a large profit -- the offshoot of the frenzy that saw people bidding  much more than the asking price during the 1988-89 peak.  </P> <P> "People are still moving, but it's just not booming like it was," said Elaine  Young, a partner with Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young. "When it's slow, people just  spend more time looking for great buys. But recently, I've noticed that a lot  of speculators have begun buying again, and that usually indicates a good  market is not far off."  </P> <P> Analysts said the current economy is just forcing Westside homeowners to accept  a simple fact in the post-boom market: They can no longer expect an annual 25%  appreciation in their houses. Still, they say, if homeowners bought their  properties well before the peak last year, they will probably still earn a  sterling profit when they sell.  </P> <P> "It's all very time-specific and very geographic-specific," said Salkin, who  also serves as the risk manager for the real estate division at First  Interstate. "If you bought right at the peak, then obviously you won't make as  much money, and you might hold on to your property longer. And million-dollar  homes in Beverly Hills and Bel-Air will always hold their value because  industrialists and capitalists from all over the world want to live there."  </P> <P> Since there is little room for new housing on the Westside, the demand will  continue to outpace the supply, keeping prices out of reach for all but 10% of  the residents in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Economists say that as long as interest rates are down, prices won't drop that  much, so a home selling for $350,000 during the peak months probably won't go  for less than $325,000 in the current market.  </P> <P> "Prices are just returning to real life," East said. "During the peak, they  just got way out of line. But when the economy rebounds, the trend will shift,  and prices will rise again."  </P> <P> And if that happens, the average beach home in Malibu will list for more than  $3 million. The average single-family home in Santa Monica will approach $1  million. And modest homes in former blue-collar communities such as Westchester  will cost $400,000.  </P> <P> "Holding the geographic location constant in the real estate market, there will  always be a tremendous demand for housing (in the Westside)," Salkin said. "The  problem is affordability."  </P> <P> AVERAGE PRICE OF HOMES  </P> <P> Figures bases on samples taken by Jon Douglas Co. between April 3 and Oct 3,  1990. Average figures are given for list and sale prices, followed by the  number of days on the market.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P> <P> List: $2,579,158  </P> <P> Sold: $1,481,777  </P> <P> Time: 131 days  </P> <P> Culver City  </P> <P> List: $338,309  </P> <P> Sold: $327,909  </P> <P> Time: 88 days  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P> <P> List: $1,140,333  </P> <P> Sold: $986,475  </P> <P> Time: 121 days  </P> <P> Palms-Mar Vista  </P> <P> List: $392,590  </P> <P> Sold: $370815  </P> <P> Time: 79 days  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P> <P> List: $605.083  </P> <P> Sold: $554,918  </P> <P> Time: 77 days  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P> <P> List: $860,311  </P> <P> Sold: $795,926  </P> <P> Time: 95 days  </P> <P> Westchester  </P> <P> List: $379,345  </P> <P> Sold: $362,995  </P> <P> Time: 92 days  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P> <P> List: $381,184  </P> <P> Sold: $343,870  </P> <P> Time: 94 days  </P> <P> Figures are based on sales reported through multiple-listing services.  </P></p>

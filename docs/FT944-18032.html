			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lagardere to sell stake in SAT Lagardere Group, the diversified French defence and electronics group, yesterday announced that it planned to sell its 26 per cent stake in SAT, the telecoms equipment and electronics company. According to Lagardere, the sale of the stake, which is valued at about FFr1bn (Dollars 188m), will bring a capital gain of FFr500m. The company said the proceeds supported its prediction of a strong rise in profits this year. Earlier this year, Lagardere said it would report a double-digit percentage increase in net profits compared with about FFr500m in 1993. The comparison is complicated by the changed accounting structure following Lagardere's increased holding in its Matra-Hachette subsidiary this year. A spokesman for Lagardere said that the sale of its stake in SAT had been agreed with Sagem, which controls the majority of SAT's shares. It said the sale would take place soon, depending on stock market conditions, and that it would comprise a public offer and an institutional placing, to be managed by Banque Nationale de Paris. Lagardere said the sale was in line with its strategy of disposing of non-core assets.</p>

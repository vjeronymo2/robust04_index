			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / High street food shift forecast HIGH STREET food retailing is set to make a comeback, according to a research report from stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson. The study suggests that the relative costs of running high street foodstores are again becoming favourable for the big grocery chains, which have for decades drifted to out-of-town sites. Changing trends in demographics and travel, the growing importance of offering frequently purchased fresh foods, and the current availability of cheap sites, are all adding to the attractions of running high street stores, the report says. Although grocery chains such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway will continue to press ahead with heavy out-of-town programmes, they may increasingly look to add incremental sales from high street stores. This would enable them to maximise their substantial investments in establishing brand franchises and distribution networks. However, the report says that so far Tesco is the only one of the big three chains to have developed a 'fully-articulated strategy to address new town centre opportunities'. Tesco's Covent Garden Metro store in London is seen as the flagship of a nascent high street chain to compete with Marks and Spencer. Food prices at all the big supermarket chains are 'remarkably similar', according to a report from the National Consumer Council, which suggests there is little competition between the stores. 'It is also clear that the major multiples gain significant advantages from their market power through lower supply prices which are not totally passed on,' it says. The Safeway supermarket chain said there was 'intense competition' in the industry. Your Food: Whose Choice? HMSO. Pounds 10.</p>

The Dabie Mountain area in northern Anhui is rich in natural  resources. But for a long time the local economy remained  underdeveloped due to its inaccessibility. Now the country's  opening up has broadened farmer's minds.    After learning that wild vegetables locally available are  popular in Japan, farmers in Huoshan in this mountainous region  immediately set up a factory to process them for export,  bringing in three million U.S. dollars a year.    They found out that nothing succeeds like success. By 1993  the inland province was home to more than 500 overseas-oriented  operations run by farmers. The goods exported were valued at  close to 1.5 billion yuan last year.    In China, some rural enterprises have been built into  large-scale production bases and can rival foreign competitors.  Their products range from car jacks to sweaters for the  American basketball team "The Chicago Bulls".    Nationwide, farmer-run enterprises exported commodities  worth  190 billion yuan in 1993, up 60 percent over the previous year.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katalin Bossanyi: "Responsibility of Central </F> Bank Greater in `Interregnum'; Gyorgy Szapary on Currency Rate  Policy"]    [Text] "We have an interest in the earliest possible  formation of a new government, and in the period of government  change we will be consulting experts of both the government in  office and the opposition, just as we did before," Gyorgy  Szapary, vice president of the Hungarian National Bank [MNB],  told NEPSZABADSAG. In his opinion, the efforts of both the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] are directed toward a continuation of market  reforms. This is a "good message" for the international world of  finance, as well.    "The reestablishment of macroeconomic balance, that is to  say, stabilization, is central to the economic policy of both  parties, and this is compatible with the MNB's monetary policy,"  the vice president said, who felt it necessary to emphasize that  the central bank was a neutral organization, independent of the  government, but that it had to adjust its monetary policy to the  economic policy of the government in power. As he put it, the  MNB was the supreme guardian of monetary policy, but it could  not perform miracles if the situation of the budget was not  stabilized.    Szapary referred to the international perception that in an  "interregnum" between election rounds and in the period of  coalition meetings, central banks have an increased  responsibility in forming monetary policy. This is especially  true for the situation in Hungary because in the first third of  the year, the deficit in the balance of payments greatly  surpassed projections. As reasons for this, the vice president  gave the increase in imports and the only inaccurately traceable  course of the income generated by exports. Therefore, even  before the first round of elections, the MNB indicated to the  government that it intended to take measures in its own sphere  of authority to prevent a further deterioration in the balance.  It will restrict the liquidity of the domestic money market by,  for instance, buying back bonds, and increase the prime rate of  the central bank. This, in turn, will of course influence the  interest rates offered by commercial banks as well.    Szapary told NEPSZABADSAG that the bank was aware of the  most  diverse conjectures about a devaluation of the forint. He did  not want to say anything definite, because that would only  benefit speculators, but he said that the MNB wanted to continue  its former exchange rate policy of pursuing a "tactic of small  steps." Incidentally, the MNB is currently in negotiations on  issuing bonds abroad.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: EC agrees better access for E Europe THE EC has set aside protectionist instincts and reached broad agreement on measures offering more generous market access for central and eastern Europe. Apart from minor outstanding differences, the package is expected to be endorsed at the EC summit in Copenhagen on June 21-22. In addition to lower tariffs, the measures call for closer political ties with six former communist countries as a step to eventual membership. EC foreign ministers agreed the package in Luxembourg last Tuesday after the European Commission offered minor changes to its original proposals for greater trade liberalisation with Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria. After objections from France and Portugal, the Commission shelved its proposal to shift from a rigid 'quota-based' system in favour of more flexible 'ceilings'. As a result, east European exporters will still face automatic duties if they breach import restrictions. The Commission also retreated from its plan to allow the east Europeans greater flexibility in importing components from the European Free Trade Area but EC member states agreed to a study on the impact of changing these 'rules of origin'. EC leaders still have to resolve differences over how far to deepen institutional ties with the east Europeans. Some member states such as the UK want to convene an early conference to assess their progress toward membership.</p>

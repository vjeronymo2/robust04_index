			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> DISTRICT ATTORNEY;  </P> <P> 2 PROSECUTORS ANNOUNCE ENDORSEMENT OF ENRIGHT  </P> <P> Two prosecutors who lost in the June primary in the district attorney's race  formally announced their support for Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright  Tuesday against appointed incumbent Michael R. Capizzi.  </P> <P> Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman and Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef  also used the news conference to lash out at Capizzi for using employees to  walk precincts on weekends in his campaign.  </P> <P> Enright assailed Capizzi several weeks ago for using office help in his  campaign. But Tuesday, he and the other two prosecutors said they were upset  about a letter from Capizzi's wife, Sandy. It was sent to those deputies who  had indicated to the Capizzi campaign staff that they would walk precincts for  him, but had failed to show up for the preceding kickoff breakfast.  </P> <P> "Sorry you were unable to attend our kickoff meeting . . . we will need lots of  people to cover the county, and if you can persuade friends to walk they will  be appreciated," the letter stated in part.  </P> <P> "The main question is, are these really volunteers," Enright said. "It hasn't  been done in the 30 years that I've been in the district attorney's office. I  think it borders on intimidation."  </P> <P> Enright said he also believed that legally, it was a close question. However,  Enright's campaign staff had already received legal advice that Capizzi's use  of deputies did not violate any state election statutes.  </P> <P> Capizzi, who was appointed by the county supervisors in January when then-Dist.  Atty. Cecil Hicks became a judge, had refused to let deputies in the office  participate in his June primary campaign. But Capizzi said he relented in the  November election because so many deputies had wanted to help.  </P> <P> Tuesday, Capizzi called the Enright-Avdeef-Freeman news conference "sour  grapes."  </P> <P> It was "double-talk", Capizzi said, because Enright is using Freeman in his  campaign and he is technically Freeman's boss. He added that he believes the  three of them are still upset because he got 86% of the deputy support within  the office when deputies were polled by their professional association for an  endorsement for the June election.  </P> <P> "Before the June election, I thought I was up against Edgar Bergen and two  Charlie McCarthys," Capizzi said Tuesday. "I'm still waiting to see which of  them is Edgar Bergen."  </P> <P> But Freeman called Capizzi's use of deputies questionable.  </P> <P> "This is of grave, grave professional concern of people involved and committed  to the real job to man the public's business," Freeman said.  </P> <P> Freeman and Avdeef indicated on election night in June they would support  Enright. Freeman has long been Enright's best friend within the office and had  run as an anti-Capizzi candidate only because it appeared then that Enright was  not going to join the race. Capizzi had been Hicks' chief assistant and had  gained a foothold as the No. 2 prosecutor in the office ahead of Enright.  </P> <P> Avdeef, who was Capizzi's strongest critic in the primary, said Tuesday he was  giving Enright his formal endorsement because "we agree on what has to be done  to make this community a safer place to reside."  </P> <P> Capizzi was easily the front-runner in June, gathering more than 40,000 votes  ahead of Enright, who ran second. But Capizzi fell far short of the 50% plus  one vote he needed to prevent a runoff. He finished with 41%, but Enright, an  eleventh-hour candidate, ran a surprisingly strong race, finishing at 29%.  Avdeef and Freeman had about 29% between them.  </P> <P> Enright supporters believe that the Freeman and Avdeef votes were anti-Capizzi  votes that can make the difference on the November ballot. The Capizzi camp,  however, points out that Capizzi still easily outdistanced Enright and that it  was logical that the other candidates would split up the vote.  </P></p>

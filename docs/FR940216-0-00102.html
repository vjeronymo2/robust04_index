			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Enforcement Test Tolerances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has chosen to set forth enforcement test tolerances in the preamble of this regulation for oxygen, benzene, and RVP, the three parameters that will be subject to enforcement testing for minimum and/or maximum levels under the simple model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters suggested that EPA should set enforcement test tolerances for all seven parameters. One commenter stated the belief that EPA is required by the Clean Air Act to set enforcement test tolerances. Many commenters requested enforcement leniency downstream so that pipelines, while attempting to stay in compliance, do not force refiners to produce reformulated gasoline at even lower specifications than the regulations require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issues Regarding Whether Enforcement Test Tolerances Are Required. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There are three specific provisions in the section 211(k) that refer to establishing test tolerances. The first, section 211(k)(3)(A), establishes a formula fuel as the statutory minimum for VOC and toxic emissions reductions, if the formula fuel is more stringent than the performance standards found in section 211(k)(3)(B). The formula includes a minimum oxygen content of 2.0 wt. % ``subject to a testing tolerance established by the Administrator.'' This provision is inapplicable, however, as EPA has determined that the performance standards in section 211(k)(3)(B) are more stringent than the formula fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, section 211(k)(4)(C) of the Act requires that EPA establish ``appropriate measures of, and methodology for, ascertaining the emissions of air pollutants (including calculations, equipment, and testing tolerances).'' This provision addresses technical issues regarding measurement or determination of emissions of various air pollutants, and does not require that EPA establish enforcement test tolerances. Congress most likely expected that individual vehicle testing by refiners, importers, and EPA would be the basis for quantifying the emissions reductions from reformulated gasolines, with certification of reformulated gasoline based on such individual test programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In using a large data base from several vehicle test programs EPA has exercised the authority provided under this provision, and has established emissions models that are much more accurate and reliable predictors of emissions performance than individual vehicle test programs. Variability in test results was accounted for in the modeling process itself, so that the models include a ``test tolerance'' based on averaging of test results from the vehicle test programs underlying the emissions models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> While Congress apparently expected that EPA would in all likelihood establish a vehicle testing program to measure emissions and certify reformulated gasoline, EPA has instead adopted an emission model that is built on many different test programs. To the extent ``calculations, equipment, and testing tolerances'' is still relevant in this context, it is taken to address testing needed to use the model, such as testing of a gasoline to obtain data for input into the model. The test procedures adopted by EPA typically include provisions designed to address test variability. In addition EPA's regulations specify test tolerances for various parameters, such as when a refiner and an outside laboratory measure the fuels parameters, and specify the acceptable range for such parameters in using the model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has established appropriate test procedures for use with the model, but they measure not air pollution emissions but fuel parameter values needed to operate the model. 40 CFR 80.46. EPA has, however, established test tolerances to determine when fuel parameter values are acceptable for use in the model, as well as limits on the range of the parameters for the model. Where a refiner or importer seeks to augment the emissions model through a vehicle test program, EPA's regulations also include provisions on testing and calculations, and account for test tolerances through the averaging of vehicle test results. EPA believes these fully implement any requirement to establish test tolerances in a context where an emissions model is the methodology to determine air pollutant emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters point to language of various legislators made during the floor debate on the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In the floor debate, various Congressmen made general statements on the issue of whether EPA must provide enforcement tolerances under section 211(k)(4)(C). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There is no clear indication in these statements that Congress intended in section 211(k)(4)(C) to mandate changes in the numerical standards adopted by EPA, or to mandate a regulatory exercise of enforcement discretion. Instead these floor debate statements are most reasonably read as indicating that EPA should establish reasonable testing tolerances in the procedures and methodologies adopted to quantify air pollutants for the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs, so that the regulated community and EPA can measure these air pollutants in a workable, verifiable manner without undue cost. EPA believes that its regulations fully implement this objective. To the extent these statements during the floor debate are read to imply that ``testing tolerances'' should be interpreted the same for purposes of section 211(k)(2)(B) and 211(k)(4)(C), EPA respectfully rejects this interpretation as contrary to the intent of Congress as expressed in the language of the Act. Furthermore, floor debate quotes are not authoritative as to the meaning of the Act, especially where such statements are contrary to the language of the Act itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, e.g., statement by Congressman Hall at 136 Cong. Rec. H12901 (October 26, 1990.) ``A reasonable testing tolerance is expressly provided for oxygen in new 211(k)(2)(B). Under 211(k)(4)(C), EPA must also establish reasonable testing tolerances for all other aspects of this program, to minimize cost and make it workable and verifiable in the real world. EPA is specifically expected to promptly establish such tolerance limits. Similar reasonable tolerances are intended for the CO program in 211(m).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

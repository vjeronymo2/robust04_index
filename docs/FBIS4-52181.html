			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--Ginandjar  Kartasasmita, minister of state for national planning and  development/chairman of BAPPENAS [National Development Planning  Board], said that, to overcome shortages of funds and to improve  efficiency, the Indonesian Government will expand privatization  in various sectors in the next REPELITA [Five-Year Development  Plan].    In reply to a question from World Bank President Louis T.  Preston in a meeting at the BAPPENAS office yesterday, Ginandjar  said that privatization efforts in Indonesia need to be expanded  in various sectors. The objective is not only greater efficiency  but also to overcome the government's ever worsening shortages  of development funds.    According to Ginandjar, privatization has started in the  electricity sector. In the future, privatization will be  expanded to a number of other sectors including the  communications (toll roads, railroads, and ports) and  infrastructure sectors (telecommunications and drinking water).    Ginandjar acknowledged that development funds will be more  limited in the future. The private sector's role in  infrastructural projects, therefore, will be expanded,  particularly in East Indonesia.    A matter more important than privatization is efficiency  issue, Ginandjar continued. Efficiency can be achieved by  promoting competition among private sector managers and  companies as well as among state-owned enterprises.  <H5>  Ministers </H5>   In his meeting with the World Bank president and his deputy,  Gautam S. Kaji, BAPPENAS Chairman Ginandjar Kartasasmita was  accompanied by ministers who handle development of  infrastructure and human resources, namely Minister of Education  and Culture Wardiman Djojonegoro; Minister of Tourism, Post, and  Telecommunications Joop Ave; Minister of Communications Haryanto  Dhanutirto; Minister of Public Works Radinal Moochtar; and  Minister of Health Sujudi.    Ginandjar told reporters that the meeting was absolutely not  for discussion of the size of the loan to be given by the World  Bank in the next fiscal year but was merely for a dialogue on  the expansion of Indonesian development.    According to Ginandjar, loan assistance from the World Bank  for fiscal 1994-95 in the framework of the CGI will not be  discussed until after the Indonesian Government has finished  drafting its funding priorities for development projects for  that fiscal year.    Ginandjar said the Indonesian Government will continue to  take advantage of opportunities for loan assistance from Bank  Indonesia [as published] as well as from other international  financial institutions. He denied that such loan assistance will  reduce government efforts to achieve national self-sufficiency.    "Self-sufficiency absolutely does not mean that we will then  not want to accept loan assistance. If low-interest loan  assistance is available, why should we not take advantage of  it?" Ginandjar said to reporters. The World Bank provided loan  assistance totaling $1.6 billion in the CGI framework in 1993-94.</p>

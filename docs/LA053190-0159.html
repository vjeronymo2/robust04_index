			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AUTOPSY ON KIDNAPED BOY INCONCLUSIVE  </P> <P> An autopsy has failed to determine the cause of death of an 11-year-old  Inglewood boy who was apparently kidnaped on his way home from school last week  and killed several hours later, a coroner's spokesman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The initial autopsy on William J. Tillett, a fourth-grader at Bennett-Kew  Elementary School, must be followed up with additional toxicological and  medical studies, coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said.  </P> <P> Tillett's body was discovered behind a Hawthorne apartment building last  Thursday evening, several hours after his parents reported to police that he  had not returned home from school.  </P> <P> Police said there were indications that Tillett had been bound but no signs of  life-threatening trauma. No suspects have been identified, police said.  </P></p>

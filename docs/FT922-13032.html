			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Arts: Chester Mystery Plays The Chester Mystery Plays, first mentioned in Chester in 1422, have always sought an international connection. Their supposed originator, 'Done Rondall, moonke of Chester Abbe', lobbied at Rome three times 'before he could obtaine leave of the Pope to have them in the English tongue.' The knotty vernacular text survives in five manuscripts (1592-1607). That text, abridged and part translated into Portuguese, forms the basis of a bi-lingual performance of the Mystery Cycle in the largest Anglo-Portuguese theatre collaboration to date. The result is a worthwhile production of great enterprise. Sixteen actors from four companies tour for six weeks in Portugal (Braga, Evora, Porto, Lisbon), finishing at the Mermaid Theatre, London. The production unites actors from the Companhia de Teatro de Braga, the Centro Dramatico de Evora and the Seiva Trupe of Porto under the aegis of the London Theatre Ensemble. The Portuguese companies had not worked with English actors before; and neither - such is the structure and culture of theatre in Portugal - had they worked with each other. The project also attests to the degree of collaboration possible between state and private funding bodies in England and Portugal. The Gulbenkian Foundation, The Secretaria de Estado da Cultura and the British Government (through British Council and Arts Council grants) each provided 30 per cent of the budget. The shared religious and cultural experience makes an apt choice for such a joint venture. The Cycle celebrates rather than enacts the biblical narrative. On stage at Evora, the second leg of the tour, the Cycle shows both the scope and limits of bi-lingual collaboration. One hears alternate lines or speeches in English and Portuguese; the effect at first dislocates and then focuses the attention; one recognises parts of the Catholic litany, familiar in Latin or English, but now intelligible in Portuguese. The two languages, switched and intercut on stage, produce tense effects: Cain and Abel, Abraham and Isaac, Gabriel and Mary at the Annunciation, Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Resurrection; all these pairs successfully play their scenes in Portuguese and English, where only a bi-lingual speaker would know exactly what is happening. When language is not fundamental or available, the staged gesture and positioning need to be more obvious and explicit. Here, the company's preparatory workshops on non-verbal communication have helped stress the dramatic rather than verbal interchange; but perhaps even more can be done. A common language of gesture began to emerge throughout the Cycle at Evora; the cast needs to be fluent in it. While this five-hour Cycle is a cultural and logistical success for the producer David Westhead, the action on stage could still benefit from more of the energy which put it there. There are moments of achieved potential in a magical Creation, where God looks into the dark under a glowing filament and decides to create light, and in the making of man and woman from clay models; later, stage effects, gesture, movement and tone create a tense Last Supper and Betrayal and a complex debate with Pilate. The Scourging and Crucifixion of Christ are both harrowing, they speak and show the language of violence and grief. As the production matures, it should become more muscular and robust. Mark Dornford-May's direction eschews music and special effects, bringing the action down to exchanges between individuals. He avoids the temptation of the anarchic approach in keeping with the street setting of the original Mystery plays, and so keeps confusion at bay. But a formulaic approach would have made some scenes (the Temptation, the raising of Lazarus) more accessible. The design (by Claudia Mayer) is simple and uncluttered: a bare stage with a grey backdrop and a huge sun; it absorbs quick changes and entrances, a door becomes a tomb, a table an ark or a sepulchre. While the lighting remains clear and plain, the costumes provide the colour and variety as each actor appears in several roles. The 1607 Chester text introduces the plays with a note that when one Sir Henry Francis of Chester Abbey (another supposed author), staged the plays, he 'obtained of Pope Clemens a thousand daies of pardon for every person that resorted peaceably to see the same playes.' Wherever he may be now, Sir Henry should be confident about this latest production. London, Mermaid Theatre (071) 410 0000, from April 22 to May 2</p>

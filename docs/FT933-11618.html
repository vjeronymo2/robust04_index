			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report COPPER closed higher on the LME after a break above Dollars 1,930 a tonne for three-month metal, injecting stability into most other metals. Dealers said buy stops were triggered around Dollars 1,935, with the market hitting a high of Dollars 1,949, before prices eased. As usual, fundamentals took a back seat in copper, with the market ignoring stocks at 15-year highs and the lessening possibilities of stoppages in Peru and the US. Instead, nearby supply tightness helped the market move up into a new Dollars 1,930 to Dollars 1,950 range. Three-month ALUMINIUM was steady on the back of copper. Strong resistance is expected above current levels, but good support is emerging on dips, indicative of the recent slight improvement in sentiment. Three-month NICKEL recovered from the morning's six-year low of Dollars 4,850 a tonne to register a Dollars 37.50 gain on the day. But further advances will attract selling, as stocks are seen rising further following yesterday's 1,368-tonne increase to a record 100,392 tonnes. Chicago WHEAT was higher at midsession on concern about declines in crop production and quality following excessive wet weather in the central plains. Compiled from Reuters</p>

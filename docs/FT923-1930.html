			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: No joy in the camp of Seguin CHAMPAGNE had been flowing throughout the early evening at the Paris headquarters of the anti-Maastricht campaign in expectation of a victory for the No faction. But the bubbly fell flat as soon as the first estimates of the referendum results flashed across the television screens. The supporters of Mr Philippe Seguin and Mr Charles Pasqua, the conservative right RPR politicians who had been spearheading the No campaign, had been toiling throughout the summer in a desperate attempt to swing French public opinion against the Maastricht Treaty. As soon as the result estimates appeared they knew that their hard work had been worthless. 'No]' cried one. 'I just don't believe it,' said another. A third man wiped tears from his eyes. 'To think that we came so close.' Scores of No campaigners were squeezed into the offices of Mr Seguin and Mr Pasqua on the rue Francois Premier in the glossy eighth arrondissement of Paris.

A band played can-can music as a group of festive Yes campaigners did an impromptu dance for the benefit of the TV cameras. The cobbled courtyard in the centre of the Socialists' opulent Hotel Particulier had been turned into a carnival tent for the evening with a marquee roof decked with the flags of all the European Community member states. 'It's great,' said one campaigner. 'Absolutely fabulous,' shouted another. 'The results couldn't be better.' The pro-Maastricht faction had prevailed by an extraordinarily slender margin but that did not seem to bother the partying Socialists. All that seemed to matter was that the Yes camp had won - not by how much. A fresh cheer greeted the announcement of each result from the different French regions. 'We're going to party all night long,' cried one man in a 'Oui' T-shirt. 'After all, we've won.'</p>

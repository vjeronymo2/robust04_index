			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 3 SAPA -- The announcement of  results in South Africa's historic elections came to a dramatic  halt Tuesday [3 May] evening as election officials apparently  decided to have a re-think of the whole counting procedure.    The counting of the estimated 19 million votes had already  dragged on for four days, and the opening of provincial  assemblies, originally scheduled for Thursday, had been  postponed to Saturday because the composition of the party blocs  was still far from being decided. There was no immediate  official word from the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC],  the body overseeing the poll, on why it had halted its running  flow of the latest voting count, but sources said it was having  a look at the entire procedure and that it might be as long as  24 hours before it was ready to resume announcing results.    IEC Media Director Pieter Cronje said, in response to  inquiries from the media, that he was unaware of any such halts,  but would investigate. Meanwhile, after the last results for  the present were issued shortly after 6 PM Tuesday, the crucial  two-thirds majority sought by the African National Congress  appeared to be beyond reach. At that stage 12,073,405 counted  votes from last week's polling had been released.    Standing at 62.5 per cent of the poll, the ANC had to win  more than 76 per cent of the anticipated outstanding votes to  reach the 67 per cent mark which would allow it to change the  negotiated interim constitution at will.    While there were neither definitive statistics on the number  of eligible voters nor how many cast their ballots last week,  IEC Spokesman Kumi Naidoo anticipated the final poll would stand  between 70 and 85 per cent of an estimated 22.45 million voters.  On these figures, the ANC would require between 76.58 and 85.43  per cent of the remaining votes to reach the two-thirds mark.    But trends since midnight on Monday to 6 PM on Tuesday  suggested the ANC majority was being reduced by the Inkatha  Freedom Party, probably as delayed KwaZulu/Natal results  trickled in. The IFP had risen to 8.3 per cent from 5.8 per  cent in this period, while the ANC share had fallen from 63.8 to  a low of 62.2 before recovering to 62.5.    The second-placed National Party [NP] dropped to 22.1 per  cent from 23 per cent during this period. The Freedom Front  [FF] in fourth place had 2.7 per cent, followed by the  Democratic Party (1.7) and the Pan-Africanist Congress (1.3).  The African Christian Democratic Party was the only other party  in contention for parliament.    Of the nine regions, the ANC had surged ahead in four. It  had recorded a massive 90.5 per cent in the Northern Transvaal,  84.9 per cent in the Eastern Cape, 81.7 per cent in the Eastern  Transvaal, and 76.5 per cent in the Orange Free State.    The ANC's majorities in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] and Northern Cape were 55 and 49.7 per cent. But  in KwaZulu/Natal the IFP maintained its majority of about 53.5  per cent with an estimated quarter of the counted votes released.    In the Western Cape, the ANC conceded defeat to the NP which  had a 54.9 per cent majority after nearly two million votes had  been released.    Meanwhile, the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]  management committee postponed the first sitting of the nine  provincial parliaments from Thursday to Saturday, presumably  because of the slow rate of counting. Likewise, the first  meeting of the National Assembly was rescheduled to Monday.    The TEC's decision was based on information from the IEC. Mr  Naidoo said the IEC met on Tuesday afternoon to discuss, among  other things, the announcement of final provisional results and  the certification of the election.</p>

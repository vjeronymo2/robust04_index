			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles in Chinese joint venture Courtaulds Textiles, the clothing and fabrics group, yesterday announced its first move into China with the formation of a joint venture to produce knitted fabrics. The move follows 18 months of exploratory visits and talks with officials in Jiangsu Province, the centre for the country's textile industry. Under the joint venture agreement, Courtaulds will invest Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.6m) over three years in Penn China - a new manufacturing company based in Nanjing, the provincial capital some 150 miles from Shanghai. Although other UK textile companies have embarked on similar schemes, Mr Noel Jervis, chief executive, claimed it was the first deal involving stretch fabrics. 'Penn China will knit, dye and finish fabric for the lingerie and automotive trim markets both in China and for export,' he said. Courtaulds will hold 85 per cent of the shares, with the remainder retained by Jiangsu Provincial Textiles Bureau. The venture is expected to strengthen the company's foothold in south-east Asia, where it already has operations in Thailand and the Philippines. If successful, Mr Jervis said the company would consider investing a further Dollars 20m in a lace manufacturing plant.</p>

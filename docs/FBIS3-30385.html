			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Eduard Selami, chairman of the Foreign </F> Policy Commission in the People's Assembly, by Artjan Tepelena  in Tirana; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Tepelena] Did the last session of the Council of  Europe Parliamentary Assembly approach the question of Albania's  membership?    [Selami] I would say yes, because from a procedural point of  view, a further step was made -- namely, this session defined  which correspondents will come here to draft a final report at  the end of March. The commission will then discuss this and  finally decide on Albania's full membership in the Council of  Europe. Apart from Albania, the dispatching of correspondents  was not granted to any other country, due to their own problems.  Even in the meeting with Martinez, as well as with Atkinson and  other group chairmen, all of them confirmed that there is no  problem concerning Albania's membership. It is a procedural  process for Albania to be admitted, which is why they sent  correspondents. If there had been problems, then of course the  contrary would have been felt -- we would have said the answer  is positive, but there is a problem and for this reason Albania  will not be accepted.    [Tepelena] Meanwhile, foreign news agencies have been  broadcasting a report concerning a Council of Europe resolution  on compensation for our country's losses due to the embargo,  which amount to $80 million. What do you think about this aid,  and is it sufficient, especially after your discussion there, in  which you once again confirmed that Albania favors the  continuation of the embargo?    [Selami] I do not think it is sufficient. Our losses are  greater, and this was one of the goals of the discussion. I  addressed the Council of Europe session in the name of the  delegation. I think this is a good beginning. The other aspect  that you mentioned, which was something special and was welcomed  by some of the delegations, was the fact that despite the  economic losses we are experiencing, we consider the embargo and  its observation as an indispensable condition not only to stop  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina but to also prevent it from  spreading to other parts, which would be very problematic. This  was the message we transmitted there.    [Tepelena] Parliamentary group Chairmen Ali Spahia and Namik  Dokle were also members of your delegation. Some newspapers  have reported that in the discussion on human rights, the Nano  question was particularly focused upon. What is your reaction?    [Selami] Of course, it was discussed. It is a problem that  cannot be avoided because he is the opposition leader. Despite  the fact that he is imprisoned on charges from the time when he  was prime minister, it is understood that when the delegation  and the commission of non-member countries arrived here, this  problem was put forward. Even now, this has become the main  focus of the opposition. We regret that a consensus to enter  the Council of Europe has not been reached because the Nano  question is always popping up. I think that such a  personalization is not fair. However, this is a problem that  belongs to the opposition. I would also like to say that this  was not the main problem and that it was not treated in a  special way, because if it had been, the correspondents would  not have come. We have discussed this question, and we think  that this is a problem that justice needs to deal with. Justice  will have its final say. Thus, we feel that there is nothing  more that we, as a political force, can do in this direction.    [Tepelena] Thank you.    [Selami] Thank you.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: AT&amp;T/NCR American Telephone and Telegraph's five-month bid for NCR looks to be over bar a little more shouting. Sunday's improved offer from Ma Bell delivers the Dollars 110 per share demanded by NCR, at least on the basis of the AT&amp;T price at Friday's close. While the target company is demanding still more protection for shareholders in the event of AT&amp;T stock slipping back, there is a limit to which such guarantees can be reasonably extracted. An agreed deal has always been on the cards, though Wall Street's strength is helping resolve a corporate battle which has been grubby even by US standards. AT&amp;T has been beleaguered on several fronts. It may have scuppered NCR's plan to put 8 per cent of the votes into the hands of its employees but, as things stand, it is due back in court soon to try to remove another poison pill. The telecoms giant has managed to unseat only four members of the NCR board and is faced with the ousted chairman continuing the fight as chief executive, while staff morale at both companies may soon become an issue. With all these problems banking up, it seems prudent to take advantage of the healthier share price, pay a little more and hope NCR goes quietly. The all-paper nature of the new offer is crucial, since it would allow AT&amp;T to account for the takeover without having to write off goodwill against earnings. AT&amp;T shareholders nevertheless face some short-term dilution. They will also have a long wait for the benefits, though that is not to say they will not come. It is just that the precedents for merging computer and communications businesses - very much a 1980s idea - are not terribly auspicious.</p>

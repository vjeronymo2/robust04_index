			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Toporkov, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA </F> correspondent in Tambov: "The Governor Has Become Enraged; War  With Oblast Soviet Continues in Tambov"]    [Text] It was difficult to find the open room on the third  floor of the old private residential house in the center of  Tambov, over which the Russian tri-colored flag still shudders  dimly and shamefully. All the others were locked tight and  sealed with several seals. But in this one room was the entire  apparatus of the oblast soviet, all of the representative  people's power. I could not help but think: Here it is, the last  redoubt of the Tambov deputies.    It was no accident that this military terminology came to  mind. What has been going on in Tambov during recent months is  reminiscent of fierce battles. Here the head of oblast  administration, V. Babenko, has declared a real war against the  soviets. But if it were only a war of words...    Vladimir Dmitriyevich is conducting the siege of the Tambov  "White House" on a broad scale, using the subdivisions of the  militia, the mass media, and threats to cut off the deputies'  telephone service. In general, the entire experience of  Krasnopresnenskaya embankment has been taken into the arsenal,  except that there are no devoted Taman followers in Tambov and  they are not shooting at the building from tanks. Also, the  plumbing works.    What sins have the Tambov deputies committed before Mr.  Governor? Here we must take a short excursion into the past.    V. Babenko assumed the chair of the head of administratipon  after the events of August 1991 which were victorious for the  "democrats." The chief physician of the oblast hospital, a  urologist by education, he at first conducted himself loyally in  regard to the oblast soviet. Vladimir Dmitriyevich liked to  emphasize the fact that there was complete peace and mutual  understanding in the relations of the local executive and  representative power, and that together they have only one noble  goal--to show concern for the people's welfare.    It is true, however, the welfare of the people was ever  dwindling, and it was necessary to find a "scapegoat." And so  they found one, particularly since the events of  September-October thundered in Moscow. Here the power of  Vladimir Dmitriyevich unfolded to its full extent, as well as  that of the president's representative, V. Davituliani. The  latter directly announced in the pages of the press that "it is  specifically A. Ryabov (the chairman of the oblast soviet--V.  T.) who bears the main responsibility for the failures in the  economy, since he... subordinated the oblast administration to  himself." V. Babenko found another accusation. He exposed the  oblast soviet in its anti-governmental, anti-presidential and  confrontational position.    Mr. Babenko did not specifically decipher the manner in  which  this "terrible position" was expressed, believing that it was  enough simply to issue the verdict: As of 22 October, to cease  the activity of the Tambov Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies  and its agencies. It is true, the decree also spoke of one other  reason for the impossibility of the oblast soviet's  implementation of its functions--"due to the absence of a quorum  as a result of the mass resignation of its deputies from their  powers and authorities." We will return to this accusation, but  for now we must remind the honorable Vladimir Dmitriyevich that  no later than 11 October the session of the oblast soviet  adopted by a two-thirds vote the decision not to include the  question of self-dissolution on the agenda. Only six deputies  supported this proposal.    That is when the pressure on the deputies started. Their  official statements began to come in, which were brought by  special messengers from the rayons. But without waiting for the  decision of the mandate commission on the correctness of these  statements, the governor publicized his decree at the meeting of  the minor soviet. Naturally, the minor soviet found it to be  unlawful, and on the basis of the Russian Federation law, "On  the Kray Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies and the Kray Oblast  Administration" (no one has repealed this law even to this day),  the minor soviet appealed to the Russian Federation Procurator  General and the oblast procurator with the request to answer:  Are such actions by the head of administration legal?    The Procurator General of Russia, A. Kazannik, kept quiet in  this affair. However, the oblast deputy procurator, V. Amelin,  directly announced that since the minor soviet repealed the  decree issued by the head of the oblast procurator's office, he  finds no grounds for intervention. Although it is written  somewhat ingeniously, it is not difficult to deduce the fact  that the procurator's office holds the actions of the minor  soviet to be correct.    It would seem that this should be the end of the Tambov  battles. But no, this merely egged the governor on to new  skirmishes. Speaking at a press conference, he openly announced  that, of all the political problems today, the question of  liquidating the soviets of all levels stands in first place. And  that was the beginning of it all. The financing of the oblast  soviet was cut off, the automobiles were "arrested", and then  the phones were disconnected. As of 1 November, the oblast  soviet apparatus has been placed on leave for a month and a  half. And although such a term is not indicated in any KZOT  [Code of Laws on Labor], nevertheless this did not trouble the  head of administration. He generously paid, out of the  taxpayer's pockets, the month-and-a-half idle time of the  people, many of whom, we might add, had already taken their  regular vacations even before.    This saga was further continued on 16 December. As described  in the local press, it was specifically on this day that they  were met at the oblast soviet building with sealed doors of  offices and a reinforced militia guard. It is true, some people,  as they say, were able to slip into the building. Deputy Head of  Administration I. Filatyev assured them that all would be placed  in jobs within the course of the present day.    Mr. Filatyev was evidently hasty in this announcement. Even  today, not all the workers have been placed in jobs. But that is  not all. Who gave permission to violate the labor legislation in  the most blatant manner, to nullify the presidential edict of 26  November 1993, which clearly states that a change in the staff  numbers and structure of the apparatus of the Soviet of People's  Deputies is not permitted in the period prior to start of work  of the new representative organ?    I believe that Mr. Babenko's attitude at that time was  definitely influenced by the results of the elections to the  Federal Assembly. They turned out to be rather pathetic for the  Tambov "democrats." Having understood where the gentlemen from  Babenko's command were leading the oblast, the voters gave them,  in the words of Sholokhov, "a complete thrashing." People who  were not subject to political twists and turns were elected to  the Federal Assembly. Among them was A. Ryabov, the chairman of  the oblast soviet.    Here it is time to say a few words about the chairman of the  soviet. Aleksandr Ivanovich worked his whole life in the Tambov  area. He is a candidate of science and enjoys great authority  among the people. And he entered the elections with a precise  and clear program of preserving people's power, implementing  social justice and protecting the interests of the people. We  might add that he registered not as the former, but as the  currently acting chairman, and the people appraised the true  worth of Ryabov's civic courage. He won by a large margin,  beating out that very same Babenko and the people from his  command.    This blow to his self-esteem rocked V. Babenko. He hastily  announced in the press that conclusions would be drawn also in  regard to the activity of the oblast agricultural  administration, the newspaper TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN and the  experienced economic managers. Many of them did not reject their  nomenclature predilections and, in essence, had dealt a stab to  the back, announced the governor.    The situation in the oblast is leading to poverty. Here are  but a few figures. Today there are already more than 13,000  officially registered unemployed persons in the oblast. This is  two or three times more than in neighboring oblasts. The volume  of industrial production has declined by 10.3 percent in a year,  and fewer consumer goods were produced. And here is the  situation in the rural areas. Meat production has declined by 21  percent during the year, milk--by almost 7 percent, and wool--by  22 percent. The herd size of all types of livestock is  declining. Investments in the national economy have declined by  32 percent, and the operational introduction of automobile roads  has declined by 46 percent.    The representative of the president, Mr. V. Davituliani,  best  summed up the truth, I believe. In a lengthy announcement  regarding the situation, addressed to President B. Yeltsin, he  writes that the old and new bureaucrats are hindering the  reforms which threaten to take power out of their hands. "It was  you, Boris Nikolayevich, who imposed this power! Did the people  dream of such power when they supported you in 1991?"    As they say, you can't put it any better than that!    So, the problem is not in the deputies. Nevertheless, the  Tambov governor continues to "storm" his "white house." Having  learned that a meeting of the minor soviet was slated for 15  February, V. Babenko urgently "took measures." At 3 o'clock in  the morning, under the cover of the militia, the doors to the  oblast soviet were once again sealed. And this after the oblast  court of arbitration found the decree by the head of  administration on terminating the financing of the oblast  soviet, on the upcoming lay-off of workers of the apparatus, and  on the attitude toward the newspaper TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN to be  invalid, and after the court decision was handed down to return  the building to the deputies.    Nevertheless, the minor soviet did hold its meeting. It  adopted a decision on measures for ensuring the safekeeping of  the soviet's property, reviewed information on the arbitration  court ruling, and repealed the 2 February decree issued by the  head of administration, "On the System of Organs of State Power  in Tambov Oblast." Almost immediately there followed a statement  by the administration press service, saying that this decision  is nothing other than a statement by a group of private  individuals, and will not be implemented by the organs of  executive power. These actions are qualified as being directed  toward the destabilization of the socio-political situation in  the oblast. No more and no less! Evidently, under pressure from  some forces, the arbitration court also suspended the  implementation of its ruling, forgetting even to specify the  term of this suspension.    In short, the storming of the building on Internatsionalnaya  Street continues. Babenko is also not embarrassed about the  tyranny in regard to Federation Council member A. Ryabov. During  the days when I was in Tambov, the telephone in the room  assigned to him did not work. Not to mention the fact that he  had been deprived of transportation, harried and exhausted by  the terrible strain on his nerves.    Meanwhile, as before, people are going to the oblast soviet,  as before with questions of the most vital importance. They also  do not conceal their attitude toward the tyranny of the  administration. This, roughly, is how N. Perepegin, an engineer  and deputy of the oblast soviet, Deputy V. Drozdovich, a former  scientific associate of one of the institutes, and others with  whom I had occasion to meet characterized Babenko's actions.    Yet the people are worried not only about the tyranny of the  executive power against the soviets. The elections to the oblast  duma are coming up soon in Tambov. Only thanks to the  intervention of the minor soviet was it possible to double the  size of this agency and to eliminate numerous violations of the  effective legislation. But the gentlemen-democrats are once  again bent on their own. Once again they are pushing their  Tambov fellow citizens toward confrontation. For example, the  mayor of the city of Tambov and leader of the "Democratic  Russia" movement, V. Koval, had submitted the TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN  program even at the last elections. It is quite obvious that  some parties cannot be allowed to participate in the elections.  In no case must the electoral commissions register  representatives of the patriotic movement "Otechestvo"  ["Homeland"] or any communist structures, regardless of what  flag they may emerge under. Such an announcement has a wild  smell about it.    Then again, the leaders of the Tambov "democrats" are not  only making political announcements. They are acting  unceremoniously. One of the workers of the oblast soviet told me  how, in his presence, in Mordovskiy Rayon the head of  administration sent a militia detachment to interfere with the  meeting of a candidate for deputy in the Federal Assembly,  Aleksey Ponomarev, with the voters. It is a good thing that  Aleksey Alekseyevich turned out to be not of the timid sort (he  managed to stay in the beseiged House of Soviets on Krasnaya  Presna until the last hour), and forced the zealous militiamen  to leave.    There is currently a fuss going on around the  people's-patriotic electoral association "Rus," which unites  representatives of over ten parties and movements. The  association had a lease agreement with the "Avangard" House of  Culture for several rooms which it needed to conduct business  with voters. After several threatening phone calls, the director  hastened to break this agreement.    Pressure is also being exerted on the mass media. Even on 2  November, the head of oblast administration issued a decree on  handing over to the administration the powers and authorities of  the oblast soviet in regard to the newspaper TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN.  The decree unceremoniously assigns the resolution of the  question of handing over the newspaper's state property, as well  as the question of co-foundership by the oblast administration.  In this situation, the journalists have not yet flinched, but no  one knows how things will be in the future.    ...This year there is a snowy, frost-bitten winter in the  Tambov region. In the city, which, it seems, has long ago been  neglected by the politicians, one cannot even get through along  the main roads. But the snowstorms are raging not only in  nature. They are also devastating the souls of the people,  before whose very eyes the scenes of destruction of the soviets  are being played out and the will of the people is being flouted.    No sooner had I written the last lines of this  correspondence  than I received a phone call from Tambov. A. Chubushev, section  head of the oblast soviet called and bitterly informed me that  the governor had made the decision to hand the oblast soviet  building over to the humanitarian institute. That means there  will be new battles. It is a shame that, amidst all the  political battles, we are losing sight of the individual, for  whom life is not sweet.</p>

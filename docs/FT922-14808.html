			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Brabant Pounds 4.9m in red after write-down Brabant Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas exploration and production company, announced a net loss of Pounds 4.92m for 1991. That compared with profits of Pounds 364,000 for the nine months to December 1990. Tax took Pounds 100,000 (nil) and losses per share were 29.6p (5.1p earnings). The company said the loss was because of the 'prudent decision' to write down the value of unproved exploration assets by Pounds 4.7m in view of the current low oil price and lack of exploration success. Turnover was Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 1.38m) and net oil production jumped to an average of 1,172 (780) barrels of oil a day.</p>

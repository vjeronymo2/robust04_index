			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> IDENTITY OF STARTING CENTER IS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION  </P> <P> It's hard to imagine that the Raiders' game plan could revolve around whether  the Chargers start rookie Courtney Hall or veteran Don Macek at center Sunday  at the Coliseum in the season opener for both teams.  </P> <P> But just in case, the Chargers aren't saying publicly whether it will be Hall  or Macek. Loose lips sink ships. Or some such nonsense.  </P> <P> "The way I practiced today, I probably won't be starting," Hall said Wednesday.  "I don't know."  </P> <P> Hall and Macek alternated in practice with the first team.  </P> <P> "I think it's kind of neat," Macek said of the mystery surrounding a position  that usually goes unnoticed.  </P> <P> Mum's the word, too, on whether Joe Phillips will play against the Raiders.  Phillips, who ended a summer-long holdout by signing Tuesday, practiced for the  first time Wednesday.  </P> <P> "They (the Raiders) are the ones that have to figure that out," said Gunther  Cunningham, the defensive line coach. "I'm not telling."  </P> <P> Cunningham said Coach Dan Henning will make the final decision on Phillips.  </P> <P> Free safety Vencie Glenn hopes there isn't a jinx associated with the Chargers'  annual calendar.  </P> <P> Each month of the year features an action photo of a different Charger. In  August, that player was Lionel James, cut before the month ended. This month,  the featured player is unsigned free agent Gary Anderson, who several days ago  asked to be traded.  </P> <P> Guess who Mr. October is?  </P> <P> "I ain't got no control over that," Glenn said. "But I hope nothing bad happens  to me."  </P> <P> The Chargers have signed four players, all waived by them Monday, to their  developmental squad: safety Michael Brooks, linebacker Ricky Andrews, offensive  lineman Eric Floyd and H-back Craig Davis.  </P> <P> Players on the developmental squad earn $1,000 a week and the right to practice  with the team. The NFL allows teams to keep up to six players on it.  </P> <P> Henning said the Chargers would like one of those six to be a quarterback, but  that quarterback won't be Jeff Graham, because Graham has signed with  Cleveland. Graham, cut by the Redskins, would have been ideal for the Chargers  because he was trained in the Washington offensive system that is similar to  theirs.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> The injury report for Sunday's Raiders-Chargers game at the Coliseum: Chargers  -- tackle Joey Howard (leg) and running back Tim Spencer (neck), questionable;  strong safety Martin Bayless (ankle), linebacker Joe Campbell (knee),  linebacker Jim Collins (hamstring), tight end Arthur Cox (ankle), free safety  Vencie Glenn (calf), wide receiver Jamie Holland (hand), guard David Richards  (arm), guard Broderick Thompson leg) and linebacker Ken Woodard (knee), all  probable.  </P> <P> Raiders -- Safety Russell Carter (shoulder) and wide receiver Sam Graddy (leg),  out; cornerback Dennis Price (knee), linebacker Jerry Robinson (groin) and  guard Newt Harrell (neck), questionable; defensive end Scott Davis (knee),  running back Derrick Gainer (knee) and defensive end Howie Long (ankle),  probable.  </P></p>

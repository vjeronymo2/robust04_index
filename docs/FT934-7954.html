			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Balladur urges banks to ease credit PRIME MINISTER Edouard Balladur yesterday asked French banks to ease the credit crunch that has pushed many small companies under, in a move reflecting concern about the weakness of the country's economic recovery. In return, Mr Balladur yesterday reviewed with leading bankers their demands for a change in the bankruptcy law to give creditors greater security; an extension of government guarantees on bank loans to small and medium-sized companies; and a cut in the tax on bank deposit interest. Defending itself against criticism that banks have been squeezing small companies, the Association of French Banks, which represents about 60 per cent of all banks in France, said yesterday its total loans outstanding at September 30 1993 were 2.5 per cent larger than a year earlier. But the association acknowledged that the recession had forced banks to be more cautious in lending to smaller companies. The government is already in the process of meeting several of the banks' demands. A reform of the bankruptcy law, to give creditors greater protection when a company declares itself bankrupt, is to go before the national assembly next week. Meanwhile, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, yesterday said the government intended to cut tax on the recovery' bank deposit interest from 39 to 19 per cent in 1995. The 39 per cent tax rate has encouraged savers to put their money into lower-taxed money market funds rather than deposits which banks can count into their balance sheets. 'Banks must play their part in the recovery,' Mr Alphandery told the national assembly. 'It would be very damaging if a lack of dynamism in our banking sector put a brake on the recovery which could begin in the months to come.' The minister's parliamentary statement and the summoning of banking chiefs to the prime minister's office are part of the government's desire to show it is leaning on bankers to raise economic activity and cut joblessness. After the meeting, Mr Michel Freyche, president of the Association of French Banks, said that 'to the extent we have given them (small companies) the cold shoulder, we will do so less in the future'. Mr Balladur's caution over interest rate cuts was again evident when he discussed next year's economic prospects with his own RPR party's backbenchers earlier this week. 'In 1994 France should return to a growth rate which is feebly positive,' he said, hardly a ringing reaffirmation of his government's official forecast which is still for 1.4 per cent real growth next year.</p>

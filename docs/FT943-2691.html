			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Crunch nears on BT3 Investors in BT3 will get a letter next week asking them to pay the final 120p instalment on their shares. The first two payments totalled 290p against a market price now of around 264p. Dealing in the partly-paid shares will end on September 30. Cheques must be received by October 6 in order to meet the payment deadline of October 11. But some brokers and share shops are asking for the money well before the end of September. If a shareholder fails to pay up in time, the Treasury will take back the shares and sell them. The shareholder stands to get back a maximum of 290p less costs but, in practice, the amount paid is likely to be less: the market price less costs. If you want to pay the final instalment, just send off your cheque together with the call notice asking for the instalment in time. If you want to sell without paying the final instalment, then the sooner you do so, the better: many brokers have a selling deadline well before the end of September. But wait until you have got your call notice. If you want to keep a stake in BT but cannot afford to make the extra payment, you need to sell some of your partly-paid shares in order to make the additional payment on the others: an operation known in the trade as cannibalisation. Personal equity plan-holders should check they have cash available.</p>

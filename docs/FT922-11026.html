			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Serbs proclaim new Yugoslavia THE Serbian-controlled parliament yesterday decreed the demise of the Yugoslav federation of six republics and proclaimed a new Yugoslavia within the boundaries of Serbia and Montenegro. By declaring itself the successor to the federal state, the new Serbian Yugoslavia hopes to avoid the need to seek recognition of its successor status from the European Community and other states. But EC diplomats, with the exception of Greece, and diplomats from the US and Canada distanced themselves from the new state by boycotting the muted ceremony. It was attended by diplomats from China, Russia and many non-aligned countries. In Brussels, Community diplomats warned that the issue of the 'successor state' was for all republics to decide in the EC-sponsored peace conference, not Serbia unilaterally. The new state, in which ethnic Serbs make up 62 per cent of the 10.5m population, covers only 39 per cent of the territory of the former federation. It includes 1.8m ethnic Albanians, who form more than 90 per cent of the population of the southern province of Kosovo, and 346,000 ethnic Hungarians who comprise 16 per cent of Vojvodina, to the north. Both gained autonomous status in 1974 under President Tito but lost it under Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic. Diplomats in Belgrade say proclamation of the new state was advanced so as to precede tomorrow's session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which is to debate exclusion of Yugoslavia. The EC and US have put most blame on Serbia for destabilising Bosnia-Hercegovina, which was recognised as independent on April 6. Outside the parliament, an anti-Communist crowd chanted 'red bandits' as the new flag was raised over the parliament which was elected in Communist-run elections six years ago. The ceremony was boycotted by ethnic Albanians. In an attempt to appease the west, the federal parliament also yesterday hastily adopted a new constitutional law which promises the same respect for human and minority rights as other CSCE member countries grant their minorities. Meanwhile, heavy shelling broke out last night in Sarajevo shortly after the republic's President Alija Izetbegovic ordered the Yugoslav federal army, seen as a defender of the Serbian minority, to leave. It was the first outbreak of shooting in the capital since the EC-mediated ceasefire came into force late on Friday. In Lisbon preliminary talks began between Mr Jose Cutileiro, the EC's special representative, and Serbian and Moslem delegations to the EC-sponsored peace talks on Bosnia-Hercegovina. A Portuguese foreign ministry spokeswoman said officials were still awaiting the Croat delegation.</p>

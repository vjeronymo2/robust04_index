			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 13 (AFP) -- A Bosnian Government  offensive launched Sunday [9 January] has made considerable  inroads into the Croat-held pocket around the central Bosnian  town of Vitez, a UN Protection Force spokesman said Thursday.    The mainly Moslem Government forces made a "considerable"  advance Wednesday in an action designed to cut the enclave in  two and cut the land route linking Vitez with Busovaca, another  Croat-held enclave, Lt-Col Bill Aikman said.    Several points along the Vitez-Busovaca road were seized by  government troops from the Croat Defence (HVO) Forces after  heavy fighting, Aikman said. Fighting was continuing in the  Vitez enclave early Thursday despite an announcement on  Wednesday that Bosnian government and Croat leaders had agreed  to work out the terms of a "total" ceasefire to become effective  on Saturday.    Aikman said he did not know whether heavy Bosnian  bombardment  of the locality of Bila, north of Vitez, on Wednesday signalled  the start of a new offensive.    Sarajevo radio said a helicopter of the regular Croatian  Army  fired several air-to-ground missiles at Bosnian civilian targets  near Vitez and Novi Travnik Thursday.    Military activity in Bosnia-Herzegovina eased slightly on  Wednesday, Aitken said, with Sarajevo enjoying a quieter day  than in much of the preceding period. Serbs besieging the city  fired 350 shells, and were targetted in return by 10 shells.  Six people were killed in Sarajevo and 36 wounded, he said.    A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Kris  Janowski, complained meanwhile that Bosnian Serbs were  practising bureaucratic obstructionism in order to prevent the  sick and wounded being evacuated from government-held areas.    "The Serbs never openly say no, but they always find  problems  to drag things out," Janowski said, citing the cases of at least  five people who died while waiting for Serb authorisation to be  moved from the enclaves of eastern Bosnia.    The UNHCR also encountered difficulties with the Bosnian  authorities in the government-held northern town of Tuzla, who  were demanding that they should be allowed to make their own  choice among the wounded of candidates for evacuation, Janowski  said.</p>

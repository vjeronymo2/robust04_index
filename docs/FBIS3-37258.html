Mr Kravchuk wrapped up  his sentence with the words "nuclear nightmare", shook his  lacquered white helmet of hair and was gone.    A telephone call from the German chancellor is one sign of  the international attention being paid to Ukraine. Another is  Mr Kravchuk's forthcoming visit to the US, which has been moved  forward from March 16 to March 3.    Ukraine is in the spotlight because various factors --  resurgent nationalism in Russia, last month's victory for  Russian separatists in Ukraine's breakaway Crimean peninsular,  and economic collapse -- have converged over the past few weeks.  Many observers, from the CIA to Britain's Royal United Services  Institute, a defence think- tank, have come to a worrying  consensus that "a probable conflict" is looming between Ukraine  and Russia.    Mr Kravchuk, the first democratically elected president in  the 1,000-year history of this nation of 53 million, makes clear  that the effects of war would be widespread. "Remember that  Ukraine still has 176 nuclear missiles and that Russia has three  times as many," he told the Financial Times yesterday. "Let no  one imagine that if a war were to explode between two such  countries, he could be somehow immune to the nuclear poison that  would be released."    For Ukraine, keeping the peace with Russia is a particularly  tricky balancing act. On one hand, as Mr Kravchuk repeats again  and again, Ukraine is eager to have "good neighbourly relations  with Russia", which is, after all, its single biggest trading  partner. On the other hand, he is equally emphatic that Ukraine  will not surrender a single inch of sovereignty.    "I repeat again what I have from the very beginning: I will  never take a single step in the direction of reducing Ukrainian  independence. I will never change my position on this issue,"  Mr Kravchuk insisted in the cultivated Ukrainian which he  pointedly speaks at all public appearances.    This deep-seated commitment to independence, which is shared  even by the Russified and Russian-speaking members of the  Ukrainian elite, is why Mr Kravchuk rejects the steps  neighbouring Belarus has taken to ensure friendly relations with  Russia -- rejoining the rouble zone and re-entering Russia's  foreign policy sphere of influence.    Although Ukraine's inflation rate of 80 per cent in December  gives some indication of how rocky Kiev's road to independence  has been, Mr Kravchuk is adamant that the Belarussian route "is  not a resolution of the problem. It is just a return of the old  ways." Worryingly, economic chaos is prompting a similar desire  for reintegration with Russia in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.    Walking the tightrope between friendly relations and  reabsorption is a task to which the wily Mr Kravchuk is perhaps  particularly well suited. Since 1991, when he underwent a  conversion from communist ideologue to nationalist leader, Mr  Kravchuk has won a certain notoriety as a man who has elevated  vacillation into a political philosophy.    Now the politician who prides himself on his ranking as a  chess Grand Master believes he has discovered a move which will  help Ukraine maintain its precarious geopolitical balance -- a  strong relationship with the west. Mr Kravchuk's opening gambit  came last month when he signed a historic tripartite agreement  with the US and Russia, under which Ukraine pledged to give up  all its nuclear weapons. He succeeded in an even more difficult  move last week, when he persuaded Ukrainian parliamentarians  many of whom greeted the initial agreement with cries of treason  and calls for impeachment -- to remove obstacles to ratification  of the accord.    Mr Kravchuk and US diplomats in Kiev, who are effusive in  their praise of the president's "remarkable political skills,"  say the nuclear issue is decided. They believe Ukraine will  surrender all its nuclear weapons and Mr Kravchuk himself thinks  it is just a matter of time -- perhaps later this month --  before the Ukrainian parliament joins the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty.    But the president has not orchestrated this newly amenable  stance on the nuclear issue without expecting something in  return. In addition to upwards of $1bn, which Ukraine is slated  to receive from a company sponsored by the US government for the  enriched uranium in its nuclear warheads, Mr Kravchuk is also  counting on massive western assistance for the economic reforms  he believes are crucial.    "We have no alternative but the market," he says with the  zeal of a convert. "Without economic reforms Ukraine as a state  will not survive."    Heart-warming words, but when asked to name a target monthly  inflation rate for December 1994, Mr Kravchuk says he would be  happy with 50 per cent. While this would be an improvement over  December's figure, it is hardly likely to be what the  International Monetary Fund team, due to arrive in Kiev on  Sunday, has in mind.    Just as he hopes to find a narrow middle road in his  relations with Russia, Mr Kravchuk is searching for a path  towards economic therapy without the shock. He says the  Ukrainian National Bank cannot stop printing money because "that  would stop the entire economy", yet he wants to stabilise the  currency, the Ukrainian coupon, and speaks of introducing a  harder national currency this year.    To bridge the gap between the market reforms that he would  like to get under way and the social stability he is intent on  maintaining, he is counting on hefty aid from the west. "We  will need a stabilising fund of between $3bn and $4bn to  introduce our new currency," he says.    Mr Roman Shpek, the young, urbane minister of the economy  charged with conducting negotiations with the IMF, said Ukraine  would like a "bridge loan" of $300m from the US, a $700m  "systemic transformation loan" from the IMF, and $400m for  sectoral reform from the World Bank.    In future conversations with the German chancellor, and when  he visits Washington, Mr Kravchuk will perhaps try to explain  that a few billion dollars are a small price to pay if the  alternative is war between Ukraine and Russia. But if he fails  to persuade the west to give him money, as Russia's experience  suggests he might, it is hard to imagine what sort of gambit Mr  Kravchuk could devise next to preserve his country's  independence.</p>

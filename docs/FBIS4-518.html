			<p>BFN     [Text] People are still leaving the country in greater  numbers than they are entering it. Figures released by the  Central Statistical Services in Pretoria show that more than  1,200 people had emigrated from South Africa in January,  compared with 433 in January last year. The number of people  immigrating to South Africa dropped from 784 in January last  year to 484 in the same month this year. Most of the people  leaving South Africa tended to head for England, New Zealand, or  Australia.</p>

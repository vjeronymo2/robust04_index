			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Government may face legal action over 1989 dockworkers' strike THE BRITISH government may face legal action in the European Court of Human Rights by unions over the behaviour of employers in the 1989 dockworkers' strike. An independent study published by the TGWU general union found that, of 63 port employers, just 15 fully respected the human rights of striking dockworkers. The study calls on the TGWU to ask the Trades Union Congress to take the case against the government, concerning Associated British Ports (ABP), to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). It argues that ABP breached the rules on collective redundancies. Rulings by the ECHR are binding on British courts.</p>

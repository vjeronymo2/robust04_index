			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: John Laing recovers to Pounds 11.6m DESPITE A Pounds 21.4m provision and poor trading conditions in the UK housing and construction markets, John Laing bounced back into the black last year. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.6m compared with a Pounds 65.3m loss in 1991 when write-downs were even higher at Pounds 87.8m Operating profits rose 41 per cent to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 21.4m) despite a fall in sales to Pounds 1.27bn (Pounds 1.59bn). A maintained final dividend of 6p makes a same-again total for the year of 9p, just covered by earnings of 9.44p (losses of 57.4p). The shares dipped 3p to 235p on concern that the good results from the UK contracting division were unlikely to be repeated in the current year. Construction profits rose from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 25.1m despite a 24 per cent fall in divisional turnover to Pounds 1.08bn (Pounds 1.42bn). Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said the group had benefited from payments for higher margin contracts won before the UK construction market became more difficult. These included payments for work on the new Sizewell power station in Suffolk. Overseas construction profits, mostly from the Middle East and south-east Asia, rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 5m on increased turnover of Pounds 40m (Pounds 30m). Housing operations also returned to profit, with Pounds 4.8m after a Pounds 2.8m loss in 1991. The improvement was due to an increase in the number of homes sold, from 1,670 units to 2,175 units in the UK, and better margins following previous land write-downs and as more expensive land bought in the late 1980s has been used up. Mr Laing said the company had seen a 35 per cent rise in net reservations in the first three months of this year compared with the corresponding period last year. Margins and selling prices, however, remained weak. COMMENT Contracting profits are likely to more than halve this year as the UK construction cycle moves against this group and as order books have fallen. Laing, however, should benefit from rationalisation following a 25 per cent reduction in staff in the construction division. Margins on contracts remain better than most UK builders and civil engineers can boast. Housing profits should be at least as good as in 1992 and could be better if the market continues to improve and prices start to harden. Profits of Pounds 17m would put the company on a prospective p/e of more than 16. On this evidence it remains one of the best contractors around but in a weak construction market.</p>

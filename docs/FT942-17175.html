			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise at Danish telecoms group GN Great Nordic, the Danish telecommunications group, increased net profits last year to DKr148.2bn (Dollars 22.1bn) from DKr31.4m in 1992. Turnover was ahead to DKr1.62bn from DKr1.33bn and profits before items and tax rose to DKr161.1m from DKr112.7m. The group announced a one-for-six share issue and plans to raise about DKr300m through a convertible bond issue. An unchanged 12 per cent dividend will be paid. The improvement in sales and earnings last year was attributed to systems coming into operation and an improvement in primary operating profits in the group's manufacturing companies to DKr111m from DKr37m in 1992. New telecommunications systems include the Copenhagen-St Petersburg optical fibre cable link, with links to Moscow, which was opened in April last year. Denmark's second cellular phone system, Sonofon, which competes with Tele Danmark's Nordic Mobile Phone system, has exceeded expectations and established a satisfactory level of operations, GN said. The group expects operating profits in 1994 to remain at the 1993 level, although profits before financial items will grow. New systems coming into operation this year include a north-south optical link through Poland and a system in Lithuania.</p>

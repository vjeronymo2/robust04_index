			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Cholera outbreak reaches Brazil BRAZIL'S first case of cholera since the outbreak of the epidemic in neighbouring Peru has been confirmed, Christina Lamb writes from Braslia. Speaking on breakfast television yesterday, Mr Luis Romero Farias, the interim health minister, said that one case had been confirmed and eight possible cases registered in the Amazon region near the borders with Peru and Colombia. The government has launched an emergency programme in the area costing Cr1.5bn (Pounds 3.3m) but Mr Farias admitted: 'The spread of the disease is impossible to stop.' Officials fear that the cholera bacteria will be quickly carried by the many rivers which traverse Brazil. According to Ministry of Health projections, Brazil could see 3m cases this year - around 2 per cent of the population. The worst-affected areas would probably be Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro, with its high population density.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> SUSPECT FREED IN ERROR SEIZED  </P> <P> A kidnap and robbery suspect mistakenly freed from the San Bernardino Central  Detention Center has been captured in Golden Beach, Md. Dorinda Carol White,  21, of Leonard Town, Md., was arrested by state troopers and is awaiting  extradition to Las Vegas in the kidnaping of a flower shop employee, San  Bernardino County sheriff's deputies said. A "computer glitch" led to White's  release from the San Bernardino jail, officers said. A car carrying White and  her companion, James Manning McRay, 21, was stopped routinely in Barstow on  Dec. 23 by California Highway Patrol officers. Arrests were made after another  woman in the car screamed that she had been kidnaped, the CHP said. Because of  a computer error, White and McRay were transferred from Barstow to San  Bernardino without booking papers indicating that they were wanted in Las  Vegas, deputies said. White was freed Saturday. McRay's paper work, however,  showed that he was wanted in Maryland and he remained jailed.  </P></p>

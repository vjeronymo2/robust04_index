			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARGENTINA  </P> <P> With reference to your editorial "Major Mistake in Argentina" (Oct. 14),  readers should bear in mind that the situation of some members of the Argentine  armed forces is a consequence of the turmoil in which the society has lived in  the last decades. The institutional end to that turmoil came in 1983 when a  democratic government was definitely re-established. The political stability  has been confirmed by the free presidential elections of 1989, the first  constitutional change of authorities in 62 years.  </P> <P> President Carlos Saul Menem, in strict application of his constitutional  capacities and following a widespread practice in our history, has issued a  pardon to condemned and indicted officers and civilians. This act can in no way  be considered a limitation to the competence of Argentine federal courts or, as  it was suggested in your editorial, an invitation to "the military to assert  its influence again." On the contrary, it is a reinforcement of the  constitutional powers, as confirmed by the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> JUAN VICENTE SOLA  </P> <P> Consul General of Argentina  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARBARA STANWYCK DIES; CAREER SPANNED 60 YEARS  </P> <P> Barbara Stanwyck, whose talent, blue eyes and pulsating voice made her a  dominant presence during 60 years of stage, screen and television appearances,  died Saturday of heart failure. She was 82.  </P> <P> Miss Stanwyck, whose career spanned the chorus line, vaudeville, movies,  television and won her three Emmys and an honorary Oscar, had been admitted to  St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica about a week ago.  </P> <P> "She died shortly before 5 p.m.," said Larry Kleno, Miss Stanwyck's longtime  press agent. "It was congestive heart failure."  </P> <P> Celebrities attending Saturday night's Golden Globe awards were quick to praise  Miss Stanwyck.  </P> <P> "It's the passing of a great lady of the screen," actress Angela Lansbury said.  "I was very sorry to hear it."  </P> <P> As a performer in 88 films, Miss Stanwyck emerged as one of the screen's strong  independent women. Like Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and other  major stars from Hollywood's so-called Golden Years, she had her own distinct  style. The Barbara Stanwyck persona on films was often the femme fatale or the  "good bad girl," able to project simultaneously toughness and warmth, cynicism  and sensitivity.  </P> <P> She was nominated four times for an Academy Award -- for roles in "Stella  Dallas," "Double Indemnity," "Ball of Fire" and "Sorry, Wrong Number," and  received an honorary Oscar in 1982 for her acting achievements.  </P> <P> Born Ruby Stevens on July 16, 1907, in Brooklyn, Barbara Stanwyck was an orphan  who said she never knew her parents. The task of raising her fell to an  unmarried sister, a chorus girl who boarded her with a series of families while  she traveled with roadhouse musicals.  </P> <P> From early childhood, Miss Stanwyck wanted to become a dancer. She quit school  at 13 to wrap packages in a Brooklyn store and taught herself to dance. Just  after her 15th birthday, she got her first performing job -- hanging from the  ceiling as part of a living chandelier in a Ziegfeld Follies number.  </P> <P> A year later, in 1923, she became a chorus girl in a New York musical review.  After dancing in lots of chorus lines in lots of shows, she tried out for a  part in a production put together by Willard Mack, a top producer and director  of the day. This was to transform her from dancer to actress, the kind of break  all would-be stars usually can only dream about.  </P> <P> Mack had a part for a chorus girl in his new play, "The Noose," but the job was  only available in the play's out-of-town tryout in Philadelphia. For its  Broadway run, the part had already been cast.  </P> <P> After this, "destiny stepped in," Miss Stanwyck later said. The play was about  a man condemned to death who loved a society woman and cared nothing for the  little chorus girl who loved him. But the original third act, where the society  woman pleaded with the warden for the body of the condemned man so she could  bury him, didn't go over with the out-of-town audience. "So the play was  rewritten to give the scene to the chorus girl," Miss Stanwyck recalled. "That  meant I had to carry the third act."  </P> <P> Mack started rehearsing with her day and night. "He saw something in me," Miss  Stanwyck said in an interview years later. "I was a dancer, not a great one,  but I knew left from right. But I was no actress. . . . He taught me how to  walk, taught me nuances, taught me tricks."  </P> <P> Mack also changed her name. Declaring Ruby Stevens was no name for a star, he  scanned names on several playbills hanging nearby and came up with Barbara  Stanwyck.  </P> <P> When the play returned from Philadelphia in 1925, Miss Stanwyck not only  replaced the girl who was to have the part in New York, but the now  long-forgotten play proved a hit and ran on Broadway for nearly a year.  </P> <P> On the strength of that and other theatrical successes, she made her screen  debut in a silent film, "Broadway Nights," shot in New York in 1927, and went  back to Broadway in 1928. The same year, she married vaudevillian Frank Fay,  and then followed him to Hollywood where he had signed a screen contract. There  they adopted a son, Anthony Dion Fay.  </P> <P> While Mack established her on stage, it was director Frank Capra who provided  her shot to movie stardom. This happened after her first two Hollywood films,  "The Locked Door" and "Mexicali Rose," both in 1929, bombed, and her movie  career seemed headed for disaster.  </P> <P> But Capra signed her for "Ladies of Leisure," reportedly without a screen test.  She played an artist's model of easy virtue who unintentionally falls in love  with a wealthy young artist.  </P> <P> Capra, she later said, taught her about using her eyes. "These are the greatest  tools in film," she said in an interview, pointing at them: "It's nice to say  very good dialogue, if you can get it. But great movie acting . . . watch the  eyes."  </P> <P> She gave herself credit for her throaty voice: "I had it from the beginning,  God save me!" Film historian James Harvey once described it as suggestive of  "not whiskey or disillusionment or sexual provocation as much as . . . the  quite unsentimental sound of tears."  </P> <P> Her walk, which was distinctive for its authoritative, unhesitant stride, she  credited to producer David Belasco and a certain animal at the zoo. Belasco,  she said, once remarked that women do not know how to walk, and advised if she  wanted to learn she should "go to the zoo. Watch animals walk." She took his  advice, and said she copied the panther's stride.  </P> <P> "Ladies of Leisure" was followed by four other Capra-directed films, and she  became a favorite of such major directors as Howard Hawks, Billy Wilder, King  Vidor and John Ford. Cecil B. DeMille wrote in his autobiography: "I have never  worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a  better workman."  </P> <P> Throughout her career, she was known as a disciplined, hard-working actress who  came to the set with every detail of her characterization in place. Wilder once  claimed Miss Stanwyck not only knew every line of her own dialogue but all the  other actors' dialogue too.  </P> <P> By the late 1930s she was solidly entrenched as one of Hollywood's leading  ladies, and became identified with roles portraying the tough, independent,  hard-as-nails dame. One of these, the 1937 "Stella Dallas," won her her first  nomination for an Academy Award, playing an uneducated but ambitious woman who  gives up contact with the one person she loves -- her daughter -- so that the  young woman could have social position and a "good" life.  </P> <P> In the early 1940s she reached a career peak with films such as "The Lady Eve,"  "Meet John Doe" and "Double Indemnity." The latter, a 1944 film co-starring  Fred MacMurray, brought her particular acclaim as a woman scheming to kill her  husband.  </P> <P> Also in 1944, Miss Stanwyck's name headed an Internal Revenue Service list of  the highest-salaried women in the United States.  </P> <P> According to film biographers, her career faltered in the 1950s. Although she  acted in more than 20 films during that decade -- several of them Westerns --  critics considered many of them second-rate. But her career rebounded on  television in the 1960s, when she played the stern matriarch of the Barkley  clan in the series "The Big Valley" from 1965 to 1969. She also starred in the  1983 miniseries "The Thorn Birds" and appeared for one season (1985-86) as  Constance Colby in "The Colbys," the prime-time melodrama.  </P> <P> She married twice. She divorced Fay in 1935 and married actor Robert Taylor in  1939. She starred with Taylor in "His Brother's Wife" and "This Is My Affair,"  in 1936 and 1937, and in "Night Walker" in 1965.  </P> <P> One of Hollywood's best-known couples, she and Taylor divorced in 1952. An  intensely private person, Miss Stanwyck rarely discussed this publicly. But in  one interview, after talking about the difficulty of sustaining two careers in  one marriage, she suddenly said: "Bob was bored. It took me a long time to  accept that. To understand it. He said he wanted to be a married bachelor. . .  . The pain followed. But it comes with the territory."  </P> <P> When she was honored with the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award  in 1987, a reporter asked if she was satisfied with what she had accomplished.  </P> <P> "It's not . . . satisfaction exactly," she answered. "Let's say I did what I  was supposed to do. I did my work."  </P></p>

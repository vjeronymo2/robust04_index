			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Oji Paper Oji Paper, one of Japan's two biggest paper makers, is divesting production of certain quality coated papers to meet monopolies requirements ahead of its planned merger in October with Kanzaki Paper, which ranks seventh in the industry, writes Gordon Cramb in Tokyo. Oji said it was transferring production facilities and marketing rights for two types of specialist paper, used for magazine and book covers, to Chuetsu Pulp and Paper, in which Oji is the biggest shareholder with 7.6 per cent. A final sale to Chuetsu, the 12th biggest paper maker, would take place after three or four years. The shuffling of assets forms part of a consolidation in the industry brought on by overcapacity, which has triggered a spate of mergers. In April, Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp united to become Nippon Paper Industries, with which the Oji-Kanzaki combine will vie for top slot.</p>

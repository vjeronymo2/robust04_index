			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> BANK HOLDUP CALLED SIMILAR TO 3 OTHERS  </P> <P> A man suspected of robbing three Ventura County banks by writing his demand  notes on Manila envelopes robbed a fourth bank in Oxnard Thursday morning using  a similar technique, authorities said.  </P> <P> The man robbed the Bank of A. Levy, 1830 Victoria Ave., about 11:30 a.m. and  fled on foot with an unknown amount of money, said Lt. Stan Myers of the Oxnard  Police Department.  </P> <P> It is the fourth robbery by the same suspect in Ventura and Oxnard in three  weeks, and each time the robber produced a note demanding money and warning  that he had a gun, said Gary Auer, agent in charge of the FBI's Ventura office.  </P> <P> The first three notes were scrawled on Manila envelopes although Auer would not  confirm that Thursday's robber used the same kind of paper. He said only that  the man produced a written note and that the robber's technique was similar.  </P> <P> Tellers have not observed a weapon in any of the four robberies, Auer said.  </P> <P> The bank robber is described as a white male, about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and  weighing about 160 pounds. He is believed to be between 25 and 30 and has short  blond hair, Auer said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Heloisa Magalhaes from Buenos Aires] </F>   [Text] The Chinese telephone network grew by 51 percent in  1993 with the installation of 5.83 million phones, a little less  than the total number of lines Brazil had in 1992. This is the  largest, most booming market in the world in this field. In  face of this market force, the Chinese Communications Ministry  has sent a strong message regarding deregulation policy to the  representatives of the International Telecommunications Union  which is sponsoring its first meeting aimed at developing  countries.    Zhu Gaofeng, Chinese vice minister of Posts and  Telecommunications, will visit Brasilia on 4 April. He said:  "It is not possible to follow only one development model in the  field of telecommunications; there is not one model that can be  adapted for all countries. Developing countries have become the  greatest market in this field, which is why international  financial institutions cannot establish short-term conditions.  Partnerships with countries that need a lot of investment must  follow a model of equal and mutual benefit."    He is negotiating with the Brazilian Government the first  stage toward a possible "joint venture" [preceding two words in  English] in the field of telecommunications and postal services.  Based on a scientific and technological cooperation agreement  signed between the two governments in Beijing in 1993, the  partnership foresees the integration of private companies like  Promon Telecommunications, Darum, and Ericsson.    These cooperation agreements will benefit:    The postal system: through development of a new postal  policy, organization of the postal network, administration of  services, marketing, courier, payment orders, and manufacture of  new equipment.    The telecommunications system: through a new policy for  voice  and data transmission services, rural communication using  satellites, point-to-point and mobile systems; through fiber  optics; through administration and planning of telephone  networks and value-added services.    The agreement also contemplates the joint development of  telecommunications equipment.</p>

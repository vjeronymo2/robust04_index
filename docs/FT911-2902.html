			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Humble grandmother who healed the wounds of a warring nation: Mrs Chamorro has surprised the sceptics in her first year as president of Nicaragua A YEAR ago this week Mrs Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, a humble conservative grandmother with little political experience and believing in traditional values of home, family and God, donned Nicaragua's presidential sash. In a country accustomed to disasters, both natural and man-made, one more seemed in the making. She had always shunned politics. Her previous taste of power, as a member of the post-revolutionary junta in 1979, had brought her to the edge of a nervous collapse - she resigned within a year, citing ill-health. Pushed into the political front-line on the strength of her husband's past - the editor of La Prensa, he was assassinated by the dictatorial Samosa regime - she was called upon to lead a fractious opposition to the polls in 1990. Defying most predictions, she beat the left-wing Sandinista party (FSLN). Mrs Chamorro inherited a nation bitterly divided by 10 years of civil war, which had divided even her own family. Few believed her capable of healing the wounds left by the 50,000 dead or of untangling the legal chaos created by the thousands of property expropriations during the 11 years of Sandinista government. None the less, even her most outspoken opponents readily admit that the big success of her first year has been to end the war. Some 20,000 Contra rebels laid down their arms, while 75,000 government soldiers have been demobilised. The secret of her success has been to surround herself with close advisers and friends, many of them drawn from her immediate family, whose pragmatic approach has eschewed party politics. None of her senior ministers is a member of any political party. The head of her cabinet, Mr Antonio Lacayo, is her son-in-law. A mild-mannered businessman, of Jesuit education, Mr Lacayo has been the engineer of the peace. For the past year, he has patiently sat through thousands of hours of meetings with table-banging trade unionists, pistol-toting Contra rebels, disgruntled businessmen, spur-shod cattle-ranchers and rough peasant farmers, all demanding more than he was able to give. It is largely due to his negotiating tenacity that all have so far settled for less. A recent opinion poll showed Mr Lacayo to be the most popular politician in the country, ahead even of the president. Not all have been so lavish in their compliments however. Mr Virgilio Godoy, the vice-president, is considered the chief spokesman for the right-wing sector of the UNO alliance, which bitterly criticises the government's pragmatism and President Chamorro's dependence upon Mr Lacayo. 'It is (Lacayo) who chooses the ministers, and is giving the orders. He is running the country. She is just there to legitimise what her son-in-law is doing,' he said. Mr Lacayo recently accused Mr Godoy of wanting to oust Mrs Chamorro from the presidency. Mr Godoy denies this, saying he only wants to oust Mr Lacayo, to re-establish control by the 12-party UNO alliance over the government. 'Lacayo has no political party. He shows a profound distaste towards the parties and their leaders. He runs the government like a business rather than a presidency,' he said. The one party that does exert control, however, according to Mr Godoy and his supporters, is the FSLN. They point to the government's refusal to remove army chief General Humberto Ortega, the brother of former president and Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega. The moderates in UNO around Mr Lacayo, and the moderates of the FSLN, have in effect established a coalition. The FSLN has supported the government's 'social contract' and economic plan; the UNO hardliners have not. In return for FSLN support for economic reform, the government has postponed sweeping military reforms. That compromise has divided the Sandinistas. Hardliners within the party see Mr Lacayo as someone intent on eventually breaking the remaining Sandinista power - the army, police, and trade unions. General Ortega is being duped, they claim. After consolidating peace in Nicaragua, Mrs Chamorro now has to revive the economy. And with unemployment and poverty rising that is no mean task.</p>

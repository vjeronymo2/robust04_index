			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ian Rodger report: "Swiss Clean Up Rules on Dirty Money"] </F>   [Text] Switzerland's private bankers have long tended to  have a smug attitude to questions about accepting dirty money.    "We have always been extremely careful about who we will  accept," one Geneva banker said recently. They say that even in  the bad old days, when the famous anonymous numbered accounts  were permitted, they always checked their clients' credentials  thoroughly.    These claims ring rather hollow in the light of the latest  case of dirty money -- a $150 million (102.7 million pounds)  account at Union Bank of Switzerland [UBS] in Zurich held openly  in the name of Mrs Sheila Miriam Arana de Nasser, wife and  partner of a suspected big-league Colombian drug dealer.    Swiss bankers now admit lamely that their screening of  clients was perhaps not quite as rigorous in the 1970s -- when  this particular account was opened -- and before as it is today.  "We were not as sensitive to money laundering then," Mr Stephan  Haeringer, a UBS director, conceded last week.    But bankers were surprised that UBS was the one caught out.  Switzerland's largest bank is renowned for its careful scrutiny  of potential customers. In the late 1980s, for example, UBS  alone among the three large Swiss universal banks managed to  steer clear of Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck, Olympia &amp; York,  Omni  and other big corporate groups that subsequently collapsed. It  was also the first Swiss bank to refer the deposits of foreign  politicians to the executive board.    The problem, Swiss bankers say, is one of Altlasten, a  German  word describing old deposits of toxic waste. All the  well-established banks have accounts like that of Mrs Arana that  were opened years before screening was tightened. And like  concentrations of toxic waste, these accounts can explode at any  time without warning.    The Swiss Federal Banking Commission's 1992 guidelines to  bankers provide no fewer than 30 pointers to help them detect  whether or not money is being laundered. But all of them have  to do with transactions -- withdrawals, purchase of drafts,  transfers or excessive cash movements.    If, as in the Arana case, the account lies virtually dormant  for several years, it is more difficult for the bank's internal  auditors to detect a problem.    The commission acknowledged the difficulty, saying that "it  is not the banks' responsibility to investigate systematically  all customer transactions for a possible connection to criminal  activities."    That said, UBS's local competitors still have trouble  understanding this case. They say that now banks have put  customer accounts on computer files, it is not difficult to  isolate all the Altlasten from, say, Colombia or Sicily for a  special audit. Also, bankers say they now scan the newspapers  for scandals and criminal activities out of fear that some of  those involved are among their clients.    But the prevailing view among Swiss bankers remains rather  fatalistic -- that a banking centre like Switzerland which  specialises in attracting investment funds from rich individuals  will inevitably also attract criminals.    "They have to place their money somewhere and they prefer to  do it in the biggest and most efficient financial centres," a  Swiss Bankers' Association spokesman stressed.    The Swiss doubt that they need further legislation to combat  criminal money. In the past four years they have put in place  what they believe is one of the best prevention and prosecution  systems in the world.    Money laundering has become a criminal offence, which allows  the Swiss police to co-operate fully with their foreign  counterparts.    Bankers are obliged to know the real owners of all their  accounts and are forbidden from accepting criminal money.  Acceptance of such money through negligence is also punishable.    Later this year two additional legal reforms will complete  the package, one permitting bankers to denounce suspected  criminal clients to the police and the other making membership  in a criminal organisation a criminal offence. This will enable  the Swiss authorities to co-operate with Italy in Mafia  investigations.    The one consolation arising from the latest case is that it  showed that the Swiss, who often turned a blind eye to financial  crime in the past, are now willing to move quickly when  suspicions are raised.    Once the facts were known, the authorities froze the bank  account and arrested Mrs Arana at her home near Geneva.    The Banking Commission and the Bankers' Association have  already launched investigations of UBS's conduct, and the bank  has suspended a vice-president responsible for the account.    The Swiss, at least, believe that the message to both banks  and money launderers is clear.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Masters degree aimed at directors launched A masters degree in company direction has been launched by Leeds Metropolitan University and the Institute of Directors. The degree differs from the conventional master of business administration degree in being aimed at people who have already made it to the boardroom rather than those aspiring to get there. Courses - fees for which are Pounds 13,000 - are run in a series of two-day modules to minimise absence from the boardroom. Research sponsored by the institute two years ago showed that 92 per cent of company directors received no training in how to be directors. The IoD backs a part-time diploma course run under regional franchises by several universities - the fees are Pounds 4,000 a head. Leeds will allow diploma holders 24 academic credits towards the 120 needed for the new masters degree, which is being offered nationally at a cost of Pounds 9,000 per student. Some training and enterprise councils have said they will pay up to half the fees for companies registered in the government's Investors in People training programme. Subjects include improving personal effectiveness, information strategy, measuring business performance, managing relationships, decision-taking and directing strategic change. Students for the masters degree will have to carry out a project in their own company. Instead of being assessed by traditional academic methods such as examinations, the degree will be awarded on project results, case studies, presentations and reports. Mr Chris Pierce, head of the university's executive and manager development unit, said: 'Students will have to prove there has been a change in their company as a result of what they have done.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Managua, 24 Jan (DPA) -- Passenger and light cargo  transportation in Managua was reduced today due to the strike  called by the National Transportation Commission [CNT] to demand  a number of social-economic benefits from Violeta Chamorro's  government.    Sit-down strikes by taxi drivers could be seen this morning  (local) in different parts of the capital, while the police  carried out strict surveillance. Part of the population had to  walk long distances to get to work due to the lack of buses.    It is estimated that 60 percent of the urban transportation  system of Managua is supporting the strike. Two hundred twenty  buses of the "Parrales Vallejos" cooperative, the strongest in  Managua are parked at stations and along some streets.    Managua's transportation system moves approximately 500,000  persons daily. The CNT announced that the pressures for  attaining a freeze on the price of oil derivatives will increase  depending on how negotiations with the government, which will  begin in the next few hours, progress.    President Violeta Chamorro said she expected there would be  no violent actions and proposed a meeting with the five groups  that are made up of transportation businessmen. Meanwhile, it  was learned that the government is trying to get Cardinal Miguel  Obando y Bravo to mediate the negotiations.    The CNT proposed a bilateral meeting with the finance,  transportation, and labor ministers, who signed accords last  September and whom the transporters believe are responsible for  the unfulfilled agreements.    Carlos Palma, leader of the strike, said violent outbreaks  will be avoided by keeping the buses at the stations. Regarding  the new strike, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who will travel  today to the Vatican, said he hopes the uprising that left  several dead and hundreds wounded and jailed last year will not  be repeated.    Daniel Ortega, former president and secretary general of the  opposition Sandinist National Liberation Front said the  government has forced transportation businessmen to strike.  Ortega and Obando agree on the need for a negotiated solution  to the social-political conflict.</p>

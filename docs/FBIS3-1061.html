He was  commenting on a report in the latest issue of the WEEKLY MAIL  &amp;  GUARDIAN that Deputy Police Commissioner Lt-Gen Basie Smit was  at the heart of an investigation by the Goldstone Commission  into a major gun-running operation by senior SAP officers.    According to the newspaper, the commission's report could  contain the hardest evidence to date of an organised third force  within the security forces. Gen van der Merwe said in a  statement: "I am aware that Judge Goldstone is conducting an  investigation into allegations that senior members of the SAP  are involved in acts of violence and gun-running. However,  according to my knowledge, these allegations are not in any way  related to drug-trafficking.    "Personally I have no reason whatsoever to believe that any  senior member of the SAP is involved in such illegal activities."    He said although he was aware of certain allegations being  investigated by the Goldstone Commission against Gen Smit, he  was convinced any proper investigation would clear him and that  his honour and professional reputation would "emerge unblemished  from this episode".    "I have already urgently requested the Goldstone Commission  in writing to hold a comprehensive public inquiry into this  matter. It is a matter of the greatest possible importance to  both the SA Police and the future of the judicial system that  this matter be dealt with in such a manner that justice is seen  to be done and that the basic principles of justice are strictly  adhered to," Gen van der Merwe said.</p>

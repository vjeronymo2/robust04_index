			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BP The tide may finally be turning in BP's favour. The company stopped leaking cash in the fourth quarter thanks to lower capital expenditure and the reduced dividend. A modest repayment of bank debt was also possible in the second half, albeit at the expense of shrinking the business through disposals. Even so, Mr David Simon deserves credit for confounding the sceptics by raising Pounds 1bn from asset sales last year. With the nutrition business still up for grabs, this year's debt-reduction target looks in reach. The company can expect little help from the cycle. Although the US economy is reviving, overcapacity in petrochemicals and refining is already causing pain as Europe slides into recession. Having taken the pain of restructuring ahead of its rivals, BP may now hold a competitive edge. The market is inclined to believe this bull case. A yield substantially lower than Shell is difficult to justify on the basis of yesterday's figures alone. BP cannot yet make substantial in-roads into its Dollars 15bn borrowings out of operating cash flow. While US interest rates are low that may not be a top priority. But if Mr Simon stays on track to reach his goal of Dollars 2bn profits by 1995, the dividend will soon be twice covered. If interest rates are then on an upward trend, he may be tempted into a rights issue after all.</p>

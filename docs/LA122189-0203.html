			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: STYLE SETS THE BEAT AT WAYNE SHINDIG  </P> <P> Who needs Dasher and Dancer when you've got dashin' and dancin'?  </P> <P> Pilar Wayne's Christmas bash Saturday night may have been low on holiday decor,  but it was high on holiday style.  </P> <P> Partying gents showed up in everything from avant-garde penguin suits (the  dashing Ethan Wayne wore his satin-trimmed stunner with a black silk shirt) to  snazzy sport ensembles embroidered with silk holly (worn by Supervisor Tom  Riley).  </P> <P> And oh, the women. Aissa Wayne knocked 'em dead in an iridescent sequinned  zebra print. Her mother, Pilar, appeared first in a full-length cloud of purple  chiffon decorated with silver discs, and then in a short number smothered in  bugle beads. Marisa -- Pilar and John Wayne's youngest daughter -- wore a  strapless black velvet body-hugger trimmed with a fluff of black fox.  </P> <P> Talk about dancin'. Pilar had cleared her Newport Beach living room of  everything but her grand piano and brought in a parquet dance floor the size of  most back yards. While a fire roared in a fireplace flanked with gleaming  crystal sconces, guests danced to favorites with rock 'n' roll and Latin beats.  </P> <P> "I didn't know mom could dance like that!" said a wide-eyed Marisa, watching  her glamorous mum execute a cha-cha.  </P> <P> Among guests was Pilar's new puppy, Thor, a Norwegian elkhound (the pup's  toothy playfulness accounted for some scratches -- hidden by tiny bandages --  on his new mistress's forearms). But Pilar's parrot, Gucci, was kept in a cage  in her ruffly master suite. "You never know what Gucci is going to do when  other people are around," Pilar said. "I am his alone. When I went to Paris  last September, I had to call him every day.  </P> <P> "I would say: 'Hi Gucci! How are you?' and he would say: 'How are you?' He is  adorable."  </P> <P> Faces in the crowd: author Joseph Wambaugh and his wife, Dee (Wambaugh's new  book, "The Golden Orange" -- a thriller about a retired Orange County cop --  will be published next spring); Peggy and Bob Goldwater; "Love Boat's" Bernie  Kopell with his wife, Yolanda (daughter of the famous dance team Veloz and  Yolanda); tennis great Tracy Austin; Lois Aldrin (who, with hubby, Buzz,  attended Vice President Dan Quayle's Christmas bash in Washington on Monday  night); Gene and JoAnne Mix (in a slinky black dress and a red, wide-brim hat);  Vikki Vargas and Mike Nason; Kitty and Jerry Kobrin; Marshall Klein (L.A. Rams  owner Georgia Frontiere's right arm, who brought Pilar a terry cloth apron  emblazoned with the words: L.A. Rams Locker Room); Judi and Carmelo Manto;  Regina McGrath; Claudia Mirkin; Kathy Bryant and Link Mathewson.  </P> <P> The time of their lives: Hundreds of Bill Medley fans brought more than the  price of admission to Sunday's Righteous Brothers' concert with Jennifer Warnes  on Sunday at The Hop in Fountain Valley. They brought Christmas toys for Big  Brothers/Big Sisters of Orange County -- stuffed toys, board games, books, hair  dryers and perfume.  </P> <P> Seems Medley and Warnes, who became pals after they teamed up to record "The  Time of My Life" for the movie "Dirty Dancing," have a soft spot for good  causes. A few weeks ago, they sang together to raise funds for victims of the  San Francisco-area quake.  </P> <P> Medley took the spotlight first, thrilling the 300-strong crowd with selections  from his new album, "The Best of Bill Medley" (which included an anthem to  "American Rock and Roll" written by the lanky singer). Then he introduced  Warnes, looking demure in a white silk blouse and dark plaid culottes,  referring to her as "a dear friend," "a cute girl from Mater Dei (the Santa Ana  high school she attended)," and "an artist who sticks to her art."  </P> <P> Calling Orange County "a land of paradox, a place where, if you try hard, you  can find some real people at Pup 'n' Taco," Warnes sang two ballads, one about  a woman longing to find a mate, the other about a cowgirl's longing to attach  meaning to life. You could have heard a pin drop when Warnes finished her soft  and soulful ballads, unfamiliar fare in a nightclub that thrives on a diet of  blaring rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> Then came what the crowd had packed into the nightclub for: Medley and Warnes  teaming up for "Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong" (the mega-hit she recorded  with Joe Cocker) and Medley and Warnes' millions-selling "The Time of My Life."  </P> <P> Afterward, Medley accepted a plaque from his daughter-in-law, Lauren Medley,  who does public relations for Big Brothers/Big Sisters. "We were planning a  Christmas party for our little brothers and sisters, and we needed toys," said  Lauren during the show. "So I called my father-in-law, told him my idea, and he  said, 'Absolutely!' " She's hoping it will become an annual affair.  </P> <P> Watching the show from the sidelines was Jo Alexander, executive director of  the organization that pairs up single-parent children, ages 6 to 16, with  helpmates. "Our volunteers give the children an adult role model," Alexander  said. "A friend they can call their own, sometimes for life."  </P> <P> In the red: "Would you like your eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon or salmon?"  That was the toughest question guests had to answer Sunday at the  take-a-break-from-the-holiday-madness brunch staged by the Rex restaurant in  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The popular $35-per-person benefit for the local chapter of the American Red  Cross also featured traditional servings of bubbly and fresh OJ. (Only the  heavenly straw potatoes -- airy stacks of toothpick-thin spuds -- were missing.  Chunks of fried red potatoes were served instead).  </P> <P> Proceeds of nearly $10,000 were earmarked for the chapter's local  disaster-relief fund, said George Chitty, CEO of the local chapter. So far this  year, the chapter's disaster emergency service volunteers have assisted 148  families. Donations of food, clothing and shelter have been given to victims of  fire, flood and high-wind disasters.  </P> <P> Among the more than 225 guests: hosts Susan and Rex Chandler (restaurant owner  Rex was busy poaching eggs in the kitchen with John Rader); Aissa Wayne with  Roger Luby; Edna and Bill Blurock (faithful brunch supporters); Lon and Mary  Ann Wells with table guests Sandi and Dr. Gerald Brodie; Zee Allred, Nora  Jorgensen, and Anne and Bob Badham; Les and Peggy Cotton; Pat Clevidence; Mary  Lou and Scott Hornsby; Joe Perricone, and Joe Genova.  </P></p>

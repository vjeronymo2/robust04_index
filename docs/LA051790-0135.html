			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON INDUSTRIAL POLICY;  </P> <P> IT'S PRUDENT, NOT IDEOLOGICAL, FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO HALT OUR DECLINE IN  TECHNOLOGY'S GLOBAL MARKETPLACE.  </P> <P> Americans think of themselves as an unideological people, solving problems by  common sense and experience rather than by doctrine. This, though, is not true;  certainly it is not true about the way the United States runs its economy. The  debate over industrial policy -- state support and direction for industrial  research -- shows the country in the grip of ideology, and jeopardizing its  future as a result.  </P> <P> The national ideology was expressed in the Bush Administration's recent  rejection of the Defense Department Advanced Research Projects Agency attempt  to lead research on high-definition television, and it is articulated in the  President's economic report for 1990. That document says that "over the past 40  years the world has learned that excessive government involvement in the  economy leads to unsound decisions . . . slows growth and costs jobs."  </P> <P> That statement confuses state socialism and the command economy with industrial  policy. At the moment when Japan is pulling ahead of the United States in  computer technology (having long since passed it in computer manufacture and  sales), is already ahead in high-definition TV technology and is preparing to  challenge the United States in aerospace -- virtually the only high-technology  area where America still is ahead of Japan -- it is absurd to talk about  industrial policy as something producing job losses and unsound decisions.  </P> <P> The Administration declares that industrial policy doesn't work at the same  time that it contests the government subsidies and direction that produced the  European Airbus program -- which has broken America's monopoly in the  commercial aircraft market. It complains about the European Community's  sponsorship of commercially valuable research in a score of other  high-technologies.  </P> <P> If state-sponsored research and development really produced "unsound  decisions," one would think the United States should be glad to see its  competitors on the wrong course.  </P> <P> In fact, the last 40 years have not shown Japan, France and West Germany making  bad decisions and suffering slow growth and job losses. Quite the contrary. The  last 40 years have shown these countries -- and others following the same  policies -- coming from far behind to become America's most formidable  present-day competitors.  </P> <P> Obviously, public-sponsored research has also produced failures and waste. The  current Japanese attempt to develop a fifth-generation computer has not  succeeded in terms of the assumptions made when the work began. The Japanese  now are redirecting their efforts along new lines of research. The  Franco-British supersonic airliner, the Concorde, was a commercial failure, but  the Airbus is a success, in part because of that earlier failure. Now France  and Britain say they plan a second-generation supersonic transport aircraft,  profiting from what they have learned from Concorde's technological success.  </P> <P> Japan would not pose the commercial challenge it does today if it ran its  affairs the way George Bush would have the United States do. Postwar Western  Europe would never have recovered a leading scientific and technological  position had its governments not sponsored projects with capital requirements  beyond the resources of individual companies, or involving pay-off time-periods  unsustainable by commercial enterprises.  </P> <P> One may object to industrial policy on theoretical grounds. An economist may  argue that the international economy tends towards an efficient division of  labor, assigning to countries what each is best able to do. In theory, it makes  no difference who does what, so long as international efficiency is maximized.  Nations then exchange their products to maximum overall benefit.  </P> <P> The theory is indifferent to national interest. Let's say considerations of  relative efficiency relegate the United States to a role of low-income  raw-materials producer and supplier of the cheap services that can be performed  by a quasi-illiterate work force. That, the theorist would say, is tough for  Americans, but good for international efficiency.  </P> <P> Opponents of industrial policy also argue that American government and business  would conduct such a policy badly, whatever may happen abroad. Yet the evidence  is otherwise. The American era of unquestioned technological supremacy, from  the 1940s to the mid-1970s, was produced by an industrial policy disguised as  defense and space policy.  </P> <P> Beginning with Pearl Harbor, the Pentagon and NASA sponsored research and  development programs that gave the United States world leadership in nuclear  physics, aeronautics, computers, artificial intelligence, metallurgy, lasers,  bio-technology and virtually every other field crucial to today's  advanced-technology industries.  </P> <P> Today, military spending is on a downward curve. Places like Southern  California already feel the pinch. The public demands a peace dividend in lower  taxes or higher social spending. American industry itself is being left to  develop the next generation of technology. It is not going to succeed.  </P> <P> Not only are there inherent obstacles in the way the industrial marketplace  works, but the investment structure of American business today penalizes  long-term research investments. Yet one may ask if national security means mere  security against military attack. Does it not encompass the well-being and  prosperity of citizens?  </P> <P> The evidence is that nations which practice an intelligent industrial policy,  deploying public and private resources to long-range national advantage and  long-term return, are the nations that prosper. The United States was the  world's technology and science leader from the 1940s through the 1970s because  war and cold war forced it to invest in research that commercial criteria would  have rejected as too costly, excessively speculative or without evident  commercial application.  </P> <P> Now the declining technological position of the United States threatens to  produce continuing decline in American living standards and increased economic  and industrial dependance on other countries. Yet one would think that most  Americans still want to lead, innovate and prosper. If so, they had better do  something about the ideologues setting national policy.  </P></p>

Lavrentyev, Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Sciences;  UDC 532.59:551.466.8]    [Abstract] The results of numerical solution by the hybrid  finite elements method (FEM) of the linear stationary problem of  uniform flow around a horizontal cylinder situated beneath the  pycnocline are presented. The FEM can be used for bodies of a  complex configuration or system of bodies, but also is  applicable to the case of a stratified fluid in which density  change occurs only at horizons situated above a submerged body.  In all the cases considered here the submerged body is  positioned completely in the lower layer with an infinite depth.  Two- and three-layer stratification models corresponding to  sharp and smooth pycnoclines are examined. The flow direction is  perpendicular to the cylinder axis. A sharply expressed  pycnocline is simulated by a two- layer fluid; a smooth  pycnocline is simulated by a three-layer fluid with a linearly  stratified middle layer and homogeneous upper and lower layers.  It is demonstrated in the example of an elliptical cylinder that  stratification exerts a substantial influence on all the  hydrodynamic characteristics (wave resistance, lift and  momentum) in definite velocity ranges. A comparison with an  approximate analytic solution suitable for a deeply submerged  body is given. Figures 6; references 14: 9 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

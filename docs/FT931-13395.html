			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Sterling hit by gloom on recovery STERLING came under renewed pressure against the D-Mark yesterday, falling another 1 1/2 pfennigs, amid increasing gloom about the prospects for an economic recovery in the UK. The pound fell to a low of DM2.437 in London, as currency dealers speculated that the government might cut base rates in the near future, following the release of poorer-than-expected economic data on Thursday. The Bank of England left interest rates unchanged, but the pound still closed at DM2.44, 1 1/4 pfennigs down on the day and more than 6 pfennigs below its closing level last Friday. In New York it fell back again, trading at DM2.435 at the close. Against a generally weak dollar, sterling firmed in London to Dollars 1.5345, up more than 1 1/2 cents, although it eased to Dollars 1.5312 in New York. On the London stock market, hopes of an early interest rate cut had helped lift share prices to within 6 points of 2,800 on the FT-SE 100 index. It closed at 2,781.2, up 7.9 on the day, for a gain of 16.1 on the week. Sterling has on several occasions in the past three months, dropped to the levels seen yesterday, only to rally to around DM2.50, but there were signs yesterday that the currency was under more serious pressure. One of the leading banks in the London foreign exchange market said it had received no requests to buy sterling from its UK corporate customers on Thursday and that there had been barely any improvement in the situation.

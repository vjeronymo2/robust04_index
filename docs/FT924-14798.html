			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Ministers unite to back Maastricht MR NORMAN LAMONT and Mr Michael Heseltine joined forces yesterday in vigorous defences of the Maastricht agreement, as ministers on all sides of the argument proclaimed the treaty's virtues in conference proceedings again dominated by Europe. The chancellor of the exchequer and the trade and industry secretary insisted the treaty was a victory for Britain and a turning-point in pushing back the tide of European centralisation and the danger of federalism. Reminding his audience of the concessions made by other EC countries during the negotiations, Mr Lamont emphasised that the treaty not only included 'subsidiarity' or minimum interference in the work of national governments by the European Commission, but also spelt out the areas which should be dealt with through co-operation between governments, such as home and foreign affairs. In a wide-ranging speech to the Conservative Political Centre on the future of Europe, the chancellor said the EC should be a 'community of nations' not a 'superstate'. While there was widespread support for defending Britain's independence in Europe, he saw no similar legitimacy for a European government. 'At present I do not believe that there is a European identity of anything like the quality and strength of the several national identities that exist within the Community,' he said, though he warned that perpetual vigilance was needed against the Community's tendency to centralise. He admitted that, with the extension of qualified majority voting to single-market issues under the single European act, some British sovereignty had been ceded, but said that those restrictions were 'as nothing' set against the benefits of the single market. Nonetheless, there had to be a clear limit on what was suitable for Community action. 'The main decisions concerning economic and fiscal policy  -in particular taxation and government spending - must remain the responsibilities of member states,' he said. While dutifully adhering to the agreed cabinet position, he attacked 'petty-minded orders' that made the Commission a laughing stock. 'Those things for which we want Europe to work together - such as free trade, fair competition and prosperity - can be achieved by nation states within a community . . and do not require the creation of a superstate,' he said. It was 'totally inconsistent' for the Commission to call for more funding from member states 'while at the same time preaching about the need to reduce budget deficits.' Earlier, in the main conference hall, Mr Heseltine faced down some rowdy Euro-sceptic interventions in a performance that won him a standing ovation during his speech as well as at its end. He insisted that Mr John Major had gone to Maastricht 'to fight for our essential interests'. 'And lost]' came a shout from the floor. Mr Heseltine argued passionately that 'national self-interest' was the only convincing reason for membership of the EC, and warned that if Britain were left on the periphery of Europe, the future of the City of London and the stream of inward investment from Japan and America would be at risk. Mr Peter Lilley, a cabinet Euro-sceptic, said: 'We British have governed ourselves for 1,000 years. Our laws, institutions and sovereign parliament are the essence of our nationhood. And nationhood is the precondition of democracy. That nationhood will not be extinguished. We won't let federalism erode it away. We won't let Brussels take it away.'</p>

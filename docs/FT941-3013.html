			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Japan consumers spend less Japan's difficulties in reviving flagging consumer demand were underlined yesterday by the first annual decline in household spending for 12 years. Japanese households spent on average 0.6 per cent less in real terms last year than in 1992, but set aside their spare cash for repaying debts rather than saving, the government's management and co-ordination agency said. They spent less on food and clothes, reflecting the austerity imposed by the recession as well as a switch away from the conspicuous consumption of the late 1980s. By contrast, spending on cars, medicine and utility bills rose. Two signs that Japan might be near the trough of its downturn emerged yesterday with a slowdown in the pace of corporate profits decline and a slight recovery in money supply. Average pre-tax profits fell 6.2 per cent in the final three months of last year, compared with the same period of 1992, the Finance Ministry announced. That makes a record 14 quarters of decline, but the decline was far less bad than the 21.6 per cent fall in the previous quarter, from July to September. The pace of decline in turnover has also slowed, to 1.4 per cent. Japan's money supply yesterday reversed a four-month slide, indicating that the government's economic stimulus packages might be starting to have some effect. The broad measure of M2 and certificates of deposit, watched by the Bank of Japan in setting monetary policy, rose 1.6 per cent last month, from February 1993, continuing a revised 1.6 per cent rise in January. Money supply had fallen steadily from September to the end of last year. One worrying sign was a record 16.8 per cent decline in capital investment in the final quarter, a reflection of Japan's high real long-term interest rates and companies' general reluctance to add capacity. The recent rise in long-term bond yields yesterday led to a rise in an important government lending rate, likely to feed through to a rise in state-backed mortgage payments and government loan costs for small businesses. The Finance Ministry increased by 0.65 percentage points to 4.3 per cent its so-called 'zaito' rate for lending post-office savings to other government institutions, the first rise since last June.</p>

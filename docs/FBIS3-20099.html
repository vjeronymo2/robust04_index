As a result of the undiplomatic remarks made by the  French ambassador to Bonn, this time it was different: One  expected a clarifying word on the alleged or real clouding of  bilateral relations. In the statements immediately after the  incident mutual relations were hastily hailed; however, such  solemn declarations have become hackneyed over the decades.    Thus it was good that Kinkel was able to come up with  something practical in Paris: the idea of presenting a kind of  joint government program for the period that the two countries  hold the presidency of the European Union [EU] -- Germany in the  second half of 1994, France in the first half of 1995. This is  a lofty word for the cumbersome task of mediating, which one has  to fulfill as EU president. Moreover, it is domestic policy  that will play the main role in the two countries during this  time: in Germany because of the Bundestag elections in October,  in France because of the presidential elections in spring 1995.  It is, therefore, uncertain whether good resolutions can  translate into noteworthy action. Still, it is some progress  that an attempt will be made to break out of the shortness of  breath of the six-month rhythm in the EU.    In Paris, Kinkel spoke of a "joint vision for the future of  the Union." This is exactly what is lacking. In Germany the  idea is fading that Europe could be unified on the basis of  federal states; with the formulation "enlargement and  simultaneous deepening," Bonn is asking for something like the  squaring of a circle. In France, large parts of the political  class are convinced that German unification has altered the  foundation of the policy of integration -- which is why  Ambassador Scheer only expressed a truism. Views in Paris,  however, differ as to what conclusions should be drawn from it.  Franco-German talks have for a long time been dominated either  by day-to-day political business, or they have degenerated to  noncommittal phrases. It is high time Bonn and Paris compared  what each side means when they speak of "Europe." The councils  and bodies where this can be discussed have existed for a long  time. All that is needed is to use them.</p>

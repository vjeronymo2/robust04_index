			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (D) In States that have established State standards or licensing requirements for secure juvenile detention facilities, the juvenile facility meets the standards (on the same basis as free-standing juvenile detention facilities) and is licensed as appropriate. Responsible State authorities must certify that all State standards or licensing requirements for a secure juvenile detention facility have been met, and that the architectural and operational configuration of the juvenile facility assures total separation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The State must initially determine that the four requirements are fully met. Upon such determination, the State must submit to OJJDP a request to concur with the State finding that a separate juvenile facility exists. To enable OJJDP to assess the separateness of the two facilities, sufficient documentation must accompany the request to demonstrate that each requirement is met. In assessing the separateness of the two facilities pursuant to a State's request for OJJDP concurrence, OJJDP will be guided by the ``rule of reason.'' If a facility is, in fact, a separate and distinct living environment for juveniles in secure custody, and not simply a juvenile wing, section, or area of an adult jail or lockup, a reasoned and reasonable application of the criteria will result in OJJDP's concurrence that a separate juvenile detention facility exists. It is incumbent upon each State to make the initial determination through an on-site facility (or full plan) review and, through the exercise of its oversight responsibility, to insure that the separate character of the facility is maintained by continuing to fully meet each of the four criteria in the operation of the juvenile detention facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14.

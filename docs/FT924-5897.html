			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: CSR ahead 14% for the half CSR, the Australian sugar, aluminium and building products group, yesterday reported net profit for the six months to the end of September of ADollars 125.4m (USDollars 85.6m), an increase of 14 per cent on the previous comparable period. The group also forecast a full-year net profit of ADollars 200m before abnormal items, compared with ADollars 175m in 1991-92. Revenue increased by 7 per cent to ADollars 2.4bn. Mr Ian Burgess, managing director, said it was 'pleasing' to report an improvement in CSR's performance after two difficult years. He said there were four main reasons for the improved result: A return to profitability by CSR's timber products businesses after two years of losses; Record raw sugar production by the group's mills; Productivity improvements and cost savings of about ADollars 20m before tax; and A cut in net interest costs from ADollars 55m to ADollars 50m. The gains were offset by lower profit margins for refined sugar in Australia and New Zealand, and lower prices for many of the group's building and construction materials. Mr Burgess said the group remained financially strong in spite of the 'difficult trading environment' caused by slow economic growth in the group's main markets in Australasia and North America. Mr Burgess said net profit before abnormal items for the full year should exceed last year's level. 'From the perspective of today, a profit above ADollars 200m seems likely.' CSR reported a net loss of ADollars 385m last year after writing down asset values by ADollars 558m following a dispute with the Australian Securities Commission on the accounting treatment of the write-down. The directors maintained the interim dividend at 10 cents a share, fully franked.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson up at Pounds 46m Kleinwort Benson, the UK-based merchant bank, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 42.2m to Pounds 45.8m in the half year to June 30 despite turbulent trading conditions which cut dealing profits by nearly 60 per cent. The drop in dealing profits was more than offset by a 42 per cent rise in net fee and commission income which rose from Pounds 104.2m to Pounds 147.7m. Lord Rockley, chairman, said 'Earnings were very resilient considering conditions in the first half.' He said that the growth in fee and commission income was a reflection of a management reorganisation which emphasised the development of both equity distribution capacity and corporate broking strengths in key industry segments. As a result, KB was winning far more of the mandates for corporate advisory, underwriting and merger and acquisition business than it had been previously. Mr Simon Robertson, deputy chairman, said: 'We are very pleased with the high proportion of the mandates we are winning against the competition and this was not the case one or two years ago.' He estimated that KB had won about 80 per cent of the mandates it had presented for this year although he warned that many of those had not yet materialised and that several might never appear. In the investment management division, profits rose from Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 19.6m, reflecting growth in private banking and in specialist Treasury fund management. Also, a new US-based fixed-income team hired in the middle of last year has built up assets under management there of Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.32bn) from a negligible amount a year ago. Total assets under management have grown to Pounds 19bn, with net new cash including a Pounds 500m European Privatisation Investment Trust and Pounds 1.5bn in new institutional funds from North American clients. European profits, which were undermined by the sharp drop in dealing income, fell from Pounds 376.7m to Pounds 296m. North American profits, however, nearly doubled, reflecting the growth in fee and commission income to Pounds 37.2m (Pounds 14.2m). Lord Rockley said that while all businesses contributed to the rise in North America, profits were particularly aided by the increasing appetite of US pension funds for foreign equities and bonds. Most of KB's US business is aimed at the distribution of the securities of non-US clients. The interim dividend is 6.75p (6p), payable from earnings per share of 24.9p (24.1p). See Lex</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Monsanto tumbles 46% after restructuring charge MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, yesterday disclosed a 46 per cent slide to Dollars 296m in net profits for 1991. The company, which raised fourth-quarter net profit to Dollars 66m from Dollars 31m, year-on-year, attributed much of the poor showing to its decision to take Dollars 325m of restructuring charges. Monsanto's 1991 sales were Dollars 8.9bn, down from Dollars 9bn in 1990. Fourth-quarter sales declined from Dollars 2.2bn to Dollars 2.1bn. The company said its agricultural division suffered a Dollars 29m operating loss in the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonally low herbicide sales. The chemicals unit more than doubled fourth-quarter operating income, thanks to lower raw materials costs and other savings, but suffered a Dollars 154m operating loss for the year, compared with a Dollars 297m profit in 1990. The Fisher controls unit reported lower earnings for both the quarter and the year, while the Nutrasweet artificial sweeteners business benefited from higher sales and lower manufacturing costs in the quarter. For all of 1991, Nutrasweet's operating income was down, however, at Dollars 173m, against Dollars 183m in 1990. Monsanto's expensive biotechnology research project cost Dollars 57m in 1991, up from Dollars 52m in 1990. This division has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years developing innovative products such as a variety of synthetic hormones that induce cows to produce more milk and seeds that produce insect-resistant cotton. But US regulators have yet to approve the products, which may not be on the market until the mid-1990s.</p>

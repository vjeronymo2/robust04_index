Korea"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Kim Chong-pil,  "chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]" of South Korea,  told a press conference on February 1 that the deployment of  U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea will actually offer "no  problem" in view of "defence."    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says his remarks are  intolerable treacherous sophism unacceptable to anyone.    The traitor Kim Chong-pil's sophism fully revealed the  bellicose and treacherous nature of the "civilian" regime and  the "DLP" of South Korea, the analyst notes, and stresses:    Kim Chong-pil, a special-class flunkeyist traitor and  warmaniac, is the first target of reforms in South Korea.    His utterances proved again that the Kim Yong-sam regime  seeking dependence on outside forces, division and war, not  national independence, peace and reunification, must be  overthrown.    We have warned more than once that if the Kim Yong-sam group  dare to seek the provocation of a war, the "civilian" following  the aggressive war moves of outside forces, the civilian" regime  would meet its miserable doom.    The South Korean "civilian" warmaniacs must look squarely at  the situation and act with discretion.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRO TEAM TENNIS;  </P> <P> RALEIGH RUINS DUKES' HOME OPENER  </P> <P> Orange County waited seven years for the return of Team Tennis.  </P> <P> It waited some more Thursday night at the Newport Beach Dukes' home opener  against the Raleigh Edge at the John Wayne Tennis Club.  </P> <P> The Dukes and the Edge, two new franchises, were still playing four hours after  they began. Raleigh eventually won, 27-23.  </P> <P> Beth Herr and Shaun Stafford of Raleigh defeated Sophie Amiach and Amy Frazier  of the Dukes, 6-3, in the deciding women's doubles set.  </P> <P> Amiach and Frazier trailed, 4-2, but won the seventh game and appeared to have  control. But Herr and Stafford settled down and won the set.  </P> <P> The teams were tied, 15-15, after three sets, but Tim Wilkison of Raleigh beat  Roger Smith, 6-5 (5-1), for a 21-20 lead heading into the final set.  </P> <P> Only about half of the original crowd of 800 remained as the final set began.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what to expect," Dukes Coach Greg Patton said. "Midway through  the match, I realized every point is so important."  </P> <P> The Dukes lost two tiebreakers and that, coupled with the loss in the women's  doubles, was too much to overcome.  </P> <P> "I really like what I see on our team," Patton said. "I'm real excited. There's  no doubt it's exciting tennis. I didn't realize it would go so long."  </P> <P> Patton, who still hasn't settled on a lineup, also said, "We need to get some  matches under our belts. I've got to learn the best way to use our guys."  </P> <P> Raleigh made its debut with a 26-19 loss to the Los Angeles Strings Wednesday  night.  </P> <P> In the opening mixed doubles set, Marty Davis and Amiach fell to Herr and Tim  Pawsat, 6-4. Herr and Pawsat broke Davis for a 5-4 lead, then went on to win  with Pawsat serving.  </P> <P> That was the biggest lead of the match for either team.  </P> <P> Frazier's 6-3 victory over Stafford, a former University of Florida  All-American, pushed the Dukes into the lead, 10-9. But Pawsat and Tim Wilkison  defeated Davis and Smith, 6-5 (5-2), to tie the score, 15-15, heading into the  final two sets.  </P> <P> The Dukes play Miami Beach at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the John Wayne Tennis Club.  </P></p>

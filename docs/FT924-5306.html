			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Arts: Hansel and Gretel - Opera When it was new in 1987 David Pountney's staging of Hansel and Gretel seemed a rare stroke of operatic inspiration, an unforgettable piece of re-invention which opened up Humperdinck's opera to a new set of resonances. Now, on its second revival at ENO (overseen by David Sulkin) the spell is less potent. There are still many incidental delights, and continued evidence of the thoughtful preparation that informed the production from the start, but the spark of enchantment is missing and the weak points in the concept have become less easy to accept. There was, always, the feeling that Pountney's painstaking post-war reworking was pandering to the fortysomethings' nostalgia for the coin-in-the-slot gas meters and wardrobe-sized refrigerators of their childhood. Instead of universalising this little tale of redemption he had given it a frisson of recognition for his own generation, overladen with the heavy hint of family violence and child abuse. All that, and the stage pictures it created, saw the production through its stickier patches. No one could pretend that the final scene with the Witch/Mother was a polished and convincing piece of theatre: Gretel's fussy wanderings around the house, Hansel's casual escape from his cage and their contrived tumbling of the Witch into the cooker seemed decidedly half-hearted. But such moments were banished by the memory of the pantomime sequence, its parade of familiar figures - postman, policeman, courting couple - dusted in radiant, make-believe white to conjure up a wonderful tableaux, which transformed the everyday image into the escapist dream. That first-act ending remains a bewitching piece of theatre, but on Wednesday the rest of the evening only sporadically caught the same spirit. It was sensitively but all rather placidly conducted by Lionel Friend; one sensed the Wagnerian echoes being pinpointed and gently emphasised rather than left to contribute to the whole unselfconscious effect. The stage action too seemed respectful rather than wholeheartedly engaged; only Ethna Robinson's Hansel, the single survivor from the 1987 cast, went about her business with real zeal and spirit. The remainder of the cast, though, was much more than adequate, merely short of an ounce of vividness. Rose Mannion's Gretel was beautifully sung, just a little too prim for a production that sets out to demonstrate the grinding consequences of deprivation. As the Mother Phyllis Cannan caught that downtrodden feeling well; as the Witch she wisely never went over the top. Donald Maxwell is now the Father, smartly besuited in pointed contrast to his wife's grimy pinafore. Julie Gossage and Yvonne Barclay provide sharp cameos of the Sandman and the Dew Fairy; certainly some of their magic remains in this intriguing production. ENO at the London Coliseum; until December 23</p>

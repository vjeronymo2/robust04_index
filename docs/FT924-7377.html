			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: The Labeque sisters - Concert The duo-pianist sisters Labeque, Katia and Marielle, are irrepressible musicians, and for some time now they have shown signs of frustration with the two-piano repertoire. There is plenty of good music for two pianos alone, but precious little with orchestra - of the first quality, only Mozart's concerto and the Poulenc one which it partly inspired, and then a long drop down to minor stuff. (Bartok's superb Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion has never made much headway in its orchestral version.) With the Philharmonia on Saturday, the Labeques took a brave step into more 'advanced' territory than they usually explore: Luciano Berio's Concerto, first heard in the Festival Hall almost 20 years ago. It is only officially a 'two-piano' concerto, for behind the soloists in the orchestra there is a third piano - here, Michael Round - with a prominent supporting role, often recycling the soloists' music in counterpoint with them. That extends the role-ambiguities which are built quite deliberately into the score. The soloists are only sometimes principal voices, collaborate directly with each other only part of the time, often accompany other instruments or melt into the orchestral texture - which is mostly moire-silken, in the composer's best and most inimitable style. At the right moments the Labeque personalities surfaced brightly, making Berio's efflorescent figurations tingle, but they were scrupulous team-members too. For all its oddities, this fascinating piece begins to look like keeping a firm place in the repertoire which so badly needs it. Under the conductor Semyon Bychkov, the score sounded expertly prepared. One had doubts only about the two big, power-driven climaxes, where forceful accelerandi and fierce dynamics made conventional peaks; Berio's way of piling up the disparate voices is subtler, and does not need such underlining. Before the concerto, Bychkov took the Philharmonia through Stravinsky's comic little Suite no. 2 with much verve, and some dicey ensemble. Later, Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony got unremarkable treatment - too sectional to support the would-be symphonic structure, too consistently loud and too barren of thoughtful shading. Our withers were not wrung. Only Michael Collins' clarinet solos glowed tenderly, like good deeds in a rough world. Sponsored by the AFG Group</p>

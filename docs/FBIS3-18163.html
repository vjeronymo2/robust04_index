Top brass  from Volvo are visiting India from 14 to 17 February in order to  become familiar with the market and study business opportunities  in the country.    The delegation is led by Nils Arthur, deputy managing  director of Volvo's Truck International Division.    According to an Indian Industry Ministry spokesman, Volvo is  to study all important areas, from the possibility of  co-ownership of enterprises to component purchases in the  country.    India has recently opened up the automobile sector to  foreign  investors, who can start production without the prior permission  from the government required in the past. Although the import  of foreign cars is still limited, it has become easier to get  lower customs duty rates.  <H5>  Mercedes Is Already Here </H5>   So far only Daimler-Benz has begun the assembly of Mercedes  automobiles at the Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company  (TELCO) in Pune near Bombay.    Manufacturers assessing the studying opportunities offered  by  this new market include BMW, General Motors, Renault, Peugeot,  and Honda. Volvo is represented in India by Modi Motors Private  Limited.</p>

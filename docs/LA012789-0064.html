			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACKWELL'S LIST  </P> <P> Now that we have once again heard from the "high guru of fashion," Richard  Blackwell, I must take exception to one of his remarks (Newsmakers, Part I,  Jan. 12).  </P> <P> As a retired librarian whose career does not date back to 1940, but whose age  most certainly does, I must contend his odious comparison in reference to a  "1940 unemployed librarian." Anyone unemployed in 1940 would have been  hard-pressed to dress according to Blackwell's so-called standards.  </P> <P> Blackwell shows a lack of sensitivity in singling out for stereotyping a  profession that has contributed much to the education, literacy and culture of  many people and it should be viewed with dignity and respect.  </P> <P> On second thought, who really cares about Mr. Blackwell's list.  </P> <P> SHIRLEY PORTER  </P> <P> Sunland  </P></p>

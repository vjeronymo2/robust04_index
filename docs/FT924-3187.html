			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Observer: Title inflation When is a professor not a professor? The question has been posed by some churlish individuals who have noted that members of the Treasury's new private-sector forecasting panel who are listed as professors include Tim Congdon. While Wynne Godley, David Currie and Patrick Minford are full-time university types, consultancy-owner Congdon is a mere honorary professor of economics at Cardiff Business School. Usually, honorary profs tend to call themselves plain mister when outside the university that so honoured them. Perhaps the reason is that, for career academics, a professorship generally takes much time and achievement to acquire. Moreover, even when they've won it, most earn a relative pittance compared with some of their honorary colleagues. Whatever the latters' rights to the title, their use of it in public smacks of gilding the lily.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Feb (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  said today that the Security Council's delay so far in issuing a  resolution on the massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron  affects its credibility and that of the United Nations.    He added that the Security Council's postponement of the  issue for reasons related to the stand of this or that state  cannot be understood.    Commenting on the council's failure so far to adopt a  resolution on the massacre, Musa said: The important thing is  that this massacre was a criminal one and it cannot be passed  over or forgotten.    Musa went on to say that the issue has changed from merely a  human catastrophe to a political situation that represents a  regression in the Security Council's status and role. He added  that the Egyptian delegation in New York has been instructed to  support the issuance of a resolution, not a statement, and to  work to have the Security Council discuss this issue in light of  the UN secretary general's report, which spoke about the  presence of UN observers.    Musa stressed that the status of the Israeli settlements has  become very serious and that the settlements and settlers must  be put under control because their presence has become extremist  and criminal, as was shown in the Hebron Mosque carnage. He  said that it is high time that the status of the settlements was  reviewed because they not only have political and legal, but  also security effects, as they contain a large number of  extremists, gunmen, and crazy people.    On the Israeli Cabinet's resolutions yesterday on the  settlements and settlers, Musa said that it is important that  the resolutions not be cosmetic. If the resolutions are  cosmetic, they are rejected because the roots of the problem lie  in the existence of the settlements and settlers, their  encouragement, and the failure to protect the Palestinians. He  stressed the need for a solution that will protect the  Palestinians.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both COMAR 26.10.01.16.D, the oil cargo tank operator certification, and COMAR 26.13.04.01.F, the hazardous waste vehicle operator certification, are stricter than the HMR. The HMR impose general and function-specific training requirements on all hazmat employees. Under 49 CFR 177.816, motor vehicle operators in particular are required to be trained in an exhaustive number of areas related to the safe transportation of hazardous materials in motor vehicles. In addition, a hazmat employer must provide for ``appropriate'' testing of its employees. 49 CFR 172.702(d). Unlike the Maryland regulations, however, the HMR do not condition motor vehicle operation on passing an examination administered by a governmental body. Cf. Colorado Pub. Util. Comm'n v. Harmon, 951 F.2d at 1581 (requirement to submit proof of training goes beyond HMR). In addition, COMAR 26.13.04.01.F requires hazardous waste transporters to be trained in specific areas that the HMR do not, namely, in hazardous waste transportation requirements specific to Maryland laws and regulations. The HMR do not limit the means by which a hazmat employer may train a driver, provided that training meets the standard of 49 CFR 172.700(b). Conversely, training received by the operator of a vehicle transporting hazardous waste does not comply with COMAR 26.13.04.01.F unless the instructor meets the experience requirements set forth at COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MDE suggests that the training requirements are not an obstacle to accomplishing the purposes of the HMTA because of 49 CFR 172.702(c), which states: ``Training may be provided by the hazmat employer or other public or private sources.'' This section, however, simply encourages hazmat employers, in training their employees, to make use of any resources, public or private, that offer training meeting the requirements of the regulations. See 57 FR at 20949&hyph;50. It does not authorize States or other non-Federal entities to impose additional training obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Determining the extent to which State training requirements may differ from those in the HMR before they become an obstacle to accomplishing the purposes of the HMTA is a balancing of the State's interest in ensuring the competence of drivers within its jurisdiction against the cost and administrative burdens on transporters and the confusion, reduced compliance and decreased safety that may result from a multiplicity of potentially conflicting requirements. RSPA already has performed that balancing, and the result is codified in 49 CFR 172.701. Because COMAR 26.10.01.16.D and COMAR 26.13.04.01.F are stricter than HMR training requirements, they violate 49 CFR 172.701 to the extent they apply to operators not domiciled in Maryland. Therefore, as applied to non-domiciled operators, each Maryland requirement is an obstacle to accomplishing the full objectives and purposes of the HMTA, and is preempted. As applied to operators domiciled in Maryland, COMAR 26.10.01.16.D and COMAR 26.13.04.01.F are not preempted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. ``Otherwise Authorized by Federal Law''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HMTA does not preempt a non-Federal requirement that is ``otherwise authorized by Federal law.'' 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). MDE asserts that its oil cargo tank operator certification requirement is authorized by sections 102 and 104 of the FWPCA, 33 U.S.C. 1252(a) and 1254(a)(1), and RCRA Subtitle I, 42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FWPCA sections cited by MDE do not support its argument. In relevant part, these read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The [EPA] Administrator shall, after careful investigation, and in cooperation with other Federal agencies, State water pollution control agencies, interstate agencies, and the municipalities and industries involved, prepare or develop comprehensive programs for preventing, reducing, or eliminating the pollution of the navigable waters and ground waters and improving the sanitary condition of surface and underground waters. 33 U.S.C. 1252(a). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The [EPA] Administrator shall establish national programs for the prevention, reduction, and elimination of pollution and as part of such programs shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) in cooperation with other Federal, State, and local agencies, conduct and promote the coordination and acceleration of research, investigations, experiments, training, demonstrations, surveys, and studies relating to the causes, effects, extent, prevention, reduction, and elimination of pollution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 33 U.S.C. 1254(a)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By their clear terms, these statutes delegate general authority to the EPA Administrator to develop programs and undertake research to protect surface and groundwater quality. While the Administrator is directed to cooperate with the States in doing so, no regulatory authority is conferred on the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MDE argues as well that RCRA Subtitle I, regulating underground oil storage tanks, authorizes the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement of COMAR 26.10.01.16.D. Although Subtitle I regulates underground storage tank systems, MDE states, ``it is the vehicle operator who transfers the product into and out of these systems.'' According to MDE, ``EPA's approval of the State of Maryland's underground storage tank (UST) program was in part based on its oil vehicle operator's certification requirements for the safe transfer of oil.'' The elements that a State UST program must contain to qualify for EPA approval are set forth at 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a); these elements are elaborated in EPA regulations at 40 CFR part 281. The elements do not include, and the regulations do not mention, regulation of oil transporters. MDE submits no evidence that Maryland's certification requirement was necessary for EPA approval of the State's UST program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCRA Subtitle I, at 42 U.S.C. 6991g, provides:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Nothing in this subtitle shall preclude or deny any right of any State or political subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce any regulation, requirement, or standard of performance respecting underground storage tanks that is more stringent than a regulation, requirement, or standard of performance in effect under this subtitle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See also 40 CFR 281.12(a)(3). The fact that Subtitle I does not prohibit a State from imposing more stringent regulations does not protect those regulations from preemption under the HMTA. Indeed, 40 CFR 281.12(a)(3)(ii) states:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

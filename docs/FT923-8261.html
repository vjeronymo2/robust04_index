			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Serbia opens up Bosnian camps: Women and children allowed to leave Sarajevo Aid convoys given better access SERBIA yesterday bowed to international pressure by opening up some detention camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina and by allowing greater access to some towns and cities in the former Yugoslav republic for humanitarian relief supplies. The Serbs also agreed to let mothers and children begin leaving the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, which Serb irregular forces have been besieging for four months. The first convoy of buses with 300 women and children is due to leave today with an escort of United Nations peacekeepers. Ms Sylvana Foa, an official with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), said aid convoys for Bosnia were now getting through more quickly and easily. 'Once these people have realised how outraged the world community would be by the sight of people starving to death, that had a major impact, probably more than even the threat of the use of force,' she added. But the Serb move to lessen their grip on some areas is also aimed at pre-empting any international military intervention, threatened in a UN draft resolution expected to be put to the Security Council today. It also indicates a growing confidence on the part of Serb leaders that their forces have achieved most of their aims in Bosnia. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, said yesterday his forces had already achieved their aims, implying that he was now in a position to co-operate fully with the UN. 'We have everything. We now control 70 per cent (of the territory of Bosnia) but we only claim 64 per cent. All we need now is a negotiated settlement,' he said in an interview. A spokesman for the UNHCR warned that Serbs were still expelling Bosnia's Moslems, who make up 43 per cent of the 4.3m-strong population. The official said that about 20,000 Moslems would be forcibly deported from the region around Bihac, north-western Bosnia, to neighbouring Croatia as part of Mr Karadzic's plan for 'ethnic cleansing' of those parts of Bosnia under Serb control. The agreement to evacuate mothers and children from Sarajevo was reached by Serb forces and a children's aid organisation. Some of the first evacuees will go to Austria and others to Croatia. The UN draft resolution calls on all states to take 'all measures necessary to facilitate, in co-ordination with the UN, the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Sarajevo, and wherever needed in other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina'. The resolution also demands unimpeded and continuous access to all camps, prisons and detention centres. UN diplomats said they expected support from most Security Council members, although Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, showed signs of distancing itself from supporting UN sanctions imposed on Belgrade last May. It also refrained from condemning the existence of detention camps. In London, Mr Thomas Niles, US assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs, said he hoped the adoption of the resolution 'will make it possible to (deliver aid) peacefully and without any use of military force'. But he said 'military measures would be contemplated . . . as a last resort'. Nato is likely to discuss this issue on Friday when all 16 member states meet to consider contingency plans for the possible use of force in Bosnia.

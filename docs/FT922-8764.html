			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Bangkok shows its anger at the generals' grip on power: Why the people of Thailand have taken to mass protest The Thai media calls them the country's 'yuppie revolutionaries'. They drove in their new Japanese and German cars to express their resentment against the military domination of politics. They used their mobile telephones to call their friends and relatives to join last week's demonstrations and to berate radio phone-in hosts. In reality the crowds that protested round the clock for a week, swelling to as much as 100,000 two nights running at the weekend, were much more of a cross-section of Thai society than the colourful reports suggest. In a country that is usually politically apathetic, their numbers have surprised analysts. The end of the protests yesterday was described as a truce. Another rally has been called for Sunday to make sure compromises reached over the weekend are implemented. Urban Thais are much more internationally-minded than 20 years ago. They have become accustomed to a free press, and resent military interference in civilian affairs. More elected politicians now have the confidence to confront the generals directly. Following the end of the cold war and the easing of conflict in Cambodia, the military have difficulty in claiming they are needed to combat a security threat. The protests were not only about principles: the fact that Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon was appointed prime minister without having stood in the March 22 general election is only part of the story. Demonstrators also applauded loudly when speakers criticised Gen Suchinda's brother-in-law, Gen Issarapong Noonpakdi, who last month replaced him as army commander, and Gen Kaset Rojananil, the air force chief who succeeded Gen Suchinda as armed forces supreme commander. The three were contemporaries in military academies and have worked together closely for years. They are now being accused of nepotism, seeking to further business interests, and it is claimed they created the five-party coalition that supports the prime minister. The fact that the Thai political climate has changed since the last large demonstrations in the 1970s was not entirely recognised by the military, although Gen Suchinda has had to rely on parliamentary support in order to claim legitimacy. In a propaganda campaign against the protesters, the military resorted to speeches and announcements that increased public anxiety. Radio and television, was heavily censored, sometimes issuing false information. This merely infuriated a large section of public opinion in Bangkok where critics of the government were easily able to find out what was happening. The errors almost cost the prime minister his two-week-old job because of the upsurge in opposition. In any case, as a result of the week end compromise, the former army commander who left the military to take up the premiership may have to resign sooner than he planned. The government parties have now agreed to amend the constitution to prevent a non-elected prime minister from taking office. When the amendment takes effect Gen Suchinda will not be able to continue in office unless he seeks election. Last Thursday he inflamed public resentment by making a brief and belligerent speech that revived cold war images of the 1970s. He said he had accepted the premiership in order to be an impartial leader for the five-party coalition, and in order to protect the country from two dangerous opposition leaders. He accused Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, his predecessor as army commander who left the military to run for parliament, of seeking to set up a 'praesidium' style of government - in other words of being a communist. And he said true Buddhists had asked him to defend the religion against the deviant faith of Maj Gen Chamlong Srimuang, the former governor of Bangkok. Maj Gen Chamlong, who was on hunger strike outside parliament at that moment, has gained immense popularity in the capital because of his modest, moral lifestyle. Although Gen Suchinda's tone has moderated since then, he still accuses protesters of trying to overthrow the government, and he uses a Thai phrase that has connotations verging on 'treason'. The irony has not been lost on the protesters who are only demanding his resignation - Gen Suchinda was one of the leaders of the coup d'etat last year that overthrew the elected government of Gen Chatichai Choonhavan. Five government and four opposition parties have agreed that four provisions of the constitution drafted last year under military domination would be changed: The prime minister would have to be an elected MP; The appointed Senate would no longer be able to participate in no-confidence debates and could only delay legislation it considers unwise; The president of parliament, who plays an important role in selecting the prime minister, would be the speaker of the elected House of Representatives instead of the president of the appointed Senate; MPs would be allowed to table motions and question ministers during the second session of parliament in each year - under present provisions this is possible only during the first session. When they finally dispersed in the early hours of yesterday morning, the protesters gave government parties one week to study details of the proposed constitutional amendments and say when the changes would come into force. Already there are signs some government parties could try to delay implementation. The protests could thus begin afresh.</p>

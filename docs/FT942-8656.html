			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: IBM UK moves into outsourcing business International Business Machines UK yesterday presented itself in the unlikely role of championing the trend towards 'minimalist companies' - organisations which contract out their non-core activities. The UK market for contracting out, or outsourcing, business services is worth Pounds 7.1bn a year, according to an independent report commissioned by IBM, which said the Pounds 337m current value of outsourced activities represented only a small fraction of the true market. The UK subsidiary of the global computing giant has responded by putting staff into two new specialist businesses, Financial Administration Services and Business Administration Services. They will offer to manage for external customers functions such as payroll, vehicle fleet management, document design and accounts - the principal activities currently outsourced. About 550 of IBM UK's workforce of 11,000 come under the new businesses, which until now have been providing these services within IBM. New staff will be taken on as and when external contracts are won. Mr Peter Cruttenden, director of finance and planning, said: 'We were prompted by our own customers to investigate the outsourcing market after receiving approaches from them to use our administration services. Outsourcing is the way forward for organisations which need to concentrate on their core businesses.' IBM said last month that the group had returned to profitability after three years of heavy losses and retrenchment. Asked about IBM's credentials to advise other companies, Mr Cruttenden said: 'We have been through a character-forming experience in recent years. Our track record speaks for itself. No other company has had to deal with such technological change in an economic ice age.' IBM UK's workforce had been cut by about 45 per cent over the past three-and-a-half years, but the administrative side had shrunk by about 60 per cent. Mr Cruttenden said IBM UK's exposure in this venture was low-risk, as outsourcing was still a relatively embryonic market. He said the UK example was being closely watched by other parts of IBM. The report says growth of outsourcing is forecast to be 12 per cent this year, increasing to 19 per cent in 1995. Outsourcing: The Future of Administration.

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: Northwest offers to buy USAir London route NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier which is integrating operations with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, is offering to buy USAir's Baltimore-London route for Dollars 5m. Northwest said that it would then seek government approval to switch the route to Detroit-London. The US carrier has long fought to obtain a route between London and Detroit, where it has a large hub. However, the bilateral aviation agreement between the US and the UK permits only one non-stop authority between London and Detroit, which is held by Delta Air Lines. A US bankruptcy court judge has approved the reorganisation plan put forward by Continental Airlines, meaning that the fifth-largest US carrier is poised to emerge from bankruptcy. As part of Continental's re-emergence, Air Canada and a Texan investment partnership are investing in the US carrier, in return for minority stakes. Continental went into bankruptcy - for the second time in its history - in 1990.</p>

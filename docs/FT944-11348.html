			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Hotel costs fall in Japan Japanese hotel rates have plunged this year, but Tokyo and Osaka remain the most expensive cities in the world in which to rent a room, according to Hogg Robinson Business Travel International. Hogg Robinson said prices paid by its clients show that Tokyo's rates have fallen 16 per cent to an average of Pounds 167.18 a night, while Osaka's dropped 29 per cent to Pounds 143.87, the biggest fall for any important city in the world. Even with the decrease, Osaka was the world's second most expensive city. Hong Kong was third, with rates up 12 per cent to Pounds 131.24, and New York fourth on Pounds 126.11, 4 per cent higher. Fifth spot was taken by Zurich - average rates of Pounds 123.37, a fall of 6 per cent  - and then came Kowloon (Pounds 117.99) and Washington (Pounds 110.89). Frankfurt was in eighth (Pounds 108.18), Paris (Pounds 107.12) ninth and Copenhagen (Pounds 106.73) 10th. London, regarded by many as an over-priced hotel city, is only the 39th most expensive, Hogg Robinson says. London's rates fell 3 per cent this year to Pounds 80.35. Mike Gates, a Hogg Robinson director, says that travellers should not be repulsed by London's high advertised room rates. Far lower prices are available to those who shop around.

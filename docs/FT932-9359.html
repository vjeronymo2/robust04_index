			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Monet sells in NY for Dollars 9.7m A LARGE marine painting by Claude Monet, completed in 1868 when the 28-year-old artist was living with his aunt on the Normandy coast, sold for Dollars 9.68m (Pounds 6.3m) at Christie's in New York on Wednesday night, Antony Thorncroft writes. 'Jetty at Havre' was sent for sale by the Japanese inventor Motoaki Ishizuka and bought by a private European collector. The price was near the high end of Christie's pre-sale estimate and set the seal on a very successful auction: 48 of the 60 lots of impressionist and modern art on offer found buyers, for a total of Dollars 48.5m and in terms of value the auction was almost 90 per cent sold. Taken with Sotheby's success on Tuesday in selling a Cezanne for Dollars 28.6m and a Matisse for Dollars 14.3m it confirmed that buyers have returned at the top end of the international art market. Two pastels of dancers by Degas also sold well. A late work, 'Danseuses Russes', based on the visit of a troupe of Russian folk dancers to the Folies-Bergere in 1895, made Dollars 6.27m, almost double its estimate, and 'Deux danseuses au foyer', two gossiping girls, also beat its target at Dollars 2.6m. The tide started to turn for impressionist and modern paintings at the December auctions in New York.</p>

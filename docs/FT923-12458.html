			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage gloom grows - C &amp; G's move THOUSANDS of home owners received an unexpected shock yesterday with the news that Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society, pushed up its standard mortgage from 10.75 per cent to 10.99 per cent. In the week when the German Bundesbank raised its discount rate by a 3/4 percentage point to 8.75 per cent, borrowers in the UK waited nervously to see whether the Bank of England would decide to follow suit. This has not happened so far, yet the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which prides itself on having by far the lowest costs of any society, has put up its mortgage rates. 'Our move is a defensive one, designed to retain existing investors' funds which are committed to homebuyers,' said Andrew Longhurst, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester chief executive. 'By choice we would always prefer lower mortgage rates but the government is making us play according to their rules on a playing field which is not level.' This is a response to the newly launched National Savings First Option Bond, which can offer basic rate taxpayers a fixed rate of 7.75 per cent net (10.34 per cent gross) on their money, if they are prepared to tie it up for one year. C&amp;G is raising interest rates on its variable savings account by 0.2 per cent, apart from on the London Share account, which pays 10.4 per cent gross on a minimum of Pounds 2,500. It also launches today a new account designed to compete with National Savings. The London fixed rate account will pay 7.8 per cent net (10.4 per cent gross) until 1 October 1993. But the minimum investment of Pounds 2,500 is higher than the Pounds 1,000 for the National Savings bond. For the time being, the largest societies, Halifax, Nationwide and the Woolwich, as well as Abbey National, which is now a bank, have said that they do not plan to put their rates up. But Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest building society hinted yesterday that it too might follow C &amp; G. Its variable mortgage rate is 10.75 per cent. 'We have been considering a move ourselves in the light of the very poor savings results by the building societies, ' said Andrew Boyce, marketing controller. 'The government has not helped us by its aggressive use of National Savings to underpin PSBR.' As the building societies see it, they are being squeezed by the government on both sides of their business. To finance its budget, the government is undercutting the building societies in the savings market, while it does not allow them to raise more than part of their funds in the wholesale money markets. So mortage interest rates may have to go up. Halifax is in a strong position to go on holding them down, at least for a while but some other societies may start putting up their rates soon. Those most likely to do so are the societies which, like Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, have already raised quite a lot of money in the wholesale money markets and so will have to boost their savings inflows by making their retail savings accounts more attractive. Along with Alliance &amp; Leicester, these include National &amp; Provincial, and Bristol &amp; West. However, Bristol &amp; West said yesterday that it has 'no intention of following suit' in putting up mortgage rates. Unlike C &amp; G, it did not drop its mortgage rate in May, when bank base rates were cut and its variable rate remains at 10.99 per cent. National &amp; Provincial, with a variable mortgage rate of 10.7 per cent said it had increased its share of building society savings but if other societies put up mortgage rates, it too would follow. John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phiilips and Drew, expects other building societies to follow C &amp; G's move in due course. However, he thinks the societies will move on an individual basis. With the banks' base rate at 10 per cent, a mortgage interest rate of around 11 per cent is fairly normal by past standards. Even if mortgage rates do not go up across the board, the drop in mortgage rates that many borrowers were hoping for, will not be on the cards for longer than expected.</p>

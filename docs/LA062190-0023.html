			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> FROM THE CONVENT TO THE UNCONVENTIONAL;  </P> <P> DEVILS, FOR A CHANGE BY WENDY PERRIAM ST. MARTIN'S PRESS $19.95, 469 PAGES  </P> <P> Some books you like or dislike unreservedly; some, you like despite their  weaknesses, or dislike despite their strengths. A few, however, have the power  to make you like them, not merely in spite of their flaws but along with, even  because of them. Such a book is Wendy Perriam's latest novel, "Devils, for a  Change."  </P> <P> The story is of Hilary Reed, the former Sister Mary Hilary, an English  contemplative nun in one of the strictest orders in Europe, who, as the book  opens, quite suddenly leaves her order and makes her way to London. Over the  course of a year, she meets a variety of people, has adventures, romances,  disillusionments and crises of faith, and emerges at the end changed,  strengthened, still spiritual but also occasionally ready to be a "devil, for a  change."  </P> <P> The triumph of the book is in the character of Hilary. Perriam has a rare  ability to get under the skin of her main character -- a bit too far under, in  fact, in the case of the supremely irritating, whining protagonist of her  previous "Under Purple." Hilary, though, is another kettle of fish. She is  intelligent, earnest and a little simple. She is lacking somewhat in  self-confidence, and somewhat more in humor; she makes occasional faulty  judgments, and becomes, often, extremely confused; she desperately wants to do  the moral thing. You recognize her immediately and are rooting for her all the  way.  </P> <P> It is through her mercy, too, that you get a quite wonderfully vivid, yet  impartial, view of convent life. Perriam knows her convents through and  through, and -- more unusual -- she has remained able to view them without  apparent prejudice either for or against. Thus we are shown without prurience  the chosen rigors of the life -- the bare feet on cold mornings, the active  seeking of "penance," the constant quest to humble the body by denial of  pleasures. We are shown, too, without sentiment, that distinctive, childlike  charm peculiar to many nuns: the delight in luxuries smaller than most of us  would notice, the sheer, cloistered innocence of them.  </P> <P> Set against the convent is the description of modern London, beginning with a  horribly accurate six-page picture of the underground at rush hour and  continuing by turns terrible, poignant and comical; Hilary, Candide-like,  encounters every aspect of the modern world, from post-punk haircuts to lessons  in the Alexander technique, from tampons to charismatic priests.  </P> <P> Both environments are convincingly portrayed; each bounces off the other in a  way that can only intensify both.  </P> <P> Where the book falters is in the many other characters that Hilary meets in her  quest for self-fulfillment. Each appears to possess just one outstanding  characteristic. Thus, you have, appearing in turn, the Earthy Working Woman,  the Problem Child, the Feminist, the Ardent Suitor, etc. The speech habits of  each can only be called curious, not so in conversations with Hilary as  delivering to her, sometimes within minutes of introduction, miniature  disquisitions, stating precisely what they feel about a given situation,  offering a couple of alternative reasons why they might feel it, and quite  often backing it all up with some statistics they just happen to have read in a  magazine.  </P> <P> How many, for instance, 17-year-old beauticians -- or, indeed, any 17-year-old  anythings -- do you know who talk like this:  </P> <P> "Nor am I (married). But it doesn't stop me having sex. Don't get me wrong,  Hilary, I wouldn't sleep around. It's far too dangerous nowadays, apart from  being cheap. But if I meet a bloke I like -- and trust -- then I'll go to bed  with him. It's part of being human, part of living. . . . All my crowd feel  much the same. . . ." And on, and on and on.  </P> <P> After a couple of hundred pages of this, you are left with two choices: tossing  the book aside wearily, or deciding to adapt to its rhythm. With "Devils," you  opt for the latter, because it is, on the whole, a very good book -- in both  the moral and the literary sense -- and because Hilary is so very real, so very  admirable, and because you care so very much that she find the right answers.  </P> <P> After a bit, you find yourself actually enjoying the dialogue, the way you do  the quirks of an eccentric but well-loved friend.  </P> <P> And as Hilary herself finds in the course of the book, you really shouldn't  expect perfection.  </P> <P> Next: Elaine Kendall reviews "Jakob the Liar" by Jurek Becker (Schocken Books).  </P></p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Four Seasons to be sold as Sharp loosens control Four Seasons Hotels has put itself up for sale in a two-stage process that would allow Mr Isadore Sharp, the luxury hotel chain's founder and controlling shareholder, to loosen his ties gradually over the next three-five years. Mr Sharp, aged 62, linked the move to plans for his own retirement. 'Every good leader should know when to step down and how to ensure the continuing good health of his company,' he said. Four Seasons, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange, has a market value of CDollars 294m (USDollars 223m). It owns or manages 44 hotels in 19 countries, including The Pierre in New York and The Four Seasons, in London. Mr Sharp is keen to maintain Four Seasons' product and management style for the forseeable future. An outside investor with a strong interest in the travel business is likely to get a more favourable hearing than a rival hotel chain. Mr Sharp and his family own 18 per cent of Four Seasons' shares, but control 70 per cent of the votes. He pledged that the principal condition of any deal would be identical terms for all shareholders. Mr Sharp has retained Goldman Sachs to seek a buyer for all Four Seasons' shares. Initially, an offer would be made to outside shareholders, followed later by the purchase of the controlling block. Like other luxury hotel operators, Four Seasons has been buffeted by the recession. But the company said yesterday that 1993 earnings, to be published in mid-April, would show very strong operating numbers'. Nine-month earnings were CDollars 5.2m, on revenues of CDollars 950m.</p>

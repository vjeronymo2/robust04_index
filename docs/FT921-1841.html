			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Embarrassment for Lang at leak THE TORY campaign in Scotland suffered intense embarrassment yesterday when Labour produced what appeared to be a letter from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, to Mr John Major in which he spoke of using the Scottish National party to split the Labour vote. The letter, written on Scottish Office paper on March 3, also revealed disagreement between Mr Lang and Mr Major over election tactics - particularly over publication of a Scottish Office booklet. The key passage in the letter reads: 'It is almost as important to us to keep the SNP at bay as it is to use them to split the socialist vote.' Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, flourished the letter at a press conference in Glasgow and said it showed that, although Mr Lang had always claimed that preserving the union was his overriding aim, he was prepared to gamble its future 'in a desperate attempt to contrive his political survival'. Mr Lang refused to comment on the letter. In it he argued for publication of a booklet which Mr Major and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had reservations about. It set out more authoritatively than before how much money Scotland received from Westminster and how much it contributed in tax. The booklet - prepared by Mr Lang - claimed that Scotland received substantially higher expenditure per head than other parts of Britain, and suggested that revenue raised in Scotland was about Pounds 4bn less than the Pounds 22bn spent. In the letter Mr Lang said he was 'disappointed' about Mr Major's reservations on the booklet. 'We are engaged in a complex exercise to outflank three other parties,' he said. 'This initiative could score against all of them.' He said it would be difficult for Labour to discredit the booklet because it needed the arguments to attack the SNP. The booklet would also help refute the SNP's Budget proposals. Mr Lang ends: 'So, with apologies for persisting on this occasion, I would ask you to reconsider publication while there is still time.' The booklet was published on March 9 at only a few hours notice. Membership of the European Community would not be automatic or easy for an independent Scotland, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warned yesterday. 'Scotland could not slide out of the United Kingdom on Monday and sidle into the Community as the 13th member state on Tuesday,' he said.</p>

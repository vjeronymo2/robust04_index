			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Kadannikov, general director of the </F> AvtoVAZ Joint-Stock Company, by correspondent N. Mogzharetto:  "VAZ--For Us Or Not About Us? One Million People Work at VAZ"]    [Text] In recent years it seems that we have adjusted  to everything, but still the new prices introduced for the  Zhiguli in December are staggering. Here we have already passed  up the Opal and Chrysler in terms of cost and we are catching up  with the Mercedes. Apparently, finding no buyers for their  products, the automotive plant stood idle during all of January  and only in February did it produce its first motor vehicle.  During these days our correspondent N. Mogzharetto met with the  general director of the AvtoVAZ Joint-Stock Company, V.  Kadannikov.    [Kadannikov] The situation at the automotive plant is the  same as it is throughout all of industry and throughout our  entire economy. Because of the shortage of batching materials  and items and nonpayments it was necessary to shut the plant  down for a month. Plus a lot of work for repairing equipment and  readjusting it for the Desyatka had accumulated. The collective  went to work on 1 February and since that time it has been  fulfilling its very tight schedule each day.    Now about the plant's development. It is simply impossible  to  imagine an automotive company that never updates its products.  But to put a new motor vehicle on the conveyor takes $2-2.5  billion. Today there are no centralized sources but,  unfortunately, there is also nothing to take their place.  Therefore we created the All-Russian Automotive Alliance, whose  main task is to put a new motor vehicle into production. And we  are speaking about a completely new model--the VAZ-1116. It will  be a five-door "hatchback" which is suitable for conditions in  the city and at the same time is high-speed (the experimental  model which I have seen reminds one a little of the well-known  Italian vehicle Fiat-Tipo.--I.M.)    [Mogzharetto] And the Desyatka--will it come into being?    [Kadannikov] Approximately 70 percent of the investments  have  been made in the "2110" family and series production will begin  at the end of the year. During 1995 we plan to reach our  projected capacities and at the same time gradually phase out  our oldest motor vehicle, the VAZ-2106. The VAZ-2105, -07, -04,  -08, -09, the Niva and the Oka will remain, but they will be  thoroughly modernized. For example, we have already begun to  make a longer five-door version of the Niva. Moreover, we are in  negotiations with the General Motors firm concerning the  production of a model of the Opal-Course in Tolyatti.    The Desyatka family itself consists of three motor vehicles:  the VAZ-2110 sedan itself, the VAZ-2111--with a "hatchback"  body, and the 2112--"universal." There are several versions of  the engine: the conventional carburetor engine with a capacity  of 1.5 liters, the modernized one with a capacity of 1.7 liters,  and the new injection engine with 16 valves.    [Mogzharetto] It is very nice that under conditions of  economic crisis you are putting a new model on the conveyor.  But, excuse me, why is it needed if the price of even the old  one has exceeded all possible bounds? Moreover, our vehicle  costs less, say, in France, than it does in Russia.    [Kadannikov] Our whole life is to blame for the fact that we  are selling vehicles at that price. Last year prices of  materials and batching items rose on average 6.63-fold, and the  motor vehicle prices--4.2-fold.    If you compare the prices of the Zhiguli there and here,  taking into account our exchange rate of the ruble to the  dollar, it turns out that they are higher here. Because the  exchange rate itself does not reflect the actual relationship  between the ruble and the dollar. There, of course, our Desyatka  will not cost $10,000, but that is not because the price is  different but because the dollar relative to the ruble is  different. The ruble's actual buying power relative to the  dollar is about 1.5 times less, and the government is  maintaining this exchange rate artificially. Additionally, in a  number of cases our prices really do turn out to be higher than  in the West, if only because many of our plants are operating  like social security organizations.    [Mogzharetto] And that is why you "put so much pressure" on  our government that effective next year it will introduce  monstrous duties on foreign brands. Because it turned out that  it was cheaper to buy a new Opal or Renault than a Desyatka.    [Kadannikov] All the mass media are accusing me of causing  that--introducing these taxes, lobbying the government, etc. I  can say--cross my heart--that neither I nor any of the members  of our board had anything to do with that decree. It is an  ordinary fiscal law generated in the bosom of the Ministry of  Finance, and the taxes that are planned will go not for the  development of the domestic automotive industry but for purposes  unknown to me.    I think it would be impossible to abolish the importation of  motor vehicles into Russia. At the present time we have  approximately 15 million passenger cars in operation in the  country. Our entire industry produces 900,000 motor vehicles a  year, of which 300,000 are sold abroad. Thus it would take us 25  years to replace the fleet of motor vehicles. This is  impossible, no motor vehicle runs that long. And if we do not  ship in foreign brands our fleet will become extremely  "obsolete," which will lead to accidents, deaths, pollution of  the environment, etc. In many places the replacement of the  automotive fleet is financed directly by the state. For example,  in Greece, where motor vehicles are not produced, three years  ago the government decided to allot a very large amount of  money--and everyone who sold an old motor vehicle could buy a  new one from the state with preferential credit. As a result,  the automotive fleet was updated in a short period of time.    There is no country that would not protect its producers  with  import taxes. There are protective measures like this that are  worse than ours--in some places more intelligent, in some places  less so. But if we are to speak seriously about the market and  are concerned about our citizens, we must not raise the question  of banning the importation of foreign makes. And we must work on  the domestic market as we work on the foreign market, under  conditions of competition. To me that is the natural course of  events.    [Mogzharetto] Is it true that after the regular price  increase the plant was overstocked with Zhigulis and they would  not sell?    [Kadannikov] No, that is not true. There are 1,500 motor  vehicles on the lot and it might seem to someone on the outside  that the plant has overstocked. But that, excuse me, is a half  day's output. But, naturally, the sales level declines after  each price increase. When we raise prices everyone is in shock  for a month or two. But then the demand levels out. [end  Kadannikov]    FROM THE EDITORS. We turned the floor over to V.  Kadannikov--this is his viewpoint. But there are also  others--for example, according to certain information, it was  namely the leaders of the LogoVAZ Joint-Stock Company, V.  Berezovskiy and V. Kadannikov, who actively "put their minds" to  getting new customs duties introduced. Thus they are trying to  attract foreign investments to the domestic automotive industry.  But the investments (if there are any) will produce a return  five years from now, while the Russians need an inexpensive  motor vehicle today....</p>

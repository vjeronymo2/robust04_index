			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Dumisani Makhaye, ANC southern Natal media </F> officer, on SAPA PR Wire Service on 2 February]    [Text] The African National Congress [ANC] in Natal is not  surprised by the appearance in the National Party [NP] list for  the Natal provincial legislature of names of some long  discredited personalities. Surely, the NP regards Natal, with  about 25 percent of national votes, as crucial for the April 27  elections. Therefore its Natal list of candidates is the best  the NP can offer.    If the best that can be fielded by the NP includes people  like George Bartlett, Con Botha and Valentin Volker, then the NP  is the party of yesterday. The people of Natal in particular and  those of the whole country in general cannot forget the mess  that was caused by Bartlett in the Department of Transport and  the recent petrol increases. The people of Natal will not  forgive Con Botha for refurbishing a beach front apartment for  himself at Addington hospital at an exorbitant price using  taxpayers' money when thousands of patients were without  hospital beds and sufficient medicines at the hospitals.    The corruption of some of the people appearing in the NP  list  is the mirror of the corruption of the NP as a whole. The list  is conservative and Afrikaner male dominated. That is the true  character of the NP which is conservative and male chauvinist.    The NP excuse that the reason that the few blacks appearing  on its list is because of intimidation in the black areas is a  big lie. The NP does not trust blacks and conversely the  oppressed masses cannot trust the NP -- the party of apartheid.  What intimidates blacks from the NP is its apartheid policies  which caused and still cause havoc among black communities.  Anyway, it was the Group Areas Act of the NP that forcibly  separated residential areas along racial and ethnic lines.    Those few token NP black candidates appearing in the list  are  not even known in their communities. Obviously, a party of  apartheid cannot hope to attract oppressed personalities of any  substance. The NP can only rely on those elements who benefitted  from apartheid.    The ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme is aimed  at reconstructing the economy which was destroyed by some of the  very people appearing on the NP list. The people of Natal dare  not vote these forces of destruction.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARRETTI'S REPORTED REMARKS OUTRAGE MOVIE EXECUTIVES  </P> <P> Anti-Semitic remarks attributed to Italian entertainment executive Giancarlo  Parretti generated alarm in Hollywood on Friday, and several top film  executives said Parretti's bid to buy MGM/UA Communications Co. will be  endangered if he fails to explain himself.  </P> <P> "He's going to have a real hard time now," said one executive who asked not to  be named. "This is the one thing, that, if it's proven true, can derail the  entire deal. This is a very liberal community, and I don't think people are  going to be happy about working with someone with that attitude."  </P> <P> But Time Warner Inc. Co-Chairman Steven J. Ross, whose firm is providing  financing for the MGM/UA deal, rose to Parretti's defense.  </P> <P> Parretti, the co-founder of Pathe Communications Co., was quoted as saying,  "Jews have ganged up on me" in a recent interview with the Italian newspaper,  L'Unita. He also reportedly charged that Jews control the media. Parretti has  denied making those statements in the past, but on Friday he refused to discuss  the controversial remarks with The Times.  </P> <P> Parretti is being closely watched in Hollywood these days as he attempts a  buyout of MGM/UA for $1.2 billion. His chances of pulling the deal off were  seen as remote until last Monday, when Time Warner offered to put up more than  half the purchase price in return for the worldwide distribution rights to the  United Artists film library and future MGM/UA and Pathe releases.  </P> <P> Ross on Friday defended Parretti, saying the embattled executive "has never  exhibited any prejudice." Ross, who released a prepared statement to The Times  through his son, pointed out that Time Warner's business deal is with a public  corporation (Pathe), not Parretti personally. He also questioned the motives of  Parretti's critics.  </P> <P> "I would think that if studio people are quoted and they're not disclosing who  they are, that in itself must mean something, especially since most major  studios with the possible exception of Fox, have contacted Mr. Parretti and/or  Warner Bros. to negotiate a deal of their own," Ross said.  </P> <P> Still, many leading film figures questioned how Ross, who is extremely active  in Jewish and Israeli affairs, can continue doing business with Parretti under  the current circumstances.  </P> <P> They said Parretti will be treated as an outcast in entertainment circles if  the remarks attributed to him are not thoroughly and convincingly refuted.  Besides being offensive, the statements are factually in error, they said,  noting that studios such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment are owned by such  non-Jewish owners as the Japanese.  </P> <P> Parretti's alleged statements also drew fire from the national office of the  Anti-Defamation League on Friday. Chairman Burton S. Levinson called on the  Hollywood community to "forcefully reject the anti-Semitic stereotyping and  bigotry" detailed in the story.  </P> <P> The alleged remarks were made public in the United States by Business Week  magazine. Editor-in-chief Stephen Shepard said his staff spoke to the reporter  who interviewed Parretti and personally viewed the videotape of an Italian  television show in which Parretti made similar, though less inflammatory  statements.  </P> <P> Jeff Berg, chief executive of International Creative Management talent agency  and an acquaintance of Parretti's, said he hopes the film executive can clear  himself. "If it's true, it's highly unfortunate because it plays into every  historical stereotype in anti-Semitic thought," Berg said. "I can only hope  Giancarlo did not say what was reported."  </P> <P> Most others declined to be identified for this story. But the reaction of one,  who said, "My eyes nearly popped out of my head," when he read the story, was  fairly typical.  </P> <P> "If it's true, it's horrible," said a major industry executive. "I would  suspect that the number of people who would want to do business with him would  be limited. As an anti-Semite, I don't see how he could even function in this  town."  </P> <P> Added another longtime member of Hollywood's creative community: "It's one  thing to note that many prominent figures in all aspects of Hollywood are  Jewish and always have been. It's quite another, however, to make hostile  statements based on that fact."  </P> <P> One Hollywood executive who is in partnership with Parretti, and who also  happens to be an Israeli-born Jew, jumped to the embattled businessman's  defense. Yoram Globus, co-president of Pathe, said Parretti is one of the most  loving and generous people in Hollywood. Globus also claimed that Parretti has  made generous donations to Israeli and Jewish causes over the years.  </P> <P> "Do you think I would have worked with him?" he asked. "It's ridiculous that  the media are trying to take the blood out of the man. There is not even an  inch of anti-Semitism."  </P> <P> MGM/UA, the object of Parretti's desire, released its second quarter financial  statement Friday and the company continued to report sizeable losses, which  reflected interest expense and the studio's continued hard luck at the box  office.  </P> <P> For the fiscal quarter ended Feb. 28, MGM/UA reported operating income of $10.3  million on total operating revenue of $176.8 million, compared to operating  income in the same period last year of $10.1 million on total revenue of $241.8  million. The company managed to reduce its net loss from $14.7 million to $9.8  million.  </P></p>

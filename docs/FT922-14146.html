			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Bronfmans take 73% of Toronto's Terminal 3 THE CHARLES Bronfman family of Montreal, through privately held Claridge Group, is taking 73 per cent control of the CDollars 520m (USDollars 436.9m) Terminal 3 and hotel at Toronto's Pearson International Airport. For the past two years the 73 per cent interest had been held jointly by Claridge and property developer Huang &amp; Danczkay Properties. The terminal was built by H &amp; D in the late 1980s and then was put into a joint venture with Claridge. The 27 per cent minority holding will remain in the hands of Lockheed Air Terminals, an affiliate of Lockheed of the US. Terminal 3 came into operation in February 1991 just as the North American recession was peaking. H &amp; D said that it broke even for the year, even though the retail sections were only 50 per cent leased. It denied that the deal with the holding company of Mr Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of Seagram, the international drinks company, is linked with Terminal 3's financial squeeze. Claridge says it may bid to lease and renovate Terminals 1 and 2 in Toronto, which are owned by the federal government. 'We are taking a strong look at bidding,' said Mr Norman Spencer, Claridge vice-president, finance. 'It's logical now we control Terminal 3.' Lockheed plans to retain its 27 per cent interest, but H &amp; D made clear it wants to pursue other projects. It is bidding with Lockheed Terminals to build a new international terminal at Athens airport. It has already been shortlisted by the Greek government. The project will cost between USDollars 2bn and USDollars 3bn.</p>

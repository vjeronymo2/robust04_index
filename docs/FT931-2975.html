			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / M0 growing more slowly M0, the narrow measure of money supply targeted by the government, has been growing more slowly on a seasonally adjusted basis than thought, the Bank of England says. The Bank's half-yearly figures show that M0 - mainly notes and coins in circulation - grew by 4.5 per cent in the 12 months to February compared with 4.8 per cent announced previously. Year-on-year growth did not breach the government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent target range in January.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK-led group in deal to run Romanian TV station A UK-led consortium has won the right to operate one of Romania's two TV channels, representatives of the group, led by Atlantic Television, said after signing the deal yesterday, Virginia Marsh reports from Bucharest. The new station, Channel 2 TV Romania, will be the first national commercial TV channel in the former Soviet bloc. Mr Robin Edwards, managing director of Atlantic Television, a Canadian-registered company, and a non-executive director of Westcountry Television of the UK, said the station would 'set the standard' for other ex-Comecon countries. The deal gives the new channel, a joint-venture company allocating a 20 per cent stake to Radio Televiziunea of Romania, broadcasting rights for 15 years. Conceived as non-political, it will import half its programmes from the west. Atlantic hopes it will be on air by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Bahrain bids for S Africa business A SENIOR delegation from Bahrain's central bank and finance ministry will next week make an official visit to their counterparts in South Africa, taking what officials in Manama call a 'major step' towards developing trade and investment ties between the two countries. The visit will mark the most substantial economic and diplomatic overture towards South Africa from the Gulf since Pretoria began dismantling apartheid and crowns a series of initiatives, led by Bahrain, to attract South African investment into the region. A trade and investment accord was signed in Bahrain on Tuesday between Kanoo, one of the Gulf's biggest trade groups, and Omega Investments, a Cape Town-based business consultancy. Bahrain officials say the May 10 visit by representatives from the Bahrain Monetary Agency promises to develop such ties. 'We're flying the flag, and putting up markers for the future,' said one. Bahrain has no diplomatic relations with Pretoria, though ministers from both countries have engaged in a flurry of exchange visits in the past year. And while Gulf countries still technically maintain the internationally applied sanctions against South Africa, reforms in the republic have encouraged Bahrain, in particular, to ignore them. 'There is acquiescence to consider them no longer there,' said Mr Tareq Almoayed, Bahrain's information minister. The Bahrain delegation intends to examine South Africa's exchange controls and trade policy with particular attention to the banking sector, in the hope of tempting big South African banks to establish branches in Bahrain. The arrival of a batch of South African banks would be a considerable fillip to the island, which has seen its pre-eminence as the Middle East's banking sector eroded in recent years.</p>

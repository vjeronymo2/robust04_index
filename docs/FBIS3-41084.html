			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Amparo Trejo] </F>   [Text] Mexico City--The director of the Federal Judicial  Police [PJF] counternarcotics division assigned to the National  Institute To Combat Drugs, Jose Luis Lagunes Lopez, has been  dismissed; and Carlos Santibanez Ramos, ex-general director of  Interpol in Mexico, has been named to replace him. This  announcement was made unofficially yesterday.    Although the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the  Republic] did not publicize the appointment of the new director,  Lagunes Lopez held a long meeting yesterday with Jorge Tello  Peon, commissioner of the National Institute To Combat Drugs.  Upon its conclusion, he refused to make any statement.    The National Institute To Combat Drugs was created at the  president's proposal on 17 June of this year. Its purpose is to  curb drug use effectively, and to prevent Mexico from serving as  the site of drug production or trafficking.    The agency replaced the Drug Control Planning Center created  by the ex-attorney general, Ignacio Morales Lechuga, in June of  last year.    Commander Emilio Islas Rangel was named as Santibanez  Ramos's  substitute at Interpol of Mexico, an appointment made official  by the Attorney General's Office yesterday.    At the instruction of the attorney general of the republic,  Jorge Carpizo, the assistant attorney for local offices and  inspections, Mario Ruiz Massieu, administered the oath for the  Interpol post to Islas Rangel. He had previously served as  director of the PGR's Kidnapping Investigations Unit, a position  now to be filled by Juan Jose Valdemar Escalona.    A PGR communique states: "Commander Islas Rangel's new  appointment is an acknowledgment of his considerable merits in  his previous position as director of the same institution's  Kidnapping Investigations Unit, where he achieved great success  in solving these crimes."    Islas Rangel previously served as security chief for the  United States Ambassador to Mexico, and representative of the  Secretariat of Government in Guanajuato.    The PGR reported that he was also deputy director of  operations for the Judicial Police in Guanajuato, and  coordinator of the Federal District Judicial Police northern  zone.</p>

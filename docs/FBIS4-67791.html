			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``Diplomatic Bankruptcy''] </F>   [Text] President Clinton, it would seem, is desperate for a  major foreign policy triumph. Nuclear nonproliferation and human  rights have been at the top of his agenda. There has been no  headway in promoting either. While Warren Christopher met his  Waterloo in Beijing as far as human rights are concerned, his  chief found North Korea a tough customer on nonproliferation.  From the U.S. point of view, therefore, the need to embark on a  bout of aggressive diplomacy in South Asia is all the greater.  This is the backdrop of the visit of Strobe Talbott to New Delhi  as Clinton's troubleshooter. If at least there was even a hint  of progress in the many rounds of Indo-U.S. talks that have  already taken place in recent months, Talbott could be expected  to try and improve matters with significant overtures. But that  is assuredly not the case, with Robin Raphel's endeavours having  yielded invisible results. Talbott, in other words, is faced  with the onerous task of convincing New Delhi of the inherent  virtues of the Clinton administration's approach to the  Indo-Pakistani conflict. But the worst way of making any headway  is to offer saccharin-coated lollipops to India.    Strobe Talbott, apart from being a high-ranking State  Department official, is also a scholar and a former journalist.  He should know better than career diplomats that devising  formulae that may look attractive on paper will make no dent  whatsoever in India's security concerns. These concerns have  been influenced as much by India's history and geography as by  the bitter experience of having to deal with a neighbour which  has waged three wars to annex Kashmir, and which it could do  entirely because of its colossal military arsenal supplied by  successive regimes in Washington. Total American unconcern for  New Delhi's apprehensions born, first, of the circumstances of  Pakistan's birth and, later, of U.S. help in nurturing a virtual  counterweight to India, persist. Otherwise, it is hard to see  how the policy-makers in Washington could even imagine that  India would have evinced the slightest interest in the package  that has been purposefully leaked to THE WASHINGTON POST.    According to the paper, the package provides for verified  Pakistani capping of its production of weapons-grade nuclear  material, U.S. lifting of the Pressler Amendment to clear the  sale of F-16s to Pakistan, and an Indian agreement to give up  its Prithvi and Agni missiles in response to Islamabad's  restraint on nukes. To ask India to accept this package is to  ask it to sign its own death warrant. If, indeed, Talbott plans  to present this package to South Block, it only means that even  a man of his experience and knowledge is, in effect, a stranger  to this country. He is being wilfully naive in believing that  Benazir Bhutto's support for the package qualifies it  automatically for Indian endorsement. All together, it seems a  clear case of diplomatic bankruptcy.</p>

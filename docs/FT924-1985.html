			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Accounts change leads Boeing to take Dollars 1bn charge BOEING, the US aerospace group, said it would implement the new Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 106 in 1992, resulting in a one-time, after-tax charge to earnings of Dollars 1bn, or Dollars 2.94 a share, AP-DJ reports from Seattle. The company said the change would be reflected in restated first-quarter results. In its 1991 annual report Boeing estimated an after-tax earnings impact of between Dollars 900m and Dollars 1.2bn. For 1992, this will represent a decrease in earnings per share of about 6 cents each quarter, it added.</p>

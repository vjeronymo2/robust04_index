			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Haynes Recovery is well under way at Haynes Publishing, the printer and publisher of workshop manuals. Underlining the confident tenor of his statement at the group's annual meeting in October, Mr John Haynes, chairman, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m for the six months to November 30. The outcome, which was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 453,000 for redundancies and cancellation of titles, and higher interest charges of Pounds 240,000 (Pounds 104,000), compared with profits of Pounds 494,000 in the corresponding six months of 1990 and just Pounds 26,000 for the last financial year. Much of the profits increase was attributable to operations in the US which continued to do well, Mr Haynes said, despite 'shark-like' trading conditions. Trading profits in the US rose from Pounds 374,000 to Pounds 870,000. Turnover, reflecting a sales promotion and merchandising campaign, improved to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.56m). The interim dividend goes up 1.5p to 2.5p, payable from earnings of 6.9p (2.9p) per 20p share.</p>

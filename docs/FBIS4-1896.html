			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Stella Lee] </F>   [Text] Angry protests are continuing in Huiyang County,  near Shenzhen, over the amount of compensation offered to  farmers whose land is being developed in an urban renewal  programme. Yesterday, dozens of landowners from Xinhua village  petitioned the county Government over the issue and accused  their village representatives of corruption. They say they are  concerned because their land was confiscated last year but so  far they have not received the government compensation they were  promised. They suspect that someone in their village may have  already received the payments and not passed them on.    A strong force of Public Security Bureau officers supervised  the protest yesterday, following a violent clash between  villagers and police last week. This time, however, the  officers turned their attention to reporters trying to cover the  demonstration. Officers checked the identity of anyone going  into the village. Hong Kong reporters were detained for four  hours for failing to seek permission from the authorities to  conduct interviews in the region. They were eventually escorted  to the border and put on trains back to the territory.    About 30 Xinhua villagers had gone to the Huiyang government  building at about 9.30 am with banners saying they wanted their  compensation. One of the Xinhua villagers said: "Our  agricultural lands were sold last year, but we have not been  given any compensation so far.    "We believe the village representatives are corrupt and we  want the Government to investigate." Another villager said the  county Government had promised to send representatives to the  village on Friday [1 April] to hear the complaints.    Similar tales emerged from Baigang village where rioting  took  place last week when hundreds of angry residents mobbed nearby  Xiachong police station in protest at "unsatisfactory"  compensation. The farmers said yesterday that each had been  given only $1,600 over the past three years as compensation for  their 900 hectares of land, although they estimated they were  owed between $6 million and $7 million by the Government.    Last week's riot started on Thursday night when about 80  villagers staged a demonstration at the police station demanding  the release of one of the farmers who had been accused of  blackmail. Daya Bay Public Security Bureau head Chen Xinde said  staff had used no force until the villagers tried to damage the  office. Five villagers were arrested for causing damage and  attacking public security officers. One villager, Chen  Rongchao, was shot in the leg twice by the public security  officials as they were trying to arrest his brother Chen  Rongsheng, another blackmail suspect.    Chen Xinde said the shooting was carried out in self-defence  when Chen tried to attack his staff. His family said they did  not know at which hospital he was being treated and so could not  check on his condition. Residents said police fired warning  shots to disperse the crowd and that sporadic fighting had taken  place. Some of the police station's windows were smashed. The  farmers accused the village representatives of trying to  suppress an organisation formed by one of the brothers which  called for a clear account of the compensation issue. Other  organisers were in hiding yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- China has reported new  progress in genetic studies in such fields as anthel culture  breeding and microbial genetics, with some of the results being  applied in economic development.    To accelerate genetic study, Chinese scientists have  conducted extensive research in cell genetics, plant transfer of  foreign genes and the development of species resources,  molecular genetics and molecular biochemical mark.    In plant genetics, the "Jinghua No. 1" developed by Beijing  Plant Engineering Laboratory, has been hailed by Chinese and  foreign scientists as the world's first anthel breeding of  winter wheat. The new seed has been proved successful in 540,000  hectares of wheat.    Up to now, about ten wheat varieties and 22 rice varieties  developed with anthel culture have been used in crops covering  up to two million hectares, which helped boost China's  agricultural production.    The allo hexaploit secale cereal is another new result from  the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences which raised per  hectare cereal output by 40 to 60 percent above other  conventional seeds. The product has been proved highly effective  in cattle feeding with excellent quality in milk production.    A new soybean seed developed by the Institute of Genetics  Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences by applying chemical  mutagenesis technology has been used in over 200,000 hectares of  crops since 1990, adding 100 million yuan (11 million U.S.  dollars) in economic returns.    Meanwhile, new advances have also been scored in  bio-organisms and medical genetics of human beings. Scientists  in the Chinese Academy of Medical Science have developed a  unique way to detect antenatal genes by comparing two genes with  hereditary diseases. The new way, which is applicable in  different regions across China, has proved to be an easy, fast  and accurate way to analyse antenatal genes.    The mutagenesis resistant effect of Chinese medicine is also  a topic of research in Beijing University and Beijing University  of Chinese Medicine. Their results are expected to be  revolutionary in the development of Chinese medicine and disease  prevention if remarkable progress has been scored, experts said.  [sentence as received]</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Berisford cancels rights as coffee rises BERISFORD International, commodities and property group, has cancelled a rights issue announced a month ago. Its shares rose 2p to 20 1/2 p. The issue, which was to raise Pounds 14m net through the sale of loan stock, would have allowed Berisford to provide further finance to Rayner Coffee International, its 45 per cent owned coffee trading associate. Mr Barry O'Connor, company secretary, said that the coffee price had risen in recent weeks and RCI had closed its position on the terminal market, meaning it was no longer exposed to margin calls. As a result the pressure for the rights issue had been removed. That allowed Berisford to cancel the issue when it found it impossible for it, its banks and the underwriters to balance their interests. Mr O'Connor said the cost of closing the terminal market position was bearable by RCI. RCI was also negotiating the sale of some subsidiaries, which may be agreed in the next few weeks, and had implemented staff cuts. Berisford guarantees some of RCI's borrowings and has cut the maximum exposure from Dollars 115m to Dollars 105m (Pounds 61m). At present RCI is using Dollars 88m of this facility. The aim is to cut this further through asset sales. Berisford said that once the RCI guarantee was removed Berisford would 'be in a better position to implement a strategy for acquisition and growth'. Berisford has also renegotiated its own borrowing facilities. It now has a facility from four banks which is 'sufficient for Berisford's ongoing business requirements'. The facility runs until March 31 1993 and Berisford has arranged more favourable terms.</p>

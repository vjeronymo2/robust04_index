			<p>BFN     [Text] Boris Yeltsin signed a decree today extending the  state of emergency in the Ingush-Ossetian conflict zone to the  Malgobekskiy and Sunzhenskiy Rayons of Ingushetia. This decree  has to be approved by the Federation Council. It is worth  mentioning that Boris Yeltsin's actions will provoke a strongly  negative reaction in Groznyy. Here these rayons are considered  to be historically Chechen lands. This is what (Mavlen  Salimov), an aide to the president of Chechnya, said to Radio  Ekho Moskvy about this:    [Begin Salimov recording] We consider that these actions are  unlawful, and consider them as aggression, as an attempted act  of aggression. [end recording]    [Announcer] Also today, a high-ranking official from the  Chechen state security department told INTERFAX that Russian  troops are being redeployed today on the border of the republic.  Khamid Zhemoldayev, deputy head of the department, says that  special units of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, equal  to an army division, have arrived in Prigorodnyy Rayon of North  Ossetia.    Also today, Chechen President Dudayev held an emergency  meeting with power ministers.</p>

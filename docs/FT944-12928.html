			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Inspired flair captures Wexford - A final act at the festival This year's Wexford Opera Festival is the 13th that Elaine Padmore has directed, and her last; she is moving on to the Royal Danish Opera. It would be impossible to overestimate what she has done at Wexford, for year after year she has fulfilled her brief superbly. She has chosen an annual trio of neglected, obscure or forgotten opera with inspired flair, resource and cunning balance. She has scoured Europe and the former Soviet Union for the right conductors, producers and casts, from the range of artists - especially young ones - that Wexford can afford. The rare let down only proves that she can take brave, calculated risks. Not least, she has kept the town thoroughly involved in it all. Good Wexford singers find roles, one or two operas each year use a lot of local children, and some 250 volunteers work unpaid for the festival - in the satisfying knowledge that it is pure gain for the town. Everybody is happy, even euphoric, as any Wexford Festival-goer can attest. At White's Hotel, the Talbot and other watering-holes, the operas are discussed far into the night. Miss Padmore's Italian successor will find hers a formidable act to match. Besides young Wagner's Das Liebesverbot, which I wrote about on Tuesday, the 1994 festival offers two more rarities: Anton Rubinstein's once-famous The Demon (1871, premiered 1874), and the alternative La Boheme by Leoncavallo - composed simultaneously and competitively with Puccini's, but eclipsed by that and by his own Pagliacci, like everything else he wrote. Yet he is more faithful to Murger's original serial, 'Scenes de la Vie de Boheme', which he captures with a crueller vision. Where Puccini reduced and intensified just two sentimental strands of it, to the point where the 'bohemianism' was little more than local colour, Leoncavallo insisted upon the feckless, nihilist real-life scene. His first two acts give us a Schaunard - here a main character - who is a flamboyant catch-as-catch-can composer, along with the choked poet Rodolfo, the would-be painter Marcello and their promiscuous sweethearts Mimi and Musette, amid their cut-rate arty parties. In the later acts they are reduced inexorably to prostitution and destitute squalour without hope; Mimi dies miserably while nobody does anything. In Reto Nickler's production, the descending curve is traced without mercy. Unfortunately, the conductor Albert Rosen gives the National Symphony Orchestra its unbridled head at every point. His singers are driven to ear-splitting passion, with ultimately deadening returns: Jonathan Veira's rollicking, eye-rolling Schaunard, Patryk Wroblewski's fluffy-haired, bespectacled, distracted Rodolfo (here a baritone), Jean-Pierre Furlan's desperate tenor Marcello, the heartfelt - though not notably musical - Mimi and Musette of Jungwon Park and Magali Damonte. But Leoncavallo is not, finally, betrayed: the taste of ashes-in-the-mouth is sour and true, over-screeched as it may be. The Demon, in which Miss Padmore has wisely cast six fine Russian and Ukrainian principals, proves to be more impressive than expected, even with cuts. Perhaps it faded from the repertoire, some 70 years ago, merely because native Russians had become hard to find in the west. Shorn of its spooky-mystical trappings, as here in Yefim Maizel's production and Paul Steinberg's striking modern sets, it is the story of a 'fallen angel's' single-minded erotic obsession with young Tamara, even to her convent re-treat. If the music is not radically original, it manages to sound like no one else's, and includes much that is rich and strange, quite mesmerising as Alexander Anissimov conducts it. Anatoly Lochak's suave, powerful baritone and Marina Mescheriakova's dramatic soprano rise splendidly to it, with sumptuous support from Leonid Zimnenko, Ludmilla Andrew, Alison Browner and an intense young tenor, Valery Serkin. A truly exciting Wexford rediscovery - and one which some larger opera houses must surely copy in haste.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BTR falls on shock figures Acutely disappointing interim results and worrying signals of growing pressure on profit margins and increases in raw materials prices combined to demolish the BTR share price yesterday, taking the rest of the market with it. BTR shares registered their worst ever one-day performance, plunging 44, or 11.5 per cent, to 338p, their lowest level since December 1993. The dismal figures had a greater impact on the company's warrants where, for example, the 1993/94 issue almost halved, closing 42 off at 45p. More worrying for the market was the strength of the selling pressure that drove the shares down; turnover in BTR reached 47m shares, the second highest single day's business on record. Analysts expressed deep dismay. 'The investment community is so disillusioned with their expectations and the actual figures that it will take many months and a set of figures up to expectations to restore confidence in the stock,' said one observer. Profits forecasts were chopped after the figures and an acrimonious post-results meeting with analysts. 'The shares are down 12 per cent and most forecasts are being reduced by around 9 per cent, which is just about right,' said another conglomerates specialist. The range is now said to be from Pounds 1.25bn to Pounds 1.335bn for the current year.</p>

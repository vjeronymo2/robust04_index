			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY TAKES ON TRADITION WITH 'TRACY';  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: THE UPCOMING MOVIE, WHICH FEATURES SOME VIOLENCE AND OVERT  SEXUALITY, IS MEANT TO SHOW THAT THE STUDIO FEELS THE TIME IS RIGHT TO BROADEN  ITS APPEAL.  </P> <P> When Dick Tracy shoots his way into movie theatres this summer, his won't be  the only famous name at stake. Walt Disney Co., in a bold departure, is  releasing the film under the classic "Disney" banner usually reserved for such  kiddie fare as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."  </P> <P> Loaded with double entendres and featuring Madonna in outfits provocative  enough to send Bashful into cardiac arrest, "Dick Tracy" drastically stretches  the boundaries of the Walt Disney Pictures formula. The company has been so  protective of the Disney name and the family values it represents that in the  past all but the tamest films were released through its companion Touchstone  division. Even "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" was deemed too racy for the Disney  name.  </P> <P> With "Tracy," Disney executives are sending a message that those days are over.  Insiders say the company, flush with success, is no longer afraid to tamper  with its traditions. "The Disney name is still sacred, but you can do other  things with it now," said one.  </P> <P> David Hoberman, head of the Disney and Touchstone film units, said more mature  films will be added to the traditional Walt Disney Pictures mix of reissued  classics and animated features as the studio steps up production in the coming  year. The move comes as the company is also launching a third division called  Hollywood Pictures under Ricardo Mestres.  </P> <P> "One of the things I have been asked to do is bring back Disney live-action  movies," said Hoberman, who has headed the two film units for six months. "We  spent four years making Touchstone into a major motion picture company,  probably at the expense of Disney."  </P> <P> When all three production units are cranking at full speed in 1991, the studio  hopes to release about 25 to 30 pictures a year. That would place Disney closer  to the front of the pack among major studios, which annually release anywhere  from 14 to 40 films.  </P> <P> Securities analysts say more films will be a plus for the studio unless quality  suffers. "They are going to have increased output, but the bottom line is, 'How  good is the project?' " said Mara M. Balsbaugh of Smith Barney, Harris Upham  &amp; Co. "In the past, they've demonstrated an above-average ability to make  commercially successful movies on average-level budgets."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Disney reported record revenue and income for the second quarter  of fiscal 1990. Revenue from filmed entertainment rose 30%, to $469 million,  from the year before. Overall revenue increased 26%, to $1.3 billion, and net  income rose 20% to $178.5 million.  </P> <P> Despite persistent rumors of bad blood between Hoberman and Mestres -- one  producer said the two executives are "only as competitive as Fox and Warner  Bros." -- some filmmakers are happy to see the increased production, saying  more projects benefit the entire community. They also said Disney has thus far  avoided the trap of bidding against itself for a project.  </P> <P> "It's just another place to sell something," said one producer. "A lot of  people will go to David or Ricardo first, depending on their relationship with  one or the other. The idea is to provide incentive and competition, and both  guys were developing their own stuff anyway."  </P> <P> The restructuring of the filmed entertainment division at Disney coincided with  the production and release of the studio's first trio of flops in recent  memory. But the embarrassment caused by the anemic "Blaze," "Stella" and "Where  the Heart Is" has apparently been relieved by the success of its more recent  entries, "Pretty Woman" and "Ernest Goes to Jail." Both have been in the top 10  for several weeks, with "Pretty Woman" grossing $71.6 million and "Ernest Goes  to Jail" pulling in $17.2 million through last Sunday.  </P> <P> Expectations are also high for the studio's upcoming films. They include  director Paul Mazursky's "Scenes from a Mall" with Woody Allen and Bette  Midler, and the sequel to the runaway hit "Three Men and a Baby."  </P> <P> Other films scheduled to go into production are "The Marrying Man," a comedy  with Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin; the American remake of "Mama, There's a Man  in Your Bed"; "Gone Fishing," a Steven Spielberg project, and "One Good Cop," a  drama starring Michael Keaton.  </P> <P> But as the busy summer movie season approaches, it's Warren Beatty's "Tracy," a  live-action feature based on the cartoon detective, that's attracting the most  attention. Shot in bold primary colors, featuring a constellation of major  stars such as Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino in supporting roles and costing  upward of $30 million, Disney hopes "Tracy" will generate the same kind of box  office and merchandising mania as last year's "Batman."  </P> <P> Those who have seen "Tracy" defend its violence as cartoonish. But there's no  denying the overt sexuality of Madonna's Breathless Mahoney in her  dressed-to-thrill costumes. Like "Batman," "Tracy" also has dark shadings that  may broaden its appeal beyond the kids' market.  </P> <P> The film is expected to receive a PG-13 rating, meaning parental guidance is  advised for children under that age. Hoberman said the Walt Disney Pictures  banner will never fly over an R-rated film. Whether "Tracy" soils Disney's  reputation remains to be seen, but one Hollywood executive questioned the  wisdom of taking that risk.  </P> <P> "If they want to signal to the world that they are doing family entertainment,  they run the risk of losing that particular association," he said. "They can no  longer say that if the film is from Walt Disney Pictures, you can automatically  take your family."  </P> <P> Hoberman, however, held that "Tracy" will only enhance the Disney name. "I'm  not sure any particular thought went into this other than the fact that it just  felt right," Hoberman said. "It's bigger than life, and we think it fits in  well with the Disney tradition."  </P> <P> Several people familiar with Disney agreed that the company probably has little  to lose, the reasoning being that the dark days of the early 1980s, when the  Disney label was box office death among adults, are long past, and that the  time is right for broadening its appeal.  </P> <P> Two of the most recent Disney releases, "The Little Mermaid" and "Honey, I  Shrunk the Kids," did extremely well with adults even though they were  primarily geared to children.  </P> <P> "At one point, when 'Tron' came out, people groaned when they learned something  was a Disney production," Balsbaugh said. "Now the merits of the film itself  will carry it or not carry it."  </P> <P> "If it was a risk, they wouldn't take it," added one Hollywood producer. "What  they are hoping is that it simply says 'quality' to the movie-going public."  </P></p>

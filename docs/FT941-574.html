			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: US selling hits cocoa futures - Market report COCOA futures plunged at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday afternoon, depressed by heavy liquidation in the US. As the long-anticipated technical 'correction' in the US took its toll the LCE May delivery price fell Pounds 29 to Pounds 904 a tonne, just Pounds 1 off the day's low. Although dealers said there was no fresh fundamental reason behind the fall many expected the Pounds 900 level to be broken. 'There's no support at all,' said one. 'I don't think we'll see the industry buying until Pounds 880.' COFFEE prices were weaker in very subdued volume. Base metal trading was routine at the London Metal Exchange as prices settled into narrow ranges. Compiled from Reuter</p>

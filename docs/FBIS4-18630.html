			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/279: "The Commission Adopts the </F> Green Paper on Audiovisual Policy"]    [Text] The Commission today adopted, on the initiative of  Mr. Joao De Deus Pinheiro, commissioner in charge of audiovisual  and culture, the green paper entitled "Strategic Options To  Strengthen the European Programme Industry in the Context of the  Audiovisual Policy of the European Union."    The Audiovisual Industry is a large, complex sector  currently  undergoing fundamental changes, brought about in particular by  rapid technological developments. These changes are causing new  interactions between the different cultural, technological and  industrial components of the industry. They are also generating  new audiovisual products and services reflecting the multimedia  and interactive approach of the information society. These  developments are creating new openings for operators who will  have to adapt their strategies and forge new alliances. The  sustained growth of the audiovisual sector is set to continue,  thereby generating great potential in terms of creation of  highly skilled jobs. These phenomena are all present at world  level and it is not yet possible to gauge them fully.    This green paper and the debate to which it should give rise  focus on one specific aspect of the audiovisual sector: the  development of the European film and television programme  industry.    The Commission is aware of the difficulty of isolating this  aspect among the many problems connected with the changes in the  sector. But it believes this exercise to be necessary to take  account of two characteristics of the programme  industry:     -  Films and television programmes are not products  like any others: as the prime vectors of culture they retain a  specific place in the midst of the manifold new types of  audiovisual products; as living testimony to the traditions and  identity of each country they deserve encouragement;    -  The  programme industry is (and will be even more so future) a  strategic element in the development of the audiovisual sector:  as recent developments show, the most powerful operators on the  world market (equipment manufacturers and cable and  telecommunications operators) are seeking to control the most  important programme catalogues.    The Commission's analysis, taking account of technological  developments, convergence of industries and the changing market  structures, already identifies four fundamental requirements for  the future of the European programme industry:     -  It must be  competitive in an open worldwide market;    -  It must be  forward-looking and be involved in the development of the  information society;    -  It must illustrate the creative genius and  the personality of the people of Europe;    -  It must be capable of  transforming its growth into new jobs in Europe.    The essential problem can therefore be summed up as follows:  how can the European Union contribute to the development of a  European film and television programme industry which is  competitive on the world market, forward-looking and capable of  radiating the influence of European culture and of creating jobs  in Europe?    To take into account the analyses and suggestions from  audiovisual professional circles in the [European] Union, the  [European] Commission, in preparing this green paper, conducted  wide-ranging preliminary consultations during which three types  of contribution were received:     -  From professional circles  and in particular those associations representing the  audiovisual industry at European level;    -  The report by the think  tank set up last november on the Commission's initiative;    -  The  competent authorities of the member states were asked to submit  their views.    From the mass of contributions received, it was seen that  though there were some contrasting, not to say conflicting,  views on what instruments should be used to implement the  Union's audiovisual policy, there was virtually unanimous  agreement on the following points, confirming the need for  wide-ranging debate on the future on the audiovisual industry in  Europe:     -  The audiovisual industry is a special case amongst  the high-growth industries, in particular with the possibilities  it offers for job creation;    -  The safeguarding of the diversity of  national and regional cultures, often expressed in terms of  maintaining the choice available to the public, is now clearly  linked to the development of a predominantly European programme  industry which must ultimately be profitable;    -  Digital  compression technology is seen as revolutionary because it  appears set to transform the sector, accentuating the strategic  role of the programme industry;    -  If the European Union wants to  strengthen its audiovisual policy, it must act quickly,  otherwise it will be overtaken by the rapidly developing  technology and the unavoidable liberalization of the industry at  international level.    While this green paper broadly reflects these points on  which  there is consensus, it is mainly concerned with initiating a  wide-ranging debate on the options the European Union should  take for the future on the basis of three lines of actions: the  rules of the game, financial incentives and convergence of  national support systems.    The green paper will be the subject of in-depth  consultations  of professional and institutional circles, in particular at the  European Audiovisual Conference organised by the Commission at  the end of June 1994. The Commission will then submit proposals  for concrete measures to the European Parliament and the Council  of Ministers in early autumn.</p>

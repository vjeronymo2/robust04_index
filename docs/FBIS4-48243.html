			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cultural Danger"] </F>   [Text] The cultural attitude of the ANC, as expounded in an  interview with BEELD, is most disturbing and should incite all  cultural organizations to take action. For it represents a  school of thought that endangers the free exercise of culture.  It is also a disavowal of principles in the new constitution.    Wally Serote, the ANC cultural leader, says that  organizations that exclude those who are not members of a  certain racial or language group--such as the Messengers, the  Junior Messengers, and the Dynamic Young Ladies--will not be  tolerated in a new South Africa under an ANC government. Their  days are numbered, for this is discrimination.    We should like to refer Mr. Serote to Article 3 of the new  constitution. This deals with fundamental rights and declares  among other things that: "Every person has the right to freedom  of association."    This simply means that one has the right to associate with  other people, a woman with other women, an Afrikaner with other  Afrikaners, a Zulu with other Zulus, etc. Of course, groups will  also have the right to be formed along language lines. This has  nothing to do with degrading discrimination, but everything to  do with the right of people to protect and expand their own  cultural inheritance.    To the best of our knowledge, all Afrikaner cultural  organizations (except those of the rightists) are in the process  of eliminating racial restrictions, so that such discrimination  no longer exists.    The Serote standard would imply that Jewish organizations  must close their doors, that a male chorus can no longer exist  (discrimination against women!), that the hundreds or thousands  of women's clubs in the country are inappropriate, etc. What  absurdity! And what a weakening of cultural distinctions will it  not indicate!    If this is the kind of thinking that is at the heart of the  ANC, the entire cultural life of the nation is threatened. Such  a policy has the potential of turning South Africa into another  Bosnia--far more than do any other controversial ANC policies  such as nationalization, for example.</p>

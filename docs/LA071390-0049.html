			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> MAYE HAS GOTTEN HER ACT TOGETHER  </P> <P> Marilyn Maye's opening night set at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill was an object  lesson in professionalism. After fortysomething years in the business,  multitudinous appearances on television, and endless nightclub tracking across  the country, the Kansas City-based singer clearly knows how to put an act  together.  </P> <P> Some of the most attractive moments in her Wednesday night program were  provided by the placement of songs in thematic medleys. "Paradise Cafe" was  followed by "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do," followed by "Am I Blue?" and "I'll Be  Around." Another grouping found a link between the sad disenchantment of  "Something Cool" and the world-weariness of "Lush Life." Maye's still rich and  vibrant voice worked these songs with consummate understanding of the lyrics  and a warmly communicative sound. Her only problem was a tendency to squeeze a  high decibel climax out of virtually every number.  </P> <P> Maye frequently has been identified as a jazz singer (a curious association,  since her career has mostly been associated with Broadway musical material, and  her greatest strengths are with storytelling songs). But the occasional forays  she made into pieces that called for rhythmic phrasing and fragments of scat  singing -- "Take Five" and "Mountain Greenery" were typical examples -- too  often sounded uncertain and contrived rather than loose and swinging.  </P> <P> To her credit, Maye performed even the unsuccessful numbers with theatrical  flair and grace. A slight refocusing of her act to emphasize the dramatic  presentations she does so well, and diminish the less effective rhythm pieces,  would add luster to her unquestioned professionalism.  </P> <P> Maye, who was accompanied by the understated, but solidly supportive rhythm  trio of John Rodby on piano, Andy Hall on bass and Mark Stevens on drums,  continues at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill through Saturday night.

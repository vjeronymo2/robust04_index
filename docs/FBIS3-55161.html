The Baltic News Service reported  that Minister of Power Engineering Algimantas Stasiukynas denied  reports published by the press that the price for oil in the  republic is artificially inflated.    The figures which he presented to the journalists today show  that the petrol price is approximately the same as in Estonia,  however, it is significantly cheaper than in Latvia or Belarus.  Heating, fuel oil, and electric power are cheaper than in  neighboring countries.    According to Algimantas Stasiukynas, there are no problems  at  the moment in getting fuel supplies. The problems appeared in  November when Russia and other CIS countries were feverishly  accumulating supplies for the winter, however, even then  Lithuania did not buy fuel [as heard]. At the moment the  reserve of fuel oil is 260,000 tons. If the present weather  remains unchanged then this amount of fuel oil would be enough  for approximately 50 days.    The minister said that since the Russian oil companies  became  commercial, purchasing oil products has been no problem. Last  year, because of the difficult financial situation, only 50,000  tons of its own oil were refined by the Mazeikiai oil refinery  Nafta; meanwhile 500,000 tons per month are needed by the  enterprise to work at full capacity. Although it would cost $40  million, according to the minister we should look for  possibilities for the enterprise to process its own oil. The  products from its own oil would cost approximately 10 to 15  percent more, therefore, it is necessary to discuss how these  products could become competitive with imported products.    The minister maintained that Lithuania has already received  a  proposal from the Russian oil companies to refine 20 million  tons of oil, however, the oil from the Lukoil company has been  delayed because export papers were not prepared in time.    Getting supplies of gas is a serious problem indeed. The  minister said if an extreme situation emerges Lithuania could be  left without gas supplies, because so far there is no  alternative means of supplying gas.    The minister of power engineering stressed that in order to  ease the problem of fuel supply Lithuania needs an oil terminal.  This would allow the country to import cheaper oil, cause  Russian oil companies to reduce the oil price, facilitate the  export of fuel oil produced in Mazeikiai, and import cheaper oil  products into Lithuania. He denied allegations that  preparations for the construction of the oil terminal are being  dragged out. On 15 January the results of the competition will  be known and the foreign firms which took part in the  competition will present their conclusions concerning the  construction of the oil terminal in Liepaja.    According to the minister of power engineering there are  many  technical problems in Liepaja; however, international  organizations would support Lithuania's decision to build the  terminal there because the tendencies of Baltic integration are  especially welcomed. In any case the construction of the oil  terminal will start this spring, the minister of power  engineering maintained.</p>

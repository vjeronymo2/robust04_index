			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique </F> Cardoso by FOLHA's special correspondent Susi Aissa at his  Corrego da Ponte ranch in Burity, Minas Gerais State, on 1 April]    [Text] [Aissa] Do you have a government plan?    [Cardoso] I will not think about that until late April. Our  program is the economic plan that we will support to the end.    [Aissa] When will the people start to feel its effects?    [Cardoso] The economy will be stabilized by the second half  of the year. I have no doubt about that. Things have already  markedly changed.    [Aissa] Will you interfere with the implementation of the  economic plan?    [Cardoso] I will not interfere, but I will support it  publicly. This I will do.    [Aissa] Will you maintain contacts with the economic team?    [Cardoso] I will maintain frequent contact with the new  minister, at his request.    [Aissa] Some people contend that this is rather unethical,  since you are a presidential candidate.    [Cardoso] That is an insincere remark. Everyone knows it is  my plan, that I made it. I will continue to comment on it.  Yet, I no longer assume responsibility for any actions taken in  this respect. I will, however, assume responsibility for  supporting it.    [Aissa] Will you seek alliances with the PFL [Liberal Front  Party] and the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]?    [Cardoso] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is  taking care of that. Why would one seek alliances? To win. In  our electoral system, which envisages a run-off election,  everyone seeks alliances. It will not be the party leaderships  that will decide this, but individual voters who move from one  candidate to another. One party only needs to hold negotiations  with another that is different from it. If both parties are  equal, there is no need for negotiations. For instance, the PT  [Workers Party] is seeking an alliance with the PC do B  [Communist Party of Brazil], a truly obsolete party that still  advocates a dictatorship. Why is the PT doing this? Because it  needs votes.    [Aissa] Would you accept alliances with the PPR, or with the  PFL?    [Cardoso] I would accept alliances with them, with the PDT  [Democratic Labor Party], the PP [Popular Party], or the PT. I  would accept an alliance with the PT. It could happen that  neither I nor Lula [PT leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva] qualify  for the run-off election.    [Aissa] Would PSDB voters agree to your sharing a platform  with [Bahia Governor] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes?    [Cardoso] I have already shared a platform with Antonio  Carlos Magalhaes, and with Tancredo Neves, Lula, and many  others. To focus on that is to overlook the real issues. What  are the real issues? One's government program, who the  trustworthy people are, and with whom one is going to rule. I  would be very happy if the PT decides to enter into an alliance  to support me. I have my background, my history. No one could  say I am a rightist because I am not.    [Aissa] Who will finance your campaign?    [Cardoso] I still do not know. The subject is still being  discussed.    [Aissa] Would you accept a contribution from Odebrecht  [construction company]?    [Cardoso] Yes. As long as everything is done properly.</p>

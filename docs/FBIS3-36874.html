			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Viktor Sakhankov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk, 9 Feb -- A meeting took place today between  Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich and the republic's  industrialists. The prime minister acquinted the industrialists  with the protocol of the expert commission for the merger of the  monetary systems of Belarus and Russia. The prime minister said  that the statements by opponents of this action, in which it is  alleged that it runs counter to the republic's interests, are  unfounded. When the appropriate agreements between the heads of  the two governments are signed, Belarus will receive fuels at  prices which are identical to those paid by Russian consumers.  There will be no need for customs barriers and duties.    In the course of the three months after signing the  agreements, the changeover to payments of wages of those  employed in the budget-funded sphere in accordance with a single  wage network will be enacted in Belarus. It is intended to  carry out settlements between the banks of Belarus and Russia  via correspondent accounts, opened by commercial banks with one  another, or via accounts of the National bank of Belarus and the  Russian Central Bank. The protocol provides for a number of  jointly elaborated mechanisms and procedures for their  implementation during the difficult process of fully merging the  two states' monetary systems.</p>

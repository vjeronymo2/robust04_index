			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Kenya in crisis as opposition threatens to quit poll process KENYA WAS thrown into a political crisis last night as two opposition parties, alleging foul play by the government, threatened to pull out of the electoral process and international observers prepared to criticise strongly the conduct of the polls. Mr Mwai Kibaki, leader of the Democratic party, and Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, leader of Ford-Kenya, were meeting last night to consider calling the election null and void after what they alleged were 'widespread irregularities and vote-rigging' which they said were 'fast pushing the nation to war'. Both parties demanded, as a minimum, the suspension of counting and a re-run of what they said were spoiled polls in many constituencies. Mr Lee Kanyaro, spokesman for the DP, said the two parties had a list of demands to be met within 48 hours or they would withdraw from the electoral process. 'We do not believe in the results being released. It is a fraudulent election.' The 38-member Commonwealth observers' group was last night in emergency session considering whether the electoral abuses they had witnessed were sufficient grounds for declaring the polls neither free nor fair. Such a decision would weigh heavily with donor countries, which a year ago froze aid to Kenya pending political and economic reform. A continuing freeze of aid, which has so far cost Kenya Dollars 350m to Dollars 400m (Pounds 230m-Pounds 263m), would have a severe impact on an economy already hamstrung by a foreign exchange shortage. The moves came as it became apparent from provisional returns from 51 of 188 constituencies that President Daniel arap Moi and his Kanu party were heading for a victory. The prospect of a formal opposition protest, in effect endorsed by international observers, is certain to raise tensions in an already fraught political climate. Violence has marred the election campaign and the opposition parties have consistently warned that Mr Moi risked provoking violence if he manipulated the elections. At least two people have been killed and several injured in the past two days. A delay in releasing results from opposition strongholds such as Nairobi and several incidences where additional ballot papers appeared to have been slipped into bundles during counting underlined observer and opposition suspicions that officials were tampering with the result. Ford-Kenya alleged malpractices across the country while the DP said in a statement that it 'wants to put to question the integrity of Moi, the presiding and returning officers and indeed the validity and motivation of holding any elections at all. It is apparent that Moi is fast pushing this nation to war'. Divided opposition hands victory to Moi, Page 3 Editorial Comment, Page 10</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: ITC Classic seeks link with BAT unit ITC Classic Finance, the Indian financial services group, is seeking a partnership with Threadneedle Asset Management, a BAT subsidiary, in order to promote an asset management company in India. Mr Feroze Vevaina, an ITC Classic director, said the two companies had started discussing 'the various aspects of the proposed collaboration, including the participation in the equity capital of the asset management company to be formed. I think the collaboration will take a definite shape by the end of this year'. ITC Classic has been given permission by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to launch mutual funds. But, as Mr Vevaina pointed out, 'we need expertise and technology to design and operate close and open ended schemes. A tie-up with Threadneedle will take care of that'. Threadneedle has invested in Indian companies through its emerging markets fund. ITC Classic had tried to promote the asset management company in partnership with Peregrine of Hong Kong.</p>

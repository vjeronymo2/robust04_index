			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT CHIEF QUESTIONS 2 MINORITY PACTS  </P> <P> The chief of the city's Department of Airports has ordered a review of two  multimillion-dollar food service contracts whose partners include several  politically well-connected minority leaders, among them Los Angeles Urban  League President John Mack and church leader H. H. Brookins.  </P> <P> The review will center on whether concession agreements, awarded under a  program to increase participation of disadvantaged minorities and women in city  contracts, provide for the minority partners a clearly defined, hands-on role  in the running of the concessions. Such a role is required by both city and  federal government contract guidelines.  </P> <P> "We're asking what have they done, what are their plans for the future and how  have they met the (minority participation) objectives," said Clifton Moore, the  department's executive director.  </P> <P> The agreements are between the city and Host International Inc., a subsidiary  of the Marriott Corp., and eight minority partners. The contracts cover  operations of cafeterias and other food services at Los Angeles and Ontario  international airports. According to public records and interviews with Host  and others, the minority participants receive a share of the profits.  </P> <P> The business activity of the minority partners varies from attending board  meetings to recruiting employees, according to interviews with participants.  </P> <P> Mack said he does not spend a lot of time involved with the food service  concessions. He said it was management's responsibility to handle employee and  payroll matters. Brookins was not available for comment.  </P> <P> Evelyn Martinez-Zapata, another of the minority partners, said: "(Host) told us  they were looking for a group to advise their management committee. This was  not ever intended to be a hands-on type of management."  </P> <P> Airport Commissioner Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who has sought more minority and  women's participation in airport concession partnerships, said of the cafeteria  contract: "My idea is there needs to be hands-on participation. I think as part  of the deal (the minority partners) should actually be running the food  operation."  </P> <P> The move to review the food and beverage contracts at city-owned Los Angeles  International and Ontario airports comes after news reports this week about  contracts for gift shop concessions with other minority and women partners,  including the wife of House Ethics Committee Chairman Julian Dixon (D-Los  Angeles). Dixon, who has denied any improprieties, reported that his wife  collected at least $150,000 over the last two years for her participation in a  joint venture partnership with Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd. Partnership. Betty  Dixon acknowledged in an interview with The Times that she had limited  involvement in the operation and had invested no more than $15,000 in the  business.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Moore asked Duty Free for a written explanation of what functions  the minority partners perform in the gift shops and news concession operations.  Moore said that Betty Dixon's portrayal of her responsibilities in the airport  concessions does "not seem to be consistent" with the minority participation  program approved by the department.  </P> <P> As for the cafeteria concessions, The Times has learned that airport officials,  including Moore, had some reservations about the contracts involving the  minority partners even as the contracts were being renewed, without competitive  bidding, by the Airport Commission in 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> Eager to renew its food and beverage contracts at the two city-owned airports,  Host sought out women and minority partners to increase its chances.  </P> <P> Internal memos show that Barbara Williams, who heads the airport's minority  business program, began warning commissioners and managers at the time that  proposed contracts did not clearly define a business role for the minority  partners, as required by city and federal guidelines. Federal guidelines apply  because the airport received federal funds.  </P> <P> U.S. Transportation Department lawyer Robert Ashby told The Times on Thursday  that federal rules require minority participants to be more than passive  investors or merely attend board of directors meetings.  </P> <P> "The individual has to be there (on the job site) a fair amount of time, has to  talk to the people to whom jobs are delegated, has to be performing as what a  reasonable person would think a manager in touch with a business should be  doing," Ashby said.  </P> <P> The minority partners brought into the cafeteria contracts by Host include  Mack, a longtime supporter of Mayor Tom Bradley; Brookins, a politically active  bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church who helped launched Bradley's  career; Martinez-Zapata, a former aide to Bradley and fund-raiser for  Councilwoman Gloria Molina; and attorney and restaurateur Andy M. Camacho, a  close political ally of Councilman Richard Alatorre.  </P> <P> The other partners are: Ernest M. Camacho, a Pasadena businessman and brother  of Andy Camacho; Earl E. Gales Jr., a partner in Jenkins-Gales-Martinez Inc., a  Los Angeles architectural and engineering firm; Treva D. Metoyer, a Lynwood  businesswoman, and Luis C. Valenzuela, a real estate developer and fund-raiser  for Molina, Alatorre and other Eastside politicians.  </P> <P> In 1987, Host formed -- and the Airport Commission approved -- the first joint  venture to boost minority involvement in its $4.4-million-a-year concession  contract at the Ontario airport. That group involved all of the partners except  Brookins and Mack. The two men were added in 1988, when Host received  commission approval for a similar arrangement to share in $49 million in annual  cafeteria sales at Los Angeles airport.  </P> <P> According to airport records and interviews with Host and four of the eight  partners, the minorities were not required to put any cash into the venture.  They each received a varying share of the concession business and they are  guaranteed payments from the profits 13 times a year. These payments range from  $13,000 a year (to Mack) to more than $65,000 a year (to Brookins), according  to Host. The payments are expected to increase as sales rise. The concessions  at the two airports grossed more than $53 million last year.  </P> <P> The contracts provide for minority partners to get minimum payments or a  percentage of the profits, whichever is larger, according to Mack.  </P> <P> The minority partners attend quarterly management meetings primarily to listen  to reports by Host executives on the food concessions business and recruit  minority vendors and employees to Host, according to interviews and public  documents.  </P> <P> The time the partners have devoted to the business varies. Mack said that he  spends "maybe a couple of hours a month" on the business, attending meetings,  making phone calls and writing letters. "Clearly, it has not consumed an  inordinate amount of my time," he said.  </P> <P> Since Brookins moved to Washington last summer he has attended few management  meetings, two partners said.  </P> <P> However, Gales said he works up to 40 hours a month on the concession business,  mainly making telephone calls and recruiting potential employees.  </P> <P> The airport's Williams said she expressed her concerns about the lack of a  direct participation plan to her superiors as the Host contracts came up for  renewal. But Gary Netzer, the senior assistant city attorney in charge of  airports, said the degree of participation was a policy decision for the  Airport Commission to make.  </P> <P> Other airport managers, including Moore, maintained in interviews that they  shared some of Williams' concerns. Moore said the issue was "sort of a value  judgment" for the Airport Commission to decide.  </P> <P> Cochran said those concerns were never expressed to the commission.  </P> <P> One knowledgeable airport source, who asked not to be identified, said some  airport officials suppressed their concerns because of the "sensitivity" of  Anglo-led airport management criticizing a business arrangement designed to  increase minority participation.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the mayor's office said it also shares concerns that the  contracts lack meaningful minority participation and may not meet city  guidelines. "Somebody made a mistake," said Deputy Mayor Michael Gage, who  added that the minority partners should be involved in the concession  operations.  </P> <P> In its role as overseer of all city minority-contracting programs, the mayor's  office was making inquiries about the status of the contracts, records show.  One memo describes the office's concerns that it was not being kept fully  apprised. However, there is no indication that Bradley himself intervened in  any way.  </P> <P> Mack said he does not believe that hands-on involvement is necessary to learn  the business.  </P> <P> "I'm not hiring or firing anybody," Mack said. "I'm not doing the payroll. That  is what we have (Host) management to do. . . . It may not be the best approach,  but it is a beginning step in the direction of trying to correct some past  inequities."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Elizabeth Mann, Joel Sappell, Henry Weinstein and Robert  Welkos contributed to this report.  </P></p>

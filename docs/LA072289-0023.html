			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOORPARK MIRROR TO BE SOLD TO RIVAL PAPER  </P> <P> The Moorpark News weekly newspaper has tentatively agreed to purchase its  cross-town rival, the weekly Moorpark Mirror, for an undisclosed amount,  according to an announcement made Friday.  </P> <P> The News is jointly owned by two newspaper companies, Harris Enterprises and  John P. Scripps Newspapers. The Mirror is owned by its publisher, Daniel J.  Schmidt, who started the News in 1978 before selling it a year later. He  founded the Mirror in 1984.  </P> <P> The News claims that about 1,500 copies of its newspaper are sold weekly, and  it delivers an additional 1,000 free copies in an effort to spur new  subscriptions. The Mirror says it has about 500 paid subscribers and circulates  3,700 free copies. Moorpark's overall population is nearly 30,000.  </P> <P> Schmidt said there are still several details that need to be worked out before  the sale can be completed. For example, he said he wants the Mirror to continue  operating.  </P> <P> Debra W. Ryono, editor and publisher of the News, said the question of whether  the Mirror remains "is all open for discussion. Nothing is definite yet."  </P></p>

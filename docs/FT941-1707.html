			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Rival to Coke may go to Sainsbury A new cola brand which could revolutionise the Pounds 1.2bn retail market for carbonated drinks in the UK may be launched in May by J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery chain. Cott Corporation, the fast growing Canadian marketing and bottling company, said yesterday that it was at an advanced stage of negotiations with Sainsbury on a proposal to launch a 'sub-brand' which would incorporate both the Sainsbury logo and a new marque. Mr Simon Lester of Cott said the peak selling time for carbonated drinks was at the end of May. The group wanted any launch to be before that time. Over the past three years Cott has captured about 20 per cent of the Canadian cola market and 2 per cent of the US market through the launch of supermarket sub-brands. Its share price has increased 100-fold over the same period. Sainsbury would aim to produce a better quality cola than traditional supermarket brands and sell it for a higher price, although it would be cheaper than Coca Cola or Pepsi Cola, which are about Pounds 1 for two litres. Mr Lester said Sainsbury and Cott were considering a series of possible names for the new brand. They included variations of marques used by Cott in the US and Canada, such as Sam's American Choice, Select and President's Choice. Another possibility is Classic. Coca Cola's leading US brand is called Classic and the company said it would sue for breach of copyright if Sainsbury were to borrow any of its names or package the product in a way which was too close to its own packaging. Sainsbury refused to comment on the negotiations.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORE URGES COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT EFFORT  </P> <P> Saying that computer technology is a vital element of America's infrastructure,  Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) on Friday urged that the federal government  devote $1.75 billion over the next five years to make the nation a  "supercomputer superpower."  </P> <P> The proposal, introduced in new legislation, would establish a national data  network to make high-performance computers more accessible to researchers,  educators and businesses. At the same time, it would provide aid to the private  sector's efforts to develop supercomputer technology.  </P> <P> Likening the initiative to the federal effort more than 30 years ago to build  an interstate highway system, Gore said his plan would not involve  controversial efforts to pick "winners and losers" in American industry.  </P> <P> "This isn't industrial policy," he said in an interview. "This is  infrastructure."  </P></p>

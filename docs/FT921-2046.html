			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Major's best bet The Conservatives have not had a good week. There is one sure-fire argument in favour of re-electing them, and so far they have failed to get it across. Sure-fire? Sure. What would win the election for Mr John Major would be a general belief that Labour cannot be trusted - not on taxation, not with management of the market economy, and not on the ground of general competence. We have no need to spend long hours discussing whether this proposition is sound. To do so would be to engage in what Mr Christopher Patten, the Conservative party chairman, refers to when pursued with awkward questions as 'Socratic discourse'. Soundness is not the issue. What matters is what people perceive. Do floating voters in marginal constituencies think that Labour can be trusted, or do they not? The story of the first week of this election is that Labour has - so far successfully - positioned itself to be given the benefit of the doubt. It may have done so unfairly, or on specious grounds, but that is beside the point. Judgments of the nature of its methods will vary according to political taste. The unpalatable fact with which the Tories have to wrestle is that many uncommitted voters remain to be persuaded that Mr Neil Kinnock is a red-blooded wild and woolly socialist under that smart dark-blue suit. It may turn out to be difficult to win great numbers of non-Conservatives over to such a view. Even ministers fighting with the desperation born of fear of the loss of office will find it an uphill struggle. For the Tories have only three weeks in which to sell their inherently negative message. The opposition has spent three years burying its unmentionable past - or nine if you date the beginning of the turnaround from 1983, as some do. The precise year is not important. Mr Kinnock never had a chance of winning while memories of the abysmal performance of the Labour governments of 1974-79 were fresh. These unpalatable recollections are now stale; younger voters regard them as history. Labour has not merely waited for time and the leftist ascendancy over its affairs to pass. It has used its years with some skill. It has concentrated on making itself look unfrightening to voters. This has been its principal objective, to the exclusion of almost everything else. Policies the electorate found repellent have been abandoned. The language of one revisionist programme after another has been refined. The latest political broadcast conveys patriotism and conservative virtue. A formerly angry party whose historic roots are buried deep in the old unionised working class has dressed itself in the raiment of the middle classes. Mr Michael Foot's duffle coat has been hung up; in its place is the dress-code of senior management. Mr Patten and his colleagues have striven to tear Labour has positioned itself to be given the benefit of the doubt all this away, to reveal what they honestly believe to be the clumsy, grasping, egalitarian, tax-grabbing monster beneath. They made the attempt again yesterday morning, with an attack on the cunning budget presented by Mr John Smith on Monday. This, it was argued by the prime minister, the chancellor and the employment secretary, would increase taxation for the middle classes, and add to unemployment. That was not all. It was also incompetent. 'This is not just a mock budget,' said Mr Major, speaking election-ese, 'it's a mockery of a budget.' I asked Mr Patten whether this line of attack would continue. The reply was a robust affirmative. The manifesto issued by Labour on Wednesday would be fully costed. The message would be driven home. Yesterday was not, however the day for it. The unemployment figures and the news of the marital difficulties of the Duchess of York stole the headlines. Thus did fate conspire both to help the government by reducing the visibility of the unemployment statistics and simultaneously to hinder it by frustrating its assault on Labour. Yet concentrating fire on Mr Smith's tax plans, and by extension Labour's perceived untrustworthiness, is not an entirely hopeless endeavour. Monday's alternative budget redistributes large sums of money from high earners to everyone else; those high earners include the very London-based scribes and broadcasters whose task it is to disseminate what the participants in the election have to say. Thus there should be no difficulty about delivering the Conservative message, which is that more people than Labour thinks are turned away by the thought of a sudden 9 per cent impost on all earnings above Pounds 22,000 a year, let alone a further 10 per cent not all that much higher up the scale. There is therefore sense in the Patten strategy of working on potential Tory voters' natural mistrust of Labour - a mistrust that, in spite of Mr Kinnock's efforts, has been suppressed, not obliterated. If the Tories' knocking copy gathers strength from repetition, Mr Smith's achievement in selling his budget on Monday may turn out to be short-lived. In those circumstances the trend in the opinion polls, which has favoured Labour this week, would be reversed. Mr Major's mistake in getting himself into a position in which he was obliged to call an election in mid-recession would quickly be forgotten. Another, less happy, possibility exists. Labour's calculations of the number of gainers from its proto-budget may be accepted by most voters. Then every Tory mention of Labour's plans will be an advertisement for Labour. That happened with the National Health Service. The government's NHS policy is right, but it will never be believed and therefore it is aways tactically wrong to mention it. Taxation is a Tory issue, but on the polling evidence so far, exploiting it has not worked to the government's advantage. It had better start doing so soon, if Mr Major is to be saved.</p>

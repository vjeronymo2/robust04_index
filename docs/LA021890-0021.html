			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> GOING PLACES;  </P> <P> NOW IN MALIBU: MASTERS OF SUBJECTIVITY  </P> <P> 'As with every art, in photography the most important thing is that we feel  fully what we are doing," said Hungarian-born photographer Andre Kertesz,  describing the works he and his counterparts started producing just after World  War I. These experiments -- the photographer interjecting his own feelings into  the familiar -- would continue indefinitely under the rubric subjectivity. A  stunning collection of prints representing the genre, "Experimental  Photography: The New Subjectivity," is on display at The J. Paul Getty Museum,  joining the remarkable Greek and Roman antiquities, pre-20th-Century Western  European paintings, sculpture and decorative arts housed in the lovely  re-created 1st-century Roman country villa overlooking the Pacific.  </P> <P> Among the works: Kertesz's "Diver," Czechoslovakian Josef Sudek's "Late Roses,"  American expatriate Man Ray's "Cannes" and American W. Eugene Smith's "The  Wake," all of which capture the drama of a moment in a single powerful image.  </P> <P>  Through March 4, The J. Paul Getty Museum, 17985 Pacific Coast Highway,  Malibu; admission is free, but parking reservations are required, (213)  458-2003. MARGERY L. SCHWARTZ  </P></p>

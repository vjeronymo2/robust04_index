			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Jakarta jockeys for a stronger trading voice - Reform has won Indonesia more credibility in world forums ECONOMIC policy makers in Indonesia have developed an unnerving habit of listening in silence to advice from outside, then acting on it just as even the most friendly critics are starting to despair. Jakarta's successive trade reforms of recent years are a case in point. The World Bank and Gatt last year praised Indonesia for its efforts to free up its trade system but urged it to go further. Jakarta obliged: more cuts in import tariffs were announced, including those on the heavily-regulated palm oil industry, where export curbs were lifted. Indonesia has undertaken a series of trade reforms since the mid-1980s when plunging oil prices forced it to realise it would have to diversify its economy to survive. Oil and gas exports could no longer be depended on as its mainstays; domestic export-oriented industries would have to be encouraged, and cumbersome monopolies dismantled. Among the measures aimed at moving away from non-tariff barriers and at cutting and rationalising existing tariffs was the elimination in 1986 of import duties on components for re-export. The established system of export licences was scrapped a year later, and, the next year, non-tariff barriers were replaced by tariffs on more than 300 import products. In 1990, tariffs were cut on nearly 2,500 items, including components for the heavily-regulated pharmaceutical industry. Export controls on commodities including coffee were abolished, and licensing procedures for cattle breeding and fishing simplified. Last June, the government moved closer to its intention of shifting the tariff ceiling down to about 30 per cent, when it cut import tariffs on more than 500 products from beef to glass and steel. Non-tariff barriers on a quarter of the products protected by such barriers were replaced by some form of direct tariff protection. 'What they have done so far is brave,' says Ms Mary Pangestu, an economist at the government-backed Centre for Strategic and International Studies. But like other analysts, she urges further steps, and more transparent planning reform. 'The key is competitive domestic industry. That must be the goal.' Perhaps bravest of all, Indonesia sacked its customs staff in 1985 and hired the Swiss firm Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) as its agent for inspecting goods and assessing duties on imports and exports. But some anomalies still remain, along with areas where vested interests appear to have held back the government back. One of these was the 1990 decision to grant a consortium headed by President Suharto's youngest son the exclusive right to the international and domestic trade in cloves. Reports reaching Jakarta indicate the setting-up of the monopoly has resulted in substantial disruption to trade in the 80,000 tonnes of cloves produced annually in Indonesia. It has also led to a drop in income for farmers who were to be the main beneficiaries of the new system. The clove cigarette industry, one of Indonesia's biggest employers and the consumer of nearly all its clove output, is paying at least three times more for its clove supplies. Policy on products from Indonesia's tropical forests has also been questioned. Export of raw logs and raw and semi-processed rattan has been banned; a prohibitive tax on exports of sawn logs was imposed in 1989. The measures have attracted criticism, but the government has dug in its heels. Mr Sudradjad Djiwandono, junior minister for trade, says the bans and taxes are intended mainly to encourage development of domestic industries. The World Bank saw things differently. The rattan policy had 'reduced incomes of farmers in several outer island provinces,' while the sawn timber taxes had 'driven a number of small sawmills out of business.' A tendency to use surcharges in compensation for eliminating non-tariff barriers is widely considered to be inconsistent with Indonesian trade reform, as is the protection afforded to parts of the motor vehicle industry and large areas of farm output. Analysts say the allocation of quotas for the textile industry should be tidied up and the system made more transparent. Measures to help the developing economies of Indonesia's outer islands are also called for. Local-level regulations such as those on the movement of cattle or copra between provinces are believed to hinder economic activity outside Java. The Indonesian authorities acknowledge the system is not yet perfect. 'There are still many things that could be improved,' says Mr Djiwandono, but adds that the direction is clear. One of the effects of reform has been to give Indonesia more credibility in world trade forums such as Gatt, and a stronger voice in what Jakarta sees as the developing world's fight against the power of western trading blocs.</p>

The British Audit  Office may have indeed concluded that the Pergau Dam would not  be an economic proposition and should not be built. But it is  for Malaysians to decide. Malaysia has brilliant think tanks,  an effective parliamentary opposition, and a highly vocal  environmental lobby. The British certainly don't have any  special wisdom that has missed all of them. Nor should British  papers assume that concessionary loan arrangements in return for  purchase of warplanes and contracts for major development  projects are unusual. If such linkages are prohibited in  Britain, that is for the British Government to answer. It has  nothing to do with Malaysia. And there is simply no link  between these deals and the BMF [Bumiputera Finance] affair. In  fact, it says something about the British press that it has only  now discovered that scandal. Carrian [company] collapsed a  decade ago. All the BMF offences were committed in colonial  Hongkong. Most of the people involved remain in the British  colony's jurisdiction. London has seen it fit to grant Lorraine  Osman [former BMF official] residence in Britain after he served  a short sentence in a plea bargain deal. British newspapers  could still demand an accounting, if they are so inclined.  Britain could set up a full inquiry into the affair and  override colonial inhibitions. Instead, British papers dredge up  some old BMF stories and link it tenuously to the Pergau Dam  payments.    Truth to tell, the British newspapers have their own  political agenda: they want to bring down John Major and the  Tory government. The editors feel that the Conservatives have  been in power too long. Some of them also feel that Major's  government has been dishonest in telling them Britain would  never deal with terrorists while holding secret negotiations  with the Irish Republican Army. Mr. Major's Back-To-Basics  policy has also gone seriously awry. It was meant to distract  attention away from high unemployment and other economic woes.  The Tory right wanted to use it to punish single mothers and  others living off social welfare. Unfortunately, the British  press decided that Tory politicians should be held to the same  moral standards that they prescribe for others. The result was a  series of embarrassing disclosures for Mr. Major. The Pergau  Dam and the arms deal has become yet another bludgeon against  Mr. Major.    None of this would have bothered Malaysia except that in the  process the British papers began to attack Mahathir Mohamed  personally, without a shred of evidence. It was too much. But  a shutout of British firms from future government contracts is a  very blunt instrument of retaliation indeed. It punishes the  wrong people. More importantly, it dilutes the principles of  free trade and competition. On his part, Mr. Major should help  to limit the damage to British industry. Of course, he has no  control over the British press. He should, however, officially  disassociate his government from these scurrilous reports. It  may only be a simple symbolic act but it might help to break thc  impasse.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (8): Wheels within wheels - The region's lack of cohesion The West Midlands is a disparate area which exists as a region for the purposes of government administration rather than for any historical reasons. It has no distinct lobbying strength in Whitehall in the way that Scotland and Wales have, for instance, with their Cabinet representation; or even as the north-east of England has managed to put together in the past decade. The new government regional offices in England do not have a direct line to the Treasury, but must go through each of the relevant Whitehall departments when bidding in the public expenditure round. The West Midlands' cities - Birmingham and Coventry - and the urban and industrial mass of the Black Country have not been as successful as, say, Glasgow, Manchester and Sheffield in forcing the hand of government towards aiding their regeneration - no doubt because, until the mid-1970s, this was a much more successful area. In pushing for better transport and communications, the West Midlands has had little success. The road to relieve the congested M6 north of Birmingham is unlikely to come into being until the end of the decade. Birmingham and the Black Country are still without a good passenger transit system, and the area has yet to see the investment in the Inter-City rail line which would speed up services to London. Traffic at Birmingham airport is expanding, but the range of international destinations is considerably smaller than those from Manchester. In earlier years when efforts were being made to reduce dependence on manufacturing the appearance of Birmingham, strangled by roads, and shorn of the sort of buildings that were being smartened up elsewhere, could be seen as a liability. The city fathers, Labour and Conservative, have been successful in prising money out of Brussels to smarten up the city centre. Birmingham city council, with the biggest budget of any local authority, still sees itself as the powerhouse in the region, in spite of the erosion of local government responsibilities in favour of government-appointed quangos. But there is co-operation between the council and the quangos - and between Birmingham and the Black Country authorities on the one hand, and Birmingham and Coventry councils on the other. The pre-eminence of Birmingham as the centre for business services is undisputed. Other local councillors in the region may have resented the city's dominance in the past, but there is now a growing awareness of the need for the region to upgrade and compete more effectively in every sense, and for the different parts to complement each other. Except that it is not a region in any cohesive sense. Economic geographers saw the West Midlands as straddling the traditional north-south divide of Britain, with the south of the region relating more to the prosperous south of the country and the north having more in common with the industrial landscape of the north. The sharpness of the divide may have been alleviated by the impact of recession on the south-east and the regeneration of the north, but it still exists in the sense that the pressures to expand and develop are greater to the south than to the north. They have been intensified with the completion of the M40 and M42 motorway network which has made more attractive the areas to the south of Birmingham and Coventry. Meanwhile, the brake on development in the north of the region was consequent on the long delay in commissioning a relief road to the M6. The government's draft regional planning guidance on land use, issued in September 1994, is clear about the need for local authorities to steer development to the north and west of the region, and resist pressure from developers to take bites out of the green belt to the south. The so-called Middle Ring of towns - from WarwickLeamington through KidderminsterStourport, Telford, and round to Lichfield - have been on the receiving end of the flight from the metropolis. The aim is to develop not here, but in the inner areas of the depleted cities. Developers will be inclined to exert pressure on authorities to develop where they see the best return. Considerable subsidies will be needed to tempt them into the inner city, emphasising the need for urban authorities to produce schemes which will win a chunk of the government's Single Regeneration Budget for the region. Birmingham has recently won development area status, although the lobby was more from local government than local business, which was reluctant to be tagged with a label that indicates that the area is in dire need. Birmingham and area business chiefs have been working to boost the city within Europe in the past few years. But they have yet to constitute a powerful base akin to the business-based teams in some American cities, or even other parts of Britain, which have helped to improve the environment and attract newcomers. Business in in the region seems only recently to have become aware of the environment. In the 1960s, developers and architects, and a few leading companies, together with the city council, formed a convenient, informal coalition. The scene is now more complex. Many family-owned companies were swallowed up, or simply went out of business. Birmingham still has more head offices than any city outside London, but executive decisions on behalf of the big companies are made outside the city, and outside the country in some cases. Lobbying-power and influence lies more with a few individual business chiefs than with institutions. Parts of the shire counties have very different concerns from the built-up areas of the region. Isolation, rather than congestion, can be the problem here. The image conjured up by the West Midlands is the built-up mass which extends from Coventry to Wolverhampton - the only break being the bit of green belt between Birmingham and Coventry. But the region also includes rural areas of Herefordshire and Shropshire. The continuing exodus of young people, in search of work, is the concern here; whereas in the inner areas of Birmingham and Coventry a different sort of depopulation, of the economically active, has been going on for more than 20 years. At the official level, the reconciliation of the needs and demands of this diverse region lies not with any single elected body, but with a forum of local authorities which has no public profile, complemented by the equally low-profile government office which will be attempting to co-ordinate departments and convey to Whitehall its priorities for the region.</p>

The former will feature the Duke Ellington  Orchestra led by Mercer Ellington; David Benoit; Larry Carlton; Diane Schuur;  Andy Narell; Keiko Matsui; Airto and Flora Purim with Dave Valentin, and the  Timeless All Stars with Billy Childs, Billy Higgins, Bobby Hutcherson, Harold  Land, Julian Priester and Buster Williams.  </P> <P> The blues show will feature Stevie Ray Vaughan and Joe Cocker, with the rest of  the roster to be announced April 26. According to its producer, Darlene Chan,  the lineup will represent blues music from "traditional to pop rock."  </P> <P> Tickets for some of the shows, including the jazz festival and the Clapton and  Clay dates, already have gone on sale. Others go on sale today but only as part  of a subscription series (call (714) 646-0850 for information). The Pacific  will announce upcoming general sale dates and will be adding other performers  through the season.  </P> <P> The small number of contemporary rock acts in the current schedule only  reflects the tendency of those acts to book their tours later in the season,  Nederlander publicist Laura Gold said.  </P> <P> The lowest price this season for reserved orchestra seats is $24.75, compared  to $20.35 for some shows last year. The highest ticket prices this year are for  the Bolshoi Ballet, which tops out at $55, and the Sinatra show at $50.  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: St James's Place 17% ahead at Pounds 16.5m St James's Place Capital, the financial services group run by Lord Rothschild and Sir Mark Weinberg, turned in half-year pre-tax profits 17 per cent higher at Pounds 16.5m, against Pounds 14.1m. However, net assets per share showed a decline from 86.3p at the year-end to 84.1p, although this was an 8 per cent improvement from the 77.5p of a year ago. In volatile market conditions, profits from dealing in investments jumped from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 10.6m, reflecting the group's management of its short-term investments. However, profits of Pounds 9.7m from the holding portfolio of investments, the group's longer-term play, were turned into losses of Pounds 2.2m as the market indices turned down. Fund management income more than tripled to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 1m). In the life assurance business, Scottish Amicable has taken over the administration of J Rothschild International Assurance. The group said that it was 'actively seeking further marketing arrangements with banks and other institutions' in a number of countries. Plans to set up a new venture to buy and manage life assurance companies, announced in September, were being advanced. SJPC is putting up some Pounds 30m of the Pounds 100m capital fund for Life Assurance Holding Corporation, with a further Pounds 40m coming from New York Life and Scottish Amicable. The remainder is being sought from other institutions. Mr Ron Bell, chief accountant, said that with the volatility and uncertainty surrounding the world's bond and equity markets, the company preferred to concentrate its investments on specific companies rather than exposure to markets in general. Earnings per share fell 27 per cent to 4.3p (5.9p). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Washington's findings leave Tokyo officials dismayed Japanese officials were yesterday dismayed at the US finding that Japan has violated agreements to open up its cellular phone market, Michiyo Nakamoto writes. Mr Takenori Kanzaki, minister of posts and telecommunications, denied the US allegation that Japan had failed to live up to its promise to increase market access for cellular phones and equipment made by Motorola. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, concluded on Tuesday that Japan had breached agreements to give comparable market access to a North American cellular phone system known as TACS. Motorola, the US company, sells equipment and handsets in Japan based on the TACS system. Mr Kanzaki said that the Japanese government is sincerely complying with the accord, and called the action by the US 'one-sided'. 'The Japanese government has done what it is our duty to do. We believe the North American mobile phone business is being actively promoted,' he said.</p>

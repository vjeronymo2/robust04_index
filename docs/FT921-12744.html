			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Mortgage rescue scheme launched by Nationwide NATIONWIDE, the second-largest UK building society, launched the first stage yesterday of a Pounds 150m mortgage rescue scheme to save 3,000 home owners from losing their homes. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, Nationwide's chief executive, said: 'We believe it should be possible to find a solution for every borrower who is in the 'can't pay' category.' It is the first of a series of rescue measures from lenders who promised the government they would put up Pounds 1bn to halve the 80,000 mortgage repossessions that otherwise appeared inevitable this year. The first stage of Nationwide's scheme is an Pounds 8m agreement with three housing associations: London &amp; Quadrant, Notting Hill Housing Trust and Newlon Housing. The associations will buy 100 homes in the London area, enabling their owners to stay as tenants. Rents will be substantially lower than mortgage interest payments, at between 3.5 per cent and 8 per cent a year of the value of the house. Mr Melville-Ross said rents in London would be closer to the lower figure, although they would be 15 per cent higher than normal housing association rents. Separate valuations will be carried out by the housing associations and Nationwide, and borrowers will have their arrears wiped out only if they stay with the scheme for three years. Each rescue operation will run for an initial five-year period, which can be extended to 20 years. About 12 other building societies are negotiating with nearly two dozen housing associations and they are expected to announce similar schemes in the next few months. Nationwide is also negotiating a scheme with local authorities in which borrowers and their families stay in their homes while the local authority pays Nationwide a sum equivalent to the cost of bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, welcomed the initiatives, saying he expected them to be the first of many.</p>

The various attitudes to the meeting depended on  where one stood. Generally the Arab media welcomed and supported  the meeting, regarding it as an incomparable achievement in the  development of Syrian-U.S. ties, the issues under discussions,  and the Syrian- Zionist negotiations.    It is clear that the Geneva meeting laid the foundations of  better ties between the United States and Syria. Their interest  in promoting bilateral ties was clearly demonstrated by the  instructions given to the two countries' foreign ministers to  handle unresolved issues between them in a detailed and open  manner, as Clinton put it.    Syria's regional role in a political settlement was  recognized, in Clinton's own words. Clinton said: There will  be no comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless he (Hafiz  al-Asad) is willing to assume a leading role. The Syrians  maintained that they elicited an acknowledgement, spelled out by  Clinton, of certain points that had been disputed for some time.  These included the following: The Americans committed  themselves to a "full peace plan" based on UN Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338 and on the land-for-peace principle,  which practically means accepting the Syrian viewpoint on the  negotiations.    The Syrians are seeking to draw up an agreement that would  enable them to avoid normalization entailing diplomatic, trade,  and cultural ties. They have bolstered their position by  pointing to several examples, including the failure of a similar  agreement with Egypt--the Egyptian regime failed to fulfill its  normalization commitments despite numerous attempts because the  Egyptian public was strongly against normalization. The Syrians  also explained that their country's special situation cannot  tolerate normalization.    The speech that President al-Asad made in Geneva included a  clear remark about this: "Hundreds of thousands have sacrificed  their lives to defend the homeland and uphold its rights.  There's hardly a house in Syria that did not offer a martyr who  fell in the defense of the Arab nation and its rights."    It was as if al-Asad was saying a river of blood exists in  Syria, in addition to the Euphrates, over which one cannot  easily jump.    If the Syrians succeed in their effort to draw up a new  formula for a solution with the Zionist entity, we will have two  types of settlements in the region: one that opens the doors  wide for all forms of relations and alliances and another that  ends the state of war but keeps all doors closed. This latter  type will allow many regional countries to adopt the Syrian  concept of a political settlement. Meanwhile, the Zionists and  Americans are trying to open all Arab doors to all forms of  normalization. To the Zionist entity normalization is a primary  condition and on its basis the "Camp David" accord, the  "Gaza-Jericho" agreement, the draft agreement with the  Jordanians, and the 17 May Accord [of 1983 with Lebanon, later  abrogated] were concluded.    The ongoing negotiations with many Arab countries  presuppose acceptance of the Zionist entity's concept of a  settlement. Acting according to the Syrian concept of a  settlement will damage, even if relatively, the Zionist plans in  the region and relations with some Arab countries and will delay  some of the normalization plans for years to come. This might  lay the basis for developments and events that do not serve the  U.S.-Zionist hegemony plan. It also explains the U.S. and  Zionist insistence on normalization.    This became evident in the speech that former U.S. President  Bush delivered at the Madrid conference, when he stressed that  the U.S. concept of a settlement is based on diplomatic,  economic, cultural, media, tourism, and development relations.  The enemy's prime minister followed him in stressing this  concept. This explains the relatively cool reaction in  Palestine to the Geneva summit and the Israelis' demand to hear  the Syrian president's unequivocal support for normalization.  The word "peace" voiced by the Syrian president in Geneva is  not enough.    This means (despite the strong optimism about the  possibility  of reaching quick results from the negotiations) that it is  difficult to accept the Syrian concept of a settlement despite  the tottering of the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement and the dependence  of the Jordanian and Lebanese signatures on the Syrian one.  Yet, according to observers' expectations, these rounds of  negotiations should result in a solution to the problem.  Lebanon is the major absentee, despite the utterances of joy  and delight expressed by officials through the media. The U.S.  President, who was keen not to leave the mistaken impression of  being against President al-Asad, who agreed with his concept of  "peace" and "Lebanon's future," did not want to touch on many  issues. He made it clear in his speech that Lebanon has no  place in the U.S. Administration's thinking. Overall U.S.  practices and the way it is handling the Middle East problem and  the negotiations indicate that this is the case.    President al-Asad's reference to Resolution 425 does not  change the picture at all. This is another stigma added to the  Lebanese regime's black record. This regime appears to have  undertaken the task of going down with the same speed that the  resistance in Lebanon is rising. The brighter the resistance  and the mujahidin become and the more they light the nation's  path, the more the regime gets immersed in the darkened dens of  vice, as if this regime's men without hesitation yielded to the  power of the Jews and their masters who are imposing their  hegemony on many ruling regimes in the world. They have  accepted this new master as their god to pray to and entreat.  They are accompanied in this by a vociferous media that is in  control of the masses and is bewitching many to the extent that  one starts to believe that apostasy is going to live forever and  that Islam, the resistance men, and all the honest people are on  their way out.    We would like here to recall the firm and decisive divine  pledge that was mentioned in the Holy Koran and the Prophet's  traditions, which emphasizes that the battle between Muslims and  Jews is continuing, that there is no peace and no conciliation  [la salam wa la sulh] with them, that the charters and treaties  will not live, and that the mujahidin will enter (the temple, as  they entered it before, and to visit with destruction all that  fell into their power) [Koranic verse].</p>

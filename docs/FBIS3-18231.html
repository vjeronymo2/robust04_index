			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mario Segni, Pact for Italy </F> leader, by Mauro Anselmo; place and date not given: "Mariotto:  `I Shall Not Stop, I Am David Against Goliath'"]    [Text] [Anselmo] Deputy Segni, how has this happened? The  Pact for Italy cannot get its candidates presented?    [Segni] I heard 10 minutes ago; yours is the first phone  call  that I have received. It all strikes me as absurd, and I feel  very embittered. But anger will not blind me. We shall go  ahead and fight.    [Anselmo] It all strikes you as absurd? First, the Pact for  Italy, your pact, was unable to collect enough signatures for  the proportional list in eight constituencies. Then, yesterday  evening, the final blow: The Court of Appeals in Rome has  rejected your whole list of candidates for the Lazio region. Is  this not a knockout?    [Segni] I will not allow you to use that term. We are alive  and well, and I assure you we have a great will to fight. Of  course, things have been happening that I did not expect,  baffling things that leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Mistakes  have been made? We shall appeal. The Court of Appeal will  think again; these mishaps will not stop us.    [Anselmo] You talk about "mishaps." Do you think there is  political maneuvering against you?    [Segni] It is too early to tell, but I know one thing for  sure: In this campaign we are David challenging Goliath. We are  the ones with clean faces. You see, we do not have the old  parties to back us, we do not have the billions, the support of  the public and private television corporations, we cannot set  the bureaucratic machinery of the system in motion. We are new.  Do you know what that means? To put it in a nutshell, we have  no godfathers, and we work on our own.    [Anselmo] But a movement running for government cannot let  itself be excluded from the Senate list in a region like  Lazio....    [Segni] I would not overdramatize the situation. As far as  Lazio is concerned, I believe there is a formal flaw that can be  put right on appeal. The main thing is not to get into a flap.  Our political proposals are good ones, and we cannot, now of  all times, let ourselves be thrown by obstacles that, from  certain points of view, were perhaps even foreseeable.    [Anselmo] Why were they foreseeable?    [Segni] I told you: Because the Pact for Italy is made up of  volunteers and is not a party like the others, which have an  organizational network covering the whole country. No need to  worry there: They make no mistakes; their bureaucrats have 40  years' training.    [Anselmo] But what happened in Lazio? Were mistakes made,  were there irregularities in the collection of the signatures?    [Segni] I am waiting to hear the reasons given by the Court  of Appeals. But the situation in itself strikes me as strange,  very strange. To be quite honest, I cannot think of an  explanation.    [Anselmo] How ever did you fail to collect enough signatures  for the proportional list in eight out of the 26 constituencies?    [Segni] The reason is very simple: Because in some regions  our friends did not make it.    [Anselmo] Not because you had taken too long to draw up the  lists and to agree on the names?    [Segni] In some cases 2,000 signatures had to be collected  in  two days.    [Anselmo] But could you not have started earlier?    [Segni] The delay in drawing up the lists undoubtedly had a  detrimental effect, but there was another factor that placed a  great handicap on us as well.    [Anselmo] What was that?    [Segni] The present electoral system, which has kept the  proportional element alive, preserving the parties with their  rules, their alchemistic practices, their wrangling over places  and seats.    [Anselmo] But Deputy Segni, were you not the champion of the  referenda, the man who collected the signatures that launched  institutional reform? How can you, of all people, fall down now  on this very terrain?    [Segni] Because David is not as big, powerful, and organized  as Goliath.    [Anselmo] You had launched the battle cry of a million  signatures before the election. How many have you collected?    [Segni] As of now, I am not in a position to tell you, but  the figure is very high.    [Anselmo] Deputy Segni, what will you do tomorrow?    [Segni] I have worked hard to build up this political  prospect for Italy and I am here, like David, waiting for the  giant with my sling.    [Anselmo] What giant?    [Segni] The Right, which is trying to hold the League and  the  fascists together, and the left, which, with the Communist  Renewal party, is presenting itself with its usual mask.</p>

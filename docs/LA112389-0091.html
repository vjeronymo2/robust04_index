Voting will take place Monday, De  La Rosa said.  </P> <P> For the last three years, seniors have gone to Disneyland for their Grad Nite  party, but attendence has declined, De La Rosa said.  </P> <P> Because students will be choosing their activity this year, De La Rosa said she  hopes more will attend.  </P> <P> "The more in attendance, the (fewer who) will be out in the streets being  exposed to alcohol," she said.  </P> <P> Committee members are concentrating on reducing the costs for the seniors by  sponsoring car washes and raffles as fund-raisers.  </P> <P> The next committee meeting will be Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. at Marie Callender's,  518 W. Las Tunas Drive, San Gabriel.  </P> <P> Interested parents can call (818) 308-2356 or (818) 284-8509 for information.  Luz Villarreal  </P></p>

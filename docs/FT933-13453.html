			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / T&amp;N cited as latest suitor for Lucas T&amp;N, the British motor components and engineering group, is understood to have approached Lucas Industries to discuss a possible friendly link-up, but it has been rebuffed by the aerospace and motor components manufacturer. T&amp;N declined to comment yesterday on suggestions that it was seeking an agreed merger with Lucas. Mr Mark Herbert, corporate communications manager at Lucas, described the reports as 'rumour and speculation'. Takeover speculation concerning Lucas has been rife for some time. Earlier this year BTR, the industrial group, was strongly rumoured to be interested in acquiring the company. More recently Siemens, the German engineering and electronics company, has been cited as the most likely bidder. A merger of T&amp;N and Lucas would create a group with sales in excess of Pounds 4bn. T&amp;N is thought to have expanded an original plan which intended a merger of its brake-linings business with that of Lucas. Lucas is seen by many in the City as lacking strong management. It has failed to appoint a new chief executive, despite a lengthy search, and a new non-executive chairman to succeed Sir Anthony Gill, who is scheduled to step down in October. Another demoralising factor has been its poor profits performance. In March it announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.2m on turnover of Pounds 1.29bn for the six months to the end of January.</p>

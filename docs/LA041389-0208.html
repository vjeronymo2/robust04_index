Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> DUPER CLEARED, REINSTATED BY MIAMI  </P> <P> Investigations by the Miami Dolphins and the NFL into allegations involving  Mark Duper uncovered no wrongdoing, and the wide receiver has been reinstated  and will report to camp next week, Coach Don Shula said.  </P> <P> Duper was suspended last season for violating the league's substance abuse  policy.

The investigations by security officials  from the team and the NFL have been concluded, Shula said.  </P> <P> Duper plans to report next week for off-season workouts. Because of his 30-day  suspension last Nov. 30, he will be subject to random drug testing.  </P></p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Eco-label still not sticking - The EC's green badge scheme is in disarray Next month, the EC Commission launches its eco-labelling scheme without a single product displaying the much-awaited badge of environmental approval. The Commission's original intention was to have at least five labelled products in the shops before the launch. Instead, the scheme is in disarray. Some countries such as Ireland and Portugal have failed to set up the necessary organisations to administer the label. Others like France and the Netherlands appear to be developing national schemes in preference to the EC's. Some manufacturers are threatening a boycott and environmental groups complain that their views have been suppressed in favour of industry's. 'Anyone can punch holes in the scheme. The really hard task is to find solutions and not just look for problems,' says Julia Hailes, the environmental consultant on the UK Eco-labelling board. Each country was supposed to set up a national board to organise and administer the label. The UK board is known to be critical of the Commission's level of commitment to the scheme. The idea of an EC-wide scheme was developed in the late 1980s in response to consumer pressure for an official stamp of approval on goods with a reduced impact on the environment. 'We have suppliers who are trying to reduce this impact and want to tell our customers about it,' says Alan Knight, environmental co-ordinator at B&amp;Q, the UK do-it-yourself chain. 'But because most of our customers won't believe environmental claims made by manufacturers, an official eco-label is the best solution,' he says. Experience with environmental labels in Germany, Canada and the Nordic countries showed that manufacturers could gain market share and possibly charge more for approved goods. The EC hoped its label would satisfy demands from consumers and encourage industry to improve its environmental performance. But the scheme ran into trouble. Methods for judging products were inadequate and created disagreements within industry and between environmental groups and manufacturers. At one stage, it was decided that paper products with high proportions of recycled material would be favoured at the expense of those made with virgin pulp. This upset pulp suppliers who argued that recycling paper was not necessarily the best environmental option. Recently, environmental groups have begun to press for the exclusion of products tested on animals. They say this must be a criterion but the label's administrators say animal testing is covered by other EC laws. The Body Shop, a maker of personal care products which campaigns against animal testing, has threatened to boycott the scheme unless animal testing is included in the criteria. The confusion and delay has disillusioned some manufacturers. Electrolux and AEG will continue to support the scheme and apply for labels, but Hoover is concerned that environmentalists are gaining too much say. Hoover might not apply for a label for its washing machines. Bosch is undecided. The European Lighting Council has withdrawn from the negotiations to establish a label for light bulbs. Manufacturers are also dismayed at the amount of red tape the scheme has encouraged. Details on the only product category so far to get the official nod - dishwashers and washing machines - have yet to be published in the EC's Official Journal. Publication is about three months behind schedule because the various Brussels departments are taking so long to process the paperwork. 'The one good thing is that the scheme has at least encouraged manufacturers to pay attention to environmental issues and improve their products. This is good for the environment, even if they decide not to apply for a label,' says Hailes.</p>

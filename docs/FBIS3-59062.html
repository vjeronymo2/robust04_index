			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "df": "IG Metall: Dramatic Situation in the </F> German Automobile Industry"]    [Text] In the middle of negotiations on wages in the steel  industry, Klaus Zwickel, first chairman of IG Metall  [steelworkers' trade union], has described the situation in the  German automobile industry as "dramatic." In 1992, the EC  posted a record 14 million registrations of new automobiles and  light goods vehicles; the corresponding figures for the United  States and Japan were 10 million and 5 million. West Europe is  still the largest automobile market in the world. In 1993,  however, demand decreased by 16 percent and by as much as 20  percent in Germany. German automakers sales and output have  declined accordingly. "In the best event, a stabilization of  the situation is conceivable in 1994, but it seems more likely  that there will be a slight decline in sales."    All the mistakes that were made in company policy in the  1980's have now appeared and all the omissions of the boom  period must now be dealt with at "top speed." The necessary  reorganization of the automobile industry is, however,  encountering obstacles due to excessive production capacity.  Excessive hopes regarding a growing market and greater market  shares led to the construction of more and more plants. It is  estimated that at the present time, at least 15 million  automobiles can be built in Europe, but only 11.5 million were  manufactured in 1993. Thus, plants are only operating at 75  percent of capacity. Operating at that level of capacity, most  enterprises can no longer function profitably.    Zwickel: "If this problem of overcapacity is not solved, the  European autmobile industry will enter a merciless and hopeless  price war," the kind of situation that could recently be  observed in the Japanese automobile market. European  manufacturers are already trying to outdo each other with price  reductions, both directly and through maintaining prices at  their present level, but offering better extras. If production  capacity continues to grow, from FIAT in southern Italy to  Toyota in northern England, programs aimed at reducing costs and  the temporary closure of plants will not help at all.    In this kind of situation, economic policy in combination  with industry will have to end this hopeless situation. Zwickel  has called for a round of negotiations involving the government,  the automobile industry, and IG Metall to at least find a clear  definition of the problems. In addition, a gradual  organizational reform of company structures will be necessary,  one that will entail "employment policy safeguards," an  accelerated approach to product innovation, stronger links  between manufacturers and their suppliers in the form of  partnership, support for research and cooperation in research,  as well as safeguards at the regional policy level for crisis  situations.</p>

			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / Competition review clears detergent makers THE OFFICE of Fair Trading said yesterday it had decided not to ask the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to investigate competition in the laundry detergents market. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, said he had seriously considered the case for a monopoly reference. He had decided against it after a review by the OFT found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour by Procter &amp; Gamble of the US and Lever Brothers of the UK, which dominate the business. Sir Bryan said he would continue to watch out for evidence that P&amp;G and Lever Brothers were abusing their market power. The two companies account for about 90 per cent of laundry detergent sales, worth more than Pounds 800m a year. Sir Bryan said detailed financial information provided by the companies did not show that price competition was ineffective and he was encouraged by recent improvements in productivity. The OFT has monitored the detergents market since 1981 when P&amp;G and Lever Brothers, part of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, were released from undertakings imposed after an MMC investigation in 1966. The OFT launched a more detailed review almost two years ago, prompted by a sharp rise in the two companies' advertising expenditure. According to Register-MEAL, a market research company, total advertising spending on laundry detergents rose to Pounds 69m last year from Pounds 12m in 1982, with a particularly sharp increase in the past five years. Sir Bryan said he had been concerned that high levels of advertising spending might prevent new competitors from entering the market. He had noted the companies' argument that the spending was needed to support a faster rate of product innovation. Sir Bryan said: 'At the present time, competition between Procter &amp; Gamble and Lever Brothers appears to be active, and there is also competition from retailer own-label brands.' The announcement was welcomed by the companies, which had argued that competition between them had intensified recently due to heavy investment in research and production equipment to expand and modernise their product ranges. The OFT yesterday accepted undertakings from Anthony Green &amp; Co and Lavery Rowe, its advertising agency, that they would stop publishing misleading advertisements for depilatory products. The action followed a complaint by the Advertising Standards Authority, which had sought unsuccessfully to get the companies to drop from their advertisements claims that the products retarded the re-growth of hair. The OFT said it would consider court action against advertisers making misleading claims.</p>

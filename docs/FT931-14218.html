			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Carlton and LWT set up joint venture Carlton Television and London Weekend Television have set up a separate television sales company to attract continental European advertising.

The new venture, London Television European Sales, said that the London area accounts for 47 per cent of UK mineral water consumption, 44 per cent of UK charge cards, 37 per cent of UK businessmen and 25 per cent of the UK retail outlet total of 30,000.

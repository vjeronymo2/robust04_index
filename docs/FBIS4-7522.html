			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P. Livajic: "Drazen Budisa on the HSLS Podium"] </F>   [Excerpt] "The documents which have been signed on the  federation of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina are of  historical significance and represent a turning point in the  difficult times in which the two peoples are living. l cannot  conceal my satisfaction at the fact that this is the  implementation of a policy which the Croatian Social Liberal  Alliance [HSLS], in contrast to the ruling party, has supported  from the very beginning, because this is the concept which will  make possible the existence of our neighboring state and thereby  the reintegration of occupied territories into Croatia," Drazen  Budisa, president of the HSLS, said in a public speech in Omis  [a coastal town south of Split]. He stressed his reservations  regarding the possible confederal agreement between Croatia and  the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, warning that only integral  states can make agreements on confederal alliances.    "If no significant changes are made to establish the legal  order of the Croatian state in the occupied areas, the HSLS will  oppose the scheduling of a referendum on creating the confederal  alliance," Budisa stressed, stating his opinion that the best  solution for all the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be that  it remain a federal state of three peoples with equal rights and  with good links to Croatia but also to Serbia.

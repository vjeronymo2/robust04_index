			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Takeshi Ishigooka] </F>   [Text] Alamaty (Kazakhstan), 1 Apr -- Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev granted an interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN on  1 April and spoke about his expectations of his upcoming visit  to Japan, which is scheduled to start on 6 April, as well as  about his appeals concerning the disasters caused by nuclear  exposure at the Semipalantinsk nuclear testing center and the  serious environmental destruction caused by the continued drying  up of the Aral Sea.    According to the president, 527 nuclear tests have been  conducted at Semipalantinsk since 1949, and there are about half  a million nuclear exposure victims. Even now, many cases of  diseases or deaths caused by nuclear exposure are reported  continuously, and psychological damage such as fear among  pregnant women has continued.    However, the facts about the scale and frequency of nuclear  tests have been veiled in secrecy. There are many unsolved  questions, including the future effects of plutonium which has  been stored in the earth.    The president severely criticized nuclear tests in the area  of Semipalantinsk as "criminal acts committed by the [former]  Soviet Union." On the other hand, he expressed the hope that  Japan, which experienced atomic bombings at Hiroshima and  Nagasaki, will cooperate with his country in the work to aid  nuclear test victims.    The environmental destruction of the Aral Sea began in the  1960's. Currently, three-quarters of the lake have dried up,  and many residents have been left in the desert. Moreover,  because a huge amount of salt has emerged on the surface in this  area, there is a possibility that this will greatly affect the  earth as a whole. The president, who has proposed an  international conference on the Aral Sea issue, called for  Japan's positive participation.    Touching on his idea of creating a Eurasian union, the  president pointed out: "More than 300 mutual agreements have  been adopted since the inauguration of the CIS. No practical  results have been achieved, however." In stating his criticism,  the president added, "Some CIS members have rejected some of  these agreements and have interpreted the concepts of agreements  according to their own interests." He stated that in following  the good example of the European Union (EU), a new union should  be formed composed of only those states which are determined to  abide by all the mutual agreements, while the system of  admitting quasimembers should be abolished.</p>

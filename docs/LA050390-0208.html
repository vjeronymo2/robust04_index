The tower crashed to the ground,  pinning Sergio's leg, she said.  </P> <P> Chambers said Sergio suffered serious burns. Doctors were attempting to  determine the extent of injuries to his vital organs. At UCI, doctors were  conducting similar tests on Caesar Olguin and Mangana, who both suffered  second- and third-degree burns.  </P> <P> Antonio Olguin, the father of Sergio and Caesar Olguin, did not have a permit  for the antenna the young men were trying to install, fire officials said. He  had planned to set up a citizens band radio to use in his towing business, Ana  Olguin said.DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Lawyer with a case for equality MS KAMLESH BAHL, who from next week begins a three-year stint chairing the Equal Opportunities Commission, has had more direct and shocking experience of discrimination than any of her predecessors is likely to have known. In her first two years at Birmingham University she was top of her law class and in finals she finished third. Yet when it came to looking for articles, it took 250 applications to get one offer - from the Greater London Council. 'It was the first time I had come across discrimination,' she says. It was a revelation . . . most other people got articles - I stuck out like a sore thumb because I was about the only one who didn't. 'If you have the merit and the ability, you should be given the opportunity. That was what I was denied at that point in my life.' The appointment of Nairobi-born Ms Bahl, aged 36, to the Pounds 30,000-a-year, three-day-a-week job, was unexpected. She is not a well-known face in the sex equality world and her greatest claim to popular fame until now has probably been as the model for Usha Gupta, the Asian lawyer in the Archers on Radio 4. Ms Bahl's success in getting the job followed the kind of procedure she would advocate for giving merit and ability an equal chance. For the first time the government advertised the vacancy and she competed with 80 others. One of Ms Bahl's strengths was perceived to be her varied career. After working at the GLC she moved to British Steel and then to Texaco, where she specialised in commercial and employment law. At the time of her appointment to the commission, she was company secretary and manager of legal services at Data Logic, the computing services company. She is also a member of the Law Society's ruling council, and sits on its race relations committee. Her experience of implementing equal opportunity policies began at Texaco, where, she says, the company was threatened by a potential equal pay case. 'That brought home to the organisation how it could be exposed in an industrial tribunal - its practices for job evaluation, its practices for rewarding individuals, the way it analysed jobs, could all be exposed in a public arena. In a business environment, the last thing you want is to wash your linen in public.' As a result, the whole organisation received training on equality issues, starting with the chairman and members of the board. As far as the future of the commission is concerned, Ms Bahl speaks the language of the lawyer and the commercial manager, rather than the social reformer. Meetings with Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary, have been 'positive'. The commission's legal and political independence, she says, must remain sacrosanct. She also points out that even if the government is unenthusiastic about commission proposals on, for example, childcare, pensions and reform of discrimination laws, goals in these areas must remain long-term. Strategies will need to be drawn up to make the best use of resources. Her immediate priority will have to be how to stretch the commission's Pounds 6m budget to cover the vast increase in public demand for its advice and services.</p>

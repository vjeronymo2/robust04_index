			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UN settles for damage limitation in Somalia UNITED NATIONS' diplomats struggling to conjure a new policy for Somalia are only certain of two things: they cannot afford any more deaths among peacekeeping troops and they must find ways of blocking the departure of the all-important US contingent. Mr Kofi Annan, the UN chief of peacekeeping operations, was unable yesterday to clarify the UN's aims in Somalia, in particular how it intended to deal with the defiant warlord, Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed. At a press conference in Mogadishu, he left the impression that the 30,000-strong military intervention in Somalia had become an exercise in damage limitation. 'The level of fatalities is unsustainable and unacceptable,' Mr Annan said of the 70 Blue Helmets who have been killed in Mogadishu since June. 'When governments begin to take casualties, the public outcry is difficult for politicians and leaders to handle. We were not prepared, we did not expect to encounter this level of violence.' It was apparent that the UN was searching for formulas to scale down the confrontation with the rebel warlord. Plans to put Gen Aideed on trial for war crimes have been abandoned. Instead, Mr Annan talked of having 'some sort of judicial process' that would investigate Gen Aideed's responsibility for the killings of UN soldiers in his south Mogadishu fiefdom. Gen Aideed is unlikely to be pursued while he continues to hold a US helicopter pilot and a Nigerian soldier captive. Washington, with its history of hostage traumas, is suggesting an 'independent inquiry' into the Mogadishu killings. Many Somalis now believe that if Gen Aideed plays his hostage card correctly, he will probably escape the rigours of a UN trial altogether. Gen Aideed's unilateral ceasefire, which has given Mogadishu a few precious days of peace, was briefly broken yesterday by an attack on a UN food convoy guarded by Saudi troops. Some food was looted, but there were no reports of casualties. Mr Annan said President Bill Clinton's decision to pull out US troops from Somalia in six months' time would 'weaken the UN operation considerably, if not unravel it altogether.' The timetable for withdrawal gives the UN little time to replace the largest single contingent in Mogadishu with troops from other countries. Mr Annan implied that it would be difficult to match US expertise in logistics and air surveillance.</p>

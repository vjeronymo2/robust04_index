Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> QUAYLE NAMES NASA PROBE PANEL  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle announced the selection today of 11 members of a  special panel that will study the future of the trouble-plagued National  Aeronautics and Space Administration -- many of them with business links to the  space agency.  </P> <P> The members of the Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program  were selected "on the joint recommendation" of NASA Administrator Richard Truly  and Norman Augustine, who was named earlier to head the panel.  </P> <P> Augustine's selection July 25 to lead the review generated questions about the  impartiality of the committee. Augustine is chairman of Martin Marietta Corp.,  a major NASA contractor. Several members named today also are linked to  corporations that do business with the space agency.  </P></p>

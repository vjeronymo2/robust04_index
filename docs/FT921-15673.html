			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / EC observers seek part in helicopter inquiry EUROPEAN Community monitors want to be involved in the inquiry set up by the Yugoslav military after federal army jets shot down an EC helicopter on Tuesday afternoon, killing five people, diplomats said yesterday. At the same time, the 170 EC monitors, most of them based in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, have temporarily suspended their activities until they obtain guarantees of security. The suspension means that a trilateral meeting aimed at shoring up the ceasefire in Croatia has been postponed. Today's negotiations in Pecs in Hungary would have involved EC monitors, the Croatian government and the federal army, the Hungarian foreign ministry said. Mr Joao de Silva, the monitor's spokesman in Zagreb, said the mission was waiting to hold talks with federal army representatives who failed to turn up at a meeting scheduled for yesterday morning. 'At this meeting we want to know the exact circumstances of what happened. . . . and obtain the necessary guarantees to let our monitors perform their job,' he told Croatian radio. 'The activities of our monitors are interrupted until we obtain these guarantees.' Western diplomats in Belgrade are concerned that the federal army, led by General Veljko Kadiejevic, the defence minister, will try to keep the inquiry internal. They said the investigation must establish who issued the instructions to shoot down the helicopter, and to fire the missiles. The federal army has described the incident as 'tragic', and Colonel Zvonka Jurjevic, head of the air force, and a Croat, was suspended. However, an article in Polityka, the Belgrade newspaper, regarded as a mouthpiece for the Serbian government, said the two helicopters involved in the incident did not have clearance to fly the last leg of their journey from the Hungarian border to Zagreb. The helicopter had been shot down because it was operating in closed air-space. Mr Dobrosav Veizovic, Serbia's deputy foreign minister, told the BBC that in the past, two helicopters had been using this air corridor for 'the illegal importation of arms to Croatia. . . . that is one of the reasons which might be the cause (for the attack on the helicopter).' But a senior western diplomat said: 'If the army thinks it can blame the EC for this accident, or try to cover up in any way, it is mistaken. This accident confirms why the army must be brought under political control as quickly as possible.' Italy yesterday said the attack on the helicopter pointed to a deliberate attempt to scupper international efforts to end the fighting in Yugoslavia. An EC peace conference on Yugoslavia is due to resume in Brussels today as planned.</p>

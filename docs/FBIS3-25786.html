Addressing a national work conference on ideological and  media work which ended here today, Ding Guangen, a member of the  Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee, said that the reform must also conform to the law  governing the development of cultural and media undertakings.    He stressed that in carrying out the reform, it was  imperative to pay close attention to the promotion of cultural  and ideological progress; follow the principles of democracy and  providing guidance to the people and focus on mobilizing their  initiative; rely on all sectors of society and be good at  employing modern mass media.    It was also imperative to step up macro-management of  cultural and media undertakings; cultivate a socialist cultural  market; study and draw on outstanding cultural achievements and  managerial expertise in other countries; restructure the  management of cultural and media undertakings; and systematize  and standardize cultural and media work.    Ding, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the party  Central Committee, said: "To implement various tasks put  forward by the party Central Committee on the ideological and  media front, it is essential to have a competent contingent."    According to Ding, the holding of the conference  demonstrates  that the party Central Committee persists in placing equal  emphasis on both material progress and cultural and ideological  progress.    The conference was also intended to mobilize the whole party  to strengthen and improve ideological and media work in order to  provide a "powerful ideological guarantee" and a "fine public  opinion environment" for the reform, economic expansion and  stability in China, the leader told the closing session.    Ding, who is also head of the Propaganda Department of the  party Central Committee, expressed the belief that the  conference would certainly help to improve the ideological and  media work and make sure that all tasks assigned by the party  Central Committee will be implemented to the letter.    Delegates to the conference pledged to implement the tasks  on  the ideological and media front and to improve their work.    To this end, it was necessary to further emancipate the  mind,  seek truth from facts and take the road of the reform and  opening to the outside world, they noted.</p>

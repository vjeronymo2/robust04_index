			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY, ISRAEL RENEW TIES CUT IN 1967  </P> <P> The government continued to press its independent foreign policy initiatives  Monday, becoming the first East European regime to restore full diplomatic  relations with Israel.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union and all the East Bloc countries except Romania severed  relations with Israel after the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. Hungary, along with  Poland, has been carefully re-establishing contacts with the Jewish state over  the last two years. Hungary, quickly followed by Poland, opened an "interests  office" in Tel Aviv in 1987.  </P> <P> The restoration of full diplomatic ties was announced by the Hungarian news  agency MTI soon after the arrival of Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who  termed the Hungarian move a matter of "historic significance."  </P> <P> Officials of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry said they expect the resumption of  relations to lead to a sharp increase in trade between the two countries.  Israeli-Hungarian trade had already doubled since the opening of the interests  office and had reached a total of $31.5 million by the end of 1988.  </P> <P> "These ties will bring economic, social and political benefits to both Hungary  and Israel," Arens said in an interview with Israel Radio broadcast from  Budapest.  </P> <P> About 80,000 Jews live in Hungary, the second-largest Jewish community in East  Europe after the Soviet Union's.  </P> <P> The Hungarian Jewish community, its leaders say, is beginning to regain its  identity after years of silence under the Communists. About 600,000 Hungarian  Jews were deported to concentration camps in 1944, near the end of World War  II. About 300,000 survivors emigrated to Israel.  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Gyula Horn told MTI that the resumption of ties after 22 years  marks another step in Hungary's reform drive and an attempt to correct what he  called past mistakes.  </P> <P> "Hungary is against confrontation, endorses dialogue and wants good  relationships based on mutual advantages," Horn was quoted as saying. "This  step is not aimed against anybody and will probably be helpful in solving the  Middle East conflict."  </P> <P> He said the move will not impair Hungary's relations with Arab countries,  pointing out that a major Arab country, Egypt, has established formal ties with  Israel.  </P> <P> The diplomatic move came eight days after Hungary angered its hard-line East  Bloc neighbors, particularly East Germany and Czechoslovakia, by deciding to  allow vacationing East Germans to cross its newly opened border with Austria  and settle in West Germany.  </P> <P> Under Monday's agreement, the head of Israel's interests office in Budapest,  Shlomo Meron, becomes the Israeli ambassador. Hungary's corresponding office in  Tel Aviv also becomes an embassy, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said.  </P> <P> Four weeks ago, the World Jewish Congress said Hungary had begun allowing  Soviet Jews to fly to Israel through Budapest, making Hungary the second East  European country to permit the transit of such emigrants. Romania has been  allowing Soviet Jews to transit through Bucharest for several years.  </P></p>

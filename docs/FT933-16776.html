			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Bosnia's armies in battles to gain land SERB forces yesterday pounded Gorazde, the besieged Moslem enclave proclaimed a United Nations 'safe area', amid intense clashes in northern and eastern Bosnia. Bosnian radio said many people were killed and wounded in the Serb artillery attack on the last remaining Moslem stronghold in the east. The report could not be independently confirmed. UN officials said at least 74 shells slammed into Gorazde, one of six Moslem enclaves proclaimed as safe areas. In the strategic south-western town of Mostar, fighting appeared to ease after the Moslem-led Bosnian army reportedly seized control of a Croat barracks and advanced to the north. Croat commanders in Bosnia yesterday denied reports of Moslem gains. 'They cannot move. We have them surrounded on three sides and the Serbs are on the fourth,' said Mr Drago Maric, an official of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). 'The Moslems want to connect up Mostar to Jablanica and Konjic, where the bulk of their forces are,' he said in reference to Moslem-held towns in central Bosnia. The Moslem-led Bosnian army over the past week has tried to press forward to link up its scattered enclaves. Moslems fear that their six isolated enclaves will fall to the more powerful Serb and Croat armies. In an apparent bid to isolate Zenica and Tuzla, also designated safe areas, Croat and Serb forces launched a joint attack on Zepce amid continued shelling of nearby Maglaj, in north-central Bosnia.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady Foreign exchanges had their hopes dashed yesterday when the US Federal Reserve failed to raise interest rates after a buoyant set of jobs data, writes Philip Gawith. Markets were expecting that the Fed might tighten policy as a follow up to the concerted central bank intervention that took place on Wednesday to support the dollar. The US currency rose by nearly a pfennig when the April non-farm payroll rose by 267,000, compared to a market forecast of 170,000, increasing the prospects of higher rates. With the Fed deciding to keep its powder dry, however, the dollar retreated from earlier highs to close in London at DM1.6661 from DM1.6682 on Thursday. Against the yen it closed at Y102.780 from Y102.695. Sterling's initial response to the very poor showing of the ruling Conservative Party in local elections was subdued, but it later lost ground in afternoon trade to close at DM2.4859 from DM2.4969. The market probably ran a little ahead of itself in expecting the Fed to lift rates immediately. The central bank has recently been scrupulous in separating rate moves from specific data. But what the performance of the dollar did make clear is that the Fed will have to act, either through intervention, higher rates, or both, if the currency is not to test new lows. Once the initial flurry of enthusiasm about the jobs data had dissipated, the downward trend reasserted itself. Analysts yesterday were agreed on two points. First, the dollar's weakness is linked to the general fragility of US asset markets, though there is little clarity about which is the chicken and which the egg. Second, the Fed will have to act decisively to calm the nerves of dollar and US asset investors. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of global currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), commented: It has got to make the markets think that it has knocked inflation with a sledgehammer, and that nothing more is needed.' Given current market sentiment, anything short of a 50 basis points rise in the discount and federal funds rate - currently at 3 per cent and 3.75 per cent respectively - is likely to disappoint and lead to a further sell-off of the dollar. An indication of prevailing sentiment is provided by SG Warburg, the UK investment bank, which this week revised down its short-term dollar forecasts, predicting that it will fall below DM1.60 and Y100 over the next three months. In Europe favourable political developments helped the Italian lira which closed at L961 from L964.3 against the D-Mark. The Spanish peseta finished slightly weaker at Pta82.49 from Pta82.25 against the D-Mark. German call money traded easier at 5.35/5.40 per cent from 5.35/5.45 per cent. There was very little movement in the futures market with the June euromark contract closing at 95.04 from 95.05. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with late assistance of Pounds 15m. Earlier the Bank had put Pounds 771m into the market after forecasting a liquidity shortage of Pounds 900m. Activity in the sterling futures market was low. The June contract finished unchanged at 94.59.</p>

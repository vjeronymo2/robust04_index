			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Slower move to more open economy: New cabinet will steer clear of sensitive issues Japan's new three-party cabinet is populist, conservative and likely to mark a pause in Japan's progress toward a more open economy and power structure. As expected, most of the top jobs went to the right-wing Liberal Democratic Party, which holds the foreign, defence, home affairs and international trade and industry ministries among its 13 cabinet seats. It gives the cabinet the experience lacking in its coalition partners. The left-wing Social Democratic Party gets five, while the New Harbinger Party, a former LDP splinter group, which forms the smallest member of the coalition gets two, including the vitally important finance ministry. The previous pronouncements and track records of Mr Tomiichi Murayama's team indicate the new government's main policies will be as follows: coalition partners will focus on the few areas where they have something in common. They will steer clear of sensitive matters such as energy, where the SDP believes Japan must freeze its nuclear programme, or defence, where the Socialists believe Japan's army is unconstitutional. The Economy: The government is expected to push for a several-year income tax cut, possibly in a tax reform bill this autumn, but to leave the timing and scope of any increase in consumption tax vague. The finance ministry and fiscal conservatives in the LDP will fight for a rise in consumption tax, on grounds that extra revenue is urgently needed to curb the rising public-sector borrowing requirement (5 per cent of gross domestic product, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). But the decision will be swayed by the New Harbinger party's tax-cutting Mr Masayoshi Takemura, whose arrival will cause alarm among ministry mandarins. He yesterday repeated his opposition to finance ministry plans to raise consumption tax, a row over which caused Mr Takemura to walk out of a former coalition government. Mr Takemura's appointment is a boon to the SDP, which opposes a rise in sales tax even more than his party does. Deregulation: Large sections of both the LDP and SDP prefer deregulation to proceed at an even slower pace than under the previous two reform-minded coalition governments. The LDP is sensitive to its small business support base, reluctant to face an increase in competition. The SDP is pulled in opposite directions by its two main types of supporter, conservative farming communities and the pro-deregulation trade union movement, Rengo. On balance, it has a record of being unenthusiastic on deregulation, as shown by its resistance to last year's ending of the ban on rice imports. Foreign and trade policy: The LDP's Mr Yohei Kono, foreign minister, and his Socialist boss, Mr Murayama, are staunch pacifists, which suggests they will press for a soft line on North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Here, they will have the support of Mr Takemura, who has been close to Pyongyang since arranging a meeting between Kim Il-Sung and a senior member of the LDP four years ago. All three members of the coalition oppose non-United Nations sanctions against North Korea. Mr Kono, but not all his LDP followers, and his two partners agree Japan should not revise Article Nine of the constitution, which forbids the use of force to settle international disputes. The prime minister and foreign minister may also, because of their pacifism, tone down Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and for wider participation in UN peace-keeping. As a result, Japan may take a generally lower profile on the world stage while this government is in office. The strong hawkish streak on the right wing of the LDP is likely to enliven this coalition's reign. Political reform: Mr Murayama surprised critics yesterday by pledging to speed the re-drawing of electoral boundaries and hold elections under the new rules opposed by many of his own party members only last January. The new boundaries will be ready by autumn, but the coalition might hold on longer if it can control its internal differences on this and other policies. The new boundaries are the final stage in the re-design of the political and electoral system, including curbs on political fund-raising. Mr Kono equivocally supports reform. Mr Murayama's electoral pledge disappointed the SDP and LDP old guard, who suspect they would do less badly in a quick election under the old system than under the new. Against that, they fear a public backlash if they are seen to be resisting popular reform. The new prime minister symbolically signalled he wanted to break with the LDP's record of political corruption by giving the construction ministry to a Socialist. Public-works contracts were at the centre of a recent judicial crackdown on corruption. One entirely legal vestige of the old political way is present in yesterday's cabinet: the strength of family ties. Ms Makiko Tanaka, the straight-talking daughter of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, becomes director-general of the Science and Technology Agency, during her first term in parliament. Few politicians land a cabinet job so early in their careers.</p>

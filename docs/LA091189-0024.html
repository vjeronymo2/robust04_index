			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Gordon Davidson, Ahmanson Theatre producing director, has asked Ahmanson  subscribers to give him a month to come up with a replacement in the Ahmanson  season for "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." Last week, the opening of the musical's  Los Angeles engagement was abruptly postponed from next April to May, 1991 -- a  move which caught Davidson by surprise, he said. If Davidson can't find a show  "of sufficient quality and stature" to match "Broadway" within the next month,  he said, he'll refund the price of the "Broadway" tickets to his subscribers.  If he does find a replacement, individual subscribers who don't want to see it  will also be given refunds. Ahmanson subscribers had created a $2.5-million  advance sale for "Broadway," said Davidson. Meanwhile, he said the owners of  the Shubert Theatre, where "Broadway" will eventually be presented, don't have  an understudy show waiting in the wings. Shauna Snow and ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Choice for Berlusconi: Government adopts conflict of interest proposals The Italian government yesterday decided to adopt unchanged the legislation proposed by three jurists to resolve the conflict of interest between the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, and his Fininvest media empire. The legislation means that Mr Berlusconi must choose between selling off his assets or appointing a special administrator as a trustee to run Fininvest, Italy's second largest private group. His media interests will also be monitored by the parliament-appointed media watchdog commission. Mr Berlusconi formally cut his managerial ties with Fininvest in January when he entered politics, but has so far failed to make any provision to prevent a conflict of interest. He has consistently stated he is averse to selling his assets, but it remains to be seen how an administrator will fit into the management structure of Fininvest, which is spread over television, publishing, financial products and retailing. The three jurists, who proposed the legislation in a 400-page report submitted at the end of September, were appointed by Mr Berlusconi in May. Their report was judged a positive first step by the opposition but they criticised the legislation as being incomplete. They claim the cards are stacked in Mr Berlusconi's favour because parliament controls appointments to the media watchdog commission. Two incidents yesterday underlined the continued problems of conflict of interest. The first was a debate in the higher magistrate's council, governing body of the judiciary, over whether to censure the behaviour of the chief public prosecutor of Milan who is investigating Fininvest. Mr Vittorio Sgroi, head of the appeals court, had to explain at length that a meeting he had held on Wednesday with Mr Berlusconi over the affair had not involved an attempt by the owner of Fininvest to exert pressure on the outcome of the censure meeting. The council later decided to take no action against Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, a senior magistrate who sparked a furore by hinting that a corruption probe into a pay television network might involve Mr Berlusconi. The second incident was a debate in parliament on the future of the Rai, the state broadcasting organisation. An opposition member hurled abuse and accused the government of monopolising information through Fininvest channels and control of the Rai. Fights broke out when several members from government benches stormed towards the opposition.</p>

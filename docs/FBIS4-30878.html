			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "The Horn Government Is Coming"] </F>   [Text] The Socialists have won a landslide victory that  exceeds all expectations and, as a whole, they obtained more  than half of the parliamentary mandates. The trend of the first  round of elections continued and even became stronger in the  second round: Down with the ruling coalition parties and no to  the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] too; one should vote  for the Socialists, or for the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ]! The only question now is whether the new government  will be a one-pattern one, or are there parties that will accept  the Socialists' coalition offer. If the SZDSZ, which came in  second with 20 percent of the mandates, accepts the role of  coalition partner even with such a percentage, the new  government will have a majority of more than 70 percent in  parliament. This means that this government will have a free  hand in governing and, in the sense of the constitutional law,  it can do whatever it wants. The weightless opposition will  actually have nothing to say in managing Hungary's affairs. If  the SZDSZ does not accept the coalition, most probably the Horn  government will have an unstable parliamentary majority but,  compared with the previous parliamentary cycle, this government  will face a much more divided opposition.    The MSZP election victory is the success of the policy the  party has conducted in the past four years and in the election  campaign, as well as the consequence of the voters' deep  disappointment in the government led by the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF]. The Socialists succeeded in convincing one-third  of the voters that the MSZP not only represents a real  alternative to the conservative forces, but it is also able to  replace them. The Socialists' message was clear: They accept  government responsibility, they endeavor to come to an agreement  rather than confrontation, they have a modernization plan that  can be implemented, and they represent a real governing force  with their professionalism and political experience. Their  electoral alliance with the largest trade union bloc, namely the  National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ], also  brought them many votes. In addition, with Gyula Horn, the MSZP  presented a front man who was facing the often base attacks  directed at him while increasing the popularity of his party and  of himself (and probably his car accident also played a role in  this), and this also attracted many hesitant voters to the  Socialists. One can predict with certainty that, having the  majority in parliament, the MSZP congress will nominate Gyula  Horn for the position of prime minister and will probably make a  coalition offer to the SZDSZ. The MSZP is aware of the fact  that the number of its parliamentary mandates is considerably  larger than the social representation of one-third of Hungary's  voters who supported the party, and inviting the SZDSZ into a  coalition might effectively increase the political and mass  support of the government; and there is urgent need for this,  given Hungary's current situation.    However, this will put the SZDSZ in a serious dilemma.  Although the SZDSZ fared well in the campaign finish, it failed  to repeat its previous result of 91 mandates in 1990. The  rhetoric it used in the period between the two rounds of the  present elections did not seem to work, namely that people  should vote for the SZDSZ because this is the only party capable  of counterbalancing the numerical superiority of the MSZP within  the government and it is the only party whose candidate for the  position of prime minister, namely Gabor Kuncze, could represent  an alternative to Gyula Horn. The SZDSZ has to decide: It will  either become a fifth wheel on the socialists' cart or it will  get into opposition and will try to exercise pressure from  outside. It is worth pondering about what erodes the party and  its support more: accepting government responsibility from a  relatively weak position or remaining outside. However, it is  also questionable whether the SZDSZ is able to bear another four  years of opposition and whether it can be regarded as a  governing force at all.    Whatever the outcome -- either a one-pattern government or a  coalition -- the winners will not have time to celebrate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] TISHRIN comments editorially on the Russian deputy  foreign minister's visit to Damascus to convey a message from  Russian President Boris Yeltsin to President Hafiz al-Asad. The  message deals with the peace talks, which have been broken off  because of Israel's intransigence, maneuvering, and refusal to  respond to the peace talks' most important requirement, which is  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.    TISHRIN notes that the latest round of talks in Washington  following the al-Asad-Clinton summit was disappointing because  of Israel's continued policy of prevarication and  procrastination. Once again raising its alleged security  problems, Israel evaded discussions on withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories. Then, the paper says, the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre took place, only to consolidate the conviction  that Israel is not serious about peace and that it seeks to use  the talks as a cover for its aggressive, expansionist actions.    TISHRIN stresses that the recent events in the occupied  territories have increased the conviction of Syria and other  Arab parties that any peace in the region must be based on a  just, comprehensive solution that meets Arab aspirations and  restores the Arab rights and territories.    The paper stresses that if the Washington talks are to be  successful, there is no alternative to an effective U.S.,  Russian, and international role that pushes for the  implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions.  Implementation of these resolutions means Israel's full  withdrawal from the Golan Heights and other occupied  territories. Syria has repeatedly stressed that there will be  no compromise over the Golan, that there will be no peace  without full withdrawal, and that Syria will not relinquish an  iota of territory or any national and pan-Arab right.    Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN stresses that Syria wants  peace, but Syria will never accept the partial and separate  solutions demanded by Israel. Syria has the right to urge the  cosponsors of the peace process to translate their assurances  into a tangible solution that spreads justice and helps  international law to prevail.    AL-BA'TH notes that the suspension of the latest round of  bilateral peace talks in Washington was because of the Zionist  settlers' brutal massacre of our kinfolk in the Ibrahimi Mosque.    AL-BA'TH adds that when the UN Security Council condemned  the  massacre and stressed the need to provide international  protection for the people of Palestine, and when it emphasized  the need to continue the peace process, which is viewed as an  opportunity to achieve security and stability in the region, it  became necessary to continue coordination among Arab parties in  order to arrive at a common decision on the resumption of the  peace negotiations. This has been explicitly stressed by Syria.    The paper says that so far, Israel has not shown an explicit  commitment to withdraw from the Golan Heights. Nor has it shown  an equal readiness to implement Resolution 425 providing for  immediate Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Moreover,  Israel is continuing its daily crimes against our kinfolk  throughout the occupied Arab territories.    The paper continues: While the U.S. Administration, which  has frequently stressed its commitment to advancing the peace  process, is preparing for a renewed diplomatic move prior to the  resumption of bilateral talks, Russia, as one of the two  cosponsors, has reasserted its readiness to play its role in the  peace process.    Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH stresses the need for  concerted international efforts, which can lead to tangible  results if they focus on changing the intransigent Israeli  position. The winning card is the UN resolutions, which must be  implemented, and which must not be allowed to be hampered  indefinitely by the Rabin government.    In a comment, AL-THAWRAH writes on the recent agreement in  Cairo between Israel and the PLO, providing for the deployment  of international observers in Hebron. The paper refers to a  statement by Yosi Beilin, the Israeli deputy foreign minister,  in which he said that the agreement will change nothing in the  current state of affairs, and that it has given Israel full  control over all security affairs in this city.    AL-THAWRAH says that such a statement shows that this  agreement is ineffective, useless, and does not have a shred of  credibility to give the Palestinians even a little sense of  security and tranquility. Besides, it does not give any actual  guarantees for preventing the recurrence of the Zionist  settlers' massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. The paper adds  that the agreement does not provide any tangible solution to the  volatile situation in the occupied territories, a situation  which is deteriorating daily as a result of the repressive  Israeli practices. Nor does the agreement provide an adequate  method for preventing further bloodshed there.    Concluding its comment, AL-THAWRAH says that if the Rabin  government continues its maneuvers and procrastination, and if  it continues to raise security pretexts to justify the policy of  occupation and expansion, then it will be fooling nobody but  itself by this false and deceptive logic. This is because it  has become common knowledge that only a just, comprehensive  peace that is accompanied by full withdrawal from all the  occupied territories can provide security for everyone.</p>

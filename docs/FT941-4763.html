			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Greece and Macedonia close to deal A possible breakthrough in the dispute between Greece and Macedonia emerged last night before both sides meet under UN auspices in Geneva today. If resolved, it could help shore up a fragile stability in the southern Balkans. Mr Cyrus Vance, a former US secretary of state and UN mediator in former Yugoslavia, will discuss the draft accord with Greek foreign minister Carolos Papoulias and Mr Stevo Crvenkovski, his Macedonian counterpart. Under the proposed agreement, Macedonia would immediately alter its flag which carries a starburst symbol linked with the ancient Greek kings of Macedon. In return, Greece would drop its veto on Macedonian membership of the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and participation in the European Union's aid programme for eastern Europe. Greek officials have indicated the embargo would be lifted as soon as Macedonia put another symbol on its flag and gave assurances the constitutional issue would be addressed. The possibility of movement follows this week's decision by the EU and the Commission to soft-pedal on earlier threats of legal action over Greece's trade embargo, and to acknowledge there is a 'political' element to the Macedonia dispute. In Strasbourg, Mr Papoulias said the EU's stance had given Athens room for manoeuvre. Today's talks coincide with cabinet meetings in Britain and Canada to decide how many troops, pending support from other countries, they will send to Bosnia to shore up the ceasefire. Lieutenant General Jean Marcotte, the UN's military spokesman in Zagreb, Croatia, said yesterday that any delay in sending troops 'would place the peace process in a critical situation'. Other countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, and particularly Turkey which has 1,000 troops on standby, have offered reinforcements. But Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has ruled against sending troops from neighbouring countries. The US, which has refused to send ground forces to Bosnia until a full peace agreement is signed, was yesterday understood to be considering boosting its force in Macedonia from 300 to 700. This would allow a 400-strong Nordic force stationed in Macedonia to be sent to Bosnia. France will offer more troops on a 'roll-over' basis, sending in forces earlier to overlap with those on the ground. The Nordic countries said they were prepared to re-deploy troops from Croatia. General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said yesterday that some 50,000 western troops, half of them American, would be needed to oversee any Bosnian peace agreement, Reuter reports from Washington. He was challenging earlier reports that a smaller force of 20,000-30,000 troops, perhaps a third of them American, could monitor any final peace deal. Political notebook, Page 8</p>

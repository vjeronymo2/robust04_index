			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / S Korea may free interest rates SOUTH Korea's new government yesterday indicated it might deregulate a large portion of interest rates this month in a key step toward financial reform. The action would fulfil a promise by the previous administration that the latest phase of interest rate deregulation would occur in the first half of this year. The government's tight control of lending and deposit rates has been blamed for distorting credit allocation and causing market interest rates to be higher than those of South Korea's main Asian competitors. Seoul agreed in 1991 to deregulate interest rates in four stages by 1997 in response to US trade pressure that it open up its financial market. The second phase to be implemented this year would free 75 per cent of bank lending rates and 30 per cent of deposit rates. It would also completely liberalise lending rates among other financial institutions, such as short-term finance companies and insurance companies, and deregulate 65 per cent of their deposit rates. But officials have hesitated to free rates because they fear it would cause painful adjustments to the financial system, including a temporary jump in interest rates. A similar attempt at deregulation in 1988 caused interest rates to rise sharply as borrowing expanded to finance property speculation. The government scrapped the reform and put strict limits on property transactions. Mr Hong Jae-hyong, finance minister, said yesterday the fall in market interest rates since last autumn had improved prospects for deregulation to be managed without significant disruption. Market rates now stand at 11 per cent against a peak 19 per cent early last year. A cut in the central bank's key lending rates in January helped push down market rates. One concern is that corporate demand for loans usually rises in the spring as companies increase spending on facilities and equipment. The government wants to encourage corporate investment spending this year to help revive the economy, which grew by some 4.5 per cent last year, the lowest rate since 1980. The finance minister also said yesterday that a schedule to introduce a 'real name' financial transactions system, promised since 1981, would be unveiled by May. Financial accounts can at present be held under pseudonyms and have been used to hide money generated by Korea's underground economy. Introduction of 'real name' accounts would help fight corruption, a move that is in line with the aims of President Kim Young-sam. Share prices on the Seoul exchange have fallen recently, because of fears the 'real name' system would drain liquidity from the market.</p>

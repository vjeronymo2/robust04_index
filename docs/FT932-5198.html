			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: US stores report upturn in May MANY of the larger US stores groups yesterday reported modest improvements in same-store sales growth during May. In the previous month, they generally experienced weak sales performances, partly related to the poor weather and partly to renewed doubts about the health of the US economy. Kmart, the large discount and speciality store group, said that sales in May improved 'considerably', for example. It attributed this to 'more seasonable spring weather in many parts of the country', and added there had been a 'very strong pick-up in sales in the first week of the June reporting period'. However, despite the upturn, Kmart's total same-store sales rose by a modest 1.1 per cent in May, including a 2.6 per cent increase on the general merchandise side. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's top-selling retailer, reported that same-store sales advanced by 6 per cent in May - slightly above the 4 per cent rise now seen for the first four months of the year. Its Sam's warehouse clubs reported flat like-for-like sales for the month, against a 2 per cent decline in the first four months of the financial year. Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based retailer, fared slightly better - posting a 5.9 per cent increase in same-store sales in its core domestic stores division. 'Almost all merchandise lines reported increases,' said Mr Arthur Martinez, chairman of the merchandise division, adding that the strongest increases came in clothing, lawn and garden lines and certain appliances. Among the department stores, however, JC Penney saw an increase of just 1.9 per cent in the mainline stores; at Federated, there was a 2.6 per cent advance; in the main division of May Department Stores, a 4.2 per cent rise. Woolworth, which has reported lack-lustre figures recently, posted a 3.8 per cent increase on a same-store basis. Meanwhile, among the specialty stores, The Gap, the fashion chain which weathered much of the recession in better shape than rival retailers but has lost ground recently, reported only a 3 per cent increase in same-store sales. Its shares fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 35 1/4 . Sears, Roebuck is ahead of schedule in its plan to reduce debt by more than Dollars 3bn, said vice chairman Mr James Denny, Reuter reports from Chicago. Last autumn, Sears unveiled a restructuring plan to spin off its financial services network and reduce debt by more than Dollars 3bn. The retailer sold 20 per cent of Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co this winter in an initial public offering, and proceeds were about Dollars 865m. The Allstate offering raised Dollars 2.12bn before any exercise by underwriters of overallotment options to buy up to an additional 11m shares. Sears also has entered an agreement for PNC Bank to buy Sears Mortgage Banking Group for Dollars 328m. 'I can tell you we are pleased with the values we have received,' Mr Denny.</p>

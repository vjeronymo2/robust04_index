			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On the prospect of UN disciplinary measures  regarding the DPRK's (North Korea) announcement to secede from  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa said at the 14 June House of Councilors' Budget  Committee meeting: "I think it will be economic sanctions." He  then said: "Some people have an apprehension that the phased and  gradual measures, which we proposed, may be shortened. We hope  that North Korea will understand the international community's  stance and will not launch hasty countermeasures." He made  these remarks in a response to a question by Fujio Saito of the  Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

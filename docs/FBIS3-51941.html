			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Pablo Vigil, construction and </F> transportation minister, and Government Minister Alfredo  Mendieta with unidentified reporters on 25 January in Managua;  from the "This Morning" newscast -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Reporter] Does this mean you  will not continue the talks with the transportation commission  [words indistinct] Engineer Vigil?    [Vigil] Absolutely not. We will continue to talk with all  groups. We will always be willing to debate, discuss, and hear  their opinion on the communique. We are always willing to  participate in discussions.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] stop the strike decreed by the  transportation commissions [words indistinct] since Monday?    [Vigil] We believe the measures are quite beneficial for the  transportation sector and the general public. That includes the  production sector, which will also enjoy the benefits. We do  not think there is any reason to continue the stoppage. We are  giving an overall solution, a clear and positive solution, to  members of the transportation sector, the people in general, and  all groups that have not supported the stoppage to achieve peace  and help the economic reactivation. Thus the growth process we  began in January will not be obstructed by a situation that  might be extremely dangerous. That is why we have decided to  solve many of the problems discussed during the preliminary  meetings, and the solutions are included in this document.    [Reporter] The communique and the talks you held have [words  indistinct] official communique.    [Vigil] In most cases, yes.    [Reporter] When will the [words indistinct]?    [Vigil] The measures taken by the Nicaraguan Government are  intended to guarantee peace for the citizens and to overcome the  impasse once and for, because it has cost the government between  7 and 8 million cordobas. We will recover the sum with better  tax collection, meaning by increasing the efficiency of the  administration. There will not be any new taxes. This must be  quite clear from the beginning. We will make tax collection  more efficient to create the revenues outlined in the budget,  which was submitted to the National Assembly.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Vigil] We can try. The next agreement will be based on  established policies and current prices at the international  level.    [Reporter] What happens [words indistinct] if the strike  continues and the [words indistinct]. What will the government  do tomorrow?    [Vigil] Minister Mendieta will answer that question.    [Mendieta] First it is important to emphasize the  government's efforts to find a negotiated solution to the  transportation sector's problems. As the communique stated, it  has been practically impossible to get these organizations  together and find a joint solution. We believe the Government  Ministry is capable of guaranteeing, through the National  Police, the free circulation of people and vehicles throughout  the national territory. We have deployed Police, Special  Disarmament Brigades, and Special Riot Police forces to  guarantee this free circulation. We have also deployed special  units to clear areas where people have tried to close the  streets. This has already been done. You can confirm that this  has been permanently guaranteed throughout Managua despite  threats that traffic would be obstructed.    Moreover, we want to point out that anyone who endorses a  strike or an illegal stoppage will be punished according to the  law. We want to state that all vehicles used to obstruct  traffic and free circulation will be fined. Consequently, we  think the measures taken today by the government should be  sufficient to encourage people to set aside their current  attitude. Nevertheless, we believe some people may still be  trying to find pretexts for continuing their actions, but they  will no longer be considered a result of the transportation  sector problem. We would have to investigate those persons'  plans.    We believe these measures are a clear answer to the  proposals  presented by the transportation sector. They will solve most of  the problems we have discussed, and above all, they will  guarantee peace for the citizens, as Minister Vigil said. We  hope there are no more situations of this kind.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] would you explain how will  you manage to [words indistinct]?    [Vigil] We created the Temporary Transportation Council  [Consejo Temporal del Transporte], but because some of the  federations objected to the legal formation of this council, we  decided to form a commission made up of all sectors that wish to  participate so they, the sector representatives, can work with  us to draft the new law that will be presented to the National  Assembly. We do not want to draft that bill unilaterally. In  fact, there is a pledge for an agreement, and the National  Assembly president thinks it is very important for the Assembly  transportation, energy, and communication commission to  participate in drafting this new law.    [Reporter] There has been some discontent with bonds [words  indistinct].    [Vigil] The bond process went very smoothly. In some minor  cases the cooperatives did not provide the proper cooperation,  and the lists needed to clearly define the number of members  were not received on time. We must remember that many times  there is a certain fluidity within the transportation  cooperatives, with members moving from one cooperative to  another, or one person resigning and another one joining. In  December we established an effective system with the Finance  Ministry to deal with this. We think we can improve it even  further, with help from the cooperatives, to ensure that each  member receives his corresponding coupons.    [Reporter] The organizations have said that they will meet  with you again tomorrow. Will you accept?    [Vigil] The organizations that were here and that left late  without reaching any agreement have been informed of this  document. They are studying it, and we will meet with them  tomorrow.</p>

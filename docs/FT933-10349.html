			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Spain surges as German repo rate cut boosts Europe THE BUNDESBANK'S unexpected decision to cut its repo rate early yesterday provided a welcome boost for European government bond markets. It added to the general optimism that interest rates will fall across the continent now the straightjacket of the European exchange rate mechanism has been loosened. The high-yielding Mediterranean markets showed the strongest gains, with Spanish bonds charging ahead on the back of a half-point cut in Spanish interest rates. The Bank of Spain cut its benchmark interest rate from 11 per cent to 10.5 per cent at its regular seven-to-12-day repurchase tender in the morning. Despite the cut, the peseta strengthened against the D-Mark, moving from 83.15 pesetas to the mark to 81.76 pesetas by mid-afternoon. Spanish 10-year yield spreads over Germany have narrowed from around 370 basis points before the EC weekend agreement to switch to wider fluctuation bands, to a low of 323 basis points yesterday. GERMAN government bonds gained nearly half a point yesterday, prompted by the Bundesbank's decision to slice 15 basis points off its repo rate. The move leaves the repo rate at 6.80 per cent, only 5 basis points above the discount rate of 6.75 per cent. Some market participants had expected the Bundesbank to leave key interest rates unchanged after last week's cut in the Lombard rate - at least until council members return from holiday on August 26. Dealers saw some switching out of 10-year French government bonds into higher-yielding 10-year bunds given that French yields were trading 10 to 12 basis points through their German equivalents. The terms were set on a new 10-year bund issue yesterday. Dealers said the coupon of 6.5 per cent was in line with expectations. The issue price was 100.90 giving an issue yield of 6.38 per cent. The new issue is expected to raise about DM10bn in total. THE Banque de France held its interest rates unchanged again, confounding those in the market who were hoping to see some signs of easing now the franc has more freedom to move within the 'new-look' exchange rate mechanism. The central bank's failure to cut rates led to a fall in prices at the short end of the curve, but long-dated issues continued to rally with the yield on the 6 3/4 per cent OAT due 2003 falling from 6.41 per cent to 6.38 per cent. 'French bonds rallied on the back of the German repo cut although this was followed by profit-taking as there is some concern about the pace at which the French central bank will ease,' said Mr Philip Tyson, European economist at Yamaichi International. INTEREST rate euphoria over much of Europe helped to lift the UK government bond market, even though sterling cut free of the European ERM last September. The index-linked sector benefitted from strong demand, gaining nearly half a point, and long-dated conventional gilts jumped  3/4 of a point on the day. The Bank of England said two of its recently announced tap stocks were sold out yesterday - a Pounds 500m tranche of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 and a Pounds 300m tranche of index-linked stock due 2020. US TREASURY prices rose across the board yesterday on hopes that a final agreement on President Bill Clinton's budget will soon be reached. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/16 at 107 23/32 , yielding 6.529 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/16 at 100 5/32, to yield 4.151 per cent. US government securities, already stronger on overseas markets, opened firmer across the board, sending the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond close to its all-time low. The bulk of the increase was attributable to rising hopes among investors and dealers that Mr Clinton's deficit-reduction budget package would be approved by Congress before the week was out. The bond market sees the president's budget as the first serious attempt by a US administration to tackle the country's huge federal budget deficit. Sentiment was also aided by the unexpectedly weak 0.1 per cent increase in the June index of leading economic indicators. The data suggested that the economy, while not necessarily contracting, is certainly not growing especially rapidly.</p>

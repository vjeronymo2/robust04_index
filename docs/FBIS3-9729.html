The first  conference on the agreement is expected to be held in May, based  on the preparatory work.    Csoti said a condition for the successful conference is that  representatives of the Hungarian national minorities living in  the different countries be present at the talks. The politician  said no decision can be reached about the minorities without  them.    Csoti noted with regret that, contrary to the expectations,  no positive changes have come about in Romania and the related  recommendations of the Council of Europe were not fulfilled.    He said it is distressing that no commemorations were heard  in Romanian legislature in Hungarian to mark March 15, the  Hungarian national day, the anniversary of the outbreak of the  1848-49 revolution and freedom fight. Csoti said the senior  political forces in Bucharest rely on extreme nationalist,  chauvinistic parties.</p>

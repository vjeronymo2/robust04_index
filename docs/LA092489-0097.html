			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLASSICAL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Yolanda Krell's letter (Sept. 17) regarding the change at KFAC and Los Angeles'  alleged lack of sophistication and culture was irritating in its  simple-mindedness.  </P> <P> As a longtime resident and lover of Los Angeles, I'm tired of the L.A. bashers  who complain about the dearth of culture in our city. Since when is classical  music the only source of "culture"?  </P> <P> Los Angeles is a thriving city for the arts, and home to many respected  artists, musicians, writers, film makers, etc.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has always been and continues to be a vital center for new music,  design, theater and more, but I suppose Krell was too busy eating her "designer  pizza" to notice.  </P> <P> AMY SRODON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

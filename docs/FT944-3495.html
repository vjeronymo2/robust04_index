			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: VAT on fuel - democracy and penalties (2) Sir, I am bemused by the furore over VAT on fuel. I thought public interest required a reduction in unnecessary consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels and imposition of VAT was to serve as an incentive for householders to reduce consumption. Trade and industry secretary Michael Heseltine has claimed a reduction in price in real terms of gas through privatisation, which suggests fiscal penalties are even more necessary now. Have I got it wrong? Sarah Lees, Cockshoot Farm, West Wycombe, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire HP14 3AR</p>

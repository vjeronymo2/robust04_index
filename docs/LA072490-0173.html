			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> NORVILLE GETS CABDRIVER FINED  </P> <P> Deborah Norville got a New York taxi driver fined for cursing at her during a  ride in December.  </P> <P> The co-host of NBC's "Today" show told New York magazine she hailed a cab  driven by Isidro Ortiz.  </P> <P> When she arrived at her destination, Norville said, she tapped on the partition  window to tell Ortiz where to drop her off. She said Ortiz cursed her and  became more abusive when she began to write down his license number.  </P> <P> Norville said that she refused to give him a tip and that Ortiz slammed shut  the money vent and sent the fare flying. A coin struck her in the eye, she  said.  </P> <P> "I was absolutely shaking when I got out of the car," she was quoted as saying  in the magazine's July 30 issue.  </P> <P> Ortiz, 31, was fined $100 at a hearing April 2, said Rebecca Bowser, Taxi and  Limousine Commission spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The cabbie has an unlisted telephone number and could not be reached for  comment.  </P></p>

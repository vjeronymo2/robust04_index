			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Drama at the Marlowe Society - Will the curtain fall on this seedbed of theatrical talent? CAMBRIDGE'S Marlowe Society may have a low public profile, but in terms of its philosophy and personnel it is arguably the single most important influence on the British theatre in the past 50 years. Every play at Stratford's Swan, every production by Peter Hall or Trevor Nunn, every performance by Derek Jacobi or Ian McKellen, has the Marlowe and its traditions at its heart. And yet, like so many arts institutions, the society's future is under threat; hence the current appeal for Pounds 300,000. This will enable it to continue to employ professional directors, designers and other production staff, as well as to provide a room in the Cambridge Arts Theatre, which it can use for meetings, readings and other small-scale entertainments. The Marlowe was founded in 1907 by Justin Brooke, of the tea dynasty, but the leading light in its early years was his cousin, the poet Rupert. From its origins in a failed exam and the wish to see set texts in performance, the society was, and remains, an undergraduate one, drawing its members from open auditions, but supplemented by professional actors, such as Peggy Ashcroft and Michael Hordern, for its celebrated Shakespeare recordings, and directors for its annual production at the Arts. From the start, its achievements were profound. Its revivals of Marlowe, Jonson, Webster and Tourneur were directly responsible for introducing their work to the modern repertoire. With pioneering productions of Troilus and Cressida, Timon of Athens and Titus Andronius, it also, in director Steven Unwin's words, 'showed that there were other Shakespearian plays beside Twelfth Night'. Linked to this has been its focus on verse-speaking, in which, as Unwin says, it opposed the dominant metropolitan culture, where classic plays were produced with grand actors on grander sets. Sir Peter Hall, who was introduced to the Marlowe's productions as a Cambridge schoolboy, sees its verse-speaking tradition as fundamental, particularly today when 'no one else is interested in it; drama schools don't bother with it, because most of their students won't do Shakespeare', and he compares it with the Kings' choral tradition. 'You can argue with it, but the standards are consistently high.' In its 85-year existence, the Marlowe has, in director John Barton's words, produced 'a long roll call of honour'. Cecil Beaton acted and designed; Michael Redgrave played Prince Hal and James Mason, Brutus; Richard Baker and Noel Annan appeared in a 1947 White Devil. 'Later actors have ranged from Michael Pennington and John Shrapnel to Tilda Swinton and Simon Russell Beale. But the society's greatest discovery has been its directors: from 1950s figures such as John Barton, Peter Hall, David Jones, Robin Midgley, Toby Robertson and Peter Wood, through Trevor Nunn, to more recent graduates like Sam Mendes, Nicholas Hytner and Steven Unwin. It is easy to see why the so-called Cambridge mafia is resented; and yet no better seedbed for directors exists. Griff Rhys Jones, who directed Bartholomew Fair and acted in The Jew of Malta dressed in a gold leotard and virtually nothing else, attributes this wealth of talent to a sense of freedom. 'I'm a great believer in the chaos theory of learning to do theatre. When I was up, there was a picture of Peter Hall inscribed 'Thank you for letting me make my mistakes'. That's what we all felt.' Hall acknowledges that the influence of the Marlowe and particularly that of Dadie Rylands, the Kings College don and Bloomsbury initiate who led the society between 1929 and 1966, was crucial to his whole career. 'My intention in founding the RSC was to adopt a particular way of approaching a text. It wasn't much noticed at the time, but it came directly out of Dadie and the Marlowe.' His own appearances for the society included Tybalt in Romeo and Juliet, when he fought a duel with John Barton's Mercutio, which he describes as 'the longest stage fight in history . . . John only went to hospital once, with a split thumb due to my inaccuracy'. The production transferred to London's Phoenix Theatre, where they played before Winston Churchill, and for once, as Barton explains, the principles of textual fidelity were abandoned. 'Churchill was sitting in the front row with a large first folio, following it line by line. So we decided to improvise . . .' John Barton, widely regarded as the most scholarly of our major directors, sees in the society conditions analagous to those of Elizabethan theatre, where actors discovered texts on their feet. 'If you give young actors Shakespearian verse to learn in a fairly short rehearsal time without a lot of psychological probing, they are going to hang on to the verse much more than people who are trained naturalistically in today's drama schools with their emphasis on TV.' This raises the question of whether the Marlowe is a genuine training ground, and should be encouraged as such, or an undergraduate society, dependent solely on the enthusiasm of its members. Barton believes that 'the proof is in the pudding' - and the pudding certainly contains plenty of plums. For example, the cast of his own 1959 Henry IV included Ian McKellen, Clive Swift, Corin Redgrave, Julian Curry, John Fortune, John Bird, Eleanor Bron, and Derek Jacobi as Hal. Jacobi attests to the merits of the training. 'For those of us intending to go into the profession, it was the equivalent of a drama school. We learnt things which in our enthusiasm to become actors we'd never considered: vocal technique, wearing costume, attention to text. And unlike drama schools, we always performed in public, which gave an edge to the work.' And yet for every Marlovian who goes into the profession, there are half a dozen who don't. Among the latter is the novelist Margaret Drabble, who replies to the question 'what does the Marlowe offer people who don't go on to be Ian McKellen?' that 'it's important for people who go to watch Ian McKellen . . . It keeps Shakespeare and his contemporaries alive, in a different way from other institutions by taking young people at the start of their career and firing them with enthusiasm'. Its appeal is two-fold. Its emphasis on textual rigour and revival of classic texts should please the traditionalists while, in a age of increasing vocational training, it epitomises the virtues of a liberal education. In Hall's words, 'For those who don't go into the theatre, it provides a chance to get inside the head of a genius. There are very few better ways of spending a few weeks than putting on a Shakesperian play.' And the experience feeds back into academia. Drabble describes how she 'got a first with distinction when I spent every available moment in the theatre. Playing Imogen for the Marlowe made me feel a serious person for the first time.' Nevertheless the Marlowe tradition is under threat. It is ironic that this comes at a time when the opening of the Bankside Globe, where it is set to perform, is poised to bring its work before a wider public. As Mendes says of the appeal, 'It's like a closed shop; the man on the street won't know what he's contributing to, but he gets the benefit - whether it's Derek Jacobi on stage or Griff Rhys Jones on TV.'

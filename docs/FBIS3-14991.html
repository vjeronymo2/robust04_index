			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal by Ukraine's Supreme Council" issued in Kiev on 25 </F> February 1994]    [Text] Esteemed Citizens of Ukraine: Ukraine is now going  through difficult times. The economic crisis has not been  overcome. The social problems have become extremely acute. In  such conditions, when confidence in all branches of power has  declined, Ukraine's Supreme Council, at the demand of the  people, adopted correct decisions: to hold early elections.  First, Supreme Council elections in March, and later, in June,  Ukrainian presidential elections and elections to local power  structures.    Therefore, Ukraine is at the threshold of new important  changes in its political and economic life. We have a  possibility to continue transformations in Ukraine in a peaceful  way and do this in a manner adopted in the majority of  democratic countries of Europe and the world: from elections to  elections, to change the parliament and, therefore, also the  government; in other words, to introduce changes into the ranks  of those who will determine the state's internal and external  policy.    However, in order for the peaceful revolutionary  transformations in Ukraine to continue, elections to Ukraine's  Supreme Council, appointed for 27 March 1994, must be successful.    However, certain facts and statements indicate that not  everybody in Ukraine is interested in a successful course of  these elections. There is talk of the possibility of some "power  vacuum." Some people even openly advocate sabotaging the  elections, undermining them.    If the Supreme Council elections do not take place, this  will  only further intensify the political and economic instability  and will lead to a constitutional crisis in Ukraine. However,  there will be no crisis of power, since the present Supreme  Council will maintain its constitutional powers and will  function until March 1995. However, why should we go backwards,  if the change in Ukraine's Supreme Council may and must take  place on 27 March 1994?    For precisely that reason, Ukraine's Supreme Council appeals  to citizens and to all officials and power bodies who are  involved in organizing the election campaign, with a request to  show high responsibility at this time, which is important for  Ukraine. Any actions or statements that may lead to the  breakdown of elections or to their sabotage are inadmissible.  Nor are any violations of the Law on Elections acceptable.    Ukraine's Supreme Council draws the attention of central,  district, and local electoral commissions, the leadership of the  State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, and the state  mass media to the need to considerably improve activity aimed at  intensifying the pre-election campaign and ensuring objectivity,  the comprehensive nature of coverage, and the observance of the  rights of candidates for deputies and voters.    Dear fellow citizens, let us use our chance to change the  life of every one of us and of the entire society.    Kiev, 25 February 1994</p>

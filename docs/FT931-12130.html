It shipped 159,000 vehicles from its Dagenham, Halewood and Southampton assembly plants, and 770,000 engines from its Bridgend and Dagenham plants. Ford also exported about 17 per cent of its output from its plant at Halewood, Merseyside, and exported more than 50 per of its Fiesta output from its Dagenham, London, plant.

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / London road jams 'sickly': Fear of 'maglignant' congestion SIR ALASTAIR MORTON, chief executive of Eurotunnel, yesterday warned that if congestion in and around London was not tackled the rest of Britain would suffer. He told a conference of 250 managers in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, that congestion in London was 'a sickly thrombosis - it's a malignant one, almost cancerous'. Speakers at the conference discussed the problems that northern and Scottish companies have when trying to reach markets in continental Europe. Lord Healey, the former Labour deputy leader, said northern England and Scotland had more than 30 per cent of Britain's road freight traffic but received only 16 per cent of the government's budget for new motorways and trunk roads.</p>

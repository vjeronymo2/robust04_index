			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, June 20 (AFP) -- China was making plans  Monday to blow up a strategic levy in Guangdong Province to stop  the worst floods in 50 years from inundating the prosperous  Pearl River delta region. Local officials, contacted by  telephone, said all measures had been taken to destroy the levy  at Foshan, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Guangzhou city, if  flood waters continued to rise. "If the flood waters rise by  another 30 centimeters (one foot), then we will have to  sacrifice part of Foshan," one official told AFP.    Threatened downriver were Guangzhou, the provincial capital  which has been on full flood alert since Saturday, and the Pearl  River delta, which is home to China's largest concentration of  foreign investment.    Hong Kong newspapers called the floods -- triggered by  successive days of torrential rains which persisted Monday --  the worst in 50 years, claiming more than 200 lives in various  areas by official count. The crisis disrupted what was supposed  to have been a triumphant inspection tour of the province by  China's president and communist party leader Jiang Zemin, the  EASTERN EXPRESS newspaper said. Jiang arrived Sunday in  Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, only to spend his  first hours visiting some of the 160 injured in Friday's  collapse of a fire-gutted textile mill in another city, Zhuhai,  that left 24 dead.    The Guangdong official, who asked not to be named, said the  demolition of the levy had been approved by the central  government in Beijing, which has called for all efforts to  protect China's richest province. Blowing up the levy would put  a vast area of lush farmland underwater, but reduce the threat  of floods wreaking greater damage downriver. Flood waters had  already submerged several counties around Sanshui city, upriver  from Foshan, where the North and East rivers join to become part  of the Pearl River delta, which flows into the South China Sea.  Late Sunday, flood waters in Sanshui had risen to 12.34 meters  (40 feet) or nine meters (30 feet) above the warning level. In  nearby Zhaoqing, the North River had jumped its banks, rising  13.53 meters (44 feet) or 4.53 meters (15 feet) above the  warning point.    Tens of thousands of Foshan residents were evacuated to  Guangzhou, residents said, while in the provincial capital  itself 500,000 people -- half of them from the Army -- had been  mobilized to fight the floods. In Guangzhou, shops and  factories along the river banks set up walls of sandbags and  moved equipment to higher ground, residents said.    Provincial authorities meanwhile banned increases in  staple-food prices, with immediate fines for anyone caught  profiteering from the flood.</p>

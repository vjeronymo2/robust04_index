			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Privatised debt Having sold its equity stakes in UK utilities, it makes sense for the Treasury to clean out the cupboard and sell its stake in their debt as well. Still, given the fragile state of the bond markets it must hope that the bulk of the proceeds come from purchases by the companies themselves. That way the government would be tapping a genuine new source of funds. The incentives for the companies to buy back the debt are considerable. Not only does it free them of any associated covenants; it may be preferable to seeing the debt repackaged and sold on by merchant banks with whom the company has no direct relationship. But the debt is trading at a premium while the companies are carrying it at face value in their balance sheets. Those that buy it back must take a hit in their profit and loss account. The first sales programme sought to get round this problem by adjusting the price at which companies bid for their own debt. Effectively it was reduced to take account of the future tax they would pay as a result of their lower interest charge. Doubtless that will again provide an incentive. Perhaps more important is the state of the markets. With long term rates so high, now may be a good time for the companies to move. The purchase premium is unlikely to fall much further. With luck the debt may be refinanced at lower rates later.</p>

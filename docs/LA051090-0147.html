			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> FAIRGROUNDS TAX RESCINDED  </P> <P> After protests from more than 200 employees, concessionaires and promoters of  events at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds, the City Council this week  rescinded a 10% admissions tax enacted a week ago.  </P> <P> The council, by a 4-1 vote Monday, repealed the tax and instructed City  Administrator Julio Fuentes to work with Ralph Hinds, president of the Los  Angeles County Fair Assn., to seek other sources of revenue.  </P> <P> Hinds said the tax, which would have applied to admissions and charges for  exhibit space at all events at the fairgrounds except for the county fair and  off-track betting, would have had a devastating effect on fairground  operations, and could have cost hundreds of jobs. He said promoters of trade  shows and other events would have sought other locations rather than pay the  tax.  </P> <P> Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, who proposed the tax a week ago without  consulting fair officials, complained that the city gets little revenue but  lots of traffic jams and other problems from events at the fairgrounds, now  known as Fairplex, the Los Angeles County Fair and Exposition Complex. "There  is no reason except greed for Fairplex to oppose this tax," said Bryant, who  cast the only dissenting vote on the repeal measure.  </P> <P> Council members Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua, who had voted for the tax a week  ago, said they reversed their votes when they learned that fair officials  objected. Soto said the city desperately needs more revenue, but said the city  staff should work with fair officials to find another approach.  </P></p>

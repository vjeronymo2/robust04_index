			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Nechayev] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin announced certain changes in the tactics of  reforms, but denied allegations that the government will  sidetrack from market transformations completely.    The changes mean a switch from purely monetarist methods  pursued by Yegor Gaydar in managing economy, however the  government will not focus on boosting production by any means.    "The period of market romanticism is over now, but we will  not permit its substitution by a fetishism of production", the  prime minister told a press conference on Thursday.    But he rejected rumours about the change of the strategic  course. "I have to tell you that rumours that this Janaury the  course (of reforms) is changing are incorrect. I state with all  responsibility that this is not so", Chernomyrdin said.    The presidential course towards a deep transformation of the  Russian society "was, is and will be". "We have everything  necessary for that and the main guarantors are the president and  the Constitution", he added.    But "we plan a correction in the course of reforms", he said  and explained that the correction means a switch from purely  monetarist instruments to other measures tested in many European  countries.    These measures envisage the creation of a true competition  on  the Russian market and in the economy between Russian and  foreign producers. This signals "big openness of the russian  economy to world economy", Chernomyrdin said.    Artificial barriers on the way of foreign goods and capitals  to Russia will be lifted, according to the prime minister.    The government also plans to conclude general agreements  with  the trade unions and producers in order to curb inflation. The  package of such measures is being drafted, he said.    But the prime minister admitted that the rouble exchange  rate  might continue to fall. "This is an objective and inevitable  process. The rate will change, we will not be able to stop it  and we do not set such a task for ourselves", he said.</p>

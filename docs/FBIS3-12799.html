A statement addressing these soldiers was distributed in  Nabulus, Tulkarm, Hebron, and other cities. The statement says:  Your history, dignity, Arabism, and Arab magnanimity require  you to rebel. This call is a sincere invitation to rescue  yourself from the quagmire of crime against our kinsfolk and  clan.    The statement adds: Our call is genuine and does not stem  from emotions. Throughout the years, we have persevered and we  have suppressed our pain and sorrow as we saw part of our own  people practice killing and terrorism against our people  everywhere in southern Lebanon and Palestine.    The statement says: It is now time for you to return to your  genuine Arab dignity and magnanimity that was upheld by the  great struggler Sultan Pasha al-Atrash followed by the great  struggler Kamal Junblat. Let those heroes be your paragon of  honor and dignity.    The statement says colonialist invaders are evicted and  defeated and oppressed people triumph. History tells us about  the invaders and colonialists. Remember your ancestors at Jabal  al-'Arab who, led by struggler Sultan Pasha al-'Atrash, defeated  and evicted the French, just as they were evicted from Algeria  and just as the United States left Vietnam in defeat.    Fatah hawks also sent a warning to settlers in the occupied  Palestinian territories that says: As of 28 February, you are  being pursued wherever you are. Our fighters will pursue you  and the occupation army and other security bodies will not  protect you.    The warning says: It is time for retribution. Your only  chance is to immediately leave the settlements before it is too  late. The warning adds: If you leave, you will survive. Leave  the settlement immediately. Your life from now on will be at  the mercy of our heroic men.</p>

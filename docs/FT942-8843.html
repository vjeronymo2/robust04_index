			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper and coffee keep London's bull run going Copper and coffee markets remained the prime targets of investment fund buyers yesterday, with prices adding to recent prodigious gains. But the party appeared to be over for oil traders as nearby prices for North Sea crude slipped back below Dollars 16 a barrel. The London Metal Exchange reported another steep drop in its copper stocks yesterday, triggering fresh fund and speculative buying. This not only sent copper's price spiralling upwards again but dragged other metal prices along with it. Copper for delivery in three months was Dollars 2,220.50 a tonne at the close but prices surged again in the final minutes of LME after hours 'kerb' trading and the red metal moved to its highest level for 15 months, to Dollars 2,229, up Dollars 50 from Monday's kerb close. LME copper stocks fell by another 18,625 tonnes to a fresh one-year low of 406,075 tonnes. Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, suggested that only copper and aluminium among the LME metals had any fundamental reasons for price rises, although 'the fundamentals for lead are slowly turning in its favour.' He said that there had been some panic buying by copper consumers yesterday and buyers were ready to step in any time the price dipped. 'But it is wishful thinking to expect a summer price lull this year,' he added. Mr Arnold said he had no idea how high the copper price would go, but when it reached its peak it would fall back a few cents a pound. He doubted if it would go back below Dollars 2,000 a tonne. Three-month aluminium closed Dollars 22 a tonne up on the LME at Dollars 1,374.50. Mr Arnold said the market was now confident that producers would stick to the international agreement to cut annual output by between 1.5m and 2m tonnes. Meanwhile, coffee futures remained in strong favour on both sides of the Atlantic, with some traders believing New York had taken over the running from London. The July arabica futures contract in New York was consolidating yesterday afternoon after a rise of more than 12 cents a pound on Monday. But the September contract spent some time stuck at its one-day upward limit of 6 cents a pound as it struggled to catch up with July's earlier rise. 'The fireworks seem to be in New York,' said one London trader. 'The sign of a true bull market is a strong backwardation (when contracts for nearby delivery are at a premium over forward positions). The backwardation is starting to deepen in New York whereas it's starting to weaken in London.' The steam had certainly not gone out of the London market yesterday. The July robusta position hit a peak of Dollars 2,150 a tonne before easing slightly to close up Dollars 93 at Dollars 2,145. This puts it 79 per cent up on the year, having risen by 50 per cent in the past three weeks. Oil prices yesterday bucked the upward trend in other commodities. The benchmark Brent Blend for July was quoted at Dollars 15.85 a barrel in late London trading, well down on its close on Monday of Dollars 16.13. Traders attributed the decline to profit-taking at the end of a three month rally, which has seen oil prices rise by about Dollars 4 a barrel from the five-year lows recorded in mid-February. Mr Lindsay Horne, a trader at the London office of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, said other factors affecting prices included the end of a buying spree by US refiners in advance of the American summer holiday driving season, and continuing strong output from the North Sea fields.  --------------------------------------------            LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS           (As at Monday's close)  -------------------------------------------- tonnes  -------------------------------------------- Aluminium           +1,675 to 2,648,350 Aluminium alloy       -340 to    36,600 Copper             -18,625 to   406,075 Lead                  +950 to   346,675 Nickel                -186 to   132,330 Zinc                +3,750 to 1,161,100 Tin                    -60 to    27,845  --------------------------------------------</p>

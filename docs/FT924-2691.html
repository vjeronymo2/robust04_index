			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Industrialists' group takes a sober view THE TREASURY is expected today to receive a downbeat view from a special panel of industry representatives. The group combines senior Treasury officials with more than 10 people from business and a top civil servant from the Department of Trade and Industry. It adds up to an intriguing experiment by the Treasury to gain economic insights by mixing the often highly diverse cultures of Whitehall and the business world. The panel includes the chief economists of ICI, GKN, BP and RTZ - four of Britain's biggest companies - as well as a representative from one of Britain's biggest suppliers of double glazing. The Treasury's economics prospects group was set up earlier this year to strengthen the department's contacts with industry and help to improve the accuracy of its forecasting. The group is separate from another Treasury panel - the members of which were announced this week - that is also concerned with economic projections and is comprised mainly of economists from specialist forecasting groups. Mr Kevin Mahoney, managing director of Caradon Everest, the double-glazing subsidiary of the MB-Caradon building products group, and a panel member, said the meetings were a useful step to improve the dialogue between Whitehall and the business world. Mr Mahoney said Treasury officials were 'trying hard to learn the language' of people who work in in-dustry. Also expected at today's meeting is Mr Ivan Bradbury, chairman of Interconnection Systems, a manufacturer of printed-circuit boards based in South Shields, near Newcastle upon Tyne. Mr Bradbury said the extent businesses suffered from a downturn depended on their efforts to step up sales - particularly in overseas markets. Two years ago, he said, his company gained only 10 per cent of its sales from exports  -now 50 per cent of annual sales of about Pounds 40m are from overseas. 'You have to make your own green shoots,' he said. Mr Bradbury was not invited to either of the panel's two previous gatherings in June and September. The Treasury has added him to the panel because it thinks his knowledge of the electronics industry andexport markets might be useful. Another panel representative is Mr John Duff, strategy and business development director at the UK subsidiary of IBM, the international computer company. Mr Duff was picked because of his role at IBM in taking charge of market research into the UK information technology industry. Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, will chair the meeting. Other Treasury officials taking part include Mr Colin Mowl, chief forecaster. The economic prospects group - along with the panel of specialist forecasters, whose first meeting is early next year - is part of a broad effort by the Treasury to develop a more open approach to policymaking in the wake of a number of recent setbacks, including sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Richard Freeman, chief economist, ICI Ex-Treasury economist, he also worked at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Plays important role inside ICI in gathering information about world economic trends and relating them to the broad span of business of the UK's largest manufacturing company. Sees 'fairly flat' outlook for demand over months. Gets on well with Treasury chief economic adviser Alan Budd. Kevin Mahoney, managing director, Caradon Everest double-glazing company In his fourth year as head of Everest, which is part of the MB-Caradon building products group and sells double glazing mainly to domestic sector. Did degree in politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford and worked for 15 years in office-equipment industry. Says 3-percentage-point cuts in interest rates in recent months have yet to push up consumer demand, and confidence still low. Kate Barker, chief European economist, Ford A former investment analyst in the City with the Postel investment group, Barker is another relative pessimist about how the UK economy will turn out next year. 'It's clear that the German economy is weakening and I'm afraid that will have an impact on the rest of Europe,' she says. Before working at Ford, Barker had the job of monitoring European economic trends at London-based National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Peter Davies, chief economist, BP Joined BP in 1985 after six years as an economist in London office of Chase Manhattan, the US bank. He also worked in Washington for World Bank and in Swaziland's Ministry of Finance. A relative optimist about the UK outlook, mainly because of what he sees as the strength of the North Sea energy sector. He has two degrees in economics from Warwick University and the London School of Economics. Philip Crowson, chief economist, RTZ After a 10-year stint in the chemicals industry, he has held his current job in the world's biggest mining company for 12 years. He is fairly gloomy about the outlook for next year, on the ground that even if demand in the UK improves, the economies of many of its important trading partners appear likely to be extremely weak. He says: 'If the world was a hospital ward, it would be full of a lot of sick patients.' Graham Burgess, chief planner, tobacco arm of BAT Remains unashamedly hopeful about the economy next year - he says he is 'one of the exceptions' in industry who firmly believes that the economy is turning for the better. He thinks that the upturn in output and demand when it comes could be relatively strong, leading to possible difficulties over inflation. He has spent 13 years at the BAT industrial group - before that he worked as a CBI economist. Leslie Gunde, chief economist, GKN automotive and components group Highly cautious about predicting a recovery - but says there are some hopeful signs about rising demand from recent economic indicators, such as the slight increase in retail sales volumes. Cheered also by signs that the US recovery may be strengthening. Before joining GKN he worked as a CBI economist and in the electronics and finance industries. Barry Scott, head of economics and energy policy, British Gas Far from bullish about prospects for increased output next year, he believes the economy has yet to show much reaction to the growth measures announced by the Treasury in last month's Autumn Statement. He thinks the recent cuts in interest rates 'will eventually have a big impact' in getting the economy moving. He has spent 15 years at British Gas - before that he was an accountant and statistician. David Coates, chief economic adviser, Department of Trade and Industry On the panel to ensure the DTI does not feel left out of the picture as the Treasury steps up efforts to form links with industry. Now at deputy secretary level at the department. His past responsibilities have included shipbuilding, regional policy and general industry support schemes. His civil Service career goes back to 1968, when he joined the Ministry of Technology as an economist. Sudhir Junankar, deputy economics director, Confederation of British Industry He started his career as a specialist in energy economics and has worked at CBI for five years. His main activity is in turning information from the organisation's monthly survey of industrial trends into a plausible view of the economic outlook. He says he is 'more hopeful' about the economy than he has been for some time, and believes demand is 'close to an upturn'.</p>

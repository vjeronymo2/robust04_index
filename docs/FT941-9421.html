			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strong case for reform along unitary councils line Sir, I was staggered to read your article suggesting that councils did not back the present review of local government in England ('Councils refuse to back review', February 3). I wondered whether the information in it had more to do with the effectiveness of the Association of County Councils' public relations machine than the reality. The Association of District Councils supports the review of local government and replacing the existing two-tier system with new unitary authorities. In the Cheshire review area, Chester City Council and the seven borough councils have agreed to submit a joint proposal to the Local Government Commission to replace the existing nine councils and a two-tier system with 6 unitary councils for Cheshire. Not only local authorities support these proposals. There is substantial public support for change. The Local Government Commission's own Mori poll for Cheshire shows that in Cheshire twice as many people support the new unitary councils as oppose change. This poll was supported by the city council's own recent consultation exercise. Leaflets and questionnaires were sent to nearly 50,000 households. We have received a staggering response of more than 11,000 replies, of which more than 80 per cent support the proposal for a unitary authority for Chester. A recent rigorous financial appraisal shows that unitary authorities would be cheaper than the present two-tier system. The eight district councils in Cheshire have worked jointly with consultants on a financial appraisal based on factual information provided by the county council and the district councils. That appraisal shows that scrapping the existing system and replacing it with six unitary authorities would produce annual savings of more than Pounds 9m. The pay-back period for the cost of these changes would be less than three years. The case for change in Chester and Cheshire is very strong. It is backed by public opinion and by eight of the area's nine local authorities. Robin Mosley, director of policy development, Chester City Council, The Forum, Chester CH1 2HS</p>

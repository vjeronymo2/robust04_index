			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: Wicker world - Style On the face of it, it's hard to see how the traditional wicker picnic hamper keeps going - being as it is, bulky, apt to spike the legs of the person carrying it, no good at keeping things cold and not especially strong. Yet it's hard to imagine appearing for Glyndebourne, Henley, Royal Ascot or a punt on the Cam with anything other than the inefficient old wicker basket our grandfathers used. The two most readily available ranges come from Antler (the suitcase people) and Optima, a Sussex-based company. Both can be found in John Lewis, Selfridge's and Harrods, and offer an assortment of styles and patterns, from Optima's Tropicana two-person hamper at around Pounds 75, to Antler's vast Summer Fruits model for eight, costing Pounds 850. In between lie all manner of two, four and six-person designs, including whole willow baskets, split willow baskets, baskets with flat or trunk lids and baker's baskets. The latter are basically Little Bo Peep hampers, with a large carrying handle on the top and two hinged flaps on either side. Affected, perhaps, but it does mean there's no risk of the lid bursting open and, as one Glyndebourne-goer put it: 'Dumping your coronation chicken all over the feet of one of your directors.' On the debit side, the cutlery of the Antler range can look utilitarian; likewise the tendency of both manufacturers is to put in tumblers rather than stemmed glasses. No questioning the robustness of Swaine Adeney's fitted hamper, however. Swaine Adeney, of Piccadilly, does a beautifully-made hamper for four persons, at Pounds 395; or for two persons, at Pounds 249. For this, you get French porcelain plates and mugs, good-quality leather fittings, and real exclusivity. Yet even Swaine Adeney has difficulty beating its Piccadilly neighbour, Fortnum &amp; Mason. From The Romantic, for two persons, at Pounds 135, to The Pall Mall, at Pounds 795, Fortnum's offer an extravagant variety of styles.</p>

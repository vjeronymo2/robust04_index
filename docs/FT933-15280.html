			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Strong words, weak action IN TOKYO, the world's leaders huff and puff. They reaffirm their commitment to 'the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina' - an integrity which, if it ever existed, has long since been trampled underfoot. They 'cannot agree' to a solution dictated by Serbs and Croats - neither of whom shows any sign of caring whether they agree or not. The G7 countries commit themselves to implement the Security Council resolution on safe areas for the Moslems, 'by sending troops, by air protection of the Unprofor, by financial and logistical contributions or by appropriate diplomatic action'. The operative word here is 'or'. No one should suppose that either Chancellor Kohl or President Clinton has committed himself to send troops, or that Mr Miyazawa has undertaken to send Japanese aircraft. The other leaders do perhaps intend to send more troops, but are not saying how many. Meanwhile, in Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic has cast aside the mask of moderation, openly expressing his contempt for world opinion; and in Sarajevo the World Health Organisation warns that the remaining hospital services are on the brink of collapse. The disparity between the rhetoric of world leadership and the reality of local barbarism is glaring. In 1991 the western powers showed they were able to reverse a clear case of aggression by one state against another. In the former Yugoslavia they have shown equally clearly that they are unable, or if able are unwilling, to deal with aggression and atrocity when perpetrators and victims are not separated by a clear international border. The partition of Bosnia into three zones - in itself a serious defeat for the principles on which the post cold war European order was supposed to be based - has now become the nearest approximation to a fair outcome that one can imagine. But even that rough justice will not be attained unless external powers are prepared to commit significantly larger forces than they have done so far, using them to help the Moslems secure a viable zone roughly commensurate with their numbers - and, presumably, to 'cleanse' it of those Serb and Croat residents who are unwilling to live under Moslem rule. That unpleasant obligation, which wiser and bolder policies at an earlier stage might have avoided, must not now be shirked. But the 'international community' (as it likes to call itself) need not and should not think only in terms of military options. Since the Croats are now officially recognised as partners in crime with the Serbs, they too must be subjected to sanctions. The moral effect in their case might well be greater, since President Tudjman has made much of his country's 'European' vocation, its supposedly superior civilisation, and its recognition by the world at large. Alas, the truth is that he has tolerated significantly less freedom of expression internally than has Mr Milosevic. Much more could be done to help free and objective media in all the ex-Yugoslav republics, such as the newspaper Feral Tribune recently started by a group of Croat journalists, and now hanging by a shoestring, or the courageous B92 radio station in Serbia. A ship that was broadcasting objective news to all the ex-Yugoslav republics from offshore in the Adriatic has had to suspend operations because the country whose flag it was flying withdrew permission and because of a Serbian complaint to the International Broadcasting Union. The nations that are supposedly enforcing sanctions in the Adriatic could surely offer it the protection of their flags and the hospitality of their airwaves.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Applicants seek the ability for (a) the Funds to utilize their cash reserves that have not been invested in portfolio securities to purchase shares of the Money Market Funds (each Fund, including Money Market Funds, purchasing shares of the Money Market Funds is an ``Investing Fund'') and (b) the Money Market Funds to sell or redeem their shares to or from each Investing Fund. By investing cash balances in the Money Market Funds as proposed, applicants believe that the Investing Fund will be able to combine their cash balances and thereby (a) reduce their transaction costs, since transaction costs currently incurred by the Investing Funds in connection with the short term investment of their uninvested cash would be avoided; (b) create more liquidity; (c) enjoy greater returns; and (d) further diversify their holdings. The policies of the Funds either permit or will be amended (pursuant to shareholder vote if required) to permit the Funds to purchase money market instruments, including shares of a Money Market Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The shareholders of the Investing Funds would not be subject to the imposition of double management fees. Applicants would cause each Investment Adviser and its respective affiliates to remit to the respective Investing Funds or waive investment advisory and any other fees these service providers earn as a result of the Investing Funds' investments in the Money Market Funds to the extent the fees are based upon the Investing Funds' assets invested in shares of the Money Market Funds. Further, no sales charge, contingent deferred sales charge, 12b&hyph;1 fee, or other underwriting or distribution fee would be charged by the Money Market Funds with respect to the purchase or redemption of their shares. If a Money Market Fund offers more than one class of shares, each Investing Fund will invest only in the class with the lowest expense ratio at the time of the investment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Several of the Funds have contractual or voluntary expense cap arrangements with SIT Investment for the purpose of keeping each Fund's total expenses below a certain predetermined percentage amount (``Expense Waiver''). To the extent actual expenses of the Funds exceed these caps, SIT Investment waives its advisory fee or reimburses a Fund in the amount of the excess. Any applicable Expense Waiver will not limit the advisory and other fee waiver or remittance discussed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicants also request relief that would permit the Funds to invest uninvested cash in a Money Market Fund in excess of the percentage limitations set out in section 12(d)(A)(ii) of the Act. Section 12(d)(A)(ii) prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring the securities of another investment company if, immediately thereafter, the acquiring company would have more than 5% of its total assets invested in the securities of the selling company. Applicants propose that each Fund be permitted to invest in shares of a single Money Market Fund so long as each Fund's aggregate investment in such Money Market Fund does not exceed the greater of 5% of such Fund's total net assets or $2.5 million. Applicants will comply with all other provisions of section 12(d)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act make it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such affiliated person, acting as principal, to sell or purchase any security to or from such investment company, Because each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with the other Funds, it may be an ``affiliated person,'' as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the other Funds. Accordingly, the sale of shares of the Money Market Funds to the Investing Funds, and the redemption of such shares from the Investing Funds, would be prohibited under section 17(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a transaction from section 17(a) if the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general policy of the Act. Section 17(b) could be interpreted to exempt only a single transaction. However, the Commission, under section 6(c) of the Act, may exempt a series of transactions that otherwise would be prohibited by section 17(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

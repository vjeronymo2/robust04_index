Leonid  Kravchuk's New Year's Present"]    [Text] In his New Year address to Ukrainian citizens,  Leonid Kravchuk unexpectedly broached the fairly unexpected idea  of holding a referendum on the law on authority. The president  explained that the law was designed to put an end to  misunderstanding with regard to the separation of powers in  Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk's initiative appears to be a logical  continuation of the emerging confrontation between the president  and the Ukrainian Supreme Council on the eve of the upcoming  parliamentary, and later presidential, elections. While the  parliamentarians have already put up with the ineluctability of  having to run for reelection, and preparations for the  parliamentary elections are in full swing, the Ukrainian  president does not appear too enthusiastic about going through a  similar process himself. The "party of authority" in Ukraine is  unwilling to hold early presidential elections, either, because  there is no plausible, serious alternative to Leonid Kravchuk  just the same. Given the republic's difficult economic and  political situation, however, it is far from certain that  Kravchuk is set to achieve an easy victory at the early  presidential elections.    Therefore, the ruling elite would like to insure itself  against possible surprises, but this requires unconventional  moves that will be somewhat reminiscent of the way events  evolved in Russia: the vote on a new constitution was also  proclaimed "an expression of confidence in Boris Yeltsin," hence  the question of early presidential elections in Russia fell  through by itself. The Ukrainian authorities, however, cannot  submit a new constitution to a referendum. This is why they  came up with the law on authority, which will boost presidential  powers and may turn Ukraine into a presidential republic without  making amendments to the country's fundamental law beforehand.  Should the referendum be a success, one may interpret it as an  expression of citizens' confidence in President Kravchuk and,  hence, cancel the early presidential elections after the new  deputy corps is already in place.    It is not yet clear how the president is going to hold the  referendum. Or who will draw up the law on authority: the  current parliament or a structure specially appointed for this  purpose by the Ukrainian president, and whether the chiefs of  the Ukrainian Supreme Council under its chairman, Ivan Plyushch,  will be involved in the preparation of the new referendum. If  the Supreme Council accepts President Kravchuk's initiative and  calls the referendum on the law on authority simultaneously with  parliamentary elections, it will, of course, have to draw up the  law on its own, and then presidential powers will not be as  sweeping as Leonid Kravchuk would wish. Even in this case,  however, the adoption of the law on authority would  automatically mean an expression of confidence in the president.  According to some well-informed sources close to the Ukrainian  Supreme Council's chiefs, Ivan Plyushch is unlikely to be  willing to strike a deal with Leonid Kravchuk on the referendum,  because the Ukrainian parliament speaker, as many other  politicians in the republic, would probably like to seize the  chance of early presidential elections simply to try his luck or  to remind the public of himself as Leonid Kravchuk's possible  successor, if not to win.</p>

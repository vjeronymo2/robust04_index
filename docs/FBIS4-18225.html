			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Landshut, Germany, March 31 (AFP) -- Numerous  Germans have lodged complaints of an inflammatory statement by  the leader of the extreme right-wing Republikaner party, Franz  Schoenhuber, the Landshut prosecutor's office said Thursday [31  March].    A senior official said they had received complaints from  outraged private citizens "by the pound" and expected to receive  more, after Schoenhuber's remarks about the president of the  Council of Jews in Germany, Ignatz Bubis.    He said prosecutors were studying the possibility of legal  action against the former Waffen-SS officer and member of the  European Parliament, who Saturday accused Bubis of being "the  worst inciter of race hatrid in Germany."

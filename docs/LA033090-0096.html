			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS APPROVE MARCH FOR EAST L.A.  </P> <P> The county Board of Supervisors overruled the Sheriff's Department on Thursday  and granted Chicano activists a permit to march in East Los Angeles this summer  to commemorate the 20th anniversary of a chaotic anti-war march that ended in  the death of newsman Ruben Salazar.  </P> <P> Prodded by Supervisor Ed Edelman, the supervisors on a 3-1 vote overturned the  sheriff's denial of a request for a parade permit by the Los Angeles members of  the 1990 National Chicano Moratorium Committee for a march Aug. 25 along  Atlantic and Whittier boulevards.  </P> <P> The request was rejected two months ago by sheriff's officials at the East Los  Angeles station who said the three-mile march would unduly disrupt traffic and  business along the proposed route and would cost too much. Overtime pay for  deputies was estimated at $37,400.  </P> <P> Some merchants on Whittier Boulevard also were fearful of a reoccurrence of  violence that marred the march on Aug. 29, 1970. More than 200 people were  arrested, 60 others were injured and three people died in the march's violent  aftermath. Among the dead was Salazar, then a Times columnist and news director  at Spanish-language television station KMEX.  </P> <P> Parade organizers were pleased with Thursday's decision, saying that concerns  about violence were overblown.  </P> <P> "It was a smoke-screen excuse to deny us our rights," said Carlos Montes,  co-chairman of the committee organizing the parade.  </P> <P> Eastside activist Arnulfo Casillas, the other co-chairman, added: "Our march  will be a cooperative effort involving businessmen, the community, students and  others."  </P> <P> An estimated 10,000 people may participate in the march to mark what organizers  say is a significant chapter in the modern history of U.S. residents of Mexican  descent.  </P> <P> About 20,000 protesters marched 20 years ago to decry the high casualty rate  among Chicano soldiers in Vietnam. But the march turned violent and rioting and  looting ensued along Whittier Boulevard. Businesses there suffered $1 million  in damages.  </P> <P> In the violence, Salazar died inside a bar when he was struck by a tear-gas  projectile fired by a sheriff's deputy. A coroner's inquest later found that  the newsman died accidentally, but many Chicano activists believe that Salazar,  then 42, was murdered.  </P> <P> Although other observances have been held in the past to mark the 1970 march,  some Whittier Boulevard merchants said they wanted no part of another march  this year.  </P> <P> But Edelman, whose district includes the Eastside, held two meetings in recent  weeks to allay apprehension over the march request.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F> by Charles Lambroschini in Paris; date not given: "For Poland,  Europe Is the Best Guarantee of Security"]    [Text] [Lambroschini] Poland wants to become a member of  the European Union [EU]. What is your main motive: trade or  security?    [Olechowski] Staying outside the EU today means being  condemned to economic isolation and being sidelined politically.  There is another very important reason for our candidacy: We  want to take as our model the process of reconciliation between  France and Germany. With that in mind, there is no better  framework than the EU. Poland and Germany have become very good  and very strong neighbors. Our current relations with Germany  are better than they have been at any time in our history. But  to move from this situation of good-neighborly relations to  friendship, we need a framework that goes beyond that of our  bilateral relations.    [Lambroschini] Since German unification, some French  politicians have been worried by Germany's growing power. Do  you share that anxiety?    [Olechowski] I have noticed Germany's growing power. But,  in my view, it will not be a danger as long as Germany remains a  democratic country, and we have no reason to doubt that. And as  long as Germany remains a member of the EU. In our view, the  bloc formed by Germany and France is an extremely important  factor. Now, let us take the speculation a little further and  imagine that Germany wished to increase its independence. If we  then started to think that this development was likely to have  bad consequences both for the EU and for the Franco-German  strategic alliance, the creation of a triangle with Poland could  have a beneficial effect. Poland's involvement with the  Franco-German duo would make it possible to counterbalance  Germany's growing power and to make the EU stronger.    [Lambroschini] Is the power of Russia, your other big  neighbor, not also a reason for your interest in the EU? Are  you not worried by the idea that Russia, with which your  relations have often been difficult, could return to its  imperialist tradition?    [Olechowski] On the subject of Russia, a Polish foreign  minister must necessarily be optimistic. Otherwise, he would be  doomed to paralysis. Poland must participate in the  construction of a Europe which absolutely must include Russia.  We must insist on Russia becoming an integral part of the  Western world: with its value system and its habits of  behavior. If we had to resign ourselves to the fact that Russia  could never become part of the West because it is anxious to  recreate its own world, or conversely because the West rejects  it, a Polish foreign minister would face only the sorriest of  options. Like Moses, he would have to lead his people far away,  because Central Europe would then be a very dangerous place. We  want to join the EU for reasons of security, not simply economic  reasons. However, we are convinced that Poland's security will  never be guaranteed if it has to remain a front line country.    [Lambroschini] Do you not see the development in Russia of a  nationalism which would compensate for poverty and humiliation?    [Olechowski] These periodic surges in nationalist and  imperialist fever surely represent the biggest danger in Eastern  Europe. But I also note that the political movements which  defend these ideas did not succeed in securing a majority in the  Russian elections. Today, there are two major currents running  through Russia. The privatization of the economy enables the  people to have a better understanding of the notion of private  ownership. Therefore the demarcation line -- which has  traditionally been blurred in Russia -- between reason of state  and individual interest is being more clearly defined. The  second current is Moscow's tendency to want to reintegrate the  republics of the former USSR in one entity. But, for instance,  on the occasion of the negotiations between Moscow and Belarus,  we see that the Russians are now aware of the price to be paid  for this integration. They realize that they would have to take  bread from Russian citizens and give it to the poorest  republics. This twofold development makes me optimistic about  Russia's future.    [Lambroschini] Can Poland therefore make a contribution to  Russia's European education?    [Olechowski] There is no question of Poland serving as a  bridge between East and West or between the EU and Russia. None  of those involved needs our country to play that role. Instead,  Poland should serve as an example. Showing the Russians that,  if we were capable of adapting to the West's values and  principles, Russia can too. There is nothing genetic separating  the Russians from the other Europeans.    [Lambroschini] In June 1991, Francois Mitterrand,  defending in Prague a plan for a European Confederation, stated  that the new democracies of Central Europe would have to wait  decades before being able to rejoin the European Community.  With Edouard Balladur as prime minister and Alain Juppe as  foreign minister, do you think that France has changed its view?    [Olechowski] I hope so. June 1991 was well before Poland  had demonstrated, in the 1993 elections, that its democratic  institutions were strong enough to enable political alternation.  It was well before our GDP had experienced an annual growth of  4.5 percent, well before we could show a private sector which  now represents 60 percent of employment and totals 2 million  enterprises.    [Lambroschini] But Francois Mitterrand's remark was also  explained by the fear that too rapid an integration of the  Central European countries might condemn them to economic  bankruptcy.    [Olechowski] There is certainly an enormous economic  difference between Germany and Poland. There is the same  difference between Germany and Greece. But there is not such a  great difference between Poland and Greece or between Poland and  Portugal. In other words, we are as ready for membership as  Greece and Portugal were when they were accepted into the  European Community. The second observation was that in the  foreign policy sphere, nothing would prevent Poland's immediate  membership. The time has come for the EU to consider Poland's  rapid integration in some spheres and to give it periods of  adjustment or exemptions in other spheres.    [Lambroschini] Does Poland still want to join NATO?    [Olechowski] We want to join NATO and we say so frequently.  We think that membership in NATO would be another means by  which Poland could build a united Europe. NATO ought to be  understood as the heart of European security, and this system of  security ought to be open to all countries which correspond to  the criteria of democracy.    [Lambroschini] If NATO is to be the means of European  security, are you in favor of its expansion to include Russia?    [Olechowski] We think that Russia ought to form part of the  European security system. What we advocate is a strategic  partnership between Russia and NATO.    [Lambroschini] Does the fact that Europe has demonstrated  such impotence in face of the conflict in Yugoslavia not leave  you skeptical about the security guarantees which you could  secure from the EU?    [Olechowski] That is why we are not talking of guarantees.  We do not like this word, because Poland had all kinds of  guarantees before the war and that served no purpose. We are  arguing for the European countries to work together in the  security sphere.    [Lambroschini] You therefore think that, in Yugoslavia's  case, it would have been easier to prevent the war than to stop  it once it had started?    [Olechowski] Well, I would answer you in this way: If  Yugoslavia had been a NATO member, there would have been no  conflict.    [Lambroschini] Do you agree with the Balladur plan for  stability in Europe, which stipulates as a precondition for  entry into the EU, that the Central European candidates should  first settle their minority and border problems?    [Olechowski] Our region certainly needs the Balladur plan.  But we do not like the idea that its implementation could be a  precondition for Poland's entry into the EU. We have made great  efforts. We have signed treaties of good neighborly relations  with our seven neighbors. This shows our desire for compromise.  But if this desire was lacking in one or two of our neighbors,  I do not see why Poland's entry into the EU should be called  into question.    [Lambroschini] Now that the former Communists have returned  to power in Warsaw, what guarantees can you give the EU that  they will remain faithful to democracy and to the market economy?    [Olechowski] There are no guarantees, there are only facts.  For the eight months since the Social Democrats joined the  government coalition, the observation has been clear. The  market economy has been maintained and there is no sign of the  government considering a return to a centralized system.  Privatization is continuing -- one could even say: as badly as  under the previous governments -- and I hope that it will be  speeded up between now and the fall with a massive new  privatization program. Finally, there has been no attack on  democratic principles.    [Lambroschini] Has Western Europe, which for so long  encouraged you to break with Communism, not disappointed you by  the timidity of its support since the fall of the Berlin Wall?    [Olechowski] We have not been disappointed in monetary  terms. The West's aid has been generous. Especially with regard  to Poland, which has benefited from a large amount of direct aid  and a reduction in its debt. We are very grateful for that.  But what has disappointed us is the inertia and conservatism of  the Western institutions. We are worried by the West's lack of  vision.</p>

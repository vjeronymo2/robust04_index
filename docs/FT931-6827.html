			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Industrial production in Japan falls again THE JAPANESE economy's weakness was underlined yesterday by official figures which show that industrial production is continuing to fall, while the growth in bank lending remains sluggish. Industrial production fell by 0.3 per cent in January from the previous month to stand 7.6 per cent below its level in January last year, according to a report from the industry ministry. However the monthly rate of decline in industrial production has slowed significantly since the autumn, when it was falling at a month-on-month rate of 2.9 per cent. The financial authorities regard industrial production as an important indicator of the prospects for economic recovery. They believe it will reach its trough this quarter, paving the way for a gradual pick-up in investment. Meanwhile, bank lending is still growing at an extremely low rate. Japanese banks' outstanding loans were 2.2 per cent up at the end of last year on the year before, according to the Bank of Japan. Mounting pressure on industrial companies to cut costs to boost profitability was underlined by KDD, the telecommunications operator, which announced plans to shed 800 jobs in the next five years to reduce it workforce to 5,000. The company is just completing a programme to cut 1,000 jobs. Earlier this week Nissan, the car maker, and NTT, Japan's main telecommunications group, announced plans to cut 35,000 jobs within three years.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA FROM ABROAD;  </P> <P> WHAT HAPPENS WHEN GI JOE GOES HOME?;  </P> <P> ZWEIBRUECKEN'S GIANT U.S. AIR BASE IS ON A HIT LIST. THERE GOES THE CITY'S MAIN  SOURCE OF INCOME.  </P> <P> "This is going to hit the town hard," Mayor Werner von Blon said. "It's a  situation we didn't expect."  </P> <P> Zweibruecken, a city of 35,000 people in the western Rhineland, is facing the  grim fact that its primary source of income, a giant U.S. air base, will be  shut down as part of a post-Cold War American retrenchment in Europe.  </P> <P> Some West Germans complain about low-flying warplanes and destructive military  maneuvers, but Zweibruecken, named for two medieval bridges over the  Schwarzbach, has welcomed American soldiers and Air Force personnel.  </P> <P> The air base fuels the local economy: 340 civilians work at the base, and many  more sell goods and services to it. The people of Zweibruecken rent out about  1,440 houses and apartments to servicemen and women who choose to live off the  base.  </P> <P> Mayor Von Blon figures that the base contributes $84 million a year to the  city's economy. When the Americans leave, unemployment is expected to rise  sharply, perhaps to 20%.  </P> <P> Von Blon, a stocky man with wavy gray hair, said he was upset by the abrupt  notice that the base is to close by the end of 1993.  </P> <P> "We didn't think Zweibruecken would be on the list; we don't have combat  forces," he said recently over coffee in his office. "I don't blame the local  air base people. . . . They didn't know themselves what was going to happen. It  was decided in Washington."  </P> <P> The decision was announced Jan. 26, and the people of Zweibruecken are still  adjusting. They had assumed that the base would be among the last in West  Germany to close, and -- because the economic future seemed assured -- they  received no federal aid or advice.  </P> <P> This rolling, wooded region has so many air bases it's called the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization's aircraft carrier. Zweibruecken has the 26th  Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, with RF-4C Phantoms, and the 10th Airlift  Squadron, with C-23A Sherpas.  </P> <P> There are Army supply depots, too, and the center of all this military activity  is Kaiserslautern -- "K-town," the GIs call it -- which has the largest  concentration of Americans living outside the United States, more than 70,000.  Next to government, the U.S. military is the area's No. 1 employer.  </P> <P> Air Force Sgt. Rick Schick told a visitor he was showing around the base at  Zweibruecken: "We've got about 3,600 servicemen and another 3,600 dependents. I  was really looking forward to another tour in Germany, but now we will all be  relocated."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, cranes moved back and forth nearby where new barracks were going  up. Canceling the contract would cost more than completing the buildings.  </P> <P> Sgt. Schick, 38, of Freeport, Pa., said the future of the base was not clear:  NATO might use it as a reserve field, or the West Germans might find use for  it.  </P> <P> At the Rosengarten, a restaurant patronized by American service personnel,  bartender Albert Sieg said: "We've got a cozy atmosphere. Dancing on the  weekends. . . . The Americans come in in uniform at lunchtime and in civilian  clothes at night. I guess the closure was inevitable. But when the Americans  go, it will be a big loss to the town and to this place."  </P> <P> Mayor Von Blon said that officials in Bonn will decide whether to hold on to  the property or turn it over to the local people. City officials, who expect to  inherit a 500-bed hospital that the Air Force built in the city but has never  used, have suggested that Zweibruecken could become headquarters of the  European Community.  </P> <P> "We have been host to the American military for the last 45 years," Mayor Von  Blon mused. "While the Cold War was going on, no one ever thought of them  leaving. Now, there's no question but that they will have to go.  </P> <P> "We all have mixed emotions about this. I'm happy the Cold War is over and  there is less need for guns and bombers. But I'm not happy the Americans are  leaving."  </P></p>

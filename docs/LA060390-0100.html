			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINT / COUNTERPOINT;  </P> <P> SHOULD PARK SERVICE PARTICIPATE IN SWAP?  </P> <P> Fred Maas, 32, is a developer and vice president of Potomac Investment  Associates, a Maryland-based company seeking the land exchange to enable it to  build an access road to a proposed 750-home and golf-course development on  Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County. Maas, who specializes in community and  government relations for the company, moved in 1988 from the Washington area to  Westlake Village, where he lives with his wife, Elizabeth, and their  7-month-old daughter, Katherine Claire.  </P> <P> Q. Why should the federal government approve the land exchange with your  development company?  </P> <P> A. There are benefits at several levels. First, with the new proposal that  involves Mr. Hope's properties in the Santa Monica and the Santa Susana  mountains, 80% of his property -- 5,700 acres -- would be in public ownership  and open space in perpetuity.  </P> <P> At a time when development pressures are enormous in Southern California  because of the number of people who are moving here and the scarcity of land,  it is truly incredible that we are able in one fell swoop to put that vast  quantity of land in public open space. We think it is a hard offer to turn  down. Anytime you are able to get 5,700 acres for 59, I think responsible  government officials should be willing to take a look at it, as they are here.  </P> <P> Second, the road, as we've designed it, has much less impact on the neighboring  communities than roads that could be built through other access points to our  property.  </P> <P> Q. Why would the road you have proposed be less disruptive than other roads you  could build if the land exchange is not approved?  </P> <P> A. I don't want to be in a position of saying, "if this, then that," because  that might seem like a threatening posture. But anyone who has ever been to  Jordan Ranch can see that there are a number of other access points. Old  Agoura, the community just west of the proposed road, has a very rural feel,  and any road that would require going through it obviously would change the  character of that community.  </P> <P> We have an access up through China Flat we could use, and obviously that would  have a devastating effect on the most sensitive area of our property. Certainly  that option was not preferable for us or for the conservationists.  </P> <P> Q. Could Jordan Ranch be developed if the land swap is not approved and you are  not allowed to build the access road?  </P> <P> A. Absolutely. The general plan for our property would yield about 14 160-acre  ranches or ranchettes, or about 28 80-acre ranches. That would require  dissecting the most sensitive areas of the property. There are those moderate  people in the environmental community who believe that the effect of 28 or 14  large ranches, which entirely bisect Jordan Ranch with no dedication of open  space, has much less public benefit than a plan which is well-thought-out and  well-planned and which makes available 47% to 50% of its area for public open  space.  </P> <P> One of the problems with the large ranch design is that the ranches will  typically be fenced. That brings that particular large parcel of 2,500-acres or  so out of any potential corridor for the movement of wildlife through the  mountains.  </P> <P> Ranches would also create long-term development pressures. What happens in the  year 2010 when homeowner 13 of the 14 homeowners tries to subdivide his  property? Real estate environments change over 20 or 30 years.  </P> <P> Q. If your Jordan Ranch development proposal is approved, what efforts will be  made to preserve oak trees, wildlife and other natural resources that now are  abundant on the property?  </P> <P> A. In terms of sensitivity to the environment, I think our vision is to have a  project that will be a model for all development here in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> We've done a massive redesign of the golf course so that we would not impact  the Palo Comado Creek and the wetlands in the area. The creek will be moved  only in two places, and in both of those cases, it is to save oak trees.  Wildlife in and around the golf course will be minimally impacted. We are doing  a massive oak tree restoration replanting effort.  </P> <P> Also, the public ownership of China Flat would be a key to all of this. China  Flat has been on the National Park Service acquisition list for 20 years. We've  come up with a proposal that will preserve that forever. So I think again, what  we are proposing is really responsible and would hope to serve as a model for  environmentally sensitive development in Southern California.  </P> <P> Q. Yet development at Jordan Ranch would result in the destruction of animal  and plant habitat, would it not?  </P> <P> A. Those things will be fully explored in the environmental impact studies  being done for the National Park Service and for Los Angeles and Ventura  counties. We believe that virtually any impact created by our project will  either be designed around or mitigated against.  </P> <P> We are working right now with a team of wildlife experts to come up with a plan  that facilitates animal movement in and around and through our property. One of  the key things in terms of wildlife movement is China Flat, a sort of hub for a  series of open space wheels, made up of public parks and private open space in  the surrounding areas.  </P> <P> Q. Given the fierce competition between the national park and developers for  scarce mountain land, why shouldn't the parks agencies seek to block any  development at Jordan Ranch?  </P> <P> </P> <P> A. I don't want to step on the turf of the people in the Park Service and  Conservancy, but it's getting tough. We are talking an era where money just  isn't available. It is very difficult this day and age to find substantial  holdings within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area boundaries  that park budgets can afford and that are owned by people willing to sell.  </P> <P> So I think negotiating is not the only way but certainly an important way.  Where there are developers who are willing to work with responsible park  agencies, I think it's prudent for them to be working with them. It's better to  have half than nothing, I guess.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Potomac Investment Associates wants to swap 1,100 acres of the Jordan Ranch in  eastern Ventura County for 59 acres of National Park Service land in Cheeseboro  Canyon. Potomac would use the canyon property for an access road to the ranch,  where the developer wants to build a golf course and 750 homes. That deal --  the linchpin of a larger land swap that would put a total of 5,700 acres in the  Santa Susana and Santa Monica Mountains now owned by comedian Bob Hope into  public ownership -- needs federal approval. Some environmentalists are  staunchly opposed to the land swap.  </P></p>

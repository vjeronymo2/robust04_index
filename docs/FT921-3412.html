			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: Ahold lifted by US performance HIGHER earnings in the US helped lift annual net profits at Ahold, the Dutch-based food retailer, by 13.4 per cent to Fl 275.8m (Dollars 146.7m) in 1991. The company, whose sales are evenly split between the US and the Netherlands, yesterday forecast further increases in both sales and net profit for 1992. Operating results in the Netherlands were barely changed last year at Fl 192.6m, but US operating earnings surged 54.4 per cent to Dollars 145.3m, boosted in part by the acquisition in the second quarter of a fourth supermarket chain, Tops Markets in New York state. Excluding Tops' results, US operating profit rose 24.3 per cent. Ahold, which is the Netherlands' biggest grocer through its Albert Heijn supermarket chain, is to increase its 1991 dual-currency dividend to Fl 1.05 and 40 cents a share, from Fl 1.04 and 32 cents. Group sales rose 18.5 per cent to Fl 20.8bn, with Dutch sales up 8 per cent at Fl 10.3bn and US sales up 27 per cent at Dollars 5.6bn. Excluding the Tops supermarkets, US sales growth was 5.2 per cent. Ahold said its Dutch institutional food-supply subsidiary posted an operating loss in 1991 while undergoing restructuring. The company also incurred start-up costs in Czechoslovakia, where Ahold has four pilot supermarkets which it hopes to expand to a wider network of 40 to 50 shops in the medium term.</p>

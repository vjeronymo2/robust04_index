			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Markets Report: German elections push dollar to two-year low The US dollar yesterday fell to a two-year low on the foreign exchanges as Chancellor Kohl's victory in the German elections lent support to the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar's weakness prompted talk of central bank intervention to support the currency. Analysts said the re-election of Mr Kohl had removed the last prop of support for the dollar. Market concerns that the US Federal Reserve is losing the battle against inflation are also contributing to dollar weakness. It closed yesterday in London at DM1.5036, from DM1.5201 on Friday. Earlier it had touched a low of DM1.4970 in Asian trading, below the previous 1994 low of DM1.5160. Yesterday evening it fell below DM1.50 again in New York trading. Against the yen it ended in London at Y97.85, from Y98.285. The US currency finished in New York at DM1.4980 and Y97.65. The D-Mark's performance was mixed. It finished firmer against the French franc, at FFr3.434 from FFr3.428, but was weaker against the Belgian franc, at BFr20.58 from BFr20.61. The Finnish vote in favour of EU membership lent support to the markka, which traded at FM3.078 to the D-Mark from Friday's close of FM3.0910. Sterling was also weaker against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.4168 from DM2.4207. It was firmer against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.6074 from Dollars 1.5925. In spite of the bearishness surrounding the dollar, trading volumes were not large. Analysts said customers were confused; many had seen DM1.51/52 as a potential buying opportunity, but were now put off by the bearish technical outlook. Mr Brian Marber, technical analyst, said the dollar's downward break out of its recent trading range meant 'a very large fall has become possible; I am expecting an eventual DM1.3910'. Mr David Cocker, analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said the absence of any profit-taking on the stronger D-Mark was bearish for the dollar; 'this suggests the dollar has the potential to go lower still'. This view was echoed by Mr Joe Prendergast, strategist at Paribas capital markets. He noted: 'The response of the markets reflects the fact that the last safety net for dollar bulls in 1994 has been removed.' With the German election result having been largely discounted by the market, analysts said there had not been any large-scale D-Mark buying. Although the German election result was the catalyst for the latest bout of dollar weakness, it is also the victim of market fears about US inflation. Mr Mike Rosenberg, managing director of international fixed income research at Merrill Lynch in New York, said the market feared that softer than expected US economic data last week meant the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates immediately. 'But the feeling in the market is that the Fed is already behind the curve,' he added. Declaring a 'mini-dollar crisis', Mr Rosenberg said there was evidence that the US Treasury was setting itself up for intervention to support the currency. 'We could be within 24 or 48 hours of a significant co-ordinated effort.' He said the problem was that the market was already expecting intervention, and this reduced the prospect of it succeeding. This, in turn, was a reason not to intervene, because to intervene and to fail was worse than to do nothing. Mr Rosenberg said the Fed might be trying to lure the market into believing it would not intervene. This would encourage traders to establish short positions, thus increasing the likelihood of successful intervention, as traders would be forced to cover short positions, adding impetus to the dollar's recovery. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said he doubted whether the Bundesbank would intervene to curb the D-Mark's advance. At the moment it was more likely to see the stronger D-Mark as a useful brake on German growth than as something to be resisted. In addition, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, has said there remains scope for lower interest rates. These would help to curb the D-Mark's rally. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 250m of late assistance. Earlier it had supplied Pounds 677m at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 1.15bn shortage. In Germany, the election result had no market impact on rates, with call money unchanged at 4.90/95 per cent.</p>

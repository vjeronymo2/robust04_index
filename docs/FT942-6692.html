			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (1): Canny buyers lead a modest recovery - Gerald Cadogan ponders a patchy upturn in the homes market Forecasts by estate agents that prices of prime UK properties will rise substantially this year still deter some potential sellers from instructing their agents. Savills, for example, forecast in December 1993 that prices would rise by 19 per cent by the end of this year. Although the owners of such properties have seen their FT-SE 100 shares fall in value by around 10 per cent since February, and new taxes and smaller tax reliefs are an irritation, they see a glorious vision. When home owners decide to make their long-delayed move, they will recoup their losses or even make a good gain if they bought the property long enough ago. Is this picture at the back of many vendors' minds too rosy? The answer seems to be, yes. The general recovery in house prices is modest, mirroring the modest, fragmented recovery of the UK economy - although Savills' other forecast of a 25 per cent rise in prime central London is proving closer to what is happening. The consensus among agents is of a rise, on average outside London of between 5 and 10 per cent. They see plenty of would-be buyers and do not have enough houses to satisfy them. But these buyers are canny. In general, they want value and will not pay over the odds. If there is competition they may go above the guide price for a house of quality. 'Patchy,' is how James Laing, of estate agents Strutt &amp; Parker, calls the market. 'But it is on the good side of patchy, if one can say that.' Some houses sell quickly and in excess of their guide price. Examples are Ellerker Hall, in Yorkshire (Carter Jonas, guide price Pounds 370,000), The Limes in Rochester (Strutt &amp; Parker, Pounds 190,000) and the Manor House in Princes Risborough (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, Pounds 450,000 for a 78-year lease from the National Trust). The total may be growing, to judge from the agents I talk to. The practice of popping out at the weekend to buy a house to sell on six months later - as happened in the 1980s - is dead and, I expect, will not return. The experience of the recession, and the possibility that even the well-paid may lose their jobs and be unable to fund a mortgage or pay school fees, has been a salutary fright. It is too risky now to trade in properties in which one lives, except for the occasional super-rich development in London. This caution is typical of the end of a recession, thinks John Husband, of Humberts. Although the Woolwich Building Society sees the number of families with negative equity as falling below 1m this summer, it is still a huge number and means that a mass of debt is still inhibiting people's movements. Some vendors still expect to receive what they paid in 1989 or quote a valuation they were given at the time. But houses which are priced too high deter viewers - and bidders. Stockton House, in Wiltshire, a superb Elizabethan house with rich panelling and plasterwork, which Savills sold recently, had to come down from Pounds 1m to Pounds 700,000 before buyers moved. In the end there were five firm bidders, which must reflect rising confidence as well as realistic pricing. In Sussex, Humberts relaunched Streat Place, which had been on the market for two to three years and, thanks to competition, sold it quickly for close to the guide price of Pounds 750,000 (Pounds 1m in 1992). The buyers' realism is healthy. This time, the shortage of houses on sale is not leading to ever-inflated prices, Husband says. Eventually, reluctant sellers will see that if they do hang on to get more next year, the only way they can take advantage of any higher price is to trade down to a smaller house, as retired people do. Or they can take their money from a part of the country with high prices, such as London, to where it will go further - Norfolk, for example. Low inflation in the mid to long-term is an equal deterrent to overpaying, as is the building societies' reluctance, steming from overzealous lending in the 1980s, to lend such generous multiples of income as they did then. Of course, interest rates are low and homes are more affordable than they have been for a very long time, but the tax relief is now down to 20 per cent and will be 15 per cent in 1995/96 and applies only to the first Pounds 30,000 of a mortgage. These new conditions create a new property world, where renting is again a sensible alternative, as it was before the second world war and as it remains over much of the Continent. Assured shorthold tenancies guarantee landlords' possession, while tenants conserve their capital. The Halifax and Nationwide indices bear out the picture of a gentle recovery. They concur more or less on how the different regions are doing but not on the figures. For the first quarter of 1994 both agreed that East Anglia and Northern Ireland had done well, and the north west, West Midlands and Wales worst. But Nationwide credited East Anglia with 11.1 per cent growth year on year, while Halifax allowed it only 4.3 per cent. For Wales, Halifax saw 1.3 per cent growth, and Nationwide a 5.7 per cent fall. In spite of these differences, which reflect different data bases and different ways of handling them, the indices remain a useful general guide to local variations in the market. London is another story. It is a large and fluid market, where it is easy to see if a home is for sale at thousands of pounds more than a few months ago. Prices have gone up, by an average 13.6 per cent in the year to March 1994 for prime property in central London, Savills finds, and by 5 per cent in the first quarter, with the increases spreading throughout the capital. Winkworth reports 10 per cent rises on the edge of central London (such as Hammersmith - W6, W14) in that period. Cluttons London Residential Agency estimates that the average discount of selling price to asking price fell to 2.81 per cent, down from 11.13 per cent in the last quarter of 1992. A high-class developer, such as John Hunter's Northacre, is putting its money down (more than Pounds 10m of it) by buying the freehold of Earls Terrace, W8 with its 21 listed Georgian houses. And large city bonuses are fuelling the rises in Holland Park, an urban 'village' for merchant bankers. It is fair to call this market patchy, with its buyers reluctant to pay too much, and its sellers reluctant to sell. And it is picky. There is no widespread boom. Local conditions matter most in assessing a price, for buyers and sellers. More houses are coming to market and, by the autumn, there may be many more  -which may damp further rises. Peter Lewis, of buying agent Stacks, says there is no better time than now to sell a good house in the country in the Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 550,000 range. It is a rare event when a set of chambers comes to market in Albany, London W1, home of the great, grand and artistic, from 19th century British premier William Gladstone to writer Graham Greene. Savills (071-730 0822) is selling F3, on the second and third floors at the north end of the long passage in the building known as 'The Ropewalk'. It is freehold. The guide price is Pounds 850,000. I expect competition.</p>

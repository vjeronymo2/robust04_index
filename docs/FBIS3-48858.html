			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- Kenichi Ogami,  secretary general of the International Institute of the Chuche  Idea and permanent chairman of the Japanese Society for the  Study of Kimilsongism, made public a treatise titled  "Illustrious Leader Leads the 21st Century."    The lengthy treatise underlines the significance of the  inauguration of the society for the study of works of Kim  Chong-il and its strengthening and development.    The treatise consists of "1. President Kim Il-song who has  built anthropocentric socialism", "2. Question of succeeding to  revolution is key to ultimate victory of socialism", "3.  Characteristics of Secretary Kim Chong-il in ideology and  theory, exploits and humanity" and "4. Towards inauguration of  national organization of societies for the study of works of Kim  Chong-il."    In the first part, the treatise points out that President  Kim  Il-song has founded the chuche idea, a new revolutionary idea,  with the popular masses, the subject of socio-historical  development and revolutionary movement, as the main, in a new  historical atmosphere in which the independence of the popular  masses has been strengthened and the world revolutionary  movement waged on an independent basis in the 20th century.    The building of anthropocentric socialism in Korea, the  first  of its kind in history, embodying the chuche idea is the  greatest exploit performed by President Kim Il-song for human  history.    It says:    Despite the vicious offensives and slanders of the  imperialists and reactionaries, President Kim Il-song has pushed  aside all difficulties, built socialism centred on the masses,  the only in the world, at an Asian corner and is maintaining and  developing it with pride.    However vicious the offensives and slanders of the  imperialists and reactionaries may be, Korean-style socialism  centred on the masses will never be collapsed.    Because socialism of Korea has struck deep roots among the  popular masses.    In the second part, the treatise points out that the  question  of succeeding to revolution is the key to the ultimate victory  of socialism and that it is not too much to say that all  socialist countries except Korea have failed in the question of  succeeding to revolution and the question of a successor.    It is of universal significance that Secretary Kim Chong-il  has emerged as a successor to the revolution who is carrying  forward and developing the leadership of President Kim Il-song,  the treatise says, and adds:    The right settlement of the question of succeeding to the  revolution and the question of a successor for the first time in  Korea not only provides a guarantee for the ultimate victory of  the Korean revolution but also opens a bright future ahead of  the revolutionary struggle of all countries.    In the third part, the treatise refers to the  characteristics  of ideology and theory, exploits and humanity of secretary Kim  Chong-il.    One of the exploits of Secretary Kim Chong-il in ideology  and  theory is that he has systematized and formularized the  revolutionary idea of President Kim Il-song.    He formularized the revolutionary idea of the president as  Kimilsongism, an integrated system of the ideology, theory and  method of the chuche idea, on the basis of his deep study of the  basic principle and the quintessence of the chuche idea created  by President Kim Il-song and on the philosophical principle of  the chuche idea.    The ideology, the theory and the method are components of  Kimilsongism.    The ideology systematizes the independent demand of mankind,  the theory gives a systematic exposition of the prospect, ways  and tasks to realize the independent demand of the masses and  the method systematizes the method of guidance to awaken,  organize and powerfully arouse the masses in the revolutionary  struggle.    What is important in the ideological and theoretical  contents  of the chuche idea enriched by Secretary Kim Chong-il is that he  has developed the chuche idea on a philosophical principle,  clarified the superiority of socialism to capitalism in an  all-round way and elucidated the law of social development on  the basis of the intrinsic demand of mankind.    The ideological and theoretical exploits of Secretary Kim  Chong-il lie in that he has made the masses accept the chuche  idea as their own.    A great exploit of Secretary Kim Chong-il as a leader of the  revolution is that he has strengthened the party and enhanced  its leadership role so as to bring the creativity of the masses  into full play.    The principle maintained by Secretary Kim Chong-il in  strengthening the party and enhancing its leadership role is to  establish the party's leadership system to the letter and direct  big efforts to the ideological education in the party's  activities after advancing an ideological theory.    What is outstanding in many exploits accomplished by  Secretary Kim Chong-il is that he has turned the whole society  into socio-political organism with the leader, the party and the  masses united as one.    Korea's is a society of an integral whole rallied firm  around  President Kim Il-song and Secretary Kim Chong-il. The party  finds itself among the masses and devotedly works for them  holding aloft the slogan "We serve the people!" The masses  accept the tasks set forth by the party as their vital demand  and carry them through unconditionally under the slogan "When  the party is determined we can do anything". Through the social  realities of Korea we can see the most solid unity of  collectives formed by human beings.    The high quality of humanity of Secretary Kim Chong-il as an  illustrious leader is infinite loyalty and devotion to the  leader and the party, the revolution and the people, stronger  sense of respect for the revolutionary seniors than others' and  boundless love for the comrades and the people.    All the activities of Secretary Kim Chong-il are  characterized by politics of love and trust.    "Belief in people as in heaven": To regard the people as the  heaven was the motto of President Kim Il-song, while Secretary  Kim Chong-il has respected the people as the greatest and takes  it as his creed to regard them as the heaven.    As the Korean people actually feel that Secretary Kim  Chong-il who is devotedly working for the people is, indeed, a  genuine leader of the people, they hold him in high esteem on  the basis of their faith and will.    In the fourth part, the treatise points to the tasks to  firmly build up and expand the organization of the societies for  the study of works of Kim Chong-il in an organizational and  ideological way.    The world will, in the future, usher in a new era when the  chuche idea is applied in an all-round way and brought into full  play under the guidance of Secretary Kim Chong-il. Without  learning from Secretary Kim Chong-il it is impossible to look  forward into a new era of mankind.    It is necessary to push ahead with the work of studying and  disseminating the chuche idea with a bright prospect for the  future and a clear cut method to shape it out, deeply learning  from the ideology and theory, exploits and humanity of Secretary  Kim Chong-il.    On the basis of the achievements we the entire members of  the  society will inaugurate the national organization of the  societies for the study of works of Kim Chong-il on the occasion  of the February 16, 1994, the 52nd birthday of secretary Kim  Chong-il by vigorously pushing on with the work to inaugurate  the society for the study of works of Kim Chong-il in all  regions and among the people of various strata.    The inauguration of the national organization of the  societies for the study of works of Kim Chong-il will be a  turning point in exerting a big ideological influence on the  activities of studying and disseminating the chuche idea in  Japan and the social movement as a whole and serve as a banner  showing how the study and dissemination of the chuche idea will  be conducted in the world.</p>

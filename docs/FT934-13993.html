			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Two engineering consultancies join to embrace water, transport and power MOTT MACDONALD, one of the UK's largest engineering consultancies, is negotiating to acquire Ewbank Preece, the Brighton-based company that is the leading UK consultancy in the international power market. The deal would create the UK's biggest multi-disciplinary engineering consultancy and one of the largest in the world, with nearly 5,000 employees and annual turnover nearing Pounds 200m. Both are private companies and terms of the proposed acquisition are undisclosed. It is hoped to complete the deal by the end of the year. Mott, based in Croydon, was formed in 1989 through the merger of Mott, Hay &amp; Anderson, transportation experts, with MacDonald, water industry specialists. Mr Jeffrey Turnbull, chairman of Mott, said yesterday the company had a long-term strategy to cover water, transportation and power - the third main sector for consultancy work, where its current presence is small. A broader spread of industries is important for large consultancies, as it increases their ability to offset downturns in one sector with better conditions elsewhere. A merger would also give Mott a presence in the fast-growing Asian market for power projects, where Ewbank Preece has been active. The deal would involve Mott buying the engineering consultancy from a new holding company, County Union, which will retain Ewbank Preece's property and hotel interests. Mr Turnbull said there was little overlap between the two engineering consultancies, apart from in central service functions. Mott is much the larger of the two companies, with 3,500 staff in more than 50 offices worldwide and expected turnover this year of Pounds 150m. Ewbank Preece has more than 1,400 staff in 40 offices worldwide, and had turnover of Pounds 37m in the year ended March. Both companies have pre-tax profits margins of about 7 per cent. Mr George Cummings, chairman and chief executive of Ewbank Preece, said that together the two companies would form a powerful group, well placed to lead its chosen markets. Mott's recent large projects include Hong Kong's new airport terminal and Lantau Fixed Crossing, and CrossRail and the Jubilee Line extension in the UK.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By So Chae-kyu] </F>   [Text] Washington, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- Most "Korea  watchers" here, noting the latest developments in the North  Korean nuclear dispute, say it should not be viewed simply as a  tug-of-war between Washington and Pyongyang but as part of an  overall U.S. strategy for the Asia-Pacific region. In other  words, those laboring under the impression that the United  States is being intimidated by North Korea are making the  mistake of looking at the trees but not the forest, they say.  They also argue that it is wrong to assume that President Bill  Clinton's administration is unable to forge a consistent policy  on North Korea as it is busy looking over its shoulder at the  hawks in the Defense Ministry and the Central Intelligence  Agency. The White House may even be trying to give that  appearance, they say.    In a nutshell, the White House is attempting to maintain and  protect its controlling position not only on the Korean  peninsula but also in the whole of Asia by playing "the North  Korea card" to the fullest, they say.    One has to keep in mind, they advise, that the North Korean  nuclear issue has been dragged out since Washington's interest  in the region and Pyongyang's urgent need for improved relations  with America have meshed nicely. Of course, unexpected events  and the interests of China and Japan tended to complicate the  issue, but in the end, the compromise worked out by Washington  and Pyongyang appears to have gone as planned by both sides.  Banking on its anxiety, South Korea could have been made to  play the game, probably unwittingly, by the White House, some  analysts say.    Certain diplomatic sources in Washington question how  accurately the South Korean Government has been "reading the  minds" of President Clinton and his staff at the White House.  As one example of Seoul's inability to divine the White House's  intentions, the sources cite the aborted visit to North Korea by  Rep. Ronald Dellums.    Even after Dellums' scheduled trip to Pyongyang was  announced, South Korean Foreign Ministry officials were said to  be skeptical of the visit ever coming off. They reportedly  wondered: Would it be necessary when North Korea had already  accepted outside inspection of its nuclear facilities?    Some South Korean officials were even said to be betting on  Dellums' visit being cancelled, which has indeed happened. In  any event, it wasn't for nothing that North Korea singled out  Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and "an  influential dove" in the U.S. Congress, and invited him to visit  Pyongyang at this crucial juncture, they say. The White House  says Dellums' planned visit had nothing to do with the U.S.  Government, but no one in Washington would take this statement  seriously, the analysts say.    One American Korea watcher said North Korea has "earned" a  one-year lease on life by agreeing to allow the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect its facilities. It is  thus time for South Korea to be really alert and pursue policy  bearing its own interests in mind, they say.</p>

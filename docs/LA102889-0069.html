			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINDU 'FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS'  </P> <P> Divali, also spelled Dipawali, will be observed Sunday by Hindus. Called the  "festival of lights," it culminates a festive period of nearly two weeks.  </P> <P> TRADITION: Although Hinduism varies in traditions and celebrations according to  regional and language differences, most Hindus consider Lakshmi, the goddess of  prosperity, as the main patroness of the festival. Merchants, for whom the  holiday is especially important, begin their new year from this point.  </P> <P> OBSERVANCES: The central ritual is the lighting of lamps and lights inside and  outside homes. A temporary altar containing symbols of wealth -- coins,  ornaments and shells -- is built to welcome Lakshmi inside one's home. Gifts of  candy and other sweets are exchanged. Rites will be performed at most Hindu  temples today and Sunday.  </P></p>

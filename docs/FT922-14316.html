			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Miners back industrial action YORKSHIRE miners' leaders yesterday voted unanimously to back a campaign for industrial action in support of colleagues at Markham Main colliery at Armthorpe. NUM members at the South Yorkshire pit are in dispute with British Coal over the use of contractors instead of their own established teams in two underground developments. They have been taking selective strike action after a ballot but called for support from the rest of the coalfield.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / NY Trade Centre partly reopens after blast: Two-thirds of workers estimated to be displaced following bomb OFFICE WORKERS jostled with television crews and emergency services yesterday as Manhattan's World Trade Centre partly reopened after Friday's bomb blast which killed five people. Mr Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the complex, estimated that about two-thirds of the 50,000 people who normally work there had been displaced. He confirmed that it would be at least another week before the complex's 110-storey twin towers reopened, but said there was no fresh information on who was responsible for the bomb. Police said about 55 calls claiming responsibility had been received. Many of the hundreds of financial firms based in the complex had used the weekend to shift operations to other offices. Deloitte &amp; Touche, the international accountancy firm which normally has 1,200 people working from seven floors of One, World Trade Centre, one of the towers, said it was temporarily housing them in its Broadway office. Deloitte said it had been allowed into the towers on Sunday to retrieve urgent files, and the only visible damage was from smoke. 'There's a fine soot on the computer equipment, but we won't know whether that's affected the hardware until we turn it on,' an official said. Salomon Brothers, the big US investment bank based in Seven, World Trade Centre, said yesterday it planned to convert one of its computer rooms into a temporary trading floor for 200 'displaced' Cantor Fitzgerald employees. Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, based in One, World Trade Centre, is the largest interdealer bond broker. Dean Witter Reynolds, the brokerage firm and largest single tenant of the complex, said it had relocated 4,500 employees to six company offices in New York and three more in New Jersey. It said its trading operations were running normally. US firms were not the only ones affected. Some subsidiaries of foreign financial services firms based in the twin towers also faced disruption. Commerzbank Capital Markets normally has about 50 people working out of One, World Trade Centre. They were attempting to move across West Street, to the bank's offices in the separate World Financial Centre complex. New York's futures exchanges, which share a single trading floor at Four, World Trade Centre, managed to open for abbreviated sessions yesterday, and most hope for business as usual today. However, the New York Mercantile Exchange, where most of the world's crude oil is priced, is again planning delayed openings and early closes. The New York Commodity Exchange operated in a make-shift environment, but spirits were high on the trading floors. Traders particularly enjoyed the fresh air being pumped onto the trading floor to compensate for lost air conditioning. The New York commodity exchanges provide the world's largest markets for crude oil, coffee, sugar and cotton and are important trading centres for precious metals such as gold and platinum. World prices for these commodities are set in New York, making it essential that trading time is not lost. Meanwhile, early morning commuters to the WTC found transport running almost normally. The Port Authority stressed that there had been no structural damage to the twin towers. New York state officials said a Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.5m) programme had been set up to assist small and medium-sized businesses displaced as a result of the blast. Mr Richard Leone, chairman of the Port Authority board, said: 'Obviously, we're suspending rent.' Insurers brace for bomb damage claims, Page 3</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Clinton sees 'danger' in health costs President Bill Clinton yesterday warned that it would prove impossible to cut social welfare spending without first attacking healthcare costs. Next year, the US states, for the first time, would be spending more on health programmes than on education, he said. This was 'a serious danger signal' for the whole country. His forum was a 'town meeting' on federal entitlements, at Bryn Mawr college in suburban Philadelphia. Mr Clinton came to office promising the end of 'welfare as we know it'. He has already appointed a bipartisan commission to propose necessary reforms. He has frequently spoken of the possibility of putting a two-year limit on welfare payments, after which recipients would have to take public service jobs. But the main thrust of his largely unscripted, 45-minute lecture yesterday was again on healthcare. Medicare and medicaid programmes combined, he noted, accounted for about 30 per cent of the total entitlement budget, second only to the 43 per cent consumed by social security payments to the elderly. Discretionary welfare spending, on the other hand, amounted to a mere 2 per cent of entitlement spending, with an additional 4 per cent taken by the food stamp poverty programme. The current average monthly welfare benefit, he said, was lower in real terms than it was 20 years ago, and was only costing more because of the growth in the number of poor people. He quoted approvingly a Washington Post editorial yesterday which cited medicare and medicaid as the 'real budget busters.' From 1994-98, he said, the health care slice of the budget, in real terms, was projected to rise by about 5.5 per cent and social security by 2 per cent, against a 5 per cent decline in defence spending and a 2.5 per cent drop in general entitlements. In the current fiscal year, entitlements, dominated by health care and social security, comprise about 47 per cent of the overall US federal budget, versus 21 per cent for defence, 18 per cent for non-defence discretionary spending, and 14 per cent for repayment of the national debt.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Four carriers unveil joint venture plan FOUR medium-sized European airlines - Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines - yesterday moved closer to integration by announcing plans to set up a jointly-owned company with a single management and balance sheet by next year. The proposal would result in SAS, KLM and Swissair each holding 30 per cent of the new company and Austrian Airlines 10 per cent. The airlines are seeking to become a 'fourth force' in the deregulated European market alongside the 'big three' - British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa of Germany. Their combined operations would employ more than 70,000 employees and carry about 36m passengers a year, making it Europe's largest airline group. The venture reflects the trend towards consolidation in the European airline industry in response to greater liberalisation and globalisation of the international airline market. Pressure has mounted on the four medium-sized carriers to establish close alliances to strengthen their competitive position as larger European rivals expand their global reach through co-operation agreements and equity investments in other carriers. BA recently acquired a 24.6 per cent stake in USAir and a 25 per cent stake in Qantas, the Australian carrier, while Lufthansa is negotiating a co-operation agreement with American Airlines. SAS said the four airlines wanted to establish 'a profitable, global airline' with an integrated traffic system based on a multi-hub European network, including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Geneva, Oslo, Stockholm, Vienna and Zurich. The Scandinavian carrier said the proposal, which emerged after a two-month study by 16 working groups set up by the four companies, would now be considered by managements and owners of the four airlines. The target was to sign a memorandum of understanding, setting out the direction of co-operation, by late June and to establish a new management company by next year. The four airlines would initially retain their identities, although they might also share a common branding. The head office of the new company would be in Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Vienna or Zurich. An SAS official said the proposal, though formally one of a number, was 'the most feasible way forward'. But he said it would not necessarily lead to a full merger.</p>

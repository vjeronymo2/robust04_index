			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH REFUSES TO LET SUPERPOWER SUMMIT SPOIL HOLIDAY WEEKEND;  </P> <P> FOREIGN AFFAIRS: THE PRESIDENT SPENDS THE DAYS BEFORE GORBACHEV'S ARRIVAL ON  THE FAIRWAY INSTEAD OF IN THE BRIEFING ROOM. 'I DON'T DETECT THAT HE'S A  CRAMMER,' ONE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL OBSERVES.  </P> <P> Four days before Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives in Washington,  the President of the United States was on the fairway Saturday, joined by his  secretary of transportation -- the two of them aggressively pursuing a weekend  of recreation.  </P> <P> The President's predilection for golf in even the foulest of weather has led  him to the links in near gales and wintry gloom. But on this day, he was  blessed with crystalline sunshine on a becalmed afternoon at the Maine  seashore.  </P> <P> If the weather was remarkable for the President's four-day Memorial Day  holiday, his golf game was not, and the topics of the day -- Soviet SS-18  missiles, the dilemma posed by German reunification, the Kremlin's objections  to Baltic independence and the obstacles to greater U.S.-Soviet trade -- were  just so many pages in the thick briefing books he carried up from Washington.  </P> <P> Is this any way to get ready for a superpower summit?  </P> <P> If you are George Bush, it most certainly is.  </P> <P> "I don't detect that he's a crammer," a senior White House official said  Saturday in a world-class display of understatement.  </P> <P> It is to Kennebunkport and hamlets like it up and down the rocky coast that  many of the well-heeled residents of Boston, New York, Philadelphia and  Washington and their suburbs have flocked each summer for the better part of  the century. Although schools do not let out for several more weeks, and the  nighttime temperatures still dictate an extra blanket on the bed, the Memorial  Day weekend marks the start of The Season -- for the innkeepers, lobster shacks  and T-shirt salesclerks who depend on the steady flow of summer people. And for  George Bush, too.  </P> <P> Just as Ronald Reagan returned to California for rejuvenation throughout his  eight years in the presidency, Bush recharges himself in Kennebunkport. He just  does it at a pace that would wear out the batteries on others.  </P> <P> So this is what he did Saturday:  </P> <P> * He reviewed his national security and intelligence briefing, a daily report  updating him on events around the globe.  </P> <P> * Aboard his blue-hulled speedboat Fidelity, he crashed about the North  Atlantic, through a moderate chop that lapped against the shores of his  storybook home.  </P> <P> * He played tennis on his private court. (He won, he claimed).  </P> <P> * He played horseshoes. (Ditto).  </P> <P> * He played golf, of course. (Ditto).  </P> <P> And it was on the golf course -- the first tee of the Cape Arundel Golf Club,  to be exact -- where the business of recreation and the business of the  presidency collided.  </P> <P> In the days before the summit, which gets down to business Thursday after  Gorbachev's Wednesday evening arrival in Washington, the air is fairly electric  with signal-sending.  </P> <P> In the view of Administration officials, Gorbachev's seemingly alarming threat  on Friday -- to pull the Soviet Union back from talks intended to reduce  conventional arms in Europe if the West persists in its demand that a unified  Germany retain West Germany's membership in NATO -- was pre-summit posturing  intended to send a message of resolution directed as much to his own right  flank and still-powerful Soviet military professionals as to the West.  </P> <P> Reacting to it for the first time in public Saturday, Bush changed his approach  not one iota from what he had said Thursday, one day before the threat was  aired.  </P> <P> "Now that's . . . a subject for real discussion, and my job is to convince him  that there is no threat to the Soviet Union from a united Germany in NATO,"  Bush told reporters as he was about to tee off.  </P> <P> "Really I can make the case that it is in their interest. So that's what we'll  be talking about," Bush said.  </P> <P> "They have a different position than we do right now. I think it's going to  take a while before we have agreement on how a post-German-unification Europe  looks," he said.  </P> <P> Eight months ago, the presidency, presidential golf and superpower summitry  were similarly entwined on the same golf course.  </P> <P> On a blustery September afternoon, Bush took a telephone call there from  Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who reported from Jackson Hole, Wyo.,  that he and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had just reached  agreement on holding the summit conference that is about to begin.  </P> <P> Did he crack open his briefing books? Yes, reported deputy national security  adviser Robert M. Gates.  </P> <P> But did he spend much time with them? Bush was asked on the golf course.  </P> <P> "Not much," he confided.  </P> <P> "Brought two big fat ones," he added, with a disapproving frown that suggested  he thought he should be spending more time hitting the books.  </P> <P> The seasons have nearly gone full cycle since the summit was first announced.  In the late spring of northern New England, the forsythia, tulips and jonquils  that faded two months ago in Washington are painting the landscape with precise  dots of red and yellow.  </P> <P> In the interim since September, Bush has met at the storm-tossed Malta summit  with the Soviet leader. His secretary of state has met in Washington and Moscow  with Shevardnadze. While a summit may focus attention on the superpower  relationship, the issues with which it deals are never a great distance from  the top of a presidential agenda.  </P> <P> Thus, positions are constantly being updated, and although the President has  met in recent weeks with a variety of academics and other experts from within  the Administration, preparations for this week's meetings are "careful but  fairly relaxed," a Bush aide said. "There's not a rush-rush. It's a fairly  steady diet."  </P> <P> The final briefings will wait until Tuesday and Wednesday, after Bush returns  to the White House.  </P></p>

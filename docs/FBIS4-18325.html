			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [F. Neumann report: "Investment in the New Laender: </F> Slowdown in Industry, Expansion in Services"]    [Text] The Ifo Investors' Account for eastern Germany  gives an overview of sectoral developments of investments in the  new laender. For 1991, 1992, and 1993 the figures were  calibrated to the (provisional figures) of the official  statistics. In the total amounts the Ifo calculations for all  these years are slightly above the official values. This is  primarily due to a somewhat more positive assessment of trends  in the important tertiary sector. For the 1994 projection, the  basis of information was the investment plans of west and east  German investors in the major economic sectors. These Ifo  survey results were supplemented by assumptions on further  trends in business startup investments and completed with the  help of various information on foreign investment activity,  investment in the Trust Agency realm and the vital area of  green-field investments.  <H5>  1993: Strong Investment Growth Persists </H5>   In 1993, investments in the new laender (including eastern  Berlin) grew vigorously. As the results of the Ifo Investors'  Account for eastern Germany show, overall investment in plants  and equipment in 1993 was more than DM140 billion and thus about  one-fifth higher than in 1992. Investment activity in the new  laender was therefore much more favourable than in western  Germany. Compared to 1992, when investments in eastern Germany  increased by one-third, the growth rate, as expected,  decelerated. In the tertiary sector investments expanded at an  above-average rate (by about two-fifths). This expansion was  mainly attributable to the sectors "housing" and "other  services." The emphasis in housing was on renovation, although  new housing construction is gaining in importance.    The umbrella category "other services" contains various  activities such as hotels and gastronomy, liberal professions,  human and veterinary medicine, leasing and investment management  companies, commercial developers, consumer services (e.g., dry  cleaning and laundries), and commercial services (e.g.,  engineering consultants, business consultants). In this diverse  sector there was a strong upturn in construction activity (new  hotels, establishment of industrial estates).    Construction also displayed above-average investment gains.  Despite complaints of sluggish approval procedures and delays in  public contract awards, contractors are profiting from pent-up  demand in the infrastructure realm and especially from necessary  renovation of the housing stock, which is providing strong  stimulus to small and medium-sized businesses.    In the other sectors, investment growth has slowed down  considerably. Investment in plant and equipment in  manufacturing, transportation, communication and the public  sector (including nonprofit organizations) exceeded last year's  levels by about one-tenth. The originally much more positive  investment plans in manufacturing were thus not fully achieved.  The slowdown in transportation and communications was, not  surprising, considering the unusually strong expansion in 1992  by the German Post Office (Telekom). Budget constraints slowed  down investment growth in the public sector. In the energy  sector (including mining) the long-standing conflict over east  German energy-supply contracts has curbed an originally much  more positive development.    Ascertaining investments in commerce is particularly  difficult. On the one hand, the expansion and modernization of  existing locations is continuing, especially by western Germany  retail chains, and logistic facilities are being expanded.  However, extensive new construction volume and considerable  (and controversial) expansion of commercial space is going to  newly constructed, green-field industrial estates. In most  cases, these major projects are not built by the trading  enterprises themselves but by special project groups, real  estate funds, or developers, and then leased out. With the  normal determination of investments according to the ownership  principle, a large portion of investments used by trading firms  (especially real estate) does not appear under commerce but  under the owner in the service sector. For this reason the 1993  investment figures for commerce will at best match last year's  levels.  <H5>  Decelerated Growth in 1994 </H5>   The Ifo calculations point to continued investment growth in  the new laender, albeit at a slower pace than in 1993.    Present plans indicate that 1994 investments will amount to  over DM160 billion, nearly 15 percent more than in 1993. The  service sector will continue its above-average growth, whereas  investments in the producing sector (energy and water supply,  mining, manufacturing, construction) will only expand by  one-tenth due to the expected stagnation of capital expenditure  in the manufacturing industry.    In 1991 and 1992, investment in manufacturing grew rapidly,  but in 1993 it was clear that west German investors especially  were holding back due to the economic downturn. Some planned  investments were postponed, others delayed. In 1994 for the  first time, west German spending in the industry of the new  laender will no longer reach the volume of the previous year.    The favourable demand situation in construction, however,  should lead to continuously increasing investments. The  energy/mining sector should increase its capital expenditure by  a relatively strong 20 percent in 1994, especially as a result  of the noticeably stepped-up investment activities in  electricity supply and district heating and, in the wake of  initial privatization successes, also in mining.    Spending in the transportation and communication sector  will grow by about one-tenth to DM26 billion. Deutsche Bahn AG  in particular will further intensify its investment activities  in the new laender (expansion and modernization of the railway  system). The investments of Bundespost will show slight growth  after having reached new heights last year. Increased spending  is also expected in the sector of "other transportation"  (private road haulage and parcel deliveries, airports, travel  agencies).    Service enterprises will again strongly increase their  capital expenditure (by one-quarter, on average). Whereas the  banking and insurance investment boom, which began immediately  following the mid-1990 Economic and Currency Union, is now over,  expansion in other services continues.    In the housing sector, a spending plus of nearly 30 percent  is expected, with a stronger focus on new housing construction  alongside modernization and renovation. A strong pace of  expansion is again anticipated in the sector of "other  services." True, the nearly one-third growth will not be as  high as in 1993, but a later upward correction cannot be ruled  out due to difficulties in assessing exactly when investments  will be made in existing and new industrial estates.  <H5>  Per Capita Investment in Eastern Germany Surpasses the </H5> Western Level    The stronger expansion of investment in the new laender has  meant that in 1993 for the first time per capita investments in  eastern Germany (nearly DM9,100) were higher than in western  Germany (nearly DM9,000). For 1994, calculations indicate per  capita spending of DM10,350 in the east compared to DM9,300 in  the west. The sectoral distribution shows that the per capita  western levels were visibly surpassed in 1992 in the sectors of  transportation and communication, state, and producing  industries. In contrast, per capita spending in housing still  remains clearly below the western level. Also clearly below  western levels is per capita spending in the services.  <H5>  Slower Pace of Western Involvement </H5>   The restructuring process in the new laender is primarily  being supported by the engagement of western investors, who are  transferring not only capital but technical know-how and  managerial experience. With the growing economic linkages  between the two parts of Germany, a separate determination of  west German investment in the new laender is becoming  increasingly difficult.    The latest calculations of the Ifo Institute indicate that  west German and foreign firms (excluding housing) invested  nearly DM50 billion in the new laender, nearly a 20-percent  increase in 1992. West German and foreign investment is also  expected to increase in 1994, albeit at a weaker pace. Present  calculations forecast spending of nearly DM55 billion, about  one-tenth more than in 1993. In the sectoral distribution of  spending, the trend observed in 1993 holds on. Whereas spending  continues to expand in the energy/mining and construction  sectors, current plans indicate that west German and foreign  investment in manufacturing will fall slightly below last year's  levels for the first time. This slight decline conceals a  relatively strong plunge in west German firms' investments,  whereas the "genuine" foreign investment activity will most  likely increase as a result of special developments in  chemistry, iron and steel, and paper and board production. Due  to a high starting level, western investments in the  transportation and communication sector will only increase  slightly, and commerce should record a decline. Strong  expansion of western investment is again expected in the  services (excluding housing). This development is solely  attributable to the area of "other services" (especially  industrial estates, new hotel construction, and other major  projects).    Although the investments of western companies will expand at  a slower pace, they will continue to make a major contribution  to growth in total capital expenditure in the new laender. In  1993, 57 percent of investments in the east German business  sector (excluding housing) came from west German and foreign  investors (1991: 44 percent, 1992: 56 percent). Of note is that  investments of Deutsche Bahn AG in the new laender (Reichsbahn)  have come from a special federal fund and have not been included  in western business investment. If this area is included, the  share of western investment in the business sector increases to  more than 60 percent.</p>

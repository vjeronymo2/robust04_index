			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Guillermo Endara with foreign </F> and domestic correspondents at the Presidential Palace in Panama  City on 9 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Radio KW Continente correspondent Carmen  Villamonte] President Endara, Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has  formally conceded Ernesto Perez Balladares' electoral victory.  What is your opinion on this and what future do you see for the  Arnulfist Party?    [Endara] Ernesto Perez Balladares' victory is  unquestionable.  Dona Mireya has recognized this because she is an honest  politician who believes in and defends the truth. She does not  believe in maintaining an air of uncertainty. Furthermore, this  democracy we saw in full bloom yesterday, and of which all  Panamanians are proud, needs candidates such as her, who can  tell the truth for the good of the nation. I congratulate her  for this.    I also recognize Perez Balladares' victory. To prove this, I  have invited Mr. Perez to come and talk with me. In the first  place I will congratulate him and then I wish to offer him a  transition mechanism to ensure that the transfer of power can be  accomplished most efficiently. When he assumes power on 1  September he will be aware of everything and anything about  public administration he so desires.    [Villamonte] How do you view the fact that the government  parties were unable to unite to face the Democratic  Revolutionary Party [PRD]?    [Endara] I believe it was because of the stubbornness of one  man, who believed himself to be superior to all other  Panamanians. I am especially fond of this man, but I believe he  was responsible for the Civilists not retaining power.    [Villamonte] The Arnulfist Party has said it will become an  opposition party and Mr. Ruben Carles has said he will lead that  opposition party.    [Endara] We Arnulfists, and I speak as one because I can now  that the election is over, cannot accept any leadership other  than an Arnulfist leadership. I can tell you that, although  Mireya is the one who should, because she is the leader of the  party and the president. I, as an Arnulfist, submit myself to  her authority.    [Villamonte] Mr. Perez Balladares....    [Unidentified correspondent, interrupting] [Question  indistinct]    [Endara] I wanted to address that issue, and I would like to  do that now. I think that there was a lot of emphasis placed on  the fact that the elections were very good, and they were. This  is reason enough to be proud.    We are proud of the elections, but there is something that  happened in the election campaign and on the same day of the  elections that is worthy of being criticized, that is worthy of  being criticized. [repeats himself] In this regard I believe  the election polls turned out to be what we were claiming. They  were totally manipulated and were fraudulent. They were  manipulated to make people believe that the one who actually  came in fourth place was in second place. The one who was in  first place actually came in first place and in that regard the  polls were not manipulated, but the polls made people believe  that his lead was very large. Those polls were manipulated  against Mireya Moscoso de Gruber to favor the person who  actually came in fourth place. It was obvious, obvious that the  polls were manipulated and fraudulent. After meditating on it  for a while, I do not think we could prohibit polls because we  would restrict freedom of expression and that is inadvisable  under any concept. Freedom of expression cannot be repressed.  I believe, however, that the Panamanian people must learn the  lesson of 1994 and when the 1999 elections come they should pay  no attention to the polls whatsoever because those polls are  conducted by persons without any scruples to fool the people.    [Villamonte] [Question indistinct]    [Endara] I am going to propose the topic of the transition.  That is the fundamental topic I am going to propose. I believe  Dr. Perez Balladares may want to talk about some topics that may  interest him. I will gladly answer his questions. It is a  meeting without an agenda, we can say.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, do you believe  that with a PRD government back in power, freedoms will be  restricted?    [Endara] I must confess that for a long time I feared this  would occur. Today I am cautiously optimistic, optimistic with  reservations, that Dr. Perez Balladares has good intentions. I  hope he will fulfill his promise to maintain this democracy and  the country's freedoms. I hope we do not return to the military  times. I sincerely believe, it but I must admit that the  optimism is under inventory benefit, as lawyers say. I and  other Panamanians are going to be vigilant and I hope the media  will also be vigilant, taking care of our freedoms and our  democracy, which we cannot lose. While Perez Balladares remains  on the path of democracy, respect for freedom, respect for  civilist or nonmilitary ideas, we are not going to be an  obstacle.    On the contrary, we will do everything within our power to  contribute, but if he strays from that path you can rest assured  there will be a group of Panamanians to oppose him and the  Arnulfist Party will be in that group. We will firmly oppose  any deviation from the proper path.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Carlos Fazio: "Haiti, Clinton To Sacrifice Cedras"] </F>   [Text] [No dateline as received] At last, the Clinton  administration seems ready to stage its democratic show in  Haiti. For the friends of future surgical intervention aimed at  ousting General Raoul Cedras and his military command from power  -- under the umbrella of a "multilateral force" comprising  English-speaking Caribbean countries and organized by the  Pentagon -- word got out that Washington is promoting "a golden  exile" for those that were once its allies. The administration  sponsors, protects, and, if necessary, sacrifices its allies,  but it sometimes -- as seems to be the current case -- protects  them when they fall from grace. It is no secret that, when  Jean-Claude Duvalier fled, the U.S. State Department prepared a  "democratic transition" for the island that was to become  legitimized by free elections, of course. Washington had its  candidate for the first clean elections following several  decades of the U.S.-backed Duvalier dictatorship.    The only thing was that it did not take imponderable factors  into consideration and lost. The majority of the people of Haiti  voted for a man who won the masses with his charisma, a Salesian  priest, and supporter of the doctrine of liberation, who is  therefore at odds with Karol Wojtyla [Pope John Paul II].    From the day of Jean-Bertrand's victory, the U.S.  intelligence community began to conspire to oust him. Aristide  barely lasted seven months in power. The man who toppled him,  General Raoul Cedras, has close ties with the Pentagon. He did  not act, therefore, on his own initiative.    One must keep in mind that during the republican  administration of George Bush, Haiti was handled under the Cold  War perception, and a sign of that was the presence of Alvin  Adams in the U.S. mission in Port-au-Prince. He is a man with  outdated views, a career diplomat who was in Saigon and served  as assistant secretary to Henry Kissinger, former U.S. secretary  of state. An expert on the counterinsurgency struggle, Alvin  coordinated matters against terrorism at the State Department  from 1987 to 1989. It was no coincidence, either, that the  first one to be promoted to chief of the coupist junta was Marc  Charles, who served as military attache in Washington, although  the decision was later rescinded.    There are sufficient elements that show the U.S. double  standard. While condemning the coup, it sent signals to the  members of the de facto government that they were allies.    The UN and OAS involvement, as well as the active  participation of France and Venezuela, which have specific  interests in Haiti, in search of a solution that would restore  constitutional rule with the ouster of the coupists and the  reinstatement of Aristide, complicated Washington's original  plans.    The double standard remained a constant. That way, while on  the one hand an apartment was arranged for Aristide in  Washington and he was given facilities to maintain his own  activities as president in exile, on the other hand, the CIA was  orchestrating a dirty propaganda campaign against Aristide,  depicting him as a messianic madman, who instigated the practice  of "necklacing" -- inserting victims in burning tires -- against  men in uniform.    Today, confused by his own contradictions and encumbered by  several unresolved international conflicts, Clinton seems to be  determined to find a cheap solution to the Haitian problem.    It all seems to indicate that there will be an end to the  crisis in the short-term. THE MIAMI HERALD newspaper reported  that a true invasion of secret agents has taken place on the  island. "Every U.S. espionage service has sent its agents and  collaborators to the Caribbean island," the newspaper reported.  Obviously, they did not go to Port-au-Prince as tourists.    Likewise, a confidential CIA report on the "increasing  uneasiness" within the Haitian military has been disclosed,  according to THE NEW YORK TIMES. The newspaper revealed that  the United States is reportedly trying to convince Gen. Cedras,  the head of the junta; Michel Francois, chief of police and, for  many, the real power behind the throne; and Philippe Biamby,  cabinet chief of the Army, to abandon power in exchange for a  comfortable life in exile.    To encourage military dissent, Clinton has reportedly  decided  to promote an old Aristide demand: to set up a radio station  from a mobile ship to transmit hostile propaganda against the  military. The project, called Radio Democracy, would have three  objectives: to persuade the troops to get rid of the military  threesome, to convince the mid-level officers that they would  not be punished for the repression unleashed during the military  regime, and to discourage the Haitian population from massively  leaving the island because they will not be given political  exile in the United States.    According to Pentagon officials, Radio Democracy could begin  transmitting in a few weeks through special units operating from  planes that will fly over Haiti at low speeds.    Some of these measures, which are now being promoted by the  Black Caucus in the U.S. Congress, could have been taken 15  months ago and the deaths of thousands of Haitians could have  been avoided.    According to Steven Forester, Haitian Refugee Center  supervisor, the Armed Forces under the command of Gen. Cedras  have executed at least 7,000 persons since the 1991 coup.  Forester described the U.S. immigration policy as "obscene,  racist, and criminal." According to him, not even the 7,000  persons who have been executed since the coup could have met the  requirements of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service  to find asylum in the United States.    On the other hand, he pointed out that Washington approves  96  percent of the requests for refugee status filed by immigrants  from the defunct USSR and 83 percent of those from citizens of  Asian countries and welcomes Cuban boat people as long as they  leave the island illegally, and as a reward it grants them U.S.  citizenship within a year.    Forester indicated that the United States has been a "deaf  accomplice" of the atrocities committed by Haitian military  officers and their paramilitary groups and pointed out that the  obligatory repatriation of the boat people never had a  humanitarian distinction.    Obviously, the departure of Cedras, Francois, Biamby, and  company and the return of Aristide to the Presidency is a  desirable and appropriate thing. The big question is why  Washington decided to promote the change now.</p>

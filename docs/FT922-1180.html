			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: No denial of sovereignty Sir, I would like to answer the question posed by Mr Bryan Cassidy (Letters, June 11), namely, 'isn't a referendum a denial of the sovereignty of parliament?' My answer is no. It cannot be a denial of sovereignty as only parliament can instigate its use. It is presumably intended for use, at parliament's discretion, to decide an issue of importance which requires a black and white decision and for which public opinion is unclear to parliament.

			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING-OUT PARTIES FOR TWO MAGAZINES;  </P> <P> REVIEWS ARE IN AT TIME'S BASH LAUNCHING EW  </P> <P> What does it take to launch a new national magazine? Investors. A distributor.  Lots of presold ads. A writer or two. Oh, yes, and a launch party, the kind  with a catered buffet, guests to be impressed and napkins and match books with  the magazine's name engraved on them.  </P> <P> That was the scene Thursday night, when Time Inc. introduced its new  Entertainment Weekly, a publication devoted to brief and beyond-brief reviews  of movies, TV shows, recordings and books. Two and a half years in the making,  EW is a multimillion-dollar gamble founded upon editor Jeff Jarvis'  journalistic credo, put forth in his first editor's note: "Short is fine."  </P> <P> The guests at the kickoff included local media types come to check out the  competition, as well as the usual have-food-will-travel party hangers-on.  Someone inventive slung fluorescent plastic Slinkies from the ceiling for  decor, and video monitors around the club bore a mysterious Big  Brother-meets-Moon Zappa legend, "Kick back. Chill out. Hang loose. Have fun."  </P> <P> Party buzz reported one teensy problem so far: EW inadvertently miffed the  powerful Disney Corp. this week with its less than flattering placement of a  full-page ad for the studio's upcoming summer extravaganza, "Dick Tracy." (Dick  was relegated to a lowly page somewhere in the back.) That morning, Disney  sources were reportedly unhappy about the magazine's gaffe, and a Disney  employee at the party confirmed that "the office is pretty ticked off" -- only  she didn't say ticked.  </P> <P> Guests received complimentary copies of Volume 1, Issue 1, with country singer  k.d. lang grinning on the cover. The lack of a star turnout seemed strange at a  Hollywood affair, but the magazine had opted to fete its advertisers rather  than a bunch of freeloading celebrities -- even preferring, it appeared, to  feed a bunch of freeloading free-lance writers.  </P> <P> And publisher Michael Klingensmith went a long way toward assuaging any  celebrity withdrawal symptoms when he announced, "In the grand tradition of  Time and Time Inc., the bar is open." Now that was a journalistic philosophy  everyone seemed to salute.  </P></p>

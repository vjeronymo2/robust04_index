			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUNDATION TO DEMAND CRIB RECALL  </P> <P> A consumer group planned today to demand the recall of millions of baby cribs  because they have protruding corner posts that can snag a child's clothing,  necklace or pacifier cord and cause strangulation.  </P> <P> The Danny Foundation (named for Danny Lineweaver, a California boy who suffered  brain damage after his shirt got caught on a crib post) planned to file a  petition with the Consumer Product Safety Commission asking it to ban  protruding corner posts or knobs and recall cribs with such features.  </P> <P> Jack Walsh, executive director of the foundation, said the proposed recall  would apply to perhaps 10 million cribs.  </P> <P> A voluntary industry standard adopted in 1986 allows crib posts or decorative  knobs to protrude no more than 5/8 inch.  </P> <P> Anne Pavlich of the safety agency said the commission's staff recommended in  May that manufacturers consider revising that rule.  </P></p>

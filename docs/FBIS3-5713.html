The Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship Association in  a  statement February 24 noted that the South Korean authorities  under the aegis of the United States worked out a policy of  developing nuclear weapons and introduced heavy water reactors  from the 1970s and now have stockpiled plutonium enough to make  hundreds of nuclear bombs and are using them in developing  nuclear weapons.    The statement stressed that the South Korean authorities  must  immediately renounce the policy of nuclear arms development that  gravely jeopardizes the Korean nation's right to existence and  peace and security in Northeast Asia, and must remove the  already stockpiled plutonium and remove the heavy water reactors  or replace them aith light water reactors.    The Indian paper TAMAKA DARBAR said it is no secret that  South Korea now is possessed of all basic indices of nuclear  armament such as the technology of nuclear development,  operation of reactors, extraction of nuclear materials,  manufacture of nuclear bombs, nuclear testing, possession of  means of nuclear delivery and the established system of war by  nuclear weapons.    The Nepalese paper HINDU DAINIK wrote that nuclear threat on  the Korean peninsula actually comes from South Korea, saying the  world recognizes North Korea's sincere efforts for the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    Jose Fanequico, executive secretary of the Mozambican  Committee for Friendship With the People of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, in a statement urged that the United  States and the International Atomic Energy Agency should discard  their double- standard policy and check South Korea's nuclear  arms development that threatens peace and security in Asia.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAPER SUES AMERICAN CONTINENTAL IN BID FOR CONTROVERSIAL TAPE  </P> <P> A Phoenix newspaper filed suit against American Continental Corp. Tuesday,  seeking the return of a reporter's tape-recorded interviews, which American  claims show that federal regulators have illegally leaked confidential  information about the company's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan subsidiary.  </P> <P> Phoenix Gazette reporter Leslie Irwin inadvertently left the 90-minute tape  cassette in the office of Tempe developer Conley Wolfswinkel after interviewing  him about his loans and financial dealings with Irvine-based Lincoln.  </P> <P> The suit claims that Wolfswinkel and others are wrongly keeping the paper from  recovering its property.  </P> <P> Wolfswinkel, who said Irwin left the cassette in a recorder that she had  borrowed from him, said he listened to the tape after the June 2 interview with  Irwin and then gave it to his lawyer and to an attorney for American  Continental, which is based in Phoenix.  </P> <P> American Continental executives claim the tape is evidence that federal  regulators have been illegally leaking financial information about Irvine-based  Lincoln to the media. Federal law prohibits government agents from disclosing  such confidential information.  </P> <P> But Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental, claims that  S&amp;L regulators have been leaking restricted information to reporters for  more than three years in an effort to destroy him and the company. Keating and  regulators have feuded almost since the time his firm bought Irvine-based  Lincoln in 1984.  </P> <P> American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection April 13 while it tries to  reorganize its debts under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. Regulators  seized Lincoln the next day and now operate it under a conservatorship.  </P> <P> In addition to the Gazette's civil lawsuit, Irwin and a Gazette editor filed a  criminal theft report Monday with the Tempe Police Department.  </P> <P> A. Melvin McDonald, an American Continental attorney, said he has sent a copy  of the tape to the U.S. Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section and  has given the original to the FBI office in Phoenix. The Justice Department, he  said, has opened an investigation of alleged criminal leaks of information by  government agents.  </P> <P> The tape reveals that regulators gave Irwin confidential information about  Wolfswinkel's loans and other financial dealings with Lincoln and American  Continental, said Tarlow and Howard L. Weitzman of Los Angeles, another lawyer  for American Continental.  </P> <P> "They told her things like how much Conley owes, what his loans were for and  other intricate details," Tarlow said. "They're not supposed to be giving that  information to reporters or anybody."  </P> <P> Weitzman said Irwin taped one regulator saying that "Keating is a target and  we'll keep looking for something until we get him."  </P> <P> Pamela Johnson, Gazette managing editor, could not be reached Tuesday and a  Gazette spokeswoman referred further questions to the newspaper's attorney,  James Henderson, who declined comment.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco said officials  there "already are trying to learn the facts behind the latest claim that this  bank has released confidential information."  </P> <P> Free-lance writer Steve Webb in Phoenix contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  Li Lanqing urged foreign trade companies of the country to carry  out bolder reforms during his visit of the ongoing 75th Chinese  Export Commodity Fair here Friday [29 April] afternoon, on the  eve of its close today.    The vice-premier visited the transaction halls and met with  regional trade officials, in the company of Wu Yi, the minister  of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and Zhu Senlin, the  governor of Guangdong Province.    In his speech to the officials, Li congratulated the fair on  its record transactions, saying that the introduction of a  competitive mechanism is a major reason for its success.    Li affirmed that competitive bidding for export quotas is an  effective solution to vicious and unfair competition between  Chinese export companies.    Li said such a practice should be applied to more  commodities  than the present 13 sorts.    Li said he fully agrees with the plan that from the next  session, commodities of the same sort will be displayed at one  place, though business delegations will still be sent by  provinces as they are now.    Li also urged local trade officials to take advantage of the  country's new trade policies issued this year, for example, the  application of a single exchange rate, to boost their local  exports.    While admitting that the new policies have room to improve,  the vice-premier called on trade authorities to improve them and  to take measures to prevent possible problems from arising.    For example, Li said, foreign importers may unreasonably  depress the prices of Chinese products, while Chinese exporters  may also unreasonably raise the prices, all resulting in a rise  of the cost of foreign currencies.    Li pointed out that the establishment of a modern enterprise  system and multinational operation should be the direction taken  for the remolding of China's foreign trade enterprises.    However, the vice-premier noted that the remolding should be  properly approved and strictly follow the instructions of the  State Council so as to hold mistakes to a minimum.    He stressed that in forming stock holding companies,  internal  shares must be limited to the promulgated amount as a measure  against the loss of state-owned assets.    In his speech, the vice-premier also talked of improving the  investment environment and training more competent foreign trade  professionals.</p>

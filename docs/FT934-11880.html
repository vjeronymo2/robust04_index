			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Ericsson in defence venture with Unimor ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications company, yesterday signed a joint venture agreement with Poland's Unimor company from Gdansk to produce defence equipment valued at Dollars 100m for the country's armed forces. The deal is the largest of its kind for Poland with an equipment supplier from outside the former Warsaw Pact country. The mobile radio relay equipment is to be delivered to the Polish army over the next six years and Ericsson hopes to expand sales from Unimor to other east European countries. Unimor which makes TV sets, would control two thirds of the equity in the joint venture, which would involve a Dollars 25m investment in technology by the Swedish company.

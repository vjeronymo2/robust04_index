			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: LETTERMAN SHOW WILL FEATURE ENTIRE CAST OF HAMLET  </P> <P> There won't be much going on in Bolan, Iowa, on March 1. That's because all 16  people who live there will be in New York for an appearance on NBC-TV's "Late  Night With David Letterman." None of the residents of the northern Iowa town,  which is not even on some maps, have been to New York. But most are vaguely  familiar with Letterman. "If he's looking for American Gothic, I think he's  going to be disappointed," said resident Daryl McCready. "We don't exactly have  hats and pitchforks. We know what's going on in the world." The town located  about 130 miles north of Des Moines has been in the news before. It got some  attention during its centennial celebration when spectators walked around the  parade because the town is so small. Residents will fly Feb. 28 to New York.  The show will be taped and broadcast March 1. NBC is paying expenses of the  trip. "I just hope someone there will meet us at the airport. Could you imagine  the headlines: 'Little Town Gets Lost at Airport,' " joked resident Linda  Nydegger.  </P> <P>  -- Kitty Dukakis' father reports that she is doing well at an alcohol  treatment center. "The mail has been tremendous," Harry Ellis Dickson told the  Boston Herald after a visit to Edgehill Newport, a private treatment center in  Rhode Island. "Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush both wrote warm, encouraging  letters . . . . "  </P> <P>  -- The Blue Moon detective agency had a real case of the blues as ABC  announced that "Moonlighting," its ratings down 14.2% from last season, will be  going on hiatus for an unspecified time. The series will return with Cybill  Shepherd and Bruce Willis in new episodes at some point, the network promised.  But as of Feb. 28, ABC is moving its new hit "Roseanne" into the 9 p.m. Tuesday  time slot to try to win back viewers. SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

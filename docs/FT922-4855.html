			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / BNL judge calls for disclosure of any state role THE Atlanta judge presiding over the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans case called yesterday for the appointment of a special prosecutor and pressed repeatedly for full disclosure of any possible government involvement in the affair. Judge Marvin Shoob's call came after US prosecutors announced a surprise plea bargain with Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL branch manager in Atlanta accused of making more than Dollars 5.5bn of secret loans to Iraq. Mr Drogoul, who had informed the judge previously that he planned to plead guilty to a 347-count indictment on conspiracy and fraud charges, yesterday changed his mind. He pleaded guilty to only 60 of the charges, decided to co-operate with the government and said he would delay his promise to name names. An angry Judge Shoob told the court Mr Drogoul was 'not making a full and honest disclosure. This case ought to have a special prosecutor because I'm not getting the information. I'm going to get a sanitised version.' The judge's remarks came as the House judiciary committee in Washington began hearings to determine whether to seek the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the BNL affair and the administration's dealings with Iraq. Judge Shoob asked Mr Drogoul if it was true that he had never expected to come to trial 'because there are so many substantial people involved'. Mr Drogoul replied it was true. The former BNL branch manager said he did not have 'formal discussions with Washington officials' about the loans to Iraq, but said the matter was a complicated one and he wished to review documents before disclosing the names of those outside BNL who were involved. During the hearing Judge Shoob said: 'I don't believe for a minute that you were able to do all of this on your own.' Mr Drogoul replied: 'You're right.' Judge Shoob, saying he would not accept anything being 'sealed, stonewalled or suppressed', warned both Mr Drogoul and government prosecutors that 'when it comes time for sentencing, if I get a sanitised version Mr Drogoul is never going to get out of jail'. At the sentencing hearing, set for August 13, Mr Drogoul will receive a prison term related to the 60 charges to which he pleaded guilty. Government prosecutors, who yesterday pledged to follow up leads provided by Mr Drogoul, are expected to recommend a reduced sentence. After the hearing Ms Gerrilyn Brill, the senior prosecutor on the BNL case, challenged the judge's assertion 'that our version of the facts was sanitised' and said she saw no need for a special prosecutor. Ms Brill disclosed that before the BNL indictments were brought last year the US had considered prosecuting the central bank of Iraq over the affair. However, a decision not to prosecute had been taken by Mr Robert Mueller, an official of the Justice Department.</p>

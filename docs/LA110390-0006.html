			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MISSION IN THE GULF  </P> <P> The gulf crisis is the product of a joint venture by Saddam Hussein and George  Bush. The people of America and Iraq as well as other nationalities trapped in  Iraq and Kuwait are in jeopardy.  </P> <P> God forbid, but if war breaks out, the colossal loss of human lives is  inevitable. Prior to shots being fired it is essential to consider with utmost  care the plight of the hostages held by Hussein as human shields. If it is  decided that destruction of Hussein and his forces is more beneficial than the  precious lives of hostages, the invasion of Iraq can be justified. If not, ways  and means for a peaceful settlement through dialogue and diplomacy should be  initiated. Why doesn't the United Nations take charge of the crisis?  </P> <P> RAISUDDIN HYDER  </P> <P> Valencia  </P></p>

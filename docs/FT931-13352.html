			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Travel Focus - Africa: North Luangwa now open - Practical Traveller / Safaris there was an African hunting dog not far ahead. We set off on foot, treading silently and hardly daring to breathe. We had barely reached the bend in the track which led through thick mopane scrub when the wild dog doubled back and met us face to face. We had walked into the middle of a hunt. This was one of those chance encounters which turn an African safari from a holiday into an adventure. One way of maximising the chances of such encounters is to choose your destination carefully. With more areas opening up for visitors, opportunities are increasing. Zambia's South Luangwa national park has long been noted for its walking safaris and its exciting night drives, while North Luangwa has only recently been opened to visitors, although on a limited scale. Zambia was one of the pioneers of walking safaris. They are generally well planned and full of interest. Abercrombie &amp; Kent, Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions, Twickers World, and Art of Travel all go to Luangwa Valley, but of these only Art of Travel specifically includes North Luangwa. Expect to pay Pounds 1,855 and up for 14 days. While the walks in Zambia take you from one fixed camp to another, Richard Bonham's walking expeditions into Tanzania's enormous Selous game reserve are more in the traditional safari mould. Strings of porters are used, and you sleep under the stars. Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions offers these safaris from Pounds 3,950. The traditional theme is repeated elsewhere in Tanzania where Gibbs Farm Safaris takes clients into the vast grass seas of the Serengeti. Camping in luxury tents, you will not see another vehicle in spite of the open country. Nigel Perks, who runs GFS, has an uncanny knack of finding the most elusive of animals. These safaris can be booked through Art of Travel, while Twickers World has fly-in safaris to the Serengeti from Pounds 2,615 for 17 days. A destination that has become much more accessible now that Air Namibia operates direct flights from Heathrow is Namibia. With its good road network, this southern African country makes an excellent destination for a fly-drive tour. Etosha national park has plenty of elephant, black rhino and lions, and a stay at Okaukuejo, with its floodlit water hole, is not to be missed. One country to rejoin the safari scene recently is Uganda, which has gorillas. The borders of Zaire, Rwanda and Uganda meet in the volcanic massif which forms the last stronghold of the mountain gorilla. It is particularly good to see that gorilla-watching in Rwanda is possible again now, as the continued conservation of these primates depends so much on western visitors. Twickers World has a 23-day tour including visiting chimpanzees in Tanzania from Pounds 1,675, while Abercrombie &amp; Kent has a four-day add-on to a standard safari for around Pounds 1,021. Mana Pools national park on the banks of the River Zambezi in Zimbabwe is not only excellent for walking but is one of the highlights of a canoe safari down the Zambezi, a leisurely way to see game, especially hippos and crocodiles, at quite close quarters. In turn, overland transport comes in many forms. Abercrombie &amp; Kent offers a traditional ox-wagon safari on the shores of Kenya's Lake Naivasha (two days, Pounds 480 ex-Nairobi), or a camel safari in northern Kenya (three days, Pounds 307 ex-Nairobi), while there is the opportunity to explore parts of the Kalahari desert in Botswana on all-terrain vehicles. Botswana's Okavango delta, a rich mixture of glittering channels, clear lagoons, water-lilied pools and sandy, palm-treed islands, has never been easy to travel around. One way is to take an unhurried safari in traditional mokoros, dug-out canoes, which are poled through the placid waters of this enormous labyrinth of waterways by local guides, with an occasional walk on one of the thousands of islands.

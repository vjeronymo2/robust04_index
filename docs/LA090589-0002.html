			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW STUDY TO TRACK SOURCE AND TYPE OF AIR POLLUTANTS  </P> <P> During the 1950s, meteorologists suspected that not all of San Diego County's  dirty air was home-grown. After all, they reasoned, if balloons released by  school children in Los Angeles occasionally came back to earth in San Diego,  wasn't it likely that air currents also carried pollutants generated by  factories and automobiles in Los Angeles?  </P> <P> Technicians subsequently developed complicated monitoring and modeling programs  that proved winds were in fact transporting pollution to San Diego from Los  Angeles, and county officials now know that out-of-town pollution plays a role  in two-thirds of the days when San Diego exceeds state and federal limits for  ozone.  </P> <P> Pollution control programs now take "LA transport" into account, but state and  federal regulators also have required the county's Air Pollution Control  District to create a plan that will reduce the amount of ozone generated within  the county's border.  </P> <P> To that end, the APCD is conducting a $1.6-million project that uses a boat,  balloons and airplanes to monitor pollution within the county. Those mobile  monitors have been augmented by a web of land-based monitoring stations in such  diverse locations as San Clemente Island, Ramona and Mount Soledad. The  airplanes and balloons will grab air samples at various heights, giving  officials a three-dimensional look at the county's air quality.  </P> <P> The study is designed to determine how much pollution is carried into the  county as well as how much is generated within the county. If Mother Nature  cooperates -- the wrong wind currents can make monitoring difficult -- the  complex monitoring system will give an accurate picture of where pollution is  generated and where winds carry it. The monitors also will help to determine  what chemical reactions are occurring once pollution is in the air.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on Hydrocarbons  </P> <P> The monitoring network will pay special attention to hydrocarbons and nitrogen  oxide, which are emitted by industrial sources and motor vehicles. Those  pollutants are known to react together to form ozone.  </P> <P> While the county easily could order overall reductions in hydrocarbons and  oxides, it is "critical" that the pollution control plan include a combination  of reductions that will generate a reduction in ozone, said Richard H. Smith,  APCD's deputy director.  </P> <P> "It's a complicated process because simply decreasing hydrocarbons and nitrogen  oxide won't necessarily bring a resulting decrease in ozone," Smith said. "You  have to determine the effects of reducing both by varying amounts."  </P> <P> The APCD will use a computer model to determine the most effective way to  reduce ozone. The model will track ozone as hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide are  decreased. Technicians will check the validity of the model against data  gathered through the ongoing monitoring program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Study for 14 Years  </P> <P> It has been 14 years since the last comprehensive monitoring program was  conducted, according to Virginia Bigler Engler, a meteorologist with the Air  Pollution Control District. The county is using federal block grant funds to  complete the study, which will be used to determine what pollution controls  would be necessary if oil drilling rigs were to be located off the coast of San  Diego.  </P> <P> The air monitoring program is scheduled to be completed by Sept. 30, but the  final deadline might be extended if desired wind currents fail to materialize.  That was the case in Sacramento, recently, when the monitoring program was put  on hold after wind patterns blowing through the region kept the air unusually  clean.  </P> <P> The monitoring program is designed to collect data "when there is definitely no  influence from Los Angeles as well as when there is," according to Hal W.  Brown, a senior meteorologist with APCD. With that data in hand, "you can then  replicate the model and feel more comfortable" with the resulting ozone control  strategy, Brown said.  </P> <P> If everything goes right with the monitoring study "we'll know what's coming  into the county and what's going on inside the county," Brown said.  </P></p>

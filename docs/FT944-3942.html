			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Misys withdraws RM offer but does not admit defeat The tussle for control of Research Machines subsided yesterday when computing services group Misys announced it had withdrawn its proposals for the educational computer and software supplier. The move came as RM unveiled a placing price of 175p a share for its forthcoming flotation, valuing it at Pounds 29.5m. Misys' first conditional offer, made on Tuesday, offered a minimum 235p a share in cash. This was followed by a second proposal to acquire a 29.9 per cent stake at a price of at least 210p a share. Both were rejected by the RM board. A Misys statement said: 'We will be watching RM's progress with interest.' The company would not comment on whether a hostile bid would be considered after the group's listing. The float will raise just Pounds 200,000 net for the company. But the listing is being instigated ostensibly to enhance the company's profile rather than for financial considerations. 'We have been the world's least-known Pounds 65m (turnover) computer services company for some time,' said Mr Mike Fischer, RM chief executive. Existing shareholders are selling close to 19 per cent of shares on flotation, leaving directors and their families holding 29 per cent of the issued share capital, other employees, former employees and families with 11 per cent, existing institutional shareholders with 38 per cent and institutional placees with 22 per cent. The placing has been fully underwritten by SG Warburg Securities. The company faced complete restructuring in 1992 as it withdrew from the design and manufacture of electronic sub-assemblies and decided to concentrate its energy on the educational world. The Oxfordshire company, which employs more than 450 staff, expects its main market to remain in the educational field. Flat sales in the year to September 30 coupled with a nervous market has not put it off a placing. 'The question of whether we might disappoint the market has been enormously scrutinised,' said Mr Fischer. 'We are not coming to the market without a huge degree of confidence.' Pre-tax profit for the year to September 30 was Pounds 3.8m compared with Pounds 2.5m last time. Total dividends were 4.8p net (2.5p). Trading is expected to begin on Wednesday.</p>

The parliamentarians also adopted an address to the  president  and the prime minister devoted to the situation in agriculture.    The address points out that "the unilateral approach to  carrying out agrarian reforms, reduced to restructuring  ownership of land, privatization and reorganization of  collective farms and state-owned farms" led to a fall of  agricultural output of 65-70% over the last two years against  the average annual level in 1986-1990.    State programs for constructing homes, gas, electricity and  hot water installations, building roads and developing the  telephone network in the country have been curbed.    Due to the inadequate increase of prices of manufactured  goods against agricultural products, virtually all farms went  bankrupt. As a result, Russians have to consume less domestic  agricultural products against the background of growing imports  of foreign goods at the expense of destroying Russia's  agriculture.    Members of the Federation Council called on the government  to  consider a complex of agricultural issues at its next session.  It is extremely necessary that real aid to agriculture be  rendered until the beginning of field work in the spring.    The session also passed a resolution demarcating the new  border between the Ivanovo and Nizhnyy Novgorod regions.    According to the decision to send a Federation Council  commission to the area of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, the  session formed a group of 4 deputies.    The session also approved a document regulating the  implementation of the law "On guarantees and compensation for  persons working and residing in the northern most regions of  Russia and regions with similar adverse climate conditions."  The document points to the need to strictly observe the  privileges for the regions' residents envisioned during the  preparation of the budget. The Federation Council will hold  parliamentary hearings to look into the issue this March. A  number of parliamentary committees will use their results as the  basis for developing a draft law on the issue.</p>

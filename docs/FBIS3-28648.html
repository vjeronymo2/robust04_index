			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Sin Yong-pae] </F>   [Text] The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) has been  disturbed by talk ahead of the parliamentary election in 1996  about a possible large-scale replacement of old-guard  politicians with young newcomers. Particularly, older  politicians within the DLP, who garnished political favors from  previous governments, fear that they may be excluded from party  nominations of candidates for the National Assembly.    The possibility of wholesale replacements was raised at the  end of last month when DLP Secretary-General Mun Chong-su  indicated that the party will push for a generational change in  the party line-up on a gradual basis. In a report on party  policies for 1994 to President Kim Yong-sam, Mun said he will  try to keep the party from aging by recruiting more young  people. He also pointed out that the number of DLP lawmakers in  their 50s or 60s will make up nearly 90 percent of the party in  1996. As a matter of fact, the need for personnel changes within  the DLP has been discussed continuously in hushed tones among  reform-minded party lawmakers since the inauguration of the Kim  government on a mandate of change and reform early last year.  They are said to have been displeased with the failure by their  party to show teamwork in carrying out in-house reform measures  because of intraparty factional divisions.    The DLP, a product of a three-party merger in 1990, consists  of three factions with different political ideologies and  backgrounds. Mun's suggestion for a generational change was in  line with President Kim's recent call for a transfusion of  "young blood" into the DLP through the nomination of reformist  candidates for the general elections. Kim, who is also the party  president, said old- fashioned politicians who have failed to  adapt themselves to the new times will gradually disappear from  the political community.    As the DLP leaders have raised the nomination issue earlier  than expected, speculation has persisted that more than 50  percent of the current DLP lawmakers will be dropped in the  selection of party candidates for the Assembly elections. Party  insiders predict that the expected rejectees will be those who  are old and lack reform zeal, and who have been targets of  public criticism for their accumulation of wealth in an illegal  or immoral way. But the controversial DLP move to infuse "young  blood" into the party has drawn a reaction from old politicians  within the DLP, mainly from the party's two conservative  factions.    Displeasure with the move to replace old politicians with  young newcomers erupted during a meeting of party advisers, who  are senior politicians, early this month. They argued that it is  wrong to allege that old politicians should retire only because  they are old.    DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil, a symbol of the old-fashioned  politician, was not enthusiastic about the prospect of personnel  changes. He said he is willing to push for a generational change  but noted it is desirable that the experience of the old and the  vigor of the young are harmonized in politics.    The dispute surrounding replacement of old politicians with  young newcomers has already intensified conflicts between  factions within the DLP. The two conservative groups have been  uneasy over the possibility of personnel changes. They said the  move was engineered by their rival reform-minded faction made up  of relatively young politicians in order to grab party hegemony.  But the reformists, loyal to President Kim, stressed the need  for a large-scale replacement of old politicians with young  reformists, saying that party candidates for the general  elections should be fresh figures befitting the new era of  reform.</p>

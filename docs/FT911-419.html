			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Scottish Conservative Party Conference: Major pledges Pounds 15m aid for Ravenscraig area MR JOHN MAJOR last night delighted Scottish Tories with a rallying speech in which he promised immediate financial aid for Lanarkshire, which is suffering from the closure of two British Steel plants. He also announced that the European Community summit in December 1992, when Britain will hold the presidency, will be staged in Edinburgh. Mr Major said the government is to spend an initial Pounds 15m to help Lanarkshire, where British Steel recently closed the strip mill at its Ravenscraig plant and the Clydesdale tube mill. Scottish Enterprise, the new official economic development body, will spend the money immediately on site clearance and environmental improvements to 'green over the worst areas of industrial dereliction', he said. Mr Major said the Scottish Office would shortly receive a study of projects for the long term revival of the area. 'We will take the necessary steps to help Lanarkshire become once again an area that will be attractive to new investment and new jobs,' he said. Referring to the choice of Edinburgh for the European council, or summit, he said: 'I want Scotland to play a leading role in international affairs. I want it to be in Edinburgh that Europe signals the final completion of the single market.' Mr Major spelt out his opposition to creating a devolved Scottish assembly with the power to raise taxes, as is demanded by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but he did not rule out the idea of Scotland having an assembly without tax raising powers. 'I know that there is sometimes a feeling, not just in Scotland but in Wales and England too, that Westminster can be too remote. I believe that government should be - must be - more receptive to the aspirations of people throughout the United Kingdom,' he said. The prime minister's speech rounded off a conference in which the Scottish Conservatives' mood steadily improved, as they contemplated the approaching general election and the rise in their standing in the Scottish opinion polls since Mr Major replaced Mrs Margaret Thatcher. The audience, which gave him an 8-minute standing ovation at the end of the speech, appeared genuinely delighted with the new prime minister who, unlike his predecessor on occasions, did not appear to patronise Scotland. Mr Tom King, defence secretary, disappointed conference delegates by not ruling out the closure of the Rosyth naval base in Fife, which employs 2,300 civilians and 1,000 naval personnel. No decision had been taken to close Rosyth, he said, but the government had to look at all the possibilities for making savings.</p>

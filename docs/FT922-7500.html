			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Furniture report highlights the striking impact of Ikea THE striking impact that Ikea has had on the UK furniture market is highlighted in a market research report showing that the Swedish furniture chain is achieving sales per square foot 2.7 times the industry average. Ikea's three stores made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m on sales of Pounds 91.4m last year and the company is expected to break through the Pounds 100m turnover barrier this year, with another two stores opening shortly. Verdict, the retail research group, says this is the first time Ikea has published its UK trading figures since it opened its first store in Warrington in 1987. Although Ikea's profits have fallen from Pounds 4.1m in 1989, Verdict points out that the retailer's profitability is being dented by the high costs of its opening programme. The report suggests that it takes three years for an Ikea store to achieve mature sales levels. Verdict suggests that Ikea's success shows it is possible for aggressive retailers to increase sales even during a recession. The report says the furniture market has declined by 7 per cent in real terms since its peak of just more than Pounds 4bn in 1989, resulting in many corporate casualties, such as Lowndes Queensway and ELS. Recession has forced companies such as Habitat, Perring's and Allied Maples to rethink strategies. Verdict highlights the strong operational performance of MFI, the market leader, which has struggled financially under the weight of debt taken on to finance a management buy-out in 1987. MFI, it suggests, will be in a good position to exploit its market dominance when it secures its finances by returning to the stock market later this year.

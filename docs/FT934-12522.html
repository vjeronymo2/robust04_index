			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Amexco recovery continues in third term THE turnround at American Express engineered by Mr Harvey Golub, chairman, continued in the third quarter as the financial services group's core travel-related services business maintained the earnings momentum of the previous three months. The group showed further benefits from the rise on Wall Street. Its Lehman Brothers investment banking unit recorded a rise in net income, to Dollars 114m from Dollars 95m the previous quarter, driven by a jump of 77 per cent in its income from making markets and other principal transactions. Net income at American Express for the three months to the end of September reached Dollars 430m, or 83 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 204.7m (after a one-off restructuring charge of Dollars 492m) a year ago. The figures were lifted by a net benefit of Dollars 23m from the rise in the US corporation tax rate, which led to a one-off adjustment to deferred taxes. It said this benefit was offset by costs from the early repayment of some debt. Net income in travel-related services rose to Dollars 236m, from Dollars 234m the previous quarter and a loss of Dollars 187m the year before. Gross revenues fell 2 per cent over the year to Dollars 2.16bn, due to a fall in the discounts charged to merchants for accepting American Express cards and a decline in card fees. However, provisions for credit losses fell by nearly 30 per cent, to Dollars 375m. The number of cards in force continued to fall, to 34.2m from 35.1m a year before, though the amount of business billed to cardholders during the period, at Dollars 30.8bn, was up 4 per cent. Gross revenues (net of interest costs) at Lehman Brothers rose by a third, to Dollars 885m, as income from principal trading jumped sharply to Dollars 421m. Investment banking revenues advanced by 34 per cent, to Dollars 186m, while commissions grew by a fifth to Dollars 126m. Other businesses continued to show improvements in operating performance. Net income at IDS, the investment management and advisory arm, rose to Dollars 96m from Dollars 80m on higher fee income, while after-tax profits at American Express Bank climbed to Dollars 27m from a loss of Dollars 30m the year before.</p>

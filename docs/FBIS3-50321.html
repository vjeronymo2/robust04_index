			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 26/1/1994 -- The craze of the  so-called "mutual assistance games" which has spread all over  Romania has come to a new phase of development. Almost weekly  newspapers trumpet the crash of one or another of these ventures  that mushroomed in all the four winds, but it is also newspapers  that advertise new such games run by "dependable" firms. Naive  people ignore warnings from the authorities and the over one  million complaints registered so far with the police, claiming  return of invested sums, and keep placing their money hoping  that, for once, they will strike it. But when it all comes to a  dead end, they suddenly start to panic and revolt at the thought  that they will not be able to recover at least the money first  deposited. In some cases game runners return 80 percent of the  initial deposit, keeping the change for their pockets. In other  cases the end begins with announcements like "no payments  today," or "the bank did not have enough cash," or "the boss is  away for two days," or "operations halted for repairs to  defective computer."    Last Monday in Pitesti, frustration reached such magnitude  in  those cheated that the town was on the verge of disaster.  Several thousands of the 600,000 investors in the various  "mutuals," seized with rage, marched to the local game houses,  threatening to devastate and set them ablaze. Their wrath then  found other targets: the mayor of Pitesti, the prefecture, the  Agricultural Bank, the financial police. A young man, suspected  of being the bodyguard of one of the game bosses, was molested  by the mob. The prompt intervention of the police somehow  quenched the fury of the crowd stopping it from making more  victims and causing more damage. However, four such houses had  been already ravaged.    The police announced that one of the bosses of such a  "mutual  assistance" circuit, the "Philadelphia," Ioan Negruta, 39 years  of age, an electrician by profession, was arrested under the  charges of fraud, embezzlement, and fraudulent bankruptcy, only  two days after he had given assurances on the local TV network  that the circuit was all right and going on after having made,  he said, no less than 25,000 millionaires among Pitesti  residents and having made payments in the region of 35 billion  lei. The police detected a 2 billion lei fraud in the firm's  books. More exactly, the total deposit stands at 25.2 billion  lei, of which 150 million had been registered as the owner's  profit and 23 billion as paid to investors.</p>

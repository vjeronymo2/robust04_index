Section 622 of the 1992 Act amends section 7 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (USHA), and sets forth the requirements for designating housing for elderly families, disabled families, and elderly  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> disabled families. (The final rule to implement the provisions of section 7 of the USHA was published on April 13, 1994.) These set-asides are to be used only for the costs of development of, or MROP activities in connection with, housing designated for occupancy under section 7. The competition for these set-aside funds will be based upon (1) the need of the PHA for assistance (taking into consideration the allocation plan submitted), and (2) the extent to which the projects/buildings meet the requirements of section 7(e) (i.e., the allocation and supportive service plans). Note: Pursuant to section 624(B) of the HCD Act of 1992, no building selected by the PHA for designated housing for disabled families under this NOFA may contain more than 25 units unless the applicant demonstrates a need for a building with more than 25 units that cannot otherwise be met by a building with 25 units or less. Designation of a portion of a project does not require that the buildings, floors or units be contiguous; PHAs are encouraged to place units in the most integrated setting possible. In general, HUD will approve designated projects for disabled families only if there is a clear demonstration that there is both a need and a demand by disabled families for such designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Attached as Appendices A and B to this NOFA are the 1994 NOFA for Public Housing Development (published on May 24, 1994) and the NOFA for 1993 and 1994 MROP activities (published on May 20, 1994). The requirements set forth in these NOFAs that are applicable to public housing development and MROP activities apply to designated housing for disabled families unless otherwise indicated in this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NOFA announces the availability of the set-asides for public housing development and/or MROP activities applications for designated housing for disabled families pursuant to section 7 of the USHA. The objective of development/MROP activities funding for designated housing for disabled families is to assist PHAs to meet the goals set forth in their allocation plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A PHA's project(s) for disabled families must be designated before the development/MROP applications can be selected for funding under this NOFA. Thus, the PHA must have an approved allocation plan that includes the designated project as a housing resource. The PHA also must have an approved supportive service plan for the project(s) that has been designated for disabled families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allocation plans (including those with supportive service plans) may be submitted at any time. However, if a PHA anticipates responding to this NOFA, it should submit its allocation plan and supportive service plan in sufficient time for them to be approved before the PHA files its development/MROP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NOFA is not applicable to the Indian housing program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: APPLICATION SUBMISSION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This NOFA is open-ended and applications will be accepted at the HUD Field Office Public Housing Division any time after publication of this NOFA until all available set-aside funds for both development and MROP activities are utilized.

Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> A. Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Sections 5 and 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA) (42 U.S.C. 1437c and 1437u); sec. 7(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)); and sections 622 and 624 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public housing development regulations are codified in 24 CFR part 941, and the designated housing final rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17652). The rule will be codified at 24 CFR part 945 (``Designated Housing'' regulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Fund Availability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HCD Act of 1992 required the Department to set aside not less than 5 percent of public housing development and MROP activities amounts approved in the FY 1993 and 1994 appropriations acts for designated housing for disabled families. Accordingly, $20 million was set aside in FY 1993 and a maximum of $21.78 million was set aside in FY 1994 for public housing development; a maximum of $8.96 million was set aside from the FY 1993 and 1994 appropriations for MROP activities. Thus, a maximum of $50.74 million may be made available under this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Fund Assignments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of 1974) requires that funds be allocated on a fair share basis, except for (a) amounts retained in a Headquarters Reserve and (b) appropriations determined incapable of geographic allocation. Since the purpose of the allocation is to encourage PHAs to designate units for occupancy by disabled families and the extent of interest is not predicable by formula, the Department does not intend to fair share these funds. This determination was made on the basis of statutory set-aside, pursuant to 24 CFR 791.403(b)(1)(ii)(C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

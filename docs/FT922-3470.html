			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: London aims to lift sugar trade THE LONDON Futures and Options exchange has hired independent commodities consultant Landell Mills Commodities Studies to look at ways of developing the London sugar market, Reuter reports. Mr Phillip Thorpe, the exchange's chief executive, said: 'London FOX has commenced a study to assess how the sugar market can develop and expand in the medium to long-term and how it should best respond to changing market conditions.' Declining raw sugar volumes over the past 18 months have been of concern to traders for some time. In an attempt to revive interest, the market switched from floor- to screen-trading, only to revert to the floor one year later, this January. In the first four months of this year, raw sugar traded only 50,110 lots, compared with 136,313 lots in January to April 1991 and 426,463 lots in the corresponding period of 1990.</p>

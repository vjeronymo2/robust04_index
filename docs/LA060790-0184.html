			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIEST TAKES BITE OUT OF DENTAL CARE  </P> <P> His tooth-side manner is so gentle and encouraging that he makes children feel  10 feet tall while reminding them to brush and floss.  </P> <P> That's not something Dr. Richard J. Thill learned in dental school.  </P> <P> He's a Roman Catholic priest with a devout interest in healthy teeth. And he  says the communication skills he developed in the seminary have served him well  in the dental office, where his biggest challenge is improving preventive care  for children ranging from toddlers to teens.  </P> <P> Thill, who pauses to say grace during an interview at a restaurant near his  office, is as comfortable practicing dentistry in a short-sleeved yellow smock  alongside a life-sized robot named Dr. Beap as he is standing behind a pulpit  in priestly attire.  </P> <P> Dr. Beap (Bartholomew Edubot Automaton Peabody) -- whose midsection is a TV on  which educational videos are played -- is part of an effort to make going to  the dentist a positive experience for children.  </P> <P> Dr. Beap hangs out in a small waiting area next to the open bay where Thill  works side by side with his colleagues, Warren Brandli and Michael McCartney,  longtime friends who specialize in pediatric dentistry. They invited Thill to  share their Tustin practice while he waits for a transfer of jurisdiction as a  priest from Colorado to California.  </P> <P> The openness of the room where they work enables children to hear the dentists  banter with each other and their patients, keeping the atmosphere lighthearted  even when distasteful fluoride treatments are being given or drills are  humming.  </P> <P> As the more boisterous McCartney makes jokes, Thill can be heard quietly  conversing with his patients, mixing advice on how to care for their teeth with  questions about how their lives are going.  </P> <P> "How's school?" he asks an eighth-grade boy as he checks his teeth.  </P> <P> "Kinda' boring."  </P> <P> "You're going to be graduating soon, aren't you?"  </P> <P> The boy nods.  </P> <P> "Congratulations -- good work. Looks like you've been brushing. Keep it up. I  have to keep telling myself that. I know it's work, but you can do it."  </P> <P> McCartney says Thill has a special ability to be empathetic with his patients  and to use the best approach for each child. McCartney is delighted to have a  priest on his dental staff.  </P> <P> "It makes a wonderful combination," he says. "With Dr. Rich, everything is done  in a real caring and giving way."  </P> <P> Thill, who attended Catholic schools and St. Boniface Catholic Church while  growing up in Anaheim, became a dentist before entering the priesthood. He  remained active in the church as he earned his degree in general dentistry at  Marquette University, completed a two-year specialty program in pediatric  dentistry at the University of Maryland and began private practice, first in  Fullerton, then in Denver.  </P> <P> While practicing in Denver, he became close friends with a longtime priest  whose sermons "made me start to think about my faith -- about studying more and  sharing it with others," he says.  </P> <P> The priest helped him tune into an inner voice that he had been hearing since  he was a boy. "He said the Lord calls and doesn't give up calling," Thill says.  </P> <P> This time, Thill was ready.  </P> <P> He entered St. Thomas Seminary in Denver in 1976 and was ordained in 1981. He  served in the Pueblo Diocese in southern Colorado for about seven years. After  spending four months in Mexico -- where he learned the language and customs by  participating in baptisms, weddings and other special occasions -- he returned  to Anaheim about a year and a half ago for an extended rest at the home of his  parents, Elmer and Gene Thill.  </P> <P> His leave from Pueblo was supposed to last a year, but he decided to relocate  permanently so he could remain close to his family. While he is awaiting  official word from his bishop in Pueblo giving him jurisdiction to serve here,  his parishioners are young dental patients who are learning to rely on Thill's  soothing voice to allay their fears.  </P> <P> That is particularly important to the children he treats as a volunteer on  Monday afternoons. They are residents of Orangewood Children's Home, the  county's shelter for abused, neglected and abandoned children.  </P> <P> "It's challenging because you're working with children who've been abused, so  you want to make sure you go gentle and slow," he says.  </P> <P> With any child who is fearful in a dentist's chair, Thill makes a special  effort to be quick, efficient -- and reassuring.  </P> <P> "They need to feel loved, to know someone's caring for them," he says.  </P> <P> Thill, who is lean and fit at 50, approaches his work with enormous energy,  which he maintains by filling his spare time with activities that nurture mind,  body and soul.  </P> <P> "I keep very fit -- physically, mentally and emotionally. We need to balance  our lives," he says.  </P> <P> He takes time every day for prayer and tries "to recognize the presence of God  all day long," which, he says, helps him cope with the fast pace of life in  Orange County. On Sunday afternoons, he meditates and studies Scripture.  </P> <P> He stays fit by swimming laps three times a week and taking frequent walks and  bike rides. He also enjoys listening to music from classical to Big Band  ("anything with good rhythm and good taste") and reading about such topics as  dentistry, astronomy, agriculture and entomology. He also unwinds by tinkering  with machines, including the 1969 Volkswagen he drives to work.  </P> <P> Thill says he will continue to practice dentistry even after he resumes his  duties as a priest. He feels being a priest has made him a better dentist.  </P> <P> "The training I have as a priest gives me insights into the difficulties and  struggles of people," he says. "Dentistry is not just limited to teeth. It's  looking at the whole person. Seeing people as God sees them. I look at the  individual as a person -- not a situation."  </P> <P> He hopes the optimism he draws from his spiritual life and exudes in the dental  office will rub off on his patients so they will have confidence in their  ability to protect their dental health.  </P> <P> "My main goal is to approach each patient as special and unique and convey a  positive and optimistic attitude toward preventive dentistry," he says.  </P></p>

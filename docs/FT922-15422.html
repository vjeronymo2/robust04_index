			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Managing director of Porsche GB quits MR PETER BULBECK, manag-ing director for the past eight years of the UK subsidiary of Porsche, the German carmaker, has left the company. Reading-based Porsche Cars Great Britain, whose sales have more than halved from their 1980s peak, confirmed that Mr Bulbeck has been succeeded by Mr Kevin Gaskell, 33, a former general manager for sales and marketing, who joined in 1987. Mr Bulbeck's resignation became effective yesterday after he requested early retirement. He made the request at a board meeting of the Stuttgart carmaker's UK subsidiary on March 20, to take early retirement. The company rejected any connection between Mr Bulbeck's departure and other changes. Porsche has struggled for sales in the face of the recession and Japanese competition. The departure of Mr Bulbeck, a 30-year veteran of Porsche in the UK, swiftly follows the resignation of Mr Brian Bowler as chief executive of Porsche Cars North America. US sales have been the worst affected of Porsche's operations. It sold fewer than 5,000 cars there last year, against a mid-1980s peak of more than 30,000. In February Mr Arno Bohn, chief executive of Porsche in Germany, threatened to resign after the company initially failed to renew his contract. He agreed to stay after winning a three-year renewal. Porsche was meanwhile disclosing profits down to DM2m from DM65m in its year to last July. Dr Armin Muller, company secretary and general manager, joins the UK company's board as finance director. Porsche Cars GB, which has shed about 50 jobs at Reading during the past 18 months, has announced price cuts of up to Pounds 7,000. Last year total sales fell by 42.5 per cent to 1,612 from 2,801 in 1990.</p>

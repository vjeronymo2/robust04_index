			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News In Brief: Hershey Foods withdraws Freia Marabou bid HERSHEY Foods, of the US, has withdrawn its bid to acquire Freia Marabou and will sell its 18.6 per cent interest in the the Norwegian chocolate and confectionery group to Kraft General Foods, a subsidiary of Philip Morris, AP-DJ reports from New York. The decision follows the recent announcement that Kraft had won control of more than 75 per cent of the Norwegian group's capital in response to its Dollars 1.5bn takeover offer. The Kraft offer is conditional upon government approval, which is not expected for several months. If concluded, the transaction would result in Hershey receiving an after-tax gain of about Dollars 40m at current exchange rates. ***** Metra, the Finnish diversified industrial company, is looking for foreign investors to subscribe for its planned loan of a maximum amount of FM700m (Dollars 144m), Reuter reports from Helsinki. The board is to ask an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on November 5 for the right to issue the loan, said Mr Klaus Gronbarj, executive vice-president. The issue would be considered as equity, he said. ***** Lafarge-Coppee, the French cement and building materials group, holds 91 per cent of the votes and 85 per cent of capital in Swiss Cementia after its bid for the minority shareholdings, Reuter reports from Zurich. Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), managing the swap offer for Lafarge, said that the offer had been extended beyond its scheduled October 28 expiry, until November 11. Lafarge held 53 per cent of Cementia's capital and 73 per cent of votes before the bid.</p>

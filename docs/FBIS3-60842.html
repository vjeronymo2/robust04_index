After firing into the  ceiling, the criminals seized a female teacher and 12  schoolchildren and led them out to a bus standing outside the  school. The bus was then driven by a driver, also taken  hostage, in the direction of a military camp.    One of a number of servicemen who began negotiations with  the  kidnappers was himself taken hostage. The kidnappers demanded a  helicopter and crew and talked about "Georgia-Makhachkala-Iran"  as a preliminary route.    According to unsubstantiated data, the terrorists have  released one of the female pupils. They have called for the  oblast's administrative head, Vladimir Chub, to take part in  negotiations. Negotiations are continuing.</p>

The  delegation Tudjman was head of was seen at the Otopeni Airport  by a honor mission led by Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor  Melescanu.    The head of the Romanian diplomacy said that "to his mind,  the visit was an extremely important moment in the relations  between the two countries, an opportunity to show Romania's  preoccupation to transfer the good relations it had with former  Yugoslavia to all the republics created following the breaking  of Yugoslavia. We are very satisfied with the discussions  conducted here, we signed the first treaty with a country from  former Yugoslavia and the exchange of views we had on the  prospects of finding a solution to the crisis in Yugoslavia has  been very interesting for us. We are very satisfied and we hope  that will be a moment marking a speeding up of our ties with  Croatia and with all the republics of former Yugoslavia."</p>

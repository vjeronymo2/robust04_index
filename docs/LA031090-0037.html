			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> PETER MURPHY: A CREEPY, FELINE, REPTILIAN PRESENCE  </P> <P> A puff of fog, a synthesized violin, and it's gloom-rock hero Peter Murphy,  close-cropped hair protruding like a blond parsnip, posed like St. Sebastian on  stage at the Wiltern Theatre on Thursday. You've heard of the Thin White Duke?  Murphy is thinner, whiter, more aristocratic in bearing.  </P> <P> He's the sort of performer who always seems to know, within a degree or two,  the angle at which his cheekbones glint most fetchingly in the sea-green  spotlight.  </P> <P> He'd crouch leonine on a stack of amplifiers and pounce, not skipping a beat.  He suffered, even as he danced, under lighting designed to look like moaty  sunbeams filtering into a subterranean prison cell.  </P> <P> When Murphy sang, he directed his words up into the flies and winced, as if  imploring the Almighty. Murphy's voice is a cross between Bowie and "Lust for  Life"-era Iggy; his music a slightly jazzier take on the spare, two-chord  death-rock formula (which he helped invent with Bauhaus, the Led Zeppelin of  the genre); his performance spectacular, feline, reptilian, letter-perfect,  creepier than Malcolm McDowell at the height of his powers.  </P> <P> Exene Cervenka, another ex-lead singer of a dark, religion-obsessed ensemble  (X), opened with a quiet, powerful set of neo-country, her flat, quavering  voice made strong by a band that included X's Tony Gilkyson on guitar. Thin  White Rope is scheduled as the opening act for the final night of Murphy's  Wiltern stand tonight. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

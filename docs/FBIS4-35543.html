			<p>BFN     [Text] India has criticized Pakistan for raising the  Kashmir issue at the Non-Aligned Foreign Minister's meeting,  saying the movement cannot be involved in the matter. The  minister of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, told  the meeting in Cairo that New Delhi has always been ready for  the dialogue with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue but there has  been little response from Islamabad. In a strongly worded  response to a Pakistani demand for intervention by NAM  [Non-Aligned Movement] in the issue, Mr. Bhatia said: Pakistan  is inflicting enormous suffering on the people of New Delhi  through state sponsored terrorism. He asserted that Kashmir is  and will always remain an integral part of India.    Mr. Bhatia reminded the meeting of the ruling by the NAM  chairman Indonesia that bilateral disputes should not be  discussed at the NAM meeting. He said: Any moves going against  the ruling can only weaken the movement.</p>

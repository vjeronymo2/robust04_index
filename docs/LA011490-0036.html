			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACING THE DIRECTIONS OF GAY THEATER  </P> <P> Loynd's article was sorely myopic and narrow-minded. Singling out gay theater  as "little seen" implies that theater is an art form seen by the masses.  </P> <P> As someone who has worked in a variety of theaters (straight and gay) for 15  years, I can swear to that not being the case.  </P> <P> Loynd obviously thinks that gay theater would be better theater if it was  performed for straight audiences. Would he say that black theater should be  performed for white audiences? Hispanic theater for black audiences?  </P> <P> I've always thought the magic of theater is not what happens on stage, but what  happens in the audience. Gay and lesbian theater's pure magic of joining  together with one's own people is something mainline theater can never hope to  match.  </P> <P> The very act of gays and lesbians going to a theater together and being in the  majority is part of the reason that the audiences of "little seen" gay theater  often travel hundreds of miles just to see a production.  </P> <P> JEFF HAGEDORN, Hollywood  </P></p>

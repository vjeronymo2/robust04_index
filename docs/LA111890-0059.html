			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LITERARY MATCHMAKER IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS  </P> <P> If MCA maven Jules Stein had had his druthers -- and he generally saw to it  that he did -- his elder daughter Jean would have become a Hollywood agent.  </P> <P> Not just a Hollywood agent. A wonderful Hollywood agent.  </P> <P> "She had that gift for putting people together, for making things happen, for  creating an environment or a climate in which people helped each other," says  Joan Didion, a longtime friend and occasional confidante of the Steins.  </P> <P> But while the formidable Jules Stein was able to move mountains when it came to  The Industry, he had less luck with his shy, fluttery daughter, who  nevertheless turned out to be a fairly intractable piece of topography herself.  </P> <P> Jean Stein never did go into her dad's business. But that didn't make Jules  wrong about his No. 1 daughter.  </P> <P> She is indeed busy mixing and matching people. She's the happy caretaker of one  of New York's great salons, an Upper West Side abode where she regularly  collects as eclectic a bunch as she's able to find -- from Dennis Hopper to  George Plimpton, from Jasper Johns to James Watson of DNA-discovering fame.  </P> <P> And now, ever the populist, she's pouring her unlikely matchmaking fervor into  Grand Street, considered one of the country's most distinguished literary  magazines. With the current issue, Stein assumes her place as Grand Street's  grande dame, and under her tutelage, the magazine reads like the literary  equivalent of a splendid dinner party.  </P> <P> Here she has collected the poet Bei Dao, an exiled leader of China's democracy  movement, and she matches him up with Olivier Messiaen, who weighs in with a  snippet of score from "Saint Francoise d'Assise," the composer's only opera.  There are literary heavyweights the likes of Elizabeth Bishop and John Ashbery.  But there's also ice-hockey arena owner-operator-cum-poet Matt Jasper.  </P> <P> "He says he's going to name his child after me, poor guy," Stein says of her  discovery.  </P> <P> That lineup doesn't even include the artist Saul Steinberg, who contributed a  portfolio of zoned-out dog drawings and antique dog postcards as well as the  jazzy cover. Or Lewis Thomas, president emeritus of New York's prominent  Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, who offers up a handy-dandy scientific  essay, "The World at a Glance."  </P> <P> "I am very interested in these different worlds coming together, so you're not  only writing, you're not only art, you're not only science, you're bringing  them all together," says Stein, 56. "And, in a way, I've lived my life in New  York that way. I'm probably one of the very few people who brings people from  different worlds to have evenings at home. So it's a natural."  </P> <P> Says Hopper: "She's very generous, and I'm not saying by giving people loans,  but as a person, intellectually. She's extremely curious, and she goes out and  she seeks out people. She seeks out experiences."  </P> <P> When Stein talks about her latest venture, her voice sounds girlish. Her words  come out in a breathy rush, tumbling over each other as a new thought overtakes  an old one midstream. Now she's talking about what a shame it is that the work  of foreign writers under 40, uncommercial as it is, so rarely sees the light of  print in this country, and how she plans to correct that in Grand Street.  </P> <P> "I just think it's important," she says. "The world is becoming smaller and  smaller, and with some American writers, there's a danger of provincialism. So  much I find of American fiction today is studying one's navel. There is more  out there."  </P> <P> And she says that it's wonderful to have the Ashberys and the Bishops, the  celebrities of the literary world, but there's nothing quite like squaring them  off with a talented unknown or three.  </P> <P> Rather like the way she arranges her life.  </P> <P> "I don't want to end up living in that world, which is where I could easily  be," says Stein. "The celebrity world, it's death finally. There are no ideas  coming in any more."  </P> <P> The rebel with the literary magazine, charmed as she is by incongruities, would  be pleased to know that her tony quarterly made a mass-market appearance in a  recent issue of People magazine, in a photo featuring her old friend Dennis  Hopper. Hopper also appears in Grand Street itself, in a pastiche of interviews  Stein published about some drugged-out days Hopper spent with writer Terry  Southern at Larry Flynt's palace, listening to Timothy Leary and G. Gordon  Liddy howl at each other for their pseudo-debates, passing pot to Flynt's wife  and watching Flynt do a Hustler shoot delicately titled "Celebrity Porn."  </P> <P> "I did meet Larry Flynt once," Stein muses. "Dennis arranged for me to meet  him. I was just terrorized."  </P> <P> Tales of Stein's adventures fail to ruffle her daughters Katrina and Wendy  Vanden Heuvel, a 31-year-old Nation editor and 29-year-old San Francisco  actress, respectively.  </P> <P> "They're used to me by now," Stein says cheerfully.  </P> <P> Stein raised $100,000 for her first issue (with a press run of 10,000) from  Grand Street well-wishers who included Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner and  Stephen Graham, a Washington Post scion, theater producer and budding novelist.  </P> <P> Of course, Stein, a longtime literary philanthropist, is also helping pay the  bills with contributions funneled through the New York Foundation of the Arts.  And the eight-room apartment on Central Park West where she raised her children  and spent the last quarter-century is now totally transformed.  </P> <P> "It's not a home any more," she says. "Sometimes there are eight people working  in there. The dining room is no longer a dining room. It's like a campaign  headquarters."  </P> <P> Stein inherited the 9-year-old magazine from its founder, Ben Sonnenberg, who  started it with the proceeds from the sale of his ancestral home at 19 Gramercy  Park.  </P> <P> Being quite the rabble-rouser himself, Sonnenberg prided himself on bucking the  tradition of literary magazines by paying writers real money, up to $2,000 a  pop and sometimes even more. Stein says she plans to do the same.  </P> <P> And if it's true that you get what you pay for, Sonnenberg did well to open his  pockets. Over the years, he published such writers as Samuel Beckett, Garry  Wills, Christopher Hitchens and Alexander Cockburn. And he liked to say he  named the magazine Grand Street, because that was where his parents met in New  York. (His father, Ben Sonnenberg Sr., was a public-relations lion.)  </P> <P> Sonnenberg retired because multiple sclerosis was beginning to get the better  of him, and because he wanted to write his memoirs. "Lost Property: Memoirs and  Confessions of a Bad Boy" will be published by Summit Books next spring.  </P> <P> As for his choice of Stein as successor, Sonnenberg, in his typically wry way,  says this of his old friend: "I had been meant to marry Jean when we were in  our 20s, because she was the daughter of a man with a great collection of  English 18th-Century furniture. And my father had a great collection of English  18th-Century furniture. And he thought it would be swell if the two collections  could merge.  </P> <P> "So this is the fulfillment of a dream of my father's."  </P> <P> Stein's famous father cast a big shadow over her childhood, and in a way, it's  where the story of her conception of the magazine begins. She grew up in a  majestic house on Angelo Drive in Beverly Hills that overlooked Rudolph  Valentino's home, Falcon's Lair. (Rupert Murdoch later bought the Steins'  mansion.)  </P> <P> "It was beautiful," Stein recalls. "You really had a sense of privacy, being  alone. It was kind of lonely, too."  </P> <P> Stein was hemmed in by two strong-willed parents and a German governess, who  were not fond of children having their own opinions.  </P> <P> "You were supposed to do what you were told," Stein recalls. "I guess you  become rebellious to survive."  </P> <P> She was eventually shipped off to the Katharine Branson School in San  Francisco, which was strict -- "I always liked to say it was located between  San Quentin and Alcatraz."  </P> <P> And later to a school in Lausanne, Switzerland, which was not -- "They only  made a law after you broke it. But it was freedom. It was heaven."  </P> <P> Stein later went to Wellesley College, but she dropped out and moved to Paris,  where she studied at the Sorbonne and joined forces with her friend George  Plimpton at the Paris Review in the mid-'50s. While she was in Paris, she met  William Faulkner, who did double duty as a successful suitor and her first  published interview subject.  </P> <P> In a rare and provocative coming out, Faulkner talked about art, Hollywood and  bourbon, informing readers of the Paris Review that "the best job that was ever  offered to me was to become a landlord in a brothel. In my opinion it's the  perfect milieu for an artist to work in."  </P> <P> "He said it was the first time he had ever spoken seriously about his work,"  Stein says. "Usually he would say to people, 'I'm just a farmer.' He was a very  great man. He had great values, and I think growing up in Hollywood is not the  best place for values. And I was a lost soul."  </P> <P> In the late '50s, Stein worked in New York as an assistant to Clay Felker, then  features editor of Esquire Magazine. But it was as an interviewer that Stein  found her metier. By the early '60s, she was married to socialite William  Vanden Heuvel. (They later divorced.) And when he was appointed a special  assistant to then-U.S. Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy, they moved to Washington.  </P> <P> In those days, Stein's interests were largely confined to the arts, and Kennedy  liked to chastise her for her tunnel vision, reminding her that there was a big  political world out there.  </P> <P> And when Robert Kennedy was assassinated, she rode his funeral train from St.  Patrick's in New York to Arlington National Cemetery in Washington. It was a  life-turning event for Stein, prompting her to conduct years of interviews that  resulted in a 1971 oral history edited by Plimpton, "American Journey: The  Times of Robert Kennedy." The book, structured as a series of recollections  pegged to different stages of the funeral journey, was warmly praised by the  New Yorker, which called it "serious, credible, and even beautiful."  </P> <P> In 1982, Stein published "Edie: An American Biography," another lauded oral  history edited by Plimpton. This one was about California blueblood and Andy  Warhol "youthquaker" Edie Sedgwick, whose troubled life ended in a drug  overdose in 1971.  </P> <P> Stein had known Edie, and considered her sort of "a younger sister." And she  spent 10 relentless years on interviews for the book, returning to some  subjects as many as 15 times. A friend liked to say that you'd think Stein was  in a wind tunnel, she was so single-minded in her pursuit of people.  </P> <P> Now Stein has turned back to Hollywood for her next book, and her Larry Flynt  piece is a small excerpt of it. It will be something about how the Old  Hollywood meets the New Hollywood, and she's been interviewing another diverse  bunch, from filmmaker King Vidor to her parents' butler for 25 years, Charles  Harris, who had previously worked at San Simeon.  </P> <P> But Stein doesn't limit herself to books any more, ever since the completion of  "Edie" left her with "a really serious postpartum."  </P> <P> "Starting the magazine gave me, even though I was already working on my next  book, it gave me the feeling I wouldn't fall off the precipice again," she  says.  </P> <P> It also gives her a chance to be a rebel, and quite a distinguished one at  that. Stein is thumbing her nose at those who insist a literary magazine is all  seriousness, and no fun. She wants to be, well, outrageous, to publish stuff  about a millionaire porn pusher who employs a big security guard called  Monstro-Kraut, and say, yeah, that's Literature.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's iconoclastic instead of outrageous," Stein says thoughtfully. "That  you have the freedom to rebel. That you can be what you want."  </P></p>

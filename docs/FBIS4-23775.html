			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The escape of Chief M.K.O. Abiola, the former  presidential candidate of the defunct Social Democratic Party,  SDP, from his domain, continues to receive attention from the  newspapers. One of them, the DAILY SKETCH, reports that the  Nigeria police have explained Chief Abiola's escape, in which  the force denied any complicity in the event. The paper notes  that this angle to the political situation calls for explanation  in order to disabuse the minds of those who believed that  policemen were in Chief Abiola's house when he escaped. The  SKETCH quotes the police as saying that Chief Abiola, who was  alleged to have declared himself president of Nigeria on  Saturday [11 June] disguised as a woman and escaped from his  Ikeja residence in Lagos. The paper reports that this incident  happened before the arrival of the police.    Although the police refuted the story that Chief Abiola  declared himself president on Saturday, THE GUARDIAN on his  front page has a picture of Chief Abiola and his agents at  Ekpetedo in Lagos, where he was purported to have announced his  presidency in respect of the annulled 12 June presidential  election last year by the former military regime.    In a related story, the SKETCH reports that some eminent  Nigerians have called for dialogue as a positive means of  resolving the political situation in the country. It quotes the  Archbishop of Lagos, Dr. Anthony Olufomi Okoje, as stating that  democracy could not be achieved through violence, force, or in a  chaotic situation. Rather, it would be achieved in an atmosphere  of peace.    Reporting on the same story, THE GUARDIAN has it that the  Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, wants the Abiola and  Abacha camp to use dialogue instead of confrontation to achieve  peace in Nigeria. On its part, the LAGOS HORIZON described the  situation in Lagos yesterday, Monday, in its lead story as that  of an uneasy calm in the state. It adds that workers were at  their duty posts even though transport was light because many  transport operators stayed off the roads, and the petrol  stations were locked up to avoid molestation by some  pro-democracy groups.    However, the DAILY TIMES reports that there were pockets of  protests in some parts of Lagos by pro-democracy activists who  called on the military to quit politics in Nigeria. According  to the paper, these were peaceful as some security agents were  able to control the situation.</p>

			<p>940316 FT  16 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Qantas plans China service Qantas, the large Australian airline in which British Airways holds a minority stake, has said that it wants to re-start a service to China on June 1 - a move which could sound the death knell for the fledgling Australian carrier Australia Air International. AA secured rights to China last year from the International Air Services Commission, which allocates Australia's international routes. At that stage, Qantas, which ceased operations to China in 1987, did not make an application. AA had hoped to start operating in 1993, and even published proposed schedules but the carrier subsequently failed to meet IASC financial requirements. Qantas plans a once-a-week flight to Beijing via Guangzhou, using a Boeing 767 aircraft.</p>

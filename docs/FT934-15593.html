			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / European airlines agree size of stakes in planned alliance THE FOUR European national airlines planning to create an alliance to challenge British Airways and Lufthansa have agreed the controversial question of how to value their stakes in the partnership. The negotiations, which could eventually lead to a full merger between Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Austrian Airlines will come to a head at a meeting in Zurich tomorrow. Agreement on the complex valuation issue gives an important boost to the negotiations, confirming the four airlines' commitment to the pact. Under the proposed Alcazar alliance, Swissair, SAS and KLM would each own 30 per cent of the new centralised management company and Austrian 10 per cent. The airlines agreed the split could not be achieved without adjustments to reflect the relative worth of each airline. The Swiss argued their carrier's valuation should be higher it was not as highly geared as SAS or KLM. But SAS and KLM argued that Swissair faced a less promising long-term future because it had been losing market share in Europe, was not a European Community carrier and had higher labour costs. The partners are thought to have agreed that Swissair's share of the joint company should be 35-36 per cent, about Dollars 250m-Dollars 350m more than the other airlines. To close the gap KLM and SAS would increase their worth by increasing their equity, while Swissair would reduce its valuation by paying a special dividend to its shareholders. Austrian Airlines is still wavering between the Alcazar partnership or co-operating with Lufthansa. The airline's management is understood to favour Alcazar, but its majority shareholder, the Austrian state, is undecided and appears to be leaning towards the German carrier. However, the three larger partners would proceed even if Austrian pulled out, sources close to the negotiations said. Even if agreement is reached on Tuesday, the four airlines still have difficult issues to resolve, including the structure of the new centralised management company, the location of its headquarters and the selection of a US airline partner. The choice of the headquarters appears to have been narrowed down to either Amsterdam or Copenhagen. But the choice of a US partner could prove difficult since Swissair has links with Delta Air Lines, KLM with Northwest Airlines and SAS with Continental Airlines.</p>

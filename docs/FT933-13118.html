			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Agencies to set codes of conduct GOVERNMENT enforcement agencies will be obliged to publish codes of conduct by next January, under proposals produced by the the government's 'red tape' review. The agencies - public bodies including the Civil Aviation Authority, the Pollution Inspectorate and the Health and Safety Executive - will be required to produce codes covering standards, complaints procedures, value for money, and 'courtesy and helpfulness'. The code is one of the few definite new proposals in yesterday's 'progress report' by the deregulation team at the Department of Trade and Industry, following a meeting of ministers with the prime minister and Lord Sainsbury, the government's deregulation adviser. Mr Tim Sainsbury, standing in for Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said an 'important' Deregulation Bill was under consideration, but he refused to disclose the matters it would cover and said its introduction would only come 'as soon as parliamentary time permits'. Mr Sainsbury - Lord Sainsbury's brother - said: 'Deregulation is a vital element in helping to improve the competitiveness of British industry: reviews of departments' regulations are now yielding major prospects for change.' Proposals under consideration include the ending of remaining restrictions on weekday shop opening in England and Wales; a review of key areas of food law including hygiene, labelling and enforcement; a green paper on the regulation of taxis and minicabs; and a change in the licensing regime for heavy goods vehicles and buses. The Department of Social Security and Inland Revenue will take a 'fresh look' at rules governing the designation of people as self-employed, and the DSS will review the statutory sick pay regime. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has set up a working group to look at the burden of different definitions of earning for tax and national insurance purposes.

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Norsk Data deeper in the red NORSK DATA, the troubled Norwegian mini-computer group, made a loss, before year-end allocations, of NKr810m (Dollars 125.6m) for 1991, against a NKr134m deficit in 1990. It plans to cut a further 500 jobs. The deterioration in financial performance was exacerbated by a NKr655m non-recurring restructuring charge in connection with the group's transformation into a computer service company. Operating revenue fell 23 per cent to NKr1.81bn. Total orders last year dropped by 18 per cent to NKr1.9bn, while orders for computer systems and solutions fell by 23 per cent to NKr950m. The group's order reserve, however, rose by 28 per cent to NKr243m. Norsk Data said developments in 1991 were dominated by the far-reaching reorganisation announced last September. 'This resulted in a completely new structure built upon autonomous companies in Scandinavia,' it said. It said these companies showed a profit in the fourth quarter of 1991, their first reporting period as separate units. The company stressed that its biggest problem in 1991 involved ND Comtec and its German subsidiary. 'The collapse of the Robert Maxwell empire stopped QED Technology, a Maxwell offshoot, from reaching agreement to buy ND Comtec.' As a result, ND Comtec has been wound down and staff has been reduced to 23 from 203. In Germany, Norsk Data reduced staff by 230 to 165. 'The German operation is now concentrated and focused on maintenance activities and sales to existing customers,' the company said. It said it had cut more than 780 jobs last year within the group, and that a further 500 jobs would go this year. It would have 1,300 employees by the middle of the year. Last year operating costs were reduced to NKr1.8bn from NKr2.31bn in 1990.</p>

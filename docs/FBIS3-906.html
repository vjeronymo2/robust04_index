"I want to go home now. It is not fair to continue  to keep me here (in Nigeria) and prevent me from participating  in the peace process," the Nigerian press quoted Johnson Tuesday  [15 March] as saying.    Johnson was leader of the Independent National Patriotic  Front of Liberia (INPFL), a breakaway faction of Charles  Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). [passage  omitted]    "Charles Taylor who shed uncountable blood is now  participating in the peace process. What of me who wanted peace  all along and supported the cause of peace," Johnson was quoted  Tuesday as saying. He said that he did not seek asylum in  Nigeria before he was brought in December 1992. "Nigeria  plotted my coming here. They have been taking good care of me  and my family," he said, adding: "If I am to think of the good  things the government makes sure I enjoy, I may not bother to go  home." "But the point is this: Where is my future? What of my  teeming supporters in Liberia, in Europe, in America and  elsewhere in the world"? he asked.    Johnson said he has written to the Nigerian military leader,  Gen. Sani Abacha and the ECOWAS chairman, President Nicephore  Soglo of Benin Republic on his fate. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: CHECKING OUT THE DAY-CARE CENTERS  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm afraid I'm going to have to put my 8-month-old baby in  day care if I'm going to be able to get the job I want and need. I'm terrified  about child abuse in day-care centers, but my husband says that this is silly  and highly unlikely. I'm very torn about what to do. What's your view?  </P> <P>  -- R.B.  </P> <P> DEAR R.B.: If there's any way you can stay with your baby for the first year  or, preferably, two years, I'm all for it. So if it's just a case of getting a  better job or extra money, then I believe it would be wise to wait. If,  however, the money you'd be earning isn't "extra" but actually is necessary to  live, if you're a single parent or if you're so driven that you'd resent  staying home, then it's probably better to go the day-care route.  </P> <P> Your concerns certainly aren't "silly." It's essential to take time to check  out day-care centers for children of any age. It's true, however, that of  35,845 cases of sexual child abuse reported in 1986, only 5.12% took place in  day care or were committed by baby sitters.  </P> <P> It's important for parents to teach their children about the difference between  good touch, bad touch and confusing touch. Parents of young children also  should be aware of signs of abuse, such as irritated genital or rectal areas,  bruises or sores around the mouth, eating or sleeping disturbances, withdrawal  or hyperactivity or fear of strangers or any particular stranger. Older  children are likely to be sexually aggressive with other children if they've  been victims of abuse.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My wife and I have planned our baby for five years and I  thought we'd timed it perfectly. Something has gone wrong, however, because now  that we finally have our wonderful daughter, my wife is depressed and in tears  most of the time. I'm beginning to wonder if she really loves our child. I've  never seen her this way before. Basically, my wife has always had a rather  happy, easygoing disposition. What could be wrong?  </P> <P>  -- J.E.  </P> <P> DEAR J.E.: She could very well be suffering from postpartum depression, and  it's important to ask your physician about this possibility. This illness is  usually temporary and can be treated, but it can be serious enough to cause  women to harm their babies and almost always robs them of the joy they should  experience at this time of motherhood.  </P> <P> According to an expert in this field, Dr. Susan Hickman, postpartum psychosis  is a biochemical illness precipitated by the hormonal upheaval with the loss of  the placenta at delivery. The illness affects about 1 in 1,000 mothers.  </P></p>

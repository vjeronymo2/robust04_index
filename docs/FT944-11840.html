			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Suharto eases Timor stance Indonesia's President Suharto has struck a conciliatory note over troubled East Timor, saying he was willing to meet exiled East Timorese for talks. According to Mr Lopes da Cruz, the country's envoy for East Timor, the president said during a meeting yesterday that reconciliation talks could be continued and that more East Timorese needed to be involved. 'He also agreed to meet East Timorese living in exile, but no date has been fixed yet.' Mr da Cruz said that he himself would meet some East Timorese leaders living in Australia, but did not say when. Opponents in Australia have been the most vocal. The envoy quoted Mr Suharto as saying that East Timor could be granted autonomy but added that it would be within the Indonesian context of being a part of the archipelago. In Dili, the capital of East Timor, the announcement was greeted with some caution; a prominent local Timorese suggested it could be for show ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Bogor near Jakarta on November 15. Mr Suharto will host the meeting, which will be attended by President Bill Clinton.</p>

The foreign minister is urging the Palestinians to allow  implementation of self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho and to  put off their demands that have stalled the talks until  negotiations begin on the fate of the rest of the West Bank.  David Ze'ev reports:    [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] Contacts between Israel and the  PLO can happen at any moment these days, including twice by  phone as Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was briefing the Knesset  Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Palestinian negotiator  Nabil Sha'th was on the other end. A Knesset official at the  closed-door committee meeting referred to the second phone  conversation as relatively long, lasting several minutes.  Members of the media followed Peres when he slipped into a side  room after the committee meeting ended. The foreign minister  said there was nothing to report, at least in public:    [Peres] Nothing for the public knowledge yet.    [Ze'ev] But Peres made it clear that Israeli rejection of at  least certain Palestinian demands is not final. The PLO has  been told by Israel: Let's get the Gaza-Jericho First self-rule  arrangements moving and then you may raise the demands again.    [Peres] There were requests that were rejected, and Chairman  'Arafat returned to them. Actually we told the Palestinians:  Look, this is not the end of the story. We do not understand  'Arafat's claim that this is a Bantustan, because in a matter of  several months we are going to continue the negotiations about  other parts of the West Bank. So actually what they are  claiming is not land, but wasting time [sentence as heard]. In  due course we shall continue the negotiations. It is not a  closed story.    [Ze'ev] Inside the committee room the foreign minister is  said to have insisted that Israel will not compromise on  controlling security at the border crossings into Jordan from  the Jericho area, and into Egypt from Gaza. Peres said the  Palestinians have withdrawn their demand for an international  force. But in response to a question, Peres did not rule out  that Jewish settlers could be uprooted, though he said it would  be an internal Israeli decision, not in the shadow of the  negotiations. And on the upcoming summit between U.S. President  Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al- Asad, Peres said  despite the high hopes in the United States for dramatic  progress, he has his doubts.

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Southern Business falls to Pounds 12.2m - Pounds 3m provision for renegotiating leasing contracts with customers hits outcome Southern Business Group, the photocopier and vending machines supplier, blamed a Pounds 3m provision for renegotiating leasing contracts with its customers for a 21 per cent fall in annual profits. In the year to September 30 pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 12.2m on flat turnover of Pounds 57.7m (Pounds 57.3m). The provision followed the decision last year to make fundamental changes in the way leasing arrangements were marketed and administered. Such arrangements are being examined by the Office of Fair Trading, which is expected to publish a report next month on the tactics of photocopier companies. Shortly before the OFT began its inquiry last year a number of Southern's employees resigned or were sacked after the company admitted improprieties in dealings with some clients. Since then contracts have been overhauled to 'ensure continued goodwill' with customers. Mr David McErlain, chairman and chief executive, said: 'During 1993 the emphasis has been on retraining our sales staff. They now operate under a strict code of conduct.' The group has renegotiated some 2,000 contracts, about 20 per cent of the total, and said it would renegotiate other deals in the next 12 months. The company said that future provisions would not exceed Pounds 200,000. Seven former customers, however, are involved in legal action against the group. They are seeking damages for alleged breach of contract and misrepresentation, but the total claims are thought to be less than Pounds 100,000. The company is also engaged in legal action against five former salesmen for alleged breach of agency agreements and breach of confidence. Mr McErlain said the action had not hampered an improvement in the company's current trading but warned that 1994 would be another tough year for suppliers. 'We've changed our ways. Now we can now grow by taking business from rivals,' he added. Although earnings per share fell to 8.44p (10.62p), the company said it was strong enough to propose an increase in its final dividend to 2.45p making a total of 3.72p (3.38p), a rise of 10 per cent. COMMENT Photocopier leasing companies are still suffering from their reputation for extracting onerous contracts from unwitting customers, and Southern is no exception. Although it has spent Pounds 3m to put its house in order, continuing legal action has not enhanced the company's standing. It has, however, made contract changes beyond the anticipated scope of the OFT inquiry and now offers some of the most flexible deals around. Unfortunately, hopes that the changes would make it the dominant company in the leasing market have been undermined by the arrival of two large US rivals, Alco Standard and Danka. Intensifying competition is expected to keep profits at about Pounds 13m, which puts the shares on a prospective multiple of 9.4. Against those flat prospects, the shares, down 2p yesterday at 82p, are not expected to show a sharp improvement in the year ahead.</p>

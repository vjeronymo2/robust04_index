			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Right wing rejects ANC compromise Right-wing parties in South Africa yesterday rejected compromise constitutional proposals from the African National Congress and refused to attend a multi-party conference to discuss amending the constitution to meet their demands. In an attempt to split the right-wing Freedom Alliance and tempt some moderate members to defy their leaders and accept a constitutional compromise, the ANC-dominated multi-party negotiating forum yesterday agreed to enshrine the ANC's compromise offer in the constitution, with or without Freedom Alliance approval. Towards this end, the 1993 constitution was amended to give provincial governments some powers of independent taxation,to protect provincial powers from diminution after the April election, and to introduce separate ballots for national and provincial elections - all important Freedom Alliance demands. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief negotiator, appealed to the right wing to accept the compromise. 'We urge them to do South Africa a favour, and not to plunge this country into a crisis,' he said, after a violent weekend left 48 people dead, some of them in election-related violence. However, only a limited concession was offered to the Freedom Alliance on the crucial issue of the powers of provincial governments in areas such as policing and a host of other functions. The Freedom Alliance yesterday demanded that provincial governments have sole authority over areas such as provincial policing, provincial defence, and the regional civil service, while the ANC continued to insist that central government should have broadly defined powers to override provincial government in all areas. As part of the continuing battle to avoid blame for the failure of constitutional talks, government and ANC negotiators last night changed the wording of the constitution dealing with provincial powers to a form of words which would appear more attractive to the Freedom Alliance, but which would not have any practical effect. It was hoped this further concession might make it possible for moderate right-wing leaders to claim victory, without substantially affecting the nature of the constitut ion. Government and ANC negotiators said that there was no legal deadline for further constitutional amendments before the April 27 elections, but that practical difficulties would prevent any further changes after last night's session.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Force may be neededto stop proliferation THE major powers may have to use force to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in Third World countries, the International Institute of Strategic Studies warns today. Regional efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, ballistic missiles and advanced conventional forces 'increasingly threaten not just regional stability, but even the global stability brought about by the end of superpower rivalry,' the London-based institute said in its annual Strategic Survey. If those on the verge of acquiring weapons of mass destruction could not be persuaded voluntarily to reverse their policies, the major powers might be forced to make them change their minds. However the IISS dismissed as 'laughable' any idea US forces could act as a 'globo-cop'. The Institute suggested that 1995, when 146 signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty meet, might be the time for the nuclear power states to substantially cut their armaments.</p>

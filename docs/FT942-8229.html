			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Revisionism on pensions Sir, Am I right in thinking that 'defined benefits' in the last line of the penultimate paragraph of your editorial commentary (May 17), and 'defined benefit plans' in the last line of the final paragraph should read respectively 'defined contributions' and 'defined contribution plans'? David Lang, 6 Cornwall Road, Dorchester, DT1 1RT This is correct: we regret the error.</p>

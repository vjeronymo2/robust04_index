			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Wang Mingshan (3769 2494 0810), chairman, Jiangxi </F> Provincial Planning Commission, given on 25 February 1994 at the  Second Session of the Eighth Jiangxi Provincial People's  Congress: "Report on the Implementation of the 1993 Economic and  Social Development Plan"]    [Excerpts] During 1993, high and low throughout the entire  province continued to implement the spirit of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's important speeches, of the 14th CPC National  Congress, and of the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee. It was a year of further liberation of minds, seeking  truth from facts, seizing opportunities, and accelerating  developments. As the economy developed rapidly, attention was  paid to strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and  control and to creatively launch new undertakings. The entire  province experienced economic development, accelerating reform,  as well as political stability and social progress. This year  the growth rate of main economic indices was the fastest since  the initiation of reform and opening to the outside world, and  continued to be higher than the national average. Total national  output value of the province was 68.6 billion yuan, which  amounted to an increase, computed at comparable prices, of 15.8  percent over the preceding year. This increase was composed of  4.5 percent in the primary industries, 31.2 percent in the  secondary industries, and 12.5 percent in the tertiary  industries. The total national output value per capita reached  1,742 yuan, which was a net increase of 307 yuan over the figure  in the preceding year. The total industrial and agricultural  output for the first time exceeded the 100 billion yuan mark as  it reached 122.1 billion yuan, an increase of 27.5 percent over  the preceding year, while the total amount of retail sales of  social commodities reached 27.9 billion yuan, an increase of  21.2 percent over the preceding year. Fiscal revenue was 6.56  billion yuan, an increase of 30.8 percent. The rate of natural  population increase had been controlled to within plan figures.  Main norms in the 1993 economic and social development plan for  Jiangxi Province, as approved at the First Session of the Eighth  Provincial People's Congress, have been essentially fulfilled  and in some cases overfulfilled.    Agriculture has overcome the effects of various natural  calamities and has again achieved an abundant harvest, thanks to  the preceding four consecutive years of steady development.  Total agricultural output value for the entire province was 33.8  billion yuan, an increase of 5.1 percent over the preceding  year. Grain production was 15.17 billion kg, which was 670  million kg above the assigned norm of the state plan, cotton  production was 156,000 tons, an increase of 5.1 percent, and  fairly large increases were also achieved in the production of  edible oils, cured tobacco, fruit, and other products. Animal  husbandry and the aquatic products industry experienced  continuous development. Total production of meat was 1.575  million tons, an increase of 11.7 percent, while production of  aquatic products was 490,000 tons, an increase of 18.6 percent.  The rural economy experienced all-round developments, with the  total output value of village and township enterprises  throughout the province reaching 57.94 billion yuan, an increase  of 92.2 percent over the preceding year. New progress was made  in the structural adjustment of the rural economy: the  proportion of industrial crops in the total agricultural output  value was raised by almost 3 percentage points, and the output  value of nonagricultural production in the rural areas for the  first time exceeded total agricultural output value, as its  proportion reached 58.8 percent of rural total social output  value, an almost 10 percentage points increase over the  preceding year.    Industry overcame the difficulties in energy sources,  communications, and stringency in capital funds and maintained  its speedy growth. Total industrial output value of the entire  province was 88.3 billion yuan, 24.7 billion yuan more than in  the preceding year, an increase of 38.8 percent. Output value of  the secondary industries for the first time exceeded that of the  primary industries, its proportion in the national output value  showing an increase of 3.4 percentage points. Economic returns  improved further. The production-sales ratio for industrial  products manufactured at the village and higher than village  levels throughout the province reached 96.5 percent, an increase  of 2.4 percentage points over the preceding year. Sales income  from budgeted industrial enterprises increased 40.7 percent,  creating 46 percent more profits and taxes. Large increases were  registered in the production of main industrial products,  especially in investment-type products and well-selling  high-quality products, compared with the preceding year. Village  and township industrial production achieved a value of 38.15  billion yuan, an increase of 90.2 percent. The new increases in  village and township industrial output value accounted for 73  percent of the newly added industrial output value of the entire  province, and has become a major sector of increase in the fast  economic growth throughout the province.    It was a year of record investments in fixed assets and of  the completion of a record number of projects, the investment  structure was continuously improved, and key constructions were  further strengthened. According to initial statistics,  society-wide investments in fixed assets were completed to the  amount of 17.85 billion yuan, an increase of 42.2 percent over  the preceding year, and of these 12.32 billion yuan were  investments by state-owned units, an increase of 49.7 percent,  which was a record for the last five years. In the investments  of the state-owned units, capital constructions accounted for  6.3 billion yuan and technological transformations for 4.5  billion yuan, increases of 41.6 and 48.2 percent, respectively,  over the preceding year. Fixed asset investments further tended  to be directed toward infrastructure, key industries, and  technological transformations. The proportion of investments in  projects of the electric power, transportation, and  communication industries, and in agriculture in relation to the  total key project investments of all state-owned units was 7.4  percentage points higher than in the preceding year. Investments  in key construction projects were substantially strengthened,  and the completion of such constructions proceeded smoothly. The  whole length of the Jiangxi sector of the Beijing-Jiulong  Railway is under construction, and last year a section involving  an investment of 1.89 billion yuan was completed. This had  comprised completion of one bridge and 18 tunnels on the  Ji'an-Ganzhou-Dingnan section, completion of work on the  Xiangwu-Jian section, about to be opened to traffic, while  double-tracking of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway is being speeded  up. There, a length of 89 km on the Jiangxi side has been  completed. On the Hengfeng-Nanchang railway, work has started on  the Shangrao section and on a railway station at Shangrao. Two  sets of 125,000 kilowatt generators of the Pingxiang power plant  and four sets of 3,200 kw generators of the Jinggangchong power  station have been linked up with the network and are generating  electricity. The large bridge at Nanchang and the Nanchang-Jiao  section of the Nanchang-Jiujiang expressway have been completed.  The Qingyun Waterworks in Nanchang have gone into operation and  are supplying water. The new building of the provincial library  has also been officially completed last year. Construction of  other projects, such as the Xinyu power plant, the Jingdezhen  power plant, the Huangjin airfield at Ganzhou, the Luojia  airfield at Jindezhen, the Mahuiling airfield at Jiujiang, the  large chemical fertilizer project at Jiujiang, the paper factory  at Yichun, the epoxy-propane projects at the Jiujiang chemical  plant, and the Jiangxi salt mine, are being energetically  pursued. The 45 priority technological transformation projects  listed in the plan have progressed as required. Among these, 18  projects, among them the long fiber polyester production line at  the Jiangxi chemical fiber and chemical engineering plant, the  Jiangxi Hongmei architectural ceramics production line, the  vaccine production line at the Jiangxi pharmaceutical plant, and  the Jiangxi traditional Chinese medicine plant, have all been  completed and started production, construction of all the other  projects is smoothly progressing.    There is brisk buying and selling in urban and rural  markets,  and the living standard of the people is continuously rising.  All through 1993, there was a brisk and flourishing trade in  urban and rural markets, and the growth of total retail sales of  social commodities accelerated month after month. For the entire  province, total retail sales of social commodities achieved the  amount of 27.9 billion yuan, an increase of 21.2 percent over  the preceding year. Commodity retail prices increased 11.1  percent. Sales in rural markets looked better month after month,  retail sales of commodities in counties and their subordinate  administrative entities increased 22.5 percent over the  preceding year, and were by 1.3 percentage points higher than  the growth rate of total social commodity retail sales. Sales of  means of production continued brisk, and aggregate sales of the  materials system throughout the year amounted to 9.37 billion  yuan, an increase of 54.8 percent over the preceding year.  Following the economic upswing, incomes of urban and rural  residents continued to go up. Average per capita net income of  peasants reached 870 yuan, a 102 yuan increase over the  preceding year, which amounted to a real, inflation factor  discounted, increase of 4.6 percent. The living expenditure  income of city and town residents was 1,800 yuan, an increase of  380 yuan, or 26 percent, showing a real, inflation discounted,  income increase of around 10 percent, and making this the year  of the fastest increase since the initiation of reform and  opening to the outside world. The average per capita salary and  wages of staff and workers was 2,450 yuan, a 296 yuan, or 13.7  percent, increase. Savings deposits of surplus money by urban  and rural residents amounted to 32.165 billion yuan, of which  8.385 billion had been newly added during the year, making this  also a record year for new deposits in Jiangxi. The average per  capita savings deposit was 811 yuan, an increase of 205 yuan  over the preceding year.    Exports continued to increase, and efforts were intensified  to attract merchants and capital. During the first half of 1993,  exports were affected by the adverse situation in the  international and domestic markets and declined for a time.  However, after May, the provincial government took effective  measures which again improved exports month after month. Total  provincial exports amounted to $883 million, an increase of 14  percent over the preceding year. Last year the government held  trade talks in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places to attract  merchants and capital to Jiangxi, and did so with evident  success. During the year, 1,293 new "three-capital" enterprises  were approved, and contracts involving $1 billion of capital  funds were signed. The amount of foreign capital actually used  was $343 million, an increase of 72 percent over the preceding  year. In this amount, $135 million were loans from foreign  governments or international monetary organizations, while $208  million were direct investments by foreign enterprises.    Continued development in various social fields. Smooth  progress was made in the application of science and technology  to promote agriculture and enterprises, also in priority  undertakings and in "torch plan" projects. Throughout the year,  a total of 420 achievements were gained in scientific and  technological fields. Development of the high-tech production  and development zone at Nanchang made good progress.  Construction and reforms at the Nanchang University made smooth  progress, and the university was granted authority to confer  doctoral degrees, which put an end to the long history of  Jiangxi being without any institution authorized to grant  doctoral degrees. The institutions of higher learning and  secondary professional training colleges throughout the province  enrolled 46,800 students from higher and middle technical  schools, an increase of 8,000 over the preceding year, and newly  added several much needed undergraduate and technical  college-level schools, also appropriately expanded the admission  ratio of officially assigned and self-paying students. Planned  parenthood work is continuously strengthened; the natural growth  rate of the population throughout the province was 13.33 per  thousand. Fresh developments were also registered in all such  social affairs as cultural activities, public health, sports,  broadcasting, television, information services, and publishing.    Delegates, the above-stated circumstances indicate that  implementation of last year's economic and social development  plan has in general been satisfactory. An excellent foundation  was laid for the fulfillment five years ahead of time of the  quadrupling of national production output value decided upon by  the provincial party committee and the provincial government.  This is the result of party committees and governments at all  levels throughout the province firmly adhering to the  fundamental line of "one central task and two basic points"  [economic development plus adherence to the four cardinal  principles and implementation of reform and the open policy]. It  is also the result of conscientiously implementing all general  and specific policies of the CPC Central Committee and of the  State Council, and the result of the solidarity, struggle, and  common effort of all the people of the province.    However, we must also realize that new contradictions and  problems exist in our economic processes: First, the very  conspicuous contradiction in the capital supply-demand  situation; second, the uneven way in which economic  profitability has been restored, many state enterprises are  still incurring losses; third, the excessively high rate of the  commodity price inflation during the second half of the year,  which is having a painful effect on the livelihood of the  lower-paid part of the population; fourth, the weakness of  agriculture in its ability to withstand natural calamities. We  shall in the future adopt effective measures and make a  conscientious effort to resolve all these contradictions and  problems.</p>

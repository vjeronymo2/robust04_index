			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- A prominent figure in  China's securities industry today said the Chinese stock market  has entered a period of readjustment but remains promising.    Commenting on the recent sluggish performance of China's  stock market, Guan Jinsheng, president of the Shanghai  International Securities Co. Ltd (Sisco), said that it is only  natural for the market to plummet after the share prices were  sent through the roof.    "China's stock market is so young that it fluctuates  wildly,"  Guan said.    At present, the share indexes at the Shanghai Stock Exchange  dived below 620 points while those at the Shenzhen exchange  dropped underneath the level of 170 points. This is in sharp  contrast with the bullish mood a year ago.    "The falling of the share indexes was inevitable," Guan  said,  citing China's macro-economic control measures as a reason.    "Undoubtedly they have a certain bearing on the stumble --  the stock market always eases when interest rates are put up to  dampen inflation -- it's a common scene all over the world, Guan  added. [no closing quotation marks as received]    But the stock market plunge mainly resulted from its  intricate structural problems, Guan stressed. It is due to the  fact that share-trading and share-offering are closely related  to each other, he said.    Yet in share-offering, their magnitudes are strictly  controlled, only to neglect the quality of the listed companies  and enterprises [as received], he said.    He called on securities companies, which act as  underwriters,  to bear the responsibility and obligation to ensure the quality  of their clients.    Certified public accountancy firms should also help in this  regard by carefully checking the re-evaluation of the assets and  financial reports; and stock exchanges and supervisory organs  should fend off any administrative interferences wherever they  come from, he said.    He also expressed concern over the dominating speculative  attitude in the trading of stocks and pinned the blame on the  flawed composition of investors. Now about eight million  individual investors are pulling together efforts to prop up a  market of nearly 300 billion yuan in market value -- it can only  make sense after institutions and funds join in, he said.    The stock market can hopefully keep stable only when 50-100  funds, each of which has billions yuan of assets, are involved  to select shares and enterprises for long-term investment, he  added.    Guan became optimistic when talking about the future of  China's stock market and predicted a period of substantive  development in the coming few years.    With the gradual perfection of its macro-economic control  system, Guan said, China will be capable of avoiding vicious  inflation and attaining rapid economic growth. "There is no  reason to believe the prospects of the stock market -- a  barometer of the economy -- are not bright," Guan said.    He said the establishment of a modern enterprise system in  China will give rise to new channels and instruments of  financing and eventually the trade of property rights, which are  bound to stimulate the development of the securities industry.    Another contributing factor is the formation of a team of  supervisory as well as operating personnel over the past few  years since China began to embrace the stock market as a means  of financing.</p>

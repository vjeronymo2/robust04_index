			<p>BFN     [Text] The Duma passed a federal budget bill for 1994 after  its second hearing on Wednesday without introducing amendments  to the planned budget revenue, expenditure, and deficit. A  total of 227 lawmakers voted for the bill (a quorum requires  226), 40 voted against, and 32 abstained.    The draft of the 1994 federal budget provides for 194.4  trillion rubles in expenditure and 124.4 trillion rubles in  revenue with the deficit planned at 70 trillion rubles or 9.6  percent of the GDP.    Legislators approved without debate the Duma Budget  Committee's proposal to boost defense spending from 37.1  trillion rubles to 40.6 trillion rubles by redistributing budget  allocations. The bill also envisages raising additional funds  for defense and other purposes.    Speaking before the vote First Deputy Finance Minister  Vladimir Petrov declared that his ministry was dropping its  demand to reserve 1.5 trillion rubles to pay off internal  currency debts. He said talks will be opened to discuss ways of  rescheduling the debts repayment to January 1995.    Under the law the government must take the Duma's budget  comments into account and submit the bill for the final third  hearing within two weeks.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Finance community in shock: James Buxton reports on the conviction of a Scottish analyst for insider dealing THE conviction yesterday of Mr Thorold Mackie for insider dealing was greeted with shock by many in the Edinburgh financial community last night. 'It's a travesty, it's appalling,' said a bank official who knows him well and had followed the trial closely. Mr Mackie, 39, is probably the best-known investment analyst in Scotland and his fate aroused personal sympathy. It also caused anxiety  - the offence of which he was found guilty concerned information given by a company chairman to an investment analyst, routine business in the Edinburgh financial community. Although the trial was held at the Court of Session in Edinburgh under Scottish judicial procedures, the offence was against UK-wide law - the 1985 Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. It was the first case of its kind in Scotland but the offence could equally have been committed in England. The crux of the case against Mr Mackie was that in September 1991 he had been informed by Mr Peter Runciman, then chairman of the waste disposal company Shanks &amp; McEwan, that the company was about to issue a profits warning - a piece of acutely price-sensitive information. Mr Mackie, it was alleged, then 'counselled and procured' two salesmen in Bell Lawrie White, the stockbrokers for which he worked, to deal in the shares. By selling clients' shares ahead of the profits warning the shares realised Pounds 1.39m more than if they had been sold after the warning. The trial therefore concerned the passing-on of a specific piece of price-sensitive information, rather than the more general information a company might routinely give to an analyst and which might lead to share dealing. Mr Mackie said Mr Runciman did not mention a profits warning at their meeting, only telling him that Shanks &amp; McEwan would enjoy 'little by way of growth in earnings per share' in that half year, as part of a general briefing. As with so many things in Scotland, the trial involved people who know each other very well. Mr Runciman and Mr Mackie were on first-name terms; both have fairly high profiles and are respected in the Scottish business and financial communities. Bell Lawrie White is the leading stockbroker in Edinburgh. During the seven-day trial, a series of stockbrokers, analysts and fund managers from Edinburgh and London - the court heard 21 witnesses in all - gave evidence against Mr Mackie. Other members of the Edinburgh financial community dropped in on the Court of Session, the principal court in Scotland, just off the Royal Mile in the heart of the city, to hear what was going on. Few of them, it seems, expected Mr Mackie to be found guilty. The majority verdict appeared to take even Mr Mackie's legal team by surprise. Mr Mackie made his name in the tightly knit Scottish financial community - which concentrates on life assurance, fund management and banking - for specialising in Scottish quoted companies, of which there are about 60. He frequently complained that Scotland was producing so few of them. Until he dropped out of the limelight after being charged with insider dealing a year ago, he was frequently quoted in the Scottish press and on the radio. In court he looked a rather lonely figure, sitting upright on a long bench, alone except for a policeman at a respectful distance. Flashes of his dry sense of humour emerged when he went into the witness box on Monday. Mr Runciman, 64, is an Englishman who was recruited in the early 1980s as a company doctor to Shanks &amp; McEwan, then a privately owned and ailing Glasgow company. Through a spectacular purchase of landfill sites from Hanson in 1986 he built the company into one of Britain's biggest waste-disposal operators and became a very wealthy man after it was listed on the Stock Exchange in 1988. A courteous, almost diffident man, he gave evidence in a quiet but determined way. He retired from Shanks &amp; McEwan at the end of last year, and is treasurer of the Scottish Conservative party.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHROP SUES EX-AIDE OVER S. KOREAN DEALS  </P> <P> Aerospace contractor Northrop Corp. is suing Honolulu businessman James Shin to  recover $6.25 million allegedly paid to him and several South Korean  associates.  </P> <P> According to the suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court here, the money paid  from 1984 to 1986 was to assist "Northrop's business activities in Korea."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based manufacturer also has filed a civil lawsuit in South  Korea to recover the money Northrop says was to have financed construction of a  hotel and office complex in Seoul. The hotel was never built and the money,  paid into a Korea Exchange Bank account in Hong Kong, disappeared.  </P> <P> U.S. government investigators say the money may be part of about $7.75 million  allegedly paid by Northrop to help sell its ill-fated F-20 fighter jet. The  payments are being investigated by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, by a  U.S. congressional committee and by the government of South Korea.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1-Million Check  </P> <P> The federal investigators are trying to determine whether the Northrop payments  violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  </P> <P> Reporters have not been able to reach Shin, 51, the former operator of a  Honolulu nightclub, for comment.  </P> <P> Northrop's suit alleged that Shin secretly received a $1-million check from the  Hong Kong bank account in August, 1984.  </P> <P> In a divorce case filed against Shin last April, his wife said Shin had been  employed as an overseas aircraft sales consultant for Northrop at a salary of  $8,500 a month, plus expenses.  </P> <P> The Northrop suit says Shin was hired in April, 1983, "as a consultant and  adviser in support of Northrop's business activities in Korea."  </P> <P> In 1984, the suit says, "Northrop began considering an investment in a joint  venture with Asia Culture Travel Development Co., a Korean corporation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Photocopy surfaces  </P> <P> The suit says Shin participated in discussions for Northrop, and the two sides  agreed to build a hotel and office complex in Seoul to assist Northrop's  marketing efforts in Korea.  </P> <P> Asia Culture was controlled by Chong Kyu Park, a politically well-connected  South Korean who once served as chief bodyguard to the president of South  Korea.  </P> <P> In August, 1984, 20 days after Northrop put $6.25 million into the Hong Kong  bank account of Asia Culture, Shin received a $1-million check drawn on the  account and concealed it because it was a conflict of interest, according to  the Northrop suit.  </P> <P> Northrop learned of the $1-million check in March, 1988, when a photocopy  surfaced in Northrop's civil fraud lawsuit in South Korea, according to the  suit here.  </P> <P> Northrop's relationship with Shin is believed to have ended in early 1987.  </P></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Hard landing in sight for Japan-US air feud: Michiyo Nakamoto previews aviation rights talks seen as threat by Tokyo carriers MR Susumu Yamaji has been busy for the past year on a personal mission to save his company and the Japanese airline industry from what he sees as the adverse effects of a US-Japan aviation accord. As the chairman of Japan Air Lines, the country's main international carrier, Mr Yamaji has travelled widely and used his contacts and influence to deliver his message that the bilateral accord places Japanese carriers at an unfair disadvantage. His efforts will be put to the test this week when negotiators from the two countries meet in Washington for a second round of talks that will seek resolution of a long-festering dispute. On the agenda are two thorny items: the number of landing slots Japan gives to US carriers at the new Kansai International Airport and the use by US carriers of their 'beyond rights' - the right to fly from the US to Japan and beyond to a third country. At stake is a large and lucrative market for international air travel to and from Japan, in particular to the Asian Pacific region, but possibly including travel to and from Europe in the future. The US wants a much larger number of landing slots at Kansai airport than Japan is prepared to give. It also believes that the beyond rights US carriers are entitled to under a bilateral aviation accord should not be restricted. The aviation accord, which was agreed in 1952, gives each side the right, among others, to fly over the other's territory and to carry their nationals to the other country. A supplementary right provides for the carriers of one country to fly to the other country and from there to a third destination. It is this one that the Japanese want restricting. There is already an oversupply of air travel services that is hurting the profitability of Japanese airlines, Japanese aviation authorities say. As primary carriers, domestic airlines should have first claim over flights between Japan and other countries. US carriers flying mostly Japanese travellers out of Japan are poaching, they say. Furthermore, by pricing their flights at a lower level than that which Japanese carriers can afford to offer, US carriers are threatening to put Japanese airlines out of business. Based on that view, the Japanese authorities tried to get Northwest Airlines to limit the number of passengers getting on at Osaka in its New York-Osaka-Sydney flights to less than 50 per cent of the total. They then rejected a United Airlines' application to extend its New York-to-Tokyo flights to Sydney, prompting United to file a complaint with the US transport department. Threats of sanctions and counter-sanctions were exchanged across the Pacific. Both sides have refrained from taking further action that could raise tensions but the first bilateral meeting last October to tackle the issue ended inconclusively. For the US industry, which is losing money in its domestic market, the market centred on Japan is enticing, given that Asia is one of the few growth markets in world air travel and the US carriers are more cost-competitive than Japanese ones. Japan, however, needs to keep its international market closed to third parties to help restore domestic carriers to health. JAL reported a Y53.8bn (Pounds 340.5m) pre-tax loss in the year to March while All Nippon Airways saw profits plunge 34 per cent. To protect the future viability of its airlines, Japan wants to keep out the kind of excessive competition that is hurting the profitability of US carriers in their domestic market. For that, it needs an aviation accord modelled on the Bermuda 2 agreement between the US and the UK which restricts capacity and provides for a balanced sharing of that capacity, Mr Yamaji believes. Protection for the Japanese airline industry would not benefit Japanese airline users, however. By providing Japanese airlines with a regulated market in which competition is kept to a minimum, the Japanese authorities would be allowing them to charge high prices and make profits without taking fundamental steps to improve their international competitiveness, according to Mr Takatoshi Ito, professor of economics at Hitotsubashi University. 'What has ruined the Japanese airline industry is the over-protective administration of the ministry of transport . . . and the dependence of the management of airline companies on regulation,' Mr Ito wrote in a recent magazine article. For Japan to ask that US-Japan market share in air traffic be pre-established in a bilateral aviation accord, is as much a results-oriented policy as the market share targets proposed by the US, which Japan so firmly rejects, he says.</p>

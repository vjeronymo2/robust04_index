It is feared that this pressure will become even more  serious and more dangerous. Do you have the same feeling?    [Al-Mahdi] Yes, we too have this feeling. But with our  people's support, we are ready to face anything.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What do you mean by "anything?" Do you  foresee a military intervention?    [Al-Mahdi] We now see the indirect military intervention of  arrogance in our country. They are strengthening the rebels in  southern Sudan with arms and money. Also, they have started  conflicts in northern Sudan so that attention will be diverted  from the south and so that in the propaganda atmosphere created,  they can more easily invest in and support the rebels in the  south.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Are you not afraid because the United  States and its Western allies have militarily intervened in  Somalia, your neighbor, and do you not think that Sudan's turn  will come after Somalia?    [Al-Mahdi] Yes, basically, it would have been Sudan's turn  after Somalia. But with the lesson that the Americans learned  in Somalia, it is impossible that they will take this dangerous  risk. They are aware of the uniformity that exists between the  government and the nation of Sudan. They also have their  actions in Somalia in front of their eyes. Naturally, under  such conditions they do not consider it advisable to repeat  their disgrace in our country.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Then do you rule out the threat of a  military attack against Sudanese territory?    [Al-Mahdi] No, not completely. We only consider it  improbable and think that they have concentrated their policy  against us in other forms such as economic sanctions, boycotts  of our exports, preventing economic investments in Sudan, and --  of course -- sending arms and money to the armed rebels in  southern and northern Sudan.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] You are emphatically specific in  attributing the uprisings in southern and northern Sudan to  forces outside your borders. Do you have any proof of this?    [Al-Mahdi] Yes, based on the type and brand of the arms that  we have taken from the rebels and the prolongation of their  resistance, we are confident that they are receiving support  from abroad.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Which government do you suspect?    [Al-Mahdi] I am not accusing a specific government. But the  crisis in southern Sudan has definitely been created by British  colonialism. Britain started to invest greatly on creating  ethnic and religious differences in Sudan a long time ago, and  we consider British colonialism to have been very involved in  the commencement of the crisis in our country. This is  historical fact. As for northern Sudan, it is not in the  interest of any country to support the incidents and the  uprisings there. We believe that such tensions in southern and  northern Sudan stem from a specific policy that the United  States and Israel are pursuing today.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, you strongly condemn  governments that are far from your borders for the ethnic crisis  and the domestic rebellions in your country, as if there were no  other country along your borders that had a hand in sparking the  fire in Sudan.    [Al-Mahdi] Look, we are living in a world that is being  managed on the basis of a new order--a system that has its  regional mentors, elements, and supporters. I only want to say  that there are also many governments and nations that are  resisting this order. They are not sitting idle and are  defending the rights of the oppressed.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, the Westerners have  accused you of opposing the military presence of the U.S. and UN  forces in Somalia or, in other words, of supporting the people  and the rebel groups in that country. Is this accusation  correct?    [Al-Mahdi] They have to prove their accusation. They want  to cover up their defeat in Somalia by resorting to such  accusations. Naturally, we consider the people in Somalia to be  right, and we also know that the foreign forces have not gone to  Somalia to help the Somalians and that their mission has never  been humanitarian as was publicized. Naturally, some  governments have extended support for the popular resistance in  that country. But this does not mean that a specific country  can be so easily accused.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] I thank you for Your Excellency's  remarks  and would like to hear your comments on the relations between  your government and the Islamic Republic of Iran.    [Al-Mahdi] The most important aspect in the relations  between  Iran and Sudan that has enraged the two countries' common  enemies is the Islamic nature of both countries. In other  words, Islam has become a common element that has paved the way  for a healthy and fraternal relationship between the two  countries. This is a phenomenon that is very rare in the world.  We have been able to transform our friendship and our positive  relations from words into deeds. Our political stances are the  same and both of our countries have a common view at  international forums. We in our country have greatly benefited  from the technology and the economic and technical strength of  the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are observing Iran's  constructive activities in our country; and this is something  that we value.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, if you have something to  add, please do so.    [Al-Mahdi] I only want to make one point and that is that we  are an independent country, nation, and government. Today we  are actually paying for our independence. The West's pressures,  plots, and attacks against us are happening because today we  want to stand on our own two feet and become economically  self-sufficient, contrary to the past. The West's fear is that  we want to implement Islamic shariah in our country and to rid  ourselves of the pro-Western culture that is a legacy of  colonialism. If we are now able to stand on our feet despite  all the foreign pressures to weaken us, it is because we enjoy  the people's support.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Accountants face stricter ethics code ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS will not be allowed to accept any insolvency work from a debtor for whom they have previously worked, under draft ethical rules issued by their professional bodies yesterday. They will also be banned from being appointed as independent trustees to the pension scheme of any company of which they are liquidator, administrator or any other receiver. The guidelines were issued by the Chartered Accountants' Joint Ethics Committee - representing accountancy bodies throughout the British Isles - and the ethics committee of the Society of the Practitioners of Insolvency. The guidelines outlaw any insolvency appointment where there has been a 'material professional relationship' with the debtor. That tightens existing regulations, which forbid appointment where there has been a 'continuing professional relationship'. The material relationship includes work - which may not be continuing - by the firm as auditor, adviser to any director or other assignments which might make the insolvency appointment prejudiced or seen to be prejudiced. The guidelines say any insolvency practitioner should decline an appointment by a debenture holder if he or she has a close business or personal connection with the holder.

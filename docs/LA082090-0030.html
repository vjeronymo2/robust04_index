			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TANKER, BARGE COLLIDE; FUEL SPILLS INTO BAY  </P> <P> A Panamanian tanker and a barge carrying more than 7 million gallons of  gasoline and heating oil collided early Sunday, spilling 152,000 gallons of  gasoline into Delaware Bay, authorities said.  </P> <P> The spill left a light sheen of gasoline over a 2 1/2-mile by 200-yard area  four miles from the mouth of the bay off Lewes.  </P> <P> The Coast Guard said it expected the gasoline to dissipate by Sunday night.  </P> <P> Cmdr. Donald Gilbert of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in Philadelphia  said Sunday's high temperatures and rain later in the day were helping to break  the sheen apart.  </P> <P> The spill was not expected to threaten the Delaware or New Jersey shorelines or  the two states' popular ocean resort areas.  </P> <P> The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said that a fish kill  was likely, although none had been reported more than 15 hours after the spill.  </P></p>

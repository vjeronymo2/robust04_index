Central Bank of China officials said that it's necessary for  Taiwan to ink such agreements with contracting parties of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, to pave the way  for Taiwan's admission into the world body.    They said that the proposed ROC [Republic of China]-U.S.  agreement will follow rules set by the International Monetary  Fund, which requires members to avoid payment restrictions on  current account trade and discriminative currency practices, to  provide exchange information, to allow the exchange of national  currency held in foreign countries, and to hold consultations  with other contracting parties on existing international pacts.    Peng Fai-nan, general manager of the Central Bank's foreign  exchange department, will sign the agreement with the United  States on behalf of Taiwan.    Central bank officials said that Peng and U.S. negotiators  will not discuss the U.S. request that Taiwan further ease  restrictions on the flow of foreign capital, although they said  future negotiations on the issue are possible.</p>

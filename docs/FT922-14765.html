			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): Labour, who wins and who loses? - Scheherazade Daneshkhu and John Authers meet two ends of the financial scale SYLVIA and Len Biles live on Pounds 121.18 per week. That comes from Len's state pension, plus an immobility allowance. Both are retired, although neither of them has yet reached the state retirement age - Len is 64, and Sylvia 56. Neither of them works because neither is able to. Len has been disabled for eight years since an operation on his leg went seriously wrong. He finds it difficult to get about, and the heating in the couple's council house needs to be kept high to allow his leg to stay stiffened. Sylvia has a congenital hip disorder, which made it impossible for her to carry on her job as a chef nearly 20 years ago. However, she does not qualify for disability allowances or pensions, because she is not receiving continuous treatment for her condition. To her fury, she even recently received a request to pay for National Insurance contributions, to boost her pension when she receives it. She needs it now. Labour's pledge to put Pounds 8 on a married couple's pension over and above inflation might therefore be seen as good news for the couple - it would increase their weekly income by 6.5 per cent. But they are unenthusiastic. Mrs Biles is a pillar of the local community and runs two social clubs for old age pensioners. Most of their members, like Mrs Biles, still distrust Labour after their experience in 1974-79. The first point she makes is that Labour cut the Christmas bonus for pensioners in the winter of 1975 to 1976. And the Conservatives are committed to raising pensions in the autumn. Also, pensioners are acutely conscious of inflation. Prices generally make their rises for the year in April, according to Mrs Biles, and she has noticed them. 'You go back to the shop from one day to the next, and the price of a carton of milk has gone up from 47p to 57p. Where can you find money for that?' That price rise happened under the Tories. But unfortunately for Labour, the couple believes that further inflationary rises like this would rub out the advantages they gain from the pension increase. Certainly, inflation on the scale of seen in the last Wilson government would cut their standard of living. However, most City analysts are confident that the discipline of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism would avoid a return to 25 per cent inflation. The couple cannot be said to have benefited much from the new Thatcherite prosperity - they did not have enough money to buy the council house in which they have lived for 30 years, so the 'right to buy' did not help. But one incident impressed them. Heating has been one of their greatest problems, due to Len's medical condition. During one bitterly cold snap their electricity bill for the quarter was Pounds 200. The Tories provided some relief. Mr Biles says: 'They were the first government to give us Pounds 2 a week when it was cold.' The junior minister responsible for granting the pay-out was John Major. As a man from Brixton, not far from the Biles' home in Waddon, near Croydon, they are inclined to trust him, even though the economists suggest they would be better off under Labour.</p>

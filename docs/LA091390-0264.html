			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: BETTE MIDLER STANDS IN FOR LIZ TAYLOR AT AIDS AWARDS  </P> <P> ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S painful bout with dental surgery put her out of commission  and prevented the star from appearing at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles  last Friday. She had been expected to present Madonna with the AIDS Project  Commitment to Life Award. (Bette Midler did the honors, riotously).  </P> <P> Before this latest health woe, Miz Liz was continuing cheerfully as Malibu's  grandest hostess in these waning days of summer.  </P> <P> Recently, Elizabeth threw a few more ribs on the barbecue for such good friends  as Nancy Reagan, Barbara and Marvin Davis and -- despite continuing rumors that  their marriage is shaky -- Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager. At this "do"  they were very much together and affectionate. Along with the ribs, Elizabeth  presented cold turkey and elaborate salads.  </P> <P> And speaking of Elizabeth -- Delta Burke is, to this month's Ladies Home  Journal. Delta, who looked terrific and trimmed down on the Miss America  pageant, where she served as a judge, tells LHJ that during the peak of the  tabloid attacks on her, Elizabeth sent a handwritten note. Taylor encouraged  Delta to be brave and not let the rumors depress her. Burke reveals that "Oprah  Winfrey also sent me a note, but this one (from E.T.) is like a letter from  God." And the "Designing Women" femme fatale concludes by saying she knows  she's going to triumph over all her troubles, because "I have to. Do you think  I want to let Elizabeth Taylor down?"  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE still talking about Madonna's campy, raunchy, period dress version  of "Vogue" on the MTV Awards.  </P> <P> It might interest you to know that the elaborate gown in which Madonna did her  stuff was once worn by another beautiful blond star -- Michelle Pfeiffer in  "Dangerous Liaisons." In that movie, Michelle played a modest, weepy, virtuous  young woman led to ruin by an incorrigible roue.  </P> <P> Madonna gave that gown a new life!  </P></p>

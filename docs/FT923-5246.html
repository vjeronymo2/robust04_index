			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (20): Evolution favours mammoths of the air - Towards the 800-seat airliner / Michael Donne, on this page, weighs prospects for stretched variants of Concorde and the Jumbo WITH passenger volumes slowly recovering, airlines are wondering how to cope with a doubling of present traffic levels by early in the next century. The most obvious answer is to use bigger aircraft. Already, a new generation of medium-to-long range jet airliners seating upwards of about 350 passengers a time is on the way. But even as they plan to bring these new large aircraft into their fleets around the mid-1990s, the airlines' thoughts are leaping further ahead to the concept of 600-plus seaters for service by the end of this decade. While initially these notions are focused on long-range aircraft, particularly for trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic operations, there are many in the airline industry who believe that short-to-medium haul versions, capable of coping with large passenger loads on routes of even a few hundred miles, may well become necessary to ease the congestion problems in US, Western European and Japanese air-space. As a result, much discussion and analysis is in progress between the airlines and the three major manufacturers, Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, on what is being called the Ultra-High Capacity Aircraft, or UHCA. The manufacturers want to know just what the airlines are looking for in terms of range and payload capabilities, while the airlines want to know whether the manufacturers can provide what they want at economic cost in a realistic time-scale - such as around the turn of the century. Nothing has been settled. The airlines' requirements vary between 500 and 800 seats, with some of the most ambitious ideas stemming from airlines in the US and especially the Far East and South-east Asia, where traffic growth has remained strong even during the recession. The manufacturers in turn have two main options. They can either develop such monster aircraft by enlarging their existing latest models, such as the Airbus A-330/A-340 and Boeing 747-400 and 777, or they can develop entirely new aircraft. The economics of both options are finely tuned. Theoretically, derivative models would be cheaper to develop. It would be possible to lengthen the fuselages of the existing large A-330/A-340 and 777 aircraft types, for example, or in the case of the 747-400 extend the existing upper deck all the way to the tail, so as to increase the payload. But that might not necessarily be the best solution, since entirely new aircraft would be able to take more advantage of the steady improvements in technology, for example in new composite materials and in power-plant technology, which would not only make them environmentally more acceptable at airports, but also perhaps reduce their operating costs. Every airline has different ideas as to what it wants. The manufacturers' problem is matching these to produce compromise designs that can generate sufficient orders to be successful. This is vital, for the development costs involved in such monster aircraft will amount to several billion dollars for each manufacturer - one estimate has suggested that if all three major airframe builders produced designs, total airframe development costs alone could reach as much as Dollars 20bn. The basic engines for such large aircraft already exist or are under development. Some time ago, the big three engine builders foresaw the need for bigger aircraft, and launched a new generation of very-high thrust engines, starting at around 65,000 lbs thrust and capable of expansion through derivatives to as much as 100,000 lbs thrust or more - the Rolls-Royce Trent, the General Electric (US) GE-90 and the Pratt &amp; Whitney (United Technologies) PW-4000. Even so, further developments of these will still need cash, perhaps another Dollars 5bn or so might, depending upon the thrust-ratings required. Such sums mean that no single airframe or engine manufacturer could undertake such a venture alone. Each will have to seek risk-sharing partnerships from other manufacturers throughout the world. This is not new  -many current commercial airliner projects involve extensive international sub-contracting and risk-sharing partnerships, but because of the great size and cost of any UHCA, the global involvement would have to be much greater. It seems likely, therefore, that virtually every aerospace manufacturer in the world, even some of the smallest, would have some share in the production, if not in the development, of the various UHCAs that may emerge. The sums involved also indicate that the total purchase price of, say, a 600-seater to an airline will probably amount to somewhere around Dollars 200m against today's flyaway cost of a new, complete Boeing 747-400 of around Dollars 140m. At such prices, airlines will want to get the maximum utilisation from such aircraft, which presupposes that they will be used most widely on routes with heavy traffic densities, such as trans-Pacific, trans-Atlantic and on long-haul routes between Western Europe and South-East Asia, the Far East and Australasia. The airlines showing most interest so far - including All-Nippon, American, British Airways, Air France, Japan Air Lines, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and United - all have such long-distance routes in various parts of the world. But specially designed short-haul variants could be developed for some of shortest but busiest air routes - London to Paris and other near-Continental cities, Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo in South America, and Tokyo-Osaka in Japan, for example. Already in Japan, extensive use is made of a short-haul version of the Boeing 747 that can carry more than 500 passengers. Such variants might need larger, heavy-duty undercarriages because of their more frequent take-offs and landings, and probably more doors for faster loading and unloading so as to reduce turn-round times at airports and enable an increase in flight frequencies every day. This in turn means that much attention must be paid to airport compatibility. Any new breed of 600-plus seaters will have to fit existing gates and apron stand areas, although waiting areas for passengers within terminals will have to be larger. But as traffic volumes recover from the recession anyway they will create problems for airport operators, especially through the need to improve passenger flow-rates through terminal buildings. What can the passengers expect from these leviathans of the air? Forget notions of in-flight gymnasia, super-comfort smoking-rooms and creches for children. There will be more doors, lavatories and galleys, of course, but the emphasis will be on more seats. It is impossible to say precisely when such giant aircraft will come into service. Most airlines and the manufacturers believe it will be around the year 2000, after allowing for a four-year production period in turn following some two years or so of detailed development. This means that designs will need to be settled and projects formally launched by around 1994, even though by then the airlines will barely be out of their recession and probably not even back into profit. The next two years, therefore, will be critical in this situation. As Mr. John B. Hayhurst, Boeing's vice-president in charge of Future Large Airplane development, has said: 'Anything is possible. It all depends on what the market demands. Our key challenge up front is to identify precisely what is needed. There is a big market out there, and we want to have the right solution.'</p>

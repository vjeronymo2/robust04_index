			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Observer: Sniffed at A decade ago Haruki Kadokawa predicted that by 1994 he would have become one of the world's most influential media tycoons. But this vaulting ambition has been somewhat truncated by his sojourn over the past few days in police custody answering questions about alleged cocaine use and importation. A maker of big-budget period dramas, including Heaven and Earth, a 1989 film in which 3,000 Canadian extras enacted a battle scene between warring Japanese feudal clans, Kadokawa has been forced to watch the spectacle of his own empire crumbling. Although Kadokawa denies the prosecutors' allegation that he had asked staff to bring in cocaine from the US, his publishing house, Kadokawa Shoten Publishing, is not waiting for the outcome and has moved to dismiss him as president. It is already worried by the extra diligence being shown by the education ministry over student textbooks which it publishes and is fearful of the potential impact on two of its most successful titles: Tokyo Walker, an entertainment magazine, and The Television, a programme guide with a circulation of 900,000. Also affected is Rex, a cute cinematic dinosaur (director, Haruki Kadokawa) and one of the bigger hits of the Japanese summer season. His career, unlike those of the stars of Jurassic Park, is being cut short by an apprehensive Japanese film distributor.</p>

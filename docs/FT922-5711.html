			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Letter: Views of balance of payments trend in UK too relaxed Sir, The relaxed attitude displayed by most to the deteriorating trend in the UK's current account deficit is very worrying. Lex (May 27) was certainly helpful, therefore, in that it drew attention to the damage that even a weak recovery is already doing. To suggest, however, that this 'does not matter in the short term because foreign money is flowing abundantly into post-election Britain' is little more than a statement of historical fact, and to suggest in the next sentence that the estimate for invisible earnings may have to rise is perverse in the extreme - foreign inflows will, of course, increase the outflow of interest and dividends. Current account deficits are by definition balanced by capital inflow - all that is in question is the price demanded through higher interest rates or currency depreciation. In this sense the UK still has plenty of 'independent' control over monetary policy - interest rates can still be put up after all. Whether, when the time comes, the UK authorities will have the nerve to do this before the market demands it of them remains a moot point.

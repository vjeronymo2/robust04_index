			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rebeca Sanchez from the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] In the past 17 months, 2,040 metropolitan policemen  have been dismissed on charges of insolence, abuse of authority,  physical aggression, intimidation, blackmail, and for soliciting  bribes, reported General Rene Monterrubio, roads and safety  secretary, when he appeared before the Federal District's  Assembly of Representatives.    [Begin Monterrubio recording] As a result of procedures for  police justice during the past 17 months, police authorities  approved 2,040 discharge or dismissal resolutions; 212  admonishment resolutions; 212 [word indistinct] charges; 1,209  arrests; and 105 admonishments [as heard]. [end recording]    Commenting on his organization's achievements, Monterrubio  cited this past April's creation of the Honor and Justice  Council to fight impunity and improve discipline of the police  corps. He said there have been 18,312 preventable crimes in the  Federal District so far this year.    He said his work as head of the Metropolitan Police is aimed  at changing its image, performing a professional job, and  consolidating an administrative structure capable of offering a  better service to the community.    [Begin Monterrubio recording] The police must represent a  guarantee for the people's security and peace, not be the cause  of insecurity and unrest. [end recording]</p>

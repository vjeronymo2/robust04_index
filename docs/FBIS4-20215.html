			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The attacks of fundamentalist Muslims  in Algeria and Egypt have given rise to concern in Bonn. For  safety reasons the German Embassy in Algeria has already sent  half of its staff home or to safe neighboring countries, Helmut  Schaefer (Free Democratic Party of Germany), minister of state  in the Foreign Minister, announced on Wednesday [27 April].  Presenting a profound analysis of German policy toward Northern  Africa at the German-Tunisian Society, Schaefer stressed that  Tunisia and Morocco are the only reliable anchors of stability  in this region.    In Algeria one must fear a rise in violence because of the  extremists in the Mouvement Islamique Armee as well as in the  Groupement Islamique Armee. Since the beginning of 1992 the  fight has already claimed 3,500 lives, including those of 35  foreigners. So far, the government has not managed to establish  a dialogue among the parties, Schaefer said.    The domestic policy situation in Egypt has "become more  difficult," Schaefer admitted. While Egypt's active political  role in the Middle East peace process is welcomed, the internal  conflict of the government with the radical Islamic  fundamentalists is growing. Schaefer stressed that, with its  current annual development aid of 225 million German marks,  Germany occupies second place among all donor countries behind  the United States. Necessary restructuring must be tackled  carefully so as not to provide the Islamic fundamentalists with  new nurturing soil because of mass layoffs.    Furthermore, Schaefer pointed out that Libya occupies third  place among Germany's suppliers of crude oil. Bonn is still  urging Libya's cooperation with the United Nations in clarifying  the Lockerbie attack.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BELLFLOWER PLANNER NAMED;  </P> <P> CERRITOS COLLEGE BOARD FILLS VACANCY  </P> <P> Joseph Stits, a high school principal and Bellflower planning commissioner, was  chosen over eight candidates last week to fill the Cerritos Community College  term of outgoing Trustee Robert D. Epple.  </P> <P> Stits, 51 and principal of Somerset Continuation High School, won appointment  on a 5-1 trustee vote. Trustee Ruth Banda, also of Bellflower, cast the  dissenting ballot. Stits will serve at least until next November, when his seat  and three others go up for election.  </P> <P> Epple resigned last fall upon his election to the Legislature.  </P> <P> "I have something to offer in regards that my background has been so varied,"  Stits said of his appointment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Professional Educator  </P> <P> Because he is a professional educator whose wife, Darla, works part-time as a  graphics designer for the college, Stits said he had worried that the trustees  might see him as having "a couple of liabilities."  </P> <P> Stits has worked in the Bellflower Unified School District for the past 25  years as a teacher, counselor and administrator, and has more than 20 years of  professional and community service in the area.  </P> <P> He is the past president of both the Bellflower Leadership and Support Team and  the Los Angeles County Continuation Education Assn. He has a bachelor's degree  in social science from Cal State Long Beach and a master's degree in psychology  and counseling from La Verne University.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor Pleased  </P> <P> Hawaiian Gardens' Mayor Kathleen Navejas, a frequent opponent of the at-large  selection and appointment process for trustees, said she was pleased with  Stits' selection.  </P> <P> "It sounds like they (the trustees) made a good choice," she said.  </P> <P> Stits may be asked to resign his Planning Commission post if Bellflower  officials determine that it poses a conflict of interest with his  responsibilities as a college trustee.  </P> <P> Stits said he is unsure whether he will seek election to the board in November.  </P> <P> "I just want to learn to be a good board member," he said. "It takes a while to  learn the ropes."  </P> <P> Ten candidates had applied for the appointed position, but one withdrew before  last week's trustee vote.  </P></p>

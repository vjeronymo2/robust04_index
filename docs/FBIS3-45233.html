At this meeting provincial party Secretary  Yan Haiwang stressed: It is necessary to properly handle  relations between reform, development, and stability to ensure  overall fulfillment of this year's reform and construction  tasks. At the meeting Yan Haiwang expressed his views on  implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee and the Eighth Provincial CPC Congress, on  deepening reform and expediting development, and on making a  success of this year's economic work.    The first is clearly understanding the situation and  changing  ideas to cope with development of the socialist market economy.  The second is giving prominence to key points, resolving  difficulties, and maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the economy. The third is making overall  progress, breaking through focal points, and speeding up  establishment of the socialist market economic structure. The  fourth is having a thorough idea of the situation, strengthening  leadership, and ensuring the smooth carrying out of reform and  construction.    Yan Haiwang said: This year the state will make a major move  in financial, taxation, monetary, planning, investment, and  foreign trade reforms. We should unswervingly implement the  reform measures promulgated by the state. Facing new tasks and  a new situation in reform and construction, we should have new  ideas for development, create new structures, and change our  concepts. At present, we should break the old, traditional  concept of a planned economy and cultivate a new concept of a  market economy. We should free ourselves from the binds of  planned economic operation and management methods, establish a  new concept in which economic and legal means as well as the  necessary administrative methods are applied to economic  management, correctly handle relations between markets and  plans, cultivate a mentality which dialectically integrates  microeconomic invigoration and macroeconomic control and  regulation, overcome the idea of inertia, and foster the idea of  being bold in taking risks.    Yan Haiwang pointed out: In this year's economic work, there  is a need to strengthen the position of agriculture as the  foundation, to bring about overall development in the rural  economy, to switch our economic work to improving economic  results, to increase the impetus of economic structural  adjustment, to adjust the orientation of capital injection, to  ensure the carrying out of key construction projects, and to  improve investment results.    Yan Haiwang stressed: In this year's reform, our province  should make breakthroughs in these three aspects: The first is  making a breakthrough in the ownership structural adjustment;  the second is actively and steadily establishing a new  enterprise system; and the third is conscientiously implementing  all macrocontrol and regulatory policies to promote our  province's reform to a new period and scale a new height in  economic construction.    The meeting was presided over by Acting Governor Zhang Wule.  [passage omitted]</p>

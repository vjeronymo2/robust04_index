			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ryan Hotels seeks Pounds 4.4m to help fund German buy RYAN HOTELS yesterday announced a 4-for-17 rights issue to help fund the acquisition of the Carat Hotel, Hamburg, which it has agreed to buy for DM16.25m (Pounds 5.5m) cash. The Dublin-based group aims to raise about IPounds 4.84m (Pounds 4.36m) net of expenses through the issue of 13.9m new ordinary shares at 40p each, compared with a closing price of 42p sterling yesterday. It also announced a rise in pre-tax profits from IPounds 2.75m to IPounds 2.82m for the year to October 31, but warned that it expected a loss in the current half as tourist activity failed to recover after the Gulf war. Turnover fell to IPounds 19.24m (IPounds 21.17m). Interest charges rose to IPounds 863,000 (IPounds 775,000). Earnings per share fell to IPounds 4.48p (IPounds 4.57p). The final dividend is maintained at 1.25p, making an unchanged total of 1.75p. Borrowings will make up the balance of the purchase price. These represent 30 per cent of shareholders' funds. The acquisition follows the group's strategy of buying hotels with year-round corporate business. It brings the number of its hotels on the Continent to three, and the profit contribution to 35 per cent. In March the company sold 65 per cent of the equity of Blooms Restaurant, which owns, among others, Blooms Hotel in Dublin, to former executives for IPounds 4.25m. The consideration represents the net asset value of the hotels, which contributed a trading profit of IPounds 447,000 to last year's results. Ryan still holds 1.63m redeemable cumulative preference shares and has an option to sell the remaining stake for at least IPounds 1.75m.</p>

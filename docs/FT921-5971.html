			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Hawks and Handsaws: The sands of time I AM thinking small at present. Large matters like elections or what best to do about mad bankers (shoot or drown them, I imagine) are way beyond my grasp. The reason I am thinking small is that I have just read an essay called The Ideal Particle and the Great Unconformity by Reg Saner which appears in a book called The Best American Essays 1991, edited by Joyce Carol Oates. I bought it last week in Beverly Hills. It cost Dollars 9.95. If you can name a better way to spend Dollars 9.95 in America at present, you are welcome to write to me. Perhaps I will reply. But then, perhaps, I won't, because I doubt I could be wrong. The writers shepherded together by Ms Oates in her purple-coloured volume include Woody Allen, Margaret Atwood, John Updike, Elizabeth Hardwick and Stephen Jay Gould. But it is Reg Saner, a poet who teaches at the University of Colorado, who takes the laurel wreath with his account of a descent of the Grand Canyon. As he goes along, he muses on various themes, some of them very large: the age of the Earth and man's place in the universe; religious fundamentalism and the Copernican revolution; how knowledge of geological time changes the mind forever. As Saner says, people come from far and wide to gaze into the Grand Canyon - and tremble, for the canyon reflects back at us an image of ourselves as creatures in transit: body hair once pelt; toenails once claws; vertebral column adapted from our days as quadrupeds; hands that used to be forepaws; brain on its way to being, perhaps, something better than a reservoir of reptilian and mammalian cunning. So why am I thinking small this week? The answer lies in the ideal particle of Saner's essay's title. Suppose you wanted to envisage a blaze-blue morning 200m years ago, and then a blaze-blue morning 200m summers up ahead. How would you bring them together? Saner does it by writing about the grains of quartz that make up much of the sand in the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in southern Colorado and elsewhere. Such a grain is nearly indestructible. At some point, loose quartz grains get cemented to fellow grains as sandstone. Provided the sandstone sinks no deeper than six miles beneath the Earth's surface, it will, most probably, rise again, and the grain will be rubbed free until recemented as one of the countless trillions making up yet another sandstone. In turn, the new layer will be overlaid by sedimentation and sink from view. But then it will rise again, and the grains be granulated again, and set on further travels, before the process starts once more. 'An individual quartz grain,' writes Saner, 'can be blown away, buried, resurrected, and re-eroded good as new through unimaginable chunks of time. The Harvard geologist Raymond Siever offers his 'rough guess' of about 200m years per cycle. And how many cycles might an actual sand grain undergo? Siever thinks a Devonian sand grain, for example, laid down maybe 380m years back, could conceivably have circled through burial and resurrection ten times since first being nicked off its parent granite some 2.4bn years ago.' 2.4bn? That is 5,000 times longer than the 500,000 years since man was transformed from Homo erectus into Homo sapiens. As you can imagine, Saner has no time whatsoever for Creationists, or 'natural theology', or 'scriptural geology' - any more than he could have time for Baptist meteorology or Mormon physics. 'Every grain at the Dunes (National Monument)', he says, 'is incomparably more ancient than the name of any god, known or forgotten. The last grain among them will be circulating here undiminished long after the last god is gone.' Since returning from Beverly Hills, I have been unable to sleep. I find concentration difficult. My appetite comes and goes. In traffic, I give very iffy hand-signals. Perhaps it is only jet-lag. But I cannot banish from my mind an image of those quartz grains tumbling and resurfacing, being shifted, sifted, sorted, then tumbling and resurfacing again through millions of years. When I pick up a newspaper, I read of monstrous events in train. John Major says this. Neil Kinnock claims the opposite. George Bush is in trouble, which is where he deserves to be. ICI is not happy. Very few people are. Russia is freeing prices, even that of vodka. The planet is dying of drought. Elizabeth Taylor is 60. Fraud. Murder. Bombs. Virginia Bottomley rampant. What to do with Lord King? And there is still an Archbishop of Canterbury. Monstrous happenings, to be sure. But all I can see is sand. I imagine I'll snap out of it.

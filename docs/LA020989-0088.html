			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULLET AND GILL NETS BLAMED IN DEATHS OF THREE SEA LIONS  </P> <P> Nearly three weeks after the carcasses of 49 California sea lions mysteriously  began washing ashore on Orange County beaches, federal biologists Wednesday  have determined that at least one sea lion had been shot and two died in gill  nets used by halibut fishermen.  </P> <P> In a necropsy completed Wednesday on the body of a young 350-pound male sea  lion, biologists retrieved a .30-caliber bullet that penetrated the animal's  abdomen and killed him. It was the first piece of solid evidence that one of  the animals had been illegally shot, said Jim Lecky, chief of the National  Marine Fisheries protected species branch.  </P> <P> And, in two other sea lion deaths, biologists reported that they found a net  peculiar to halibut fishing wrapped around one carcass, while the neck and  shoulder of another sea lion bore the markings of a halibut net, Lecky said.  </P> <P> From that evidence and their knowledge of coastal fisheries, federal officials  now believe that most of the Orange County sea lions died after encounters with  fishermen -- either as they became entangled in gill nets and drowned, or were  shot by squid fishermen protecting their catch from a marauding sea lion.  </P> <P> "We are pretty much calling a conclusion to this investigation because we are  pretty sure what's going on," Lecky said.  </P> <P> Lecky said at this point there are no witnesses, so no criminal charges are  planned. He added that since the sea lion is not an endangered species and the  deaths are a small percentage of the population, no special surveillances are  scheduled.  </P> <P> But fishermen from San Clemente to San Pedro denied they were to blame for most  of the deaths.  </P> <P> "No gill-netter is blatantly going away and killing sea lions," said gill net  fisherman John (The Turk) Emirzian, 50. "Probably several things are killing  them."  </P> <P> Don Hansen, a director of the California Sportsfishing Assn, some of whose  members hunt squid, said: "Most operators just don't do that anymore (shoot sea  lions to keep them away from their catch). Trouble is the public is quick to  point fingers."  </P> <P> Federal and private biologists said Wednesday that they had ruled out disease  as a primary cause for the deaths because all but two of the sea lions were  dead when they hit the shore. If they were diseased or malnourished, sea lions  usually struggle to the shore alive, the biologists say.  </P></p>

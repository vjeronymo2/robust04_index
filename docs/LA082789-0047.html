			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICTURE OF A NATION  </P> <P> In her article, "The Temptation of Political Theatre," Sylvie Drake discusses  at length Vaclav Havel's "Temptation," currently playing at the Mark Taper  Forum.  </P> <P> For whatever it is worth, at a recent performance a Czech journalist sought me  out to say how accurate a picture the play drew of Czechoslovakia and how  strongly he connected to it. Ms. Drake comments that "Temptation" "never gets  specific." For us the play is very specific: a visceral portrait of life in  Czechoslovakia right now.  </P> <P> One also must take issue with Dan Sullivan's take on Mark Harelik as the "wrong  actor" to play Foustka. As Harelik is creating a role not bound by definitive  realizations of either the part or the play, it seems presumptuous to define  the "type" of actor appropriate to it.  </P> <P> The Taper has brought "Temptation" to Los Angeles because we feel that it is an  important play for our time written by an important writer who continues to  create art heroically out of the specific experience of life in Czechoslovakia  and who cannot benefit from the normal collaborative process by which plays are  brought to life. If the play leaves some audiences and critics unsatisfied and  unresolved, that is a true and honest representation of the state of affairs  under which this brave man and his countrymen now live.  </P> <P> GORDON DAVIDSON  </P> <P> Artistic Director/Producer  </P> <P> Mark Taper Forum  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

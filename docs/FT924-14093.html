			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Gloom worsens in financial services sector A PICTURE of deepening gloom and pessimism in Britain's financial services companies emerges from the quarterly survey of business confidence in the sector published by the Confederation of British Industry and Coopers &amp; Lybrand today. The report says that financial services companies are delaying new investments because they are worried about their business prospects and believe they risk making a net loss on any developments they plan. In contrast to the second quarter of the year, when companies were increasingly confident about their business prospects, many of the 300 companies surveyed - ranging from banks and building societies to stockbrokers and venture capitalists - saw their business volumes dwindle between July and September. The fall in volumes affected both wholesale and personal business and was followed by a sharp drop in confidence, particularly among building societies, securities traders and fund managers. The only improvement came from business with overseas customers. There was some good news, however, for the financial services sector. Income from fees and commissions rose strongly and lenders widened their average spreads, but banks said their margins and fee income had improved more slowly than expected. Almost all financial services companies are cutting costs sharply for the fourth quarter in succession. Banks, finance houses, and securities traders lead the way, although insurance brokers say that their total costs have strongly increased. While the squeeze on costs has led to a continuing fall in the numbers employed in the sector, the drop was not as sharp in the third quarter of the year as it was in the second. Staff costs make up a much smaller proportion of total company costs than they did a year ago. Financial services companies expect the cost-cutting to continue for the rest of the year, but the resulting profitability gains are partly offset by their non-performing loans. In order to help themselves through the recession, financial services companies are holding back on spending capital on developing their businesses. The survey reports significant cuts in planned spending on land and buildings, as well as on vehicles, plant, and machinery over the next 12 months. There are also signs that companies will spend less on developing computer systems and on information technology generally next spring. The only chink of light in the generally gloomy scene seems to be that most companies expect profits to rise slightly in the last three months of the year, as fewer bad debts and lower costs take their effect.

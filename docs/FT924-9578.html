			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Sparkle on Fair and Reasonable diamonds - The upheaval caused by the Japanese jewellery retailer FR, a Japanese jewellery importer and retailer, is adding to the present woes of De Beers, the South African group, by taking a new approach in Japan's diamond market. This has grown into one of the world's largest, thanks to the demand for luxury goods in the boom of the late 1980s. Not only has FR - which stands for Fair and Reasonable - snatched a contract to import polished diamonds from the recently re-named autonomous republic of Sakha - formerly Yakutia - which produces most of Russia's diamonds, it has also shocked the trade by publishing a monthly diamond price index, something De Beers believes strongly should be avoided. With worldwide demand for diamonds languishing because of recession, the last thing De Beers needs is disarray in the Japanese market, which vies with the US as the world's biggest and accounts for about one-third of total diamond retail sales. FR, a newcomer to the Y1,000bn (Dollars 8.18bn) Japanese retail market, is aggressively expanding at a time when other diamond distributors are cutting stocks. Last July, it set up a diamond shop in Ginza, the classy shopping district of Tokyo. FR was listed on the over-the-counter market in April last year and has grown at a speed unprecedented in Japan. Headed by Mr Yoshihiko Suzuki, the 33-year-old president, sales have risen to Y26bn since it was set up 10 years ago. But FR's share price has plunged 63 per cent from the beginning of last month after rumours of financial difficulties. Mr Suzuki refutes the rumours, and stock market analysts suggest the stories may have been started by FR's competitors. 'The company is up against the world's largest diamond cartel as well as long-standing Japanese retailers,' points out Ms Setsu Yamazaki, retail analyst at brokers James Capel. But Ms Yamazaki adds that FR undoubtedly faces hard times because of the fall in consumer spending. Mr Suzuki says imports of polished diamonds from Sakha will start this month. He says FR has a contract to distribute 10 per cent of the diamonds which will be cut and polished in the republic by a joint venture company established in May between Yakutia and Arda, a Japanese trading company. Diamond cutters are being recruited from Moscow. However, De Beers, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough diamonds, claimed last week that it had been given an undertaking by Sakha that, if a cutting centre was set up, De Beers would take charge, not the Japanese company. Nevertheless, FR has already opened a stone polishing and cutting factory in Yamanashi prefecture, west of Tokyo, and wants to bring over trainees from Sakha. The company expects imports from Sakha, which will total some 6,000 carats during the next two months, gradually to increase to an annual 300,000 carats. Meanwhile, FR has derived a bid and offering price for customers, by adding a 17 per cent margin to the average importers' price. Mr Suzuki says diamond prices at other retailers are two to five times higher than that of FR's. He adds FR is ready to buy customers' diamonds bought from other retailers. 'Before, people only had the option of a pawn shop to cash their diamonds. I want to create a secondary market,' he says. Mr Suzuki's scheme to create a secondary diamond market in Japan has triggered scorn among his competitors. It is virtually impossible anywhere in the world to get even two traders to agree on the price of a polished diamond. Despite the recession, Mr Suzuki puts on a brave face. He says that by offering quality diamonds at affordable prices, FR's sales and profits are expected to grow steadily. 'In the bubble age, you could sell anything, even if it was expensive. Now people want to be satisfied without spending that much,' he says.</p>

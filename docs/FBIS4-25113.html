			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Toshiaki Arai] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 April -- Issei Inoue, deputy chairman of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and other members  of the SDPJ delegation which is visiting China met with Chinese  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on 2 April and exchanged opinions  on the DPRK nuclear issue. Foreign Minister Qian appraised  positively the fact that the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopted  the chairman's mildly worded statement rather than hinting at  the possibility of imposing sanctions on the DPRK in the future.  He said, "It helped to ease tension on the Korean peninsula and  gave (the people concerned some leeway in terms of time to  settle the issue peacefully)."    Foreign Minister Qian also touched on China's influence on  North Korea and pointed out, "Like Japan, China is not a party  [directly] concerned." In this way, he reminded the  delegation's members not to expect too much. As has been said  before, he insisted on a settlement through dialogue between the  four parties: the United States, the DPRK, the ROK, and the  International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

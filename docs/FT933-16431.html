			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Montedison triggers new losses inquiry MONTEDISON, the Italian industrial group controlled by the troubled Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, has brought in a second set of accountants to investigate mysterious losses at a little-known foreign subsidiary. The disclosure of the losses at Financing and Investments, a Curacao subsidiary of Montedison's Swiss-based international holding company, resulted in a last-minute revision of the group's accounts this week to show an additional L435bn (Dollars 281m) consolidated loss on top of the L1,244bn previously reported. Separately, shares in Ferfin, which have plunged since the group shocked shareholders at the end of May with much higher-than-expected losses for 1992, fell a further 6.52 per cent to L381.6 in Milan yesterday. The latest drop takes the cumulative fall in Ferfin's ordinary share price to over 64 per cent since its original 1992 results were announced. Montedison, which this week elected a new board largely comprising appointees acceptable to Ferfin's five main creditor banks, said it had called on the Deloitte &amp; Touche accounting group to examine where and how the losses arose. The accountants have also been requested to examine the complex structure of Montedison International Holding and its subsidiaries and of the foreign subsidiaries of Ferfin. Earlier this week, Montedison said it had called on its main auditors, Price Waterhouse, to look into the unexplained losses, ascribed to 'credits deemed to be irrecoverable'. The appointment of additional auditors suggests the group wants an independent study and may imply the scale of the task is more complex than expected. Magistrates are now looking into two aspects of Ferfin's affairs. While one team in Milan is monitoring the proposed rescue, two separate sets of magistrates in Milan and Rome are investigating possible irregularities in the constitution and eventual dismantling of the Enimont chemicals joint venture between Montedison and the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group. The latter inquiry has triggered rumours that Montedison's newly-discovered losses could be linked to covert payments to Italian politicians in return for Enimont-linked favours, along the lines of kickbacks paid by Eni. Alternatively, some observers believe the losses cover previously concealed errors in commodities or foreign exchange trading, or may have stemmed from covert share support schemes when Ferfin and Montedison were engaged in a stream of takeovers.</p>

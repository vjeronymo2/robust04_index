			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reverses early loses as bonds improve Wall Street Equities tracked bond prices yesterday, reversing morning losses as bonds firmed and ultimately ending unchanged, writes Karen Zagor in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 0.90 at 3,245.75. The index fell sharply at first, then recovered to post modest gains by mid-afternoon, but succumbed late to sporadic selling in the last hour and a half. The more representative Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 1.20 at 412.49, while the Nasdaq composite of secondary stocks slipped 2.82 to 636.28. Turnover on the New York SE was relatively heavy at 216m shares. Market sentiment was negative, with big board declining issues outpacing those advancing by a margin of 915 to 771. Bond prices exerted a strong influence on equities prices for a second day. Stocks followed bonds lower in morning trading, when the benchmark 30-year bond tumbled to 100 1/16. But as bond prices started to recover on short-covering, equities also turned higher. In late trading the long bond was quoted at 101, up 3/16 to yield 7.91 per cent. The bond market's morning performance was dominated by reduced change of another cut in interest rates and the pressure of absorbing Dollars 36bn in new securities issued this week. But the market received some support from a report that the producer price index had fallen 0.3 per cent in January, although the core index rose 0.3 per cent, stripping out food and energy. Auto stocks continued to benefit from expectations that the worst is behind the US auto industry following better than expected early February car sales. Ford, which predicted substantial improvements in 1992 operating results, climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 37 1/8 and General Motors firmed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 38. Chrysler was one of the morning's most active big board issues, adding Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 16 3/8 after Kidder Peabody put the issue back on its 'buy' list for the fist time since 1988. Airline issues also moved higher, in thinner trading yesterday morning. Delta Air Lines rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 68 1/4 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, was up Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 74 and UAL, parent of United Airlines, firmed Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 146. Shares in Living Centers, a nursing home company, were quoted at Dollars 15 3/8 in heavy trading. An initial public offering was priced at Dollars 14 1/2 a share. Salomon, the Wall Street investment bank, slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 30 as news from the company's meeting with investors hit the market. Mr Warren Buffet said he will stay on as interim chairman until the government investigation is completed. Canada TORONTO stocks ended slightly lower, as a slump in the gold sector was offset by a jump in mining shares. Based on preliminary figures, the 300-composite index dropped 7.87 points, or 0.22 per cent, to close at 3,573.89, with declines topping advances 303 to 286. The index was off 22 points, or 0.62 per cent, on the week. Volume today was 23.30m,shares worth CDollars 259.1m, compared with yesterday's 28.92m shares worth CDollars 309.1m. The gold sector fell 1.62 per cent on index, while financial services and consumer products showed smaller losses. Industrial products and energy climbed moderately, while the mining sector jumped 1.45 per cent. Fishery Products International lost 1 to 6 1/4. The company said it will implement temporary 'unscheduled downtime' at its processing plant in Catalina, Newfoundland, and will temporarily withdraw 11 vessels from its fleet. As a result of these moves, 1,005 employees will be out of work. SHL Systemhouse Inc. said it plans to sell 11,159,773 common shares. SHL was down 1/4 to 15 7/8.</p>

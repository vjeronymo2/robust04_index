			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- China has achieved  marked progress in regional social development levels in various  fields, according to the results of a comprehensive assessment  of regional social development levels released today. Beijing,  Shanghai, and Tianjin topped the list in terms of high  comprehensive levels of social development, while Anhui,  Qinghai, and Guizhou were ranked among the top three in terms of  growth rates of comprehensive levels of social development.    According to a State Statistics Bureau briefing,  comprehensive levels of social development are indexes of  regional and overall social development calculated on the basis  of the weighted average of figures for all fields of social  development for the purpose of presenting a comprehensive  picture of social development in a given country or region.  This assessment -- which is based on 1992 statistics and uses  the method of multistage consolidation [duo ji zong he fang fa  1122 4787 4844 0678 2455 3127] -- covers more than 100  statistical indicators in ten fields, including the environment,  population, economics, living standards, and levels of  scientific and technical education that reflect China's overall  levels of social development.    The results of the assessment indicate that China's average  social development level index in 1992 reached 121, an increase  of 10 percent over 1991. Fourteen provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities are above the national average in  terms of comprehensive levels of social development. The  assessment also reveals some new characteristics in China's  social development in 1992: China's social development  basically kept pace with the development of the economy; China's  gross domestic product registered an increase of 13.2 percent in  1992, while the average social development level index rose by  10 percent, basically keeping pace with the former. Large gaps  exist from region to region. Excluding Beijing, Tianjin, and  Shanghai, the average social development level index of the five  highest-ranked regions is 60 percent higher than that of the  five lowest-ranked regions. The level of social development was  higher in eastern and coastal open areas. Thirteen out of the  14 regions -- Shanxi Province is the exception -- which enjoy  index figures greater than the national average are from eastern  or coastal open areas. Regions with relatively low average  social development levels saw faster growth; twelve of the  fifteen regions with index figures below the national average  reached or topped the national growth rate for 1992.    An analysis of the results reveals uneven development from  sector to sector in 1992. Nationally, the index figures of  population, economy, hygiene and health care, social security,  public order, and living standards saw large increases; the  environment and scientific and technical education index figures  registered slight progress; and the labor index figures declined.</p>

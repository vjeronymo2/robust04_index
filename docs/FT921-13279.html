			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / NHS funding reform extended AN EXTENSION to the controversial element of the health service reforms allowing family doctors to buy medical treatment on behalf of their patients was announced yesterday. But both Labour and the Liberal Democrats said they would end the practice, known as fundholding. Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, said: 'The next Labour government will end GP fundholding; we will do it because we will not tolerate two-tier lists on which the length of time you wait depends on your GP's budget.' While Labour portrayed this as standing by its existing position, the Tories interpreted the opposition's announcement that it was looking at ways of giving all GPs a greater say in National Health Service planning as 'a total U-turn'. Under the government's plans, another 5,000 general practitioners will be able to become fundholders, controlling the budget for treating their patients for a range of conditions. Several pilot projects will be launched, designed to improve the operation of fundholding and to extend the benefits to all GPs. The announcement was welcomed as 'a step in the right direction' by the British Medical Association. Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, told the Commons that the first wave of GP fundholding practices had been a 'clear success'. The changes he announced were designed to 'allow advantages of fundholding to be enjoyed by more patients and doctors'. The fundholding provisions have been one of the most contentious parts of the government's health service reforms launched in April 1991. Those reforms removed the right of family doctors to refer patients to the hospital of their choice. That meant most GP practices could refer patients for treatment only to hospitals and organisations with which the district health authority has contracts for services. However, some 1,700 GPs in larger practices were allowed to become fundholders controlling part of the budget for treating patients. Those GPs can effectively refer their cases - about 7 per cent of all NHS patients - to hospitals of their choice. The freedom of referral that fundholding practices enjoy extends to only a limited range of conditions. They include minor and elective surgery, such as corneal grafts, hernia repairs and varicose-vein stripping. Operations costing more than Pounds 5,000 are outside the control of fundholders. Such operations are often the ones with the longest waiting lists, and delays to them cause most unhappiness to NHS users. Critics predicted that a two-tier health service would be created by fundholders, who would use their control of budgets for operations to buy faster treatment for their patients at the expense of the rest. That seemed to happen, as some hospitals began to offer special deals to fundholders' patients - including shorter waiting times. The government moved quickly to change the rules, but the impression persisted that fundholders' patients enjoyed benefits denied to others. That impression was reinforced by the experience of GPs who have become fundholders. The Twickenham, south-west London, practice of Dr Ian Wild and partners, who became fundholders last April, shows how their freedom to refer has been used for the benefit of patients. Although the practice cannot buy shorter waiting times than non-fundholding practices, it still has freedom to shop around on behalf of patients for the best deal for each operation. The practice has also been able to use its budget to arrange for services previously available only through hospitals, to be offered to patients at the local health centre. The picture is reflected in a study carried out for the King's Fund Institute by Professor Howard Glennerster of the London School of Economics. It found that fundholding had shifted the balance of power within the NHS from the consultant to the GP. The conclusion is that fundholding has often improved the quality of health service for patients. Such findings had prompted Labour to tone down its opposition to fundholding. But as the party is pledged to restore GPs' freedom to refer patients to the hospital of their choice, Mr Cook believes GPs will lose interest in the additional bureaucracy of fundholding. The BMA also says many of Britain's family doctors do not want to become fundholders. Labour said yesterday that it was looking at ways of giving all GPs a greater say in NHS planning and in specifying what hospitals should be providing. But that would not be on the basis of giving them control of budgets for treating their patients. Mr Waldegrave also announced that there would be experiments to see whether non-fundholding GPs could be given more control over operations.</p>

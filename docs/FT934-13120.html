			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): The easy route can take you into Europe - Personal Equity Plans / Peps were meant to encourage private investment in UK equities, but the rules have been widened SALES OF unit trust Peps have boomed since collective funds were made fully eligible for personal equity plan investment. They are an easy way for small investors to get exposure to a spread of shares, and their tax advantages have provided an extra incentive, writes Bethan Hutton. Every adult in the UK is allowed to invest Pounds 6,000 in each tax year in a general Pep, and an additional Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep. Income and capital gains from these investments are tax-free. A general Pep can be used to invest in individual company shares, unit trusts or investment trusts, but a single-company Pep cannot be used to invest in a unit or investment trust. When the government first introduced Peps, in 1986, the stated aim was to encourage private individuals to invest in UK equities. That has now been widened to include the rest of the EC, but investments still have to be equity-based. This means that at least 50 per cent of the fund must be invested in equities, which rules out most specialist bond funds. A ruling on this point, earlier this year, has led to a mushrooming of funds which generate as much income as possible by investing up to the maximum permissible 49 per cent in bonds or other fixed-interest securities, in addition to a base of equities. Another limitation is that Peps cannot be used to invest more than Pounds 1,500 in collective funds that have a majority of their assets outside the EC. 'You are restricting yourself in terms of geographic areas,' warns Graeme Farquharson, investment director at Hill Martin. Some of the most popular and best performing unit trusts invest in the US, the Far East or other emerging markets. The easiest route into a unit trust Pep, and the one chosen by the majority of investors, is through one of the schemes offered by the large unit trust management groups, which allow you to invest in one or a selection of their funds. However, if you want to split your investment between trusts from a number of different groups, you could use a self-select Pep, managed by an independent third party, but this can be an expensive option as you also pay the manager's charges. Unit trust Peps are frequently used as savings vehicles for school fees planning, particularly through the monthly savings schemes offered by many unit trust groups. Pep mortgages are also an option that is catching on, as doubts about the universal suitability of endowments spread. Farquharson favours the phased-investment option offered by some unit trust groups: a lump sum is entrusted to the managers, who then drip-feed it into the fund over a period of six to 12 months. This avoids putting the whole lot in at the what might be the top of the market, and so offers some protection from one of the perennial risks of investing in equities. A tax-free label on a financial product always attracts investors, but in fact basic-rate tax payers would hardly notice the difference between a Pep investment and a normal unit trust holding for the first few years. 'I am slightly concerned that Peps are being sold to people for whom the advantage is so small that it is almost not worth it, bearing in mind that you are restricting your choice,' says Farquharson. If the full Pounds 6,000 allowance were invested in a trust yielding 5 per cent, ie Pounds 300 a year, the total tax saving for a basic-rate taxpayer would be just Pounds 60. Higher-rate taxpayers see more worthwhile savings: Pounds 120 in this example, though of course many funds yield considerably less than 5 per cent. If the fund you choose is eligible for a Pep, and does not charge any more for it, then you might as well take the tax-free route. However, if there are additional charges, or you would otherwise have invested in a non-qualifying fund, you need to think carefully about whether the tax savings will outweigh the disadvantages. The real benefits of a Pep only become obvious over the longer term, particularly if the income is reinvested, as growth can roll up tax free. Funds with very low yields  - for example, with a high proportion invested in overseas equities  - will not benefit so much from the tax-free rolling up of income, and so will not perform noticeably better through a Pep. Capital gains tax is not an issue for the majority of small investors - and, in any case, it would take a long time for most unit trusts to build up more than Pounds 5,800 of capital gains from a Pounds 6,000 investment. However, if the full Pep allowance is used every year, and the investments are left untouched for several years, or the Pep is part of a wider investment portfolio, then it can be a useful CGT shelter. The potential flow of investors' money through the Pep route has inspired unit trust groups to develop new products to attract Pep investors. Innovations have focused on reducing the impact of charges, and maximising income at a time of low interest rates on cash deposits. Fidelity was the first unit trust group to introduce a unit trust Pep charging structure that combines lower front-end fees with exit penalties if the money is withdrawn in the first three years. Other companies have now followed this route, which is intended to encourage investors to stick with the unit trust over the long term. Fidelity charges 2 per cent initially for Pep investments, whether lump sums or monthly savings, compared with an initial charge of 5.25 per cent if the investment is not made via a Pep. An exit fee of 3 per cent is levied if the investment is withdrawn in the first year, 2 per cent within two years, and 1 per cent within three years. After three years, there is no exit penalty. If the money is withdrawn by the executors of an estate, no exit fee is charged. Investors also pay the standard annual management charges of 1-1.5 per cent. Other companies offering similar charging structures for Peps on some of their funds include Guinness Flight and Gartmore. Several Pepable unit trusts have been launched this year which aim to provide a high yield for investors looking for an alternative to building societies, as interest rates have dropped. The Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Higher Income personal equity plan aims to offer a 10 per cent yield through a complicated structure, which also uses derivatives to boost income. The Cazenove Utility and Bond fund, also aiming for a high yield, has a very low 0.2 per cent initial charge, and 0.5 annual charge, though Pep investors pay an extra Pounds 35 up front.</p>

South Africa's Ambassador Tjaart van der Walt told SAPA he  had spoken at about 6.30pm to President Mangope, who said he was  going to his country residence at Motsepi. "I have not contacted  him there yet," the Dr van der Walt. [sentence as received]    In another development, the Freedom Alliance said on  Thursday  it was suspending negotiations with the South African Government  and the African National Congress [ANC] to protest against the  ANC's involvement in upheavals in Bophuthatswana. "The leaders  of the Freedom Alliance have therefore decided that all  negotiations, mediation, submission of (election) candidate  lists and efforts by the Freedom Alliance to rejoin the process  will be stopped forthwith until the ANC has stopped the action  in Bophuthatswana," Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National  Front] leader General Constand Viljoen said in a statement.    Waving ANC and SA Communist Party placards, thousands of  people took to the streets of Mmabatho on Thursday, apparently  spurred by a march by about 300 policemen to the SA Embassy to  demand reincorporation of Bophuthatswna into South Africa. Later  in the afternoon there were reports homeland police had gone on  strike.    Homeland soldiers fired teargas at thousands of protesters  who stormed and looted the Megacity shopping complex in  Mmabatho. The soldiers later surrounded the complex to keep the  looters at bay.    Also on Thursday evening protesters set fire to a general  store in Mmabatho belonging to the homeland's police chief,  General PJ Seleke. The store is near the University of  Bophuthatswana where students have clashed with police in the  past few days.    "They opened the gas taps and threw a match into the store  and it just went up," one of the people outside blazing building  told SAPA.</p>

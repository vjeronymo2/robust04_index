			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop report confirms big harvest for US farmers US FARMERS are harvesting a bountiful spring crop despite haphazard summer weather, the US agriculture department reported yesterday. All-wheat production is pegged at 2.34bn bushels for the 1992 season, up 5 per cent from the previous forecast, and 18 per cent higher than 1991. This is mostly due to anticipated record high production of non-durum spring wheat - 654m bushels, 12 per cent over the last projection - and partly to a revised forecast for winter wheat, up 2 per cent to 1.60bn bushels. These high wheat numbers should allay fears about depleting US wheat stocks, which are at their lowest level in years. Maize production is forecast at 8.76bn bushels, slightly below expections but still 17 per cent above last year's crop of 7.474bn. Soyabeans are expected to surge to 2.8bn bushels - up 5 per cent from last year's 1.975bn bushel crop and well ahead of recent forecasts. Less fecund were cotton producers with production expected to reach 16.5m bales, 6 per cent less than last year. Southern cotton belt states had a cold and wet spring which will lower yields by as much as two-thirds, as it did in Texas. This is expected to lower cotton export estimates, but the USDA kept the forecast unchanged at 6.7m bales. Industry analysts welcome the bumper crop, which follows several dry years, but warn that demand remains alarmingly stagnant. Over the past six weeks, corn prices have roughly slipped by 20 per cent, soyabeans by 25 per cent and, since the beginning of the year, wheat prices have dropped by 25 per cent. 'There is still room to go lower,' said Mr Martyn Foreman, an analyst at Illinois' Agreviser. Wheat exports also pose problems for US farmers. In particular, Russian demand has fallen - and the Russians are harvesting a good crop this year - leading the USDA to reduce export estimates from 1.175bn to 1.125bn. However, maize and soyabean exports are expected to rise. The maize forecast for 1992-93 exports is up 50m to 1.60bn bushels. Meanwhile, large European demand for soyabean has led the USDA to revise both the 1991-92 and the 1992-93 projections, from 680m bushels to 690m and 675m to 700m respectively.</p>

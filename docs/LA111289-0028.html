			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITHER MAHLER?  </P> <P> Like columnist Herbert Glass, we too noticed that the Los Angeles Philharmonic  is programming only one Mahler symphony this coming season (On the Record, Nov.  5).  </P> <P> Twenty-four years ago, a number of us Mahler fanatics marched good-naturedly at  the Music Center, demanding more Mahler. Our group was born that night.  </P> <P> Today, while America takes a Mahlerian respite, Europe is playing him wall to  wall and Japan is worshiping at his shrine.  </P> <P> As for Mr. Glass' complaint about Mahler being possibly out of favor, it could  be time for us to dust off the old picket signs and show our displeasure in  front of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> AVIK GILBOA  </P> <P> President, Gustav Mahler  </P> <P> Society, Los Angeles  </P></p>

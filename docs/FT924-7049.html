			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Troubled Westpac sells Channel Ten holding group WESTPAC Banking Corp-oration, the troubled Australian bank, yesterday said it had completed the sale of Television and Telecasters (TTL), the holding company for the Channel Ten television network, to a consortium led by CanWest Global Communications, a Canadian broadcasting group. Westpac did not reveal the price for the sale, which is subject to regulatory approval. However, CanWest said that the consortium expected to pay about ADollars 235m (USDollars 161m), of which about 50 per cent would be financed by a loan from Westpac. CanWest, Canada's largest independent television broadcaster, will take a 15 per cent stake in TTL. Other consortium members have not been named, but Television North Queensland, a regional broadcaster which carries the Channel Ten signal, is believed to be planning to join the consortium. CanWest last year bought a stake in New Zealand's fledgling TV3 network, and is believed to be planning to achieve synergies between the two countries through common programming. TTL, the least successful of Australia's three commercial television networks, was acquired through a debt-for-equity swap last year. The network had been in receivership since it defaulted on its bank debts in September 1990. However, the network recently announced a return to profitability after two years of losses with a net profit of ADollars 15.2m for the 50 weeks to the end of September. The sale of Channel Ten heralds the end of a period of uncertainty for Australia's three commercial broadcasters, all of which have suffered changes of ownership in the last two years. Channel Seven, once owned by Mr Christopher Skase's Qintex Australia group, remains in receivership, but is profitable, and is expected to be floated on the Australian Stock Exchange next year. Channel Nine, the top-rated network, is making strong profits following the acquisition of a controlling shareholding by Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press group. Channel Nine was previously owned by Bond Corporation, the failed flagship of Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt entrepreneur. The sale of Channel Ten will improve Westpac's image, which has been battered by poor financial results, bad debts, a failed rights issue and the recent resignation of five directors, including the chairman.</p>

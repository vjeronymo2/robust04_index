			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Rao must move swiftly to enact his reforms: Widely seen as a stop-gap, Narasimha Rao is now likely to complete the full term A year ago, Premier PV Narasimha Rao of India turned down an invitation to speak at the World Economic Forum at Davos. With the Ayodhya mosque in ruins and northern India torn by religious unrest, he judged it the wrong time to try to woo the world to do business with India. He now plans to travel to Switzerland at the end of the month at the head of a high-powered delegation, probably to include Mr Manmohan Singh, his finance minister and main architect of India's economic reforms. Mr Narasimha Rao is riding high after three political victories in the past two months. In November, the ruling Congress (I) party fared better than it had expected in state elections; the opposition Hindu militant Bharatiya Janata party, whose supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque, suffered defeat as voters rejected its ideology. Last month the prime minister skilfully defused a potential crisis after an all-party parliamentary committee criticised ministers, including Mr Singh, over their handling of the 1992 Rs40bn (Pounds 862m) Bombay securities market scandal. Mr Narasimha Rao capped this victory by winning over to the government benches a small opposition grouping of 10 MPs led by Mr Ajit Singh, thereby securing a stable parliamentary majority for the first time. Seen as a stop-gap, he is now widely expected to complete the full term of the current parliament, which runs until mid-1996. He has lasted longer than any other prime minister outside the Nehru-Gandhi family. Mr Singh, too, has grown in authority. Both are now better placed to promote their pro-market reform than in over a year. But they do not have much time. If controversial issues are not tackled soon, these could be postponed indefinitely; by the end of 1994, at the latest, the next general election will loom large in MPs' minds. Next month's budget will test the government's willingness to carry on. But unfortunately for the supporters of pro-market reform, the Congress party is increasingly complacent. The economy has made unspectacular but steady progress under Mr Singh. A surge in exports and inward foreign investment has helped India amass nearly Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) in foreign exchange reserves, against Dollars 1.1bn when reforms began. The rupee has been made convertible on the trade account. Import duties are coming down; the 'licence raj' of government controls has been largely dismantled. Shares in some state-owned enterprises have been sold off in the name of privatisation, and Mr Singh is seen in the party as having driven the wolf from the door. MPs will accept further modest rationalisation of the economy, but do not seem ready for the painful restructuring of state-owned enterprises which account for half the nation's capital. Trade unions in banking, telecommunications and other industries have reacted angrily to suggestions of job cuts; conservatively-minded businessmen have urged ministers to keep their interests in mind when opening India to foreign competition. Mr TN Ninan, editor of a leading business daily, says: 'Mental attitudes must change, and the growing body of evidence is that they haven't changed enough'. The government is behind schedule for cutting public borrowing. It had planned to cut the public sector deficit for the year to the end of March 1994 to 4.7 per cent of GDP. The real figure will be nearer 6.5 per cent. However, reforms have created many opportunities for Indian and foreign companies. When he speaks at Davos, Mr Narasimha Rao will be able to say India has made considerable progress, for example, in attracting investment proposals in core industries such as power and petrochemicals. With the stock market soaring in the past two months by more than 40 per cent, fuelled by foreign investment, he will be able to claim India's standing in international financial markets has been transformed. But without further radical changes, it could fritter these gains away. Mr Singh is aware of the arguments for continued reform. He has spent much time impressing them on Mr Narasimha Rao. The budget will show how persuasive he has been.</p>

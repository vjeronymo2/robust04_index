			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A choice of large aircraft The dogfight over which aircraft should replace the Royal Air Force's ageing Hercules transport fleet has so far been mostly confined to snarls and barks. The two combatants - Lockheed, the US manufacturer of the updated Hercules, and British Aerospace, potential partner in the flatly-named European Future Large Aircraft - have mostly settled for emotive newspaper advertising to make their pitch. But the fighting before a cross-departmental Whitehall committee this autumn will probably draw real blood. Ministers and civil servants have to judge some finely-balanced arguments. Lockheed contends that its latest generation of Hercules, the C-130J, is an evolution of the aircraft which has served the RAF and many other air forces well. Now new technology will cut the crew required, and hence the operating costs, and improve its performance. Better still, from a cash-strapped Ministry of Defence's point of view, the aircraft will be available off the shelf in 1996 at a fixed price. British Aerospace argues that the Future Large Aircraft will be a more modern design than the Hercules, which will allow it to operate at lower cost over its service life. The FLA will be faster and larger, and so can transport equipment which will not fit into a Hercules. There is also a large worldwide replacement market for Hercules which the FLA could attack. More parochially, BAe also fears that, if the UK does not back the FLA, the other members of the consortium will proceed anyway but that British companies will be excluded. In particular, BAe may lose its role as wing-maker to the Airbus consortium, with DASA of Germany taking its place. Competing claims In sifting these competing claims, the first decision must be: can Britain afford to wait for the FLA to arrive? The current Hercules fleet is showing its age badly. If an accurate assessment shows that the fleet cannot be maintained at a conscionable cost into the next century, then the FLA is simply not an option. A rigorous examination of the development costs of the FLA, and the lifetime running costs of both aircraft, is also needed. Aerospace manufacturers are notoriously starry-eyed about the final bills for their big ideas. The aircraft which was built for less than manufacturer's initial estimate has yet to fly. In this Lockheed has a huge advantage, since its aircraft is all but built, and it stands ready to sign a deal at about Pounds 25m an aircraft with the MoD. The onus is thus on British Aerospace to prove that its costings are accurate. That must eventually mean that it is prepared to back its pricing of the FLA with its own resources. Firm order At a bare minimum that would require a fixed price bid from British Aerospace for a firm order. BAe might also have to underwrite the cost of maintaining the existing Hercules fleet while waiting for the FLA. In return, the MoD might have to agree to stop fiddling with the aircraft's specification, a perennial habit of civil servants which drives up costs of many programmes. Definite answers to these questions will take time to establish, and BAe is hampered because the final feasibility study for the FLA is not due to be completed before the end of the year. If BAe really thinks that it can provide adequate answers to the testing questions, then it is perhaps justified in arguing for more time to make its case. It is also true that Airbus Industrie, which would manage the FLA project, has a good recent record. In particular the A340 civil airliner has proved that the consortium can develop an aircraft which has a strong market in relatively short order. However, in arguing for British participation in the FLA, BAe should be mindful of the risks of fixed-price military contracts to aerospace companies. Hundreds of millions of dollars written-off by McDonnell Douglas on its C-17 jet transporter are a graphic reminder of what can go wrong. It should also remember that it would only be a minority partner in the project and so not fully able to control its own destiny. If BAe is serious about pursuing the FLA, it had better make sure that the terms on which it might settle with the MoD are not ones which the company might live to regret.</p>

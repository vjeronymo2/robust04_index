			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: US economy The latest US unemployment figures leave the Federal Reserve in a cleft stick. The economy is growing, which in the UK would be enough to raise a statue to the chancellor, but the recovery is still very weak. US growth may be around 2 per cent this year, and a little more next year. That is not enough to stop unemployment rising, exacerbating the Fed's political difficulties with the administration. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, thus has a difficult decision to make. At the risk of frightening the bond market, he could cut short term interest rates once more, hoping to spark consumer confidence. Alternatively, he could hold off, gambling that the Fed's tough anti-inflationary attitude will help long yields fall, stimulating the housing market. Ideally, he would wait for a clearer picture, but once the presidential election campaign formally starts in September, interest rate cuts would look partisan. By selling dollars heavily on Friday, the foreign exchanges took the view that an early rate cut was possible. The Fed intervened to stem the fall, but more significant is the way Mr Greenspan has dragged his heels over previous rate cuts. At this stage, falling long term interest are more important for the recovery in the economy. The Fed will not let haste threaten that prize.</p>

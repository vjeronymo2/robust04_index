			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Americans to pay more for energy: Clinton administration spells out its economic programme A NEW energy tax levied on the thermal content of fuels will raise net revenues estimated at Dollars 22bn a year once it is fully in force, US Treasury officials said yesterday. The tax will be imposed at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British thermal units on coal, nuclear energy and gas, and at a much steeper rate of 59.9 cents per million BTUs on oil. The administration plans to phase in the tax in three stages, charging one third of the full rate from July 1, 1994, two thirds a year later, and the full rate from July 1, 1996. When fully phased in, the tax is expected to add 7.5 cents to the price of a gallon of petrol, 26.25 cents to a thousand cubic feet of natural gas, and Dollars 2.25 to the monthly electricity bill of an average household. Environmentalist groups greeted the details of the new tax with cautious approval. While many groups have favoured much heavier taxes, or a tax based directly on carbon content, to discourage consumption of polluting fuels, some analysts noted that a BTU tax has an advantage over an ad valorem tax in environmental terms because it hits coal, which is cheaper per BTU than other fossil fuels, more than some cleaner fuels. At the same time, by imposing a higher rate on oil President Bill Clinton could have some effect on fuel consumption in motor vehicles. The new tax, which will be collected at the pipeline, mine or refinery, is expected to raise the price of natural gas by 13.5 per cent, of coal by 18 per cent and of oil by 23.6 per cent. Renewable energy sources will for the most part be excluded from the tax, although hydroelectric power will be taxed at the average cost of the fossil fuels used by power generators. Some groups have argued against the energy tax on the grounds that it hurts lower income families, but the administration has tried to offset the impact of the energy tax with increased spending on food stamps and a programme to subsidise heating bills for low income families, as well as by an expanded earned income tax credit, again for low income families. Officials calculate that without these offsets, a family with an income of Dollars 25,000 a year would spend Dollars 105 a year more for its energy bills, while a family earning Dollars 40,000 would pay Dollars 118 and a family earning Dollars 60,000 would pay Dollars 133. One senior administration official said this would only be a modest burden on the average American, contrasting the extra cost of around Dollars 10 a month with the cut in interest rates that has taken place since the election. That has already yielded savings of Dollars 60 a month on a Dollars 100,000 mortgage. Mr Clinton's decision to impose a broad energy tax could have international implications. Last year, there was some discussion of an international agreement to levy a carbon tax, but the EC, Japan and the US were unwilling to commit themselves alone for fear of creating a competitive disadvantage for their economies. But Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said yesterday the US decision would make it easier for EC member states to adopt an energy tax.</p>

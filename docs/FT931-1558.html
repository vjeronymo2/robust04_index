			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / US backs British role in Europe BRITAIN was urged to play 'a central and vigorous role' in Europe yesterday by the US ambassador, Mr Raymond Seitz. Such a role, Mr Seitz said, 'adds considerable value and weight' to the Anglo-American relationship, the value of which 'is exponentially increased or diminished by Britain's position in the multilateral Europe'. But, he added, the US was also anxious 'that Britain preserve its capacity for independent action', notably in the military field. On a wide range of security issues after the cold war 'the willingness of either Washington or London to respond. . . will depend in large measure on the willingness of the other to act as well'. He added: 'The overlap of our strategic interests may not be quite so extensive as before'. Mr Seitz, appointed by President George Bush as the first career diplomat to hold the post, is thought likely to stay in London for at least another year. But the Clinton administration has yet to confirm this.</p>

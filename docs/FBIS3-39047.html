			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The ceremony for the  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who arrived in Ankara on an  official visit, was held at Cankaya Mansion this afternoon.  General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; ANAP  [Motherland Party] leader Mesut Yilmaz; ministers and other  officials, participated in the ceremony.    In a speech he delivered at the ceremony, President Suleyman  Demirel said that Aliyev's visit, which coincides with a period  when significant developments are taking place, will enable a  useful exchange of views on regional and international issues  concerning both countries.    Indicating that the Armenian attacks prevent both the  socioeconomic and political formation of Azerbaijan, which has  embarked on a process of reconstruction and unification with the  international community, Demirel stated that this situation is  starting to endanger regional stability. Demirel further noted  that nothing can be achieved -- neither territorial acquisition  nor political advantage -- with these acts of aggression which  are in violation of international norms, adding that he takes  advantage of this occasion to condemn the Armenian aggression  once more.    Noting that Turkey attaches great importance to regional  peace and cooperation, Demirel added that he sincerely believes  that stability and security cannot be separated. For this  reason, Demirel further stated, he believes that the conflict  between Azerbaijan and Armenia will be justly solved when  Azerbaijan's territorial integrity is achieved. Demirel said:    [Begin Demirel recording] It has to be known that Turkey  will not be content with supporting Azerbaijan only in  international issues. While embracing its Azeri brothers as a  state and nation after a 70-year longing, Turkey, as a  contemporary democratic state, will also continue to extend  all-out assistance in the reconstruction process of Azerbaijan.  [end recording]    Aliyev, in turn, indicated that Turkey and Azerbaijan had  established a close cooperation and support in recent years and  added that the newly constituted Azerbaijan Republic has always  been aware of Turkey's support and help. Explaining that the  most important issue Azerbaijan faces is the Armenian  aggression, Aliyev added that his people strongly feel Turkey's  assistance regarding this aggressiveness.    Adding that Azerbaijan conducts a peaceful policy, Aliyev  said that their aim is to have friendly relations with their  neighbors. Aliyev said:    [Begin Aliyev recording] We are calling on the concerned  countries', especially Turkey's, support in achieving a peaceful  solution to the artificial Karabakh issue which was created by  the Armenians. [end recording]    Subsequently, the two presidents held a meeting and  thereafter the respective delegations of the two countries  started their discussions. Aliyev later received Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller at the hotel where he is residing and conferred  with her for some time. The guest president also met Motherland  Party leader Mesut Yilmaz. Aliyev will continue with his  contacts in Ankara tomorrow and depart from Turkey on Saturday.</p>

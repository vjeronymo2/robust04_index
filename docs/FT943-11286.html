			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: 'Sleeping Beauty' retains its purity - Clement Crisp sees two fine performances from ENB soloists Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur The Sleeping Beauty is the one, and supreme, masterpiece of 19th century ballet that has come down to us in something like its original form. Or, more accurately, is still available to us in a decently original form if a producer has sufficient humility to respect what Petipa and Tchaikovsky created. Other texts, from Giselle to Swan Lake, are variously corrupt and, like tottering old ladies, are just waiting to be mugged by ballet's eager gang of ruffians. And they do not wait in vain. Beauty, because it is so massive in its forces, seems to be reasonably protected, though there have been some pretty nasty attacks in recent years. English National Ballet's staging - I reported on its first performance last autumn - is by Ronald Hynd. Most of the proper (ie Royal Ballet in 1946) text is honoured. Innovations are not crass. There is sometimes too much clutter of activity - the old repertory, as the Kirov has persuasively shown us, demands less rather than more to make its best effects - but what we see is Beauty and not some Frankenstein mishap. Visually it has a certain fairy-tale glamour, and the permanent setting is skilled, but it is still far too bright. Peter Docherty's costuming suffers from the dreadful qualities of man-made fibres, which are unyielding and un-nuanced in their response to light and to movement. Natural materials may be a financial menace, but they soften, flow, take on gentler shapes and a more responsive lustre. Away with nylon. To end its Coliseum performances this week, ENB has brought Beauty for a first London showing. On Wednesday it was dominated and made memorable by the performances of Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur. Miss Oaks has seemed in the past the prettiest of dancers, but one whose gifts are for light-weight roles. Her Aurora is clearly the fruit of serious work - it is technically bright, clear, fluent and results in a portrait of a young princess having beguiling charm of feeling, as of style. It is not a grand reading, though effects are often prodigious, as in the wonderfully secure and long-sustained balances, with nary a wobble. Miss Oaks brings sweetness, youthful grace, even innocence, to the part. Sometimes she is too ingratiating - passages when she lets the dance and her own natural distinction speak are more effective than those in which she plays to her suitors and to us - but it is an entirely delightful, honourable view of the greatest challenge a ballerina can know. She has grown up as an artist. I have been fortunate to have seen two ideal interpretations of the role of Prince Florimund in half a century of looking at this ballet. Anton Dolin in 1948 - returning to Covent Garden with Markova - took to the stage in the hunting scene with a dignity and grace of manner that were astonishing. In 1961, in the Kirov's ideal production, Oleg Sokolov was a figure of Apollonian beauty - noble in manner, noble in dancing. I have measured every other player against these. On Wednesday Thomas Edur matched these great examplars of the danse noble. His manner is courteous, unforced. Character is immediately established, as he avoids a persistent mistress, or stands slightly remote amid his entourage. Temperament is touched with melancholy. His dancing, despite the waders he must wear, is fluent, angelically phrased. It is an astonishing impersonation, because as perfect as we have right to expect in ballet's imperfect world. In the wedding celebrations, his dancing is large in scale, shaped in long easy sequences, phrase-endings beautifully melting. And there is neither bombast, nor trickery, nor one iota of vulgarity in anything we see. It is the dancing of a true heir to those real, if subliminal, traditions of behaviour that take our balletic princes back to their actual historical forebear, Louis XIV. Company support is bright - and in the behaviour of King Florestan and his courtiers, positively lurid. I liked Susan Jaffe as a serene, brilliant Lilac Fairy, and salute James Supervia as a wonderfully convincing Tutor to the prince, looking like Dr Johnson, and giving the role dignity. For fellow admirers of King Herod, I record that there are infants in the Prologue whose little runs and expressions of terror at the appearance of Carabosse confirm us in our belief about the proper fate for stage-tots. English National Ballet's summer season is sponsored by Nomura. Sleeping Beauty continues at the Coliseum this week; then opens the ENB season at the Royal Festival Hall from August 1.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Minister's council move overturned A DECISION by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to close the London borough of Haringey's own refuse collection service was overturned by the High Court yesterday. Two judges ruled that the closure order, due to take effect in the new year, was legally flawed and must be reconsidered. Mr Heseltine acted last March, while environment secretary, after allegations of 'anti-competitive behaviour' by the Labour-controlled council in awarding itself a contract for refuse collection and street cleaning work. Mr Michael Portillo, then local government minister, told parliament the council had accepted the bid from its own direct service organisation in spite of two lower bids from the private sector. Yesterday Lord Justice Evans, sitting with Mr Justice Otton, ruled that Mr Heseltine had been legally obliged to consider allowing the organisation to put in a new bid, subject to conditions, before ordering a complete bar. 'There is no evidence that the secretary of state did this, and if he failed to do so, then in my judgment he erred in law,' the judge said. Haringey welcomed the ruling.</p>

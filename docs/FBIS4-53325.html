			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japan's economy needs  "little more time" to hit bottom but a "recovery trend is hoped  for in and after summer," a leading banker said Tuesday [17 May].    Some bright signs are seen in personal consumption, and  housing spending and public works remain buoyant, Toshio  Morikawa, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of  Japan, told a regular news meeting.    But he said capital investment is still "motionless" and  conditions for income and labor are deteriorating.    Under these circumstances, Morikawa expressed hopes that the  15.25 trillion yen stimulus package in February and summer  income tax cuts would combine to "cement a recovery trend."    On possible downward pressures ahead, he reiterated his  concerns over the yen's rise, delayed passage of fiscal 1994  budget and stalled Japan-U.S. trade talks.    "I hope currency rates will remain stable," Morikawa said,  noting the yen's rise has come to a halt with recent  intervention by leading industrial nations to prop up the dollar.    However, the yen's current levels are "tough for  manufacturers," he said. The dollar traded above 104.50 yen in  Tokyo on Tuesday.    On shaky political situations, Morikawa said he does not see  any great impact on the economy from the minority rule by Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata.    But he called for "positive handling" to pass the fiscal  1994  budget as soon as possible, and to conduct economic reform as  promised in the March market-opening package, primarily to  resume trade talks with the United States.    "I'm concerned about a further long delay" in passing the  budget for the year started April 1, even though public works  are maintained with the third fiscal 1993 budget, he said.    Referring to the release of fiscal 1993 business results  next  week, Morikawa, who is also president of Sumitomo Bank, said his  bank is likely to post a better-than-expected net operating  profit from core banking business since interest rates stayed  low through the year.    But a lower-than-expected pretax profit is predicted from  active write-offs of nonperforming loans, he said.    On the interest rates trend, Morikawa said short-term rates  are likely to remain stable at low levels for the time being,  and long-term rates will level off from a recent slight uptrend.    U.S. long-term rates are on the rise, but this is unlikely  to  affect rates in Japan, where the economy remains weak and prices  stable, he said.</p>

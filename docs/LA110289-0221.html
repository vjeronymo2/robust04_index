			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CANSECO IN FLAP ABOARD JETLINER  </P> <P> Oakland Athletics right fielder Jose Canseco was briefly detained by police at  McCarran International Airport after reportedly causing a disturbance on a  flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Police took Canseco aside after he got off the flight late Tuesday night and  questioned him for about 20 minutes before letting him go, said Metropolitan  Police Lt. Ron Fisher.  </P> <P> Fisher said the pilot had radioed ahead and alerted police that Canseco was  being unruly with a flight attendant.  </P> <P> "Apparently he didn't do some of the things she told him to do, like putting on  his seat belt," he said. "The flight attendant told the officers she had  interpreted some of the things he had said back to her as threats. His side was  that the flight crew was lying about the accusations."  </P> <P> Fisher called the incident no big deal and said police stationed at the airport  commonly respond to similar incidents.  </P></p>

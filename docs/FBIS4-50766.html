			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Teng Yen-erh (6772 1750 0334): </F> "Vice Minister of State Economic and Trade Commission Yu  Xiaosong Expresses Optimism About Extension of MFN Status"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 May (TA KUNG PAO) -- Yu Xiaosong, vice  minister of China's State Economic and Trade Commission, said  today that he is optimistic about the extension by the United  States of most-favored-nation [MFN] status for China.    In reply to a reporter's question about the U.S. extension  of  MFN status for China, Yu Xiaosong -- who was attending a  Beijing-Hong Kong economy and trade luncheon meeting -- said  today that he was optimistic about the extension. Even if the  MFN status is revoked this year, it will have to be restored  next year. After all, Sino- U.S. relations are an important  part of world relations, he said, and if Sino-U.S. relations  come to a deadlock, the rift will have to be mended by the  politicians of the next generation, since it will not be easy  for this generation to do so.    Yu Xiaosong stressed that a deadlock, first of all, would be  unfavorable to the United States. Sino-U.S. relations cannot  come to a deadlock. Whichever side causes the deadlock will  have to bear the historical responsibility, and the politicians  of that side will have to undertake the mission to mend the rift.    Yu recalled that there were no ties between China and the  United States in 1972, when former U.S. President Nixon and  former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger paid their visit to  China. In addition, China and the United States had been at war  with each other, but at that time both sides felt the need to  normalize relations between them. Then why should something be  done to deadlock the relations today? he asked.    He stressed that China, for its part, does not want the  relations to come to a deadlock, but some people in the United  States do intend to cause a deadlock.    He said many Americans and politicians do not know about  China, so it is necessary to make more efforts to convince them  and to explain the situation to them.    He said China should have been granted permanent MFN status.  China now has met all the requirements set out by the United  States in this regard, but the United States wants to add some  extra requirements, which are not provided for by U.S. law.</p>

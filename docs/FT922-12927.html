			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Observer: Monumental The collapse of communism was swift; removing its icons takes longer. But this week the revolution caught up with Lenin in the Central Bank. This fine building on Neglinnaya Street near the Bolshoi Theatre, which had housed the pre-revolutionary Moscow Stock Exchange and which for decades was home to Gosbank, USSR, was also home to two monuments to the maker of Soviet ideology. One, a statue on the first floor, stood, arm outwards, as if directing visitors to the foreign currency department. The other was a saying from Chairman Lenin in the entrance hall, which announced, in effect, that once a revolutionary government had control of the central bank, then the seizure of the financial system was 90 per cent complete. Hardly suitable viewing for the squads of world bankers who pass through the portals to huddle with their counterparts from the Russian Central Bank. So now it is only above the eternal flame to the state bankers who fell in the Great Patriotic War that a little hammer and sickle attests to the past.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The Daf Crisis: Andersen men made receivers THE ACCOUNTANTS appointed yesterday as administrative receivers to Leyland-Daf's principal UK subsidiaries have three months under insolvency law to hold a creditors' meeting. Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, partners in Arthur Andersen, the sixth-largest accountancy firm, were appointed yesterday afternoon. They may well be able to hold a number of the trading companies together and sell them as operating businesses either before or after the creditors' meeting. The receivership is not affected by the jurisdiction of the courts in the Netherlands, where the Leyland-Daf holding company is based, or by those in Belgium. The management is applying for protection from creditors in both countries. In practice, the receivers are likely to work closely with their counterparts in these countries to consider a sale which might involve businesses operating in more than one country. The appointment of the British receivers prevents any creditor being able to launch separate legal proceedings to seize the company's assets and recover outstanding debts. They have assigned a number of other accountants and insolvency specialists from the firm to take control of the management of three UK operating companies on six sites. They only began holding discussions with the company on Tuesday, and may take several weeks to build up a detailed understanding of the position of the business. Unless they are granted an extension, they will be expected to provide a statement on the financial state of affairs at a creditors' meeting by early May. Until then, they are protected. A creditors' committee would normally be elected at that time, and any future negotiations  - including monitoring the professional fees charged  - would be channelled through this committee. In the meantime, they can expect a series of potential buyers for the Daf businesses to come forward.</p>

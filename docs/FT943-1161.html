			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Defence workers to target Tories A three-month campaign by trade unions over the latest round of defence cuts will culminate next month when dockyard and naval-base workers will lobby the Conservative party conference. This will be followed on October 17 by lobbying of the Commons, when it is due to debate the cuts. The campaign started in July after Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, announced savings of Pounds 750m a year with the loss of 18,000 jobs, including 7,000 civilian posts, in Front Line First, his defence costs study. The unions aim to persuade the government to undertake a full defence review and do more to manage the structural changes in local economies. Referring to the Commons debate, Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the TGWU general union, said: 'We unashamedly want to influence the outcome.' There was 'a sense of betrayal on the part of those we represent. They say 'I've served the nation well. Why am I rewarded by the sack?' ' Mr Dromey was speaking at a conference organised in Plymouth last week by the south-west region of the Trades Union Congress as part of the campaign. Workers from Devonport dockyard, where 850 further redundancies were announced in the summer, were among those who attended. A similar conference with Rosyth workers will be held by the Scottish TUC in Edinburgh on Friday. Private meetings are being sought with Conservative MPs whose constituencies include defence bases. The unions are capitalising on the fact that the Tories have several marginal seats in the south-west, regarded as the UK's most defence-dependent region. Mr Dromey said: 'We want to put on the spot Tory MPs. They should put constituents before their careers.' Plymouth Business School estimates that nearly 20,000 defence-related jobs have disappeared or are under threat in Devon and Cornwall. Mr Dromey emphasised at the Plymouth conference that the unions did not defend the status quo. 'Peace means change, but change should follow a proper defence review to define the country's new role in the international arena. Instead, the Treasury is calling the tune.' In the south-west the union campaign has attracted broad support. Mr Robert Hicks, Conservative MP for Cornwall South-East, told the conference: 'It embarrasses me at times that we have this Treasury-led approach to defence and security of the country. No one more than myself resents this price-tag approach to central issues. I recognise the need for cost-effectiveness, but you can take that too far.' Mr Eric Dancer, chairman of Westcountry Development Corporation, a private and public-sector partnership for regeneration, said the peace dividend had to be welcomed, but funding had not been forthcoming to cope with the structural change in Devon and Cornwall. A study by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand showed the two counties received much lower government spending than some other regions. Mr Dancer said: 'The prime minister is now taking a particular interest and has personally asked for a further report.' Mr Paul Noon, deputy general secretary of the IPMS civil service union, described Front Line First as 'a short-term view on how to achieve Pounds 750m savings on top of all the others in Options for Change (the white paper on defence requirements).' The Ministry of Defence admitted that it had not assessed the impact on regional economies, he said. Mr David Jamieson, Labour MP for Devonport, reinforced the point. He said: 'The most essential requirement is to have a full defence review.'</p>

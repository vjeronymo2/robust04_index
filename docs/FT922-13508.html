			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Finance bill set to head agenda THE OUTLINES of the new finance bill, which could be introduced early next month, within a few days of the state opening of parliament, are clearer than the names of the ministers who will take it through parliament. No decisions will yet have been taken, but the bill might include one of the first manifesto pledges to be implemented. The Tory manifesto specifically says that 'as early as possible in the new parliament' the party would introduce a 'rent-a-room' scheme enabling home-owners to get tax relief on rooms they let to lodgers. Fresh Budget resolutions could be brought forward for debate immediately after the Queen's Speech debate, which lasts a week and begins on May 6. The second reading debate on the finance bill could then take place in late May, with it receiving detailed consideration through June and into July on a timetable not very different from usual. The bill is expected to be substantial, though not necessarily particularly controversial, comprising perhaps 70 clauses and several schedules. Many of these would be fairly technical measures on the European single market which have been discussed by the Customs and Excise department with interested groups, but some important aspects of the Budget have still not been introduced. The most notable of these are the changes on inheritance tax, to raise the general threshold to Pounds 150,000 and to exempt most family businesses. The further alleviation of inheritance tax is thought in Whitehall to be for future years rather than in changes to the existing Budget proposals. Other Budget plans which will feature in the bill include the additional help for the film industry, the extension of Gift Aid, and the abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme. Also on the stocks is a short, perhaps 10- or 12-clause bill, to bring about the promised relief for businesses hit by the transitional arrangements for the uniform business rates. Changes in personal equity plans allowing Pounds 6,000 to be invested in unit and investment trusts over a tax year, have already been made, though not by a bill but by alterations in the PEP rules.</p>

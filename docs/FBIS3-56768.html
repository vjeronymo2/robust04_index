			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin  had a telephone conversation with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman  of the Georgian parliament and head of state.    The Russian president, who telephoned Tbilisi, announced  that  he had been planning to pay an official visit to Georgia at the  end of January 1994. However, since he understood full well the  importance of Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to France [beginning  20 January] not only for Georgia and the CIS member countries,  but also for the international community, he decided to postpone  his visit until February.    As agreed, a meeting of the Russian and Georgian prime  ministers will be held ahead of Boris Yeltsin's visit.    Today, Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia starts a  three-day working visit to the Russian capital. The main  objective of the Georgian prime minister's visit is to conclude  the preparation of a comprehensive friendship and cooperation  treaty between Russia and Georgia.    It is expected that this treaty will be signed during Boris  Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi set for 3-4 February.    The final details of the treaty will be agreed on Wednesday  or Thursday at a meeting between Otar Patsatsia and Viktor  Chernomyrdin.</p>

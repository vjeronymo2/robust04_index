			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Seeboard to cut hundreds of jobs in restructuring SEVERAL HUNDRED jobs are expected to go at Seeboard, distributor and supplier of electricity in the south-east of England, following a restructuring of the company to be announced today or next week. Although the job losses are likely to be phased over more than a year, they come after an 18-month period in which more than 400 jobs have been shed from the previous workforce of 6,000. The restructuring involves a rationalisation of operating divisions, contracting out of information technology services to an outside company and a move to smaller headquarters. Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, was unavailable for comment yesterday but he presaged the changes when announcing the company's interim results in January by saying he planned to move to different headquarters and investigate the possibility of introducing 'business streams'. It is thought the five main operating divisions will be reduced to three, each of them run as a separate profit-making business. The corporate reporting structure will be simplified. Analysts speculated that the three likely divisions would be based around distribution, supply and the rest of the business - which includes retailing and contracting. The new headquarters will be in the Crawley area in West Sussex. Eventually only about 100 people will be employed there, as against a current total of 500 at the headquarters in Hove, East Sussex. The move will be delayed until completion of the building next year. Although the company expects that most of the cuts will be met by voluntary redundancies, it has not ruled out forced redundancies.</p>

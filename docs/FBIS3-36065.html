Kazimirov, who recently travelled to Khankendi [Stepanakert]  and Yerevan arrived in the late evening on January 30 to Baku  with the Russian plan for regulating the Armenian-Azeri conflict.    An official from the Azeri Presidential Cabinet told TURAN  that the plan proposed a withdrawal of Armenian forces from six  occupied south-western regions of Azerbaijan and the stationing  of buffer-forces all along the line of hostilities. The  question about the fate of the two other occupied Azeri regions,  Lachinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy, and the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh, will be discussed at a later date. The first  stage of implementation of the plan would be a 2-3 week long  cease-fire which was scheduled to be signed on February 1.    However, Geydar Aliyev rejected the proposal and told  Kazimirov yesterday that "we will discuss the question of a  cease-fire only after the complete withdrawal of Armenian forces  from the occupied Azeri territories." He also said, "Azerbaijan  will not be humiliated by such cease-fire terms."    One Azeri diplomat said, "The regulation of the conflict can  be discussed seriously only if the plan provides for a complete  withdrawal of Armenian troops from all the occupied regions and  the return of Azeris to the Shushinskiy Region of  Nagorno-Karabakh. Under these conditions, Azerbaijan would  guarantee the restoration of road travel between  Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia", one Azeri diplomat said.    The fact that Kazimirov left with an unagreed upon plan,  postpones the settlement of the question for an indefinite  period of time. In this connection, reports of the Russian  media about today's scheduled meeting between Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and  Azerbaijan, and with the representatives of the Armenian  community of Nagorno- Karabakh are appear to be premature.  Moreover, Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov did not leave  for Moscow. This morning he received the UK ambassador Thomas  Young.</p>

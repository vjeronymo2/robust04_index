[Begin Sosa recording] The exchange rate stands at 170  bolivares to the dollar. That is a completely overvalued  dollar. The bolivar was overvalued in the past, but now we have  an undervalued bolivar. I think nervousness led a number of  people to apply pressure on a balance of payments that should  have been perfectly manageable. They will probably realize in  the future that the [words indistinct] was too good. [end  recording]    The finance minister reported that in a meeting today the  Council of Ministers approved four tax laws [words indistinct],  including a property tax [words indistinct], a tax on the sale  of luxury items, and a wholesale tax. The wholesale tax will  produce (?350) billion [currency not specified] for the national  treasury [words indistinct].    Sosa announced that he will travel to Washington on Thursday  to meet privately with IMF President Michel Camdessus to ask for  help in restoring confidence in the country.</p>

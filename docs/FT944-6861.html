			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Tories train big guns on Dudley West seat: Labour successes in council polls have intensified by-election campaigning Labour today steps up the intensity of its campaign to wrest Dudley West from the Conservatives in a parliamentary by-election, buoyed by striking success in two local polls. Results from Dudley Borough Council by-elections in two of Dudley West's eight wards in the past four weeks have shown a 30 per cent swing to Labour and resulted in the capture of council seats once considered an exclusive Conservative preserve. The by-election for the West Midlands constituency, to be held on December 15, follows the death of John Blackburn, who took the seat for the Conservatives in 1979 and strengthened his hold in the elections of 1983 and 1987. But in 1992 his majority slipped in the face of 3.85 per cent swing to Labour. Mr Graham Postles, the Conservative candidate, is defending Blackburn's 1992 majority of 5,789. Labour calculations suggest that a swing of slightly more than 4 per cent, a small movement compared with those indicated by the council by-election results, would lead to a win for its candidate, Mr Ian Pearson. The narrow margin between the main candidates has turned Dudley West into a battleground for senior politicians. Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, has already visited. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is in the constituency today and Mr John Maples, Conservative deputy chairman and chronicler of disillusionment among the party faithful, is expected later in the week. Conservative officials promise a visit from either a cabinet minister or a senior party official every day during the campaign. Three members of Labour's shadow cabinet - Mr John Prescott, Mr Jack Straw and Mr Frank Dobson - have been electioneering in the constituency. Ms Ann Taylor is expected today and it is likely that Mr Tony Blair will appear later with his vision of the new Labour party. The Conservatives have already started hammering away on the theme that Labour is not to be trusted and the result of the by-election will depend on the degree to which Black Country voters see Mr Blair's Labour party as practical and free of the ideological baggage of the past. Dudley West is not natural Labour territory. With 75 per cent home-ownership it has many of the same social characteristics as Guildford and Winchester. The western borders of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation are traditionally prosperous. Unemployment rates in five of the eight wards are less than 6 per cent. That of another ward is close to the national average at 9.3 per cent. Only in the industrial wards of Brierley Hill, with 17.8 per cent unemployment, and in Brockmoor and Pensnett, does Dudley West look like a Midlands inner-city constituency. Apart from Mr Postles and Mr Pearson, the other announced candidates for the by-election are Mr Mike Hadley (Liberal Democrat), Lord David Sutch (Monster Raving Loony Party), Mr Andy Carmichael (National Front), Mr Mike Nattrass (New Britain Party) and Mr Malcolm Floyd (UK Independence Party).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In the opinion of Ukrainian Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko, relations with Russia are a priority in our  foreign policy. In an interview with UKRINFORM, the foreign  minister emphasized that [word indistinct] relations between  Ukraine and Russia serve not only the interests of our two  countries, but also Europe in general. The minister also stated  that the process of fulfilling the tripartite agreements of the  Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian presidents on our nonnuclear status  and guarantees for us has already begun. He emphasized, however,  that all the sides must adhere to their commitments, which will  ensure fulfillment of the agreements.</p>

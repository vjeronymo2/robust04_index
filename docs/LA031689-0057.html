			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CONTRACT FOR TRAFFIC PROJECT OKD  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Estates City Council awarded a $22,512 contract Tuesday to  Basmaciyan-Darnell Inc. of Costa Mesa to design Phase III of a troublesome  intersection near Malaga Cove where Palos Verdes Drives West and North join.  </P> <P> Phase III involves a stretch of Palos Verdes Drive West from Via Corta to the  triangular intersection. The triangle itself and the curve sloping north to  Torrance have already been designed. Construction on the curve will begin in  the next few months, City Engineer Gary Wynn said.  </P> <P> Councilman Edward Ritscher, who cast the sole vote against awarding the  contract, said BDI would favor signal lights at the intersection of Via Corta  and Palos Verdes Drive West. Ritscher, like several other council members,  opposes signals in the city.  </P> <P> BDI said plans for the project will be completed in 32 weeks.  </P></p>

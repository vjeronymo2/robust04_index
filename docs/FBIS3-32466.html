This  action could seriously jeopardize the reform. With the backing  of President Itamar Franco, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso and leaders of the proadministration PSDB [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party] and the PMDB [Brazilian Social Movement  Party] reached an agreement in Congress with the group of  congressmen who oppose a constitutional reform. Under this  agreement most of the provisional measures will be approved by  27 January by suspending the sessions allocated to review the  Constitution. "The approval of the economic plan is currently  more important than the Constitutional reform," President Franco  told his finance minister in the evening of 25 January when he  authorized the agreement.    The government's decision to request that the economic plan  be voted on first -- although it might endanger the  constitutional reform -- exploded like a bomb in Congress.  While the parties that oppose the reform celebrated the success  of their strategy, the atmosphere in the corridors of Congress  was one of tension, irritation, and great uncertainty. Bahia  State Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, the PFL [Liberal Front  Party] leader at the Chamber of Deputies, protested: "The  government is showing its inability to negotiate and to ensure  the approval of its proposals." Magalhaes and the other leaders  are in favor of the constitutional reform and could not hide  their pessimism. They believe the constitutional reform is  definitively at risk. According to one important congressman,  who is in favor of the constitutional reform: "If the situation  continues, the debates will not begin until after the Carnival  holidays. This would mean that the constitutional reform work  will coincide with the beginning of the presidential elections  campaign and the announcement of candidacies."    Deputy Nelson Jobim (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party,  PMDB - Rio Grande do Sul), the constitutional reform rapporteur,  tried his best to look optimistic and calm. Pretending to agree  with the postponement, he said: "There is an important reason  for postponing the debates. The provisional measures will not  be in effect tomorrow." Nonetheless, in private talks with  party leaders -- particularly those of the ruling parties -- he  did not hide his irritation against the governmentleaders,  especially against Humberto Lucena (PMDB - Paraiba), who  presides the Senate and the constitutional reform work. He  said: "He (Lucena) is responsible for all this confusion because  he is making no effort to have the provisional measures voted on  or to begin the constitutional reform work."    Jobim has a trump card that can be used to speed up the  voting: The reform reducing the quorum required for the approval  of the constitutional amendment creating the Social Emergency  Fund is important for the government. Jobim explained that the  approval of this year's budget depends on this amendment, which  links the government's revenue to this fund. "If the amendment  is not approved, there will be no budget resources," he said.  This trump card will be placed on the negotiation table today.  Deputy Gustavo Krause (PFL - Pernambuco), the deputy  rapporteur, said: "If that does not work, there will be no  constitutional reform."    The PFL leader, who is coordinating the conservatist bloc  for  the beginning of the constitutional refom debates, did not hide  his dismay. He said: "I will not say the reform will only be  voted on after the Carnival holidays because I am in favor of  the reform and will not say anything to favor those who oppose  it." In the last two weeks, Magalhaes managed to persuade 340  deputies to come to Brasilia by promising that the  constitutional reform debates would start soon. "This has not  occurred and I wonder if -- when summoned next week -- they will  respond as promptly as they did now, because that week  immediately precedes the Carnival holidays."</p>

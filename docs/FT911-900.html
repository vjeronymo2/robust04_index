			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / No chemical weapons at front, says UK general THE MYSTERY surrounding Iraq's tactics in the war over Kuwait deepened yesterday when General Sir Peter de la Billiere, who commanded British forces, said Baghdad had apparently not sent chemical weapons for use against the US-led coalition. Shortly before the allies launched their offensive in February, UK officials said there was evidence that Iraq had moved chemical shells and rockets to frontline units. But Sir Peter told the House of Commons defence committee yesterday that to his knowledge no chemical weapons had subsequently been recovered. 'I believe the reason for this is that they weren't deployed,' he said. It had previously been assumed that Iraqi forces did not resort to chemical weapons either because they had no opportunity to employ them effectively against the rapid allied advance, or because of allied threats of retaliation. Sir Peter promised 'full disclosure' of the results of an investigation into the deaths of nine British soldiers whose armoured vehicles were attacked by a US A-10 aircraft. His comment followed a reported statement by Lt-Gen Charles Horner, the US Air Force commander in the war, that a British air controller had indicated there were no allied forces in the area.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Fishing: A view from the casting couch In a distinctly non-vintage year for new fishing books, the best I have come across, by some distance, is Trout Bum, by American writer John Gierach (Robinson, Pounds 14.95). To judge from the abysmal picture of him on the inside cover, the author is a hairy, brawny wilderness man, and he writes of icy mountain lakes a day's walk from anywhere; of crystal headwaters high in the lonely peaks; of camp fires with coyotes for company. The style is literary - a touch sub-Hemingway, you might think - but the prose is suffused with love for the sport and deep knowledge of its traditions and lore. I would guess that Gierach is a first-rate fisherman, but he has the good manners not to boast. I liked him and his book very much. Incomparably the most interesting volume I have seen is Dr CB McCully's A Dictionary of Fly Fishing (Oxford University Press, Pounds 6.99). I know nothing of the doctor but surmise he must be monstrously learned. Whether your query concerns the character of oligotrophic water, the origin of the Funneldun fly, or the genesis of the great nymph versus dry fly controversy, the answer is here. All is expressed wittily and pithily and the whole thing is a delight. A Passion For Angling, by Chris Yates, Bob James and Hugh Miles (Merlin Unwin/BBC, Pounds 16.99) is a pleasant reminder of the wonderful BBC television series which ran this autumn. I have said before, and will say again, that Yates is the best writer on fishing in the UK. The book is full of delicious touches without seeing him entirely on top form. I greatly enjoyed Roger Pierce's unpretentious and individual Fishing With My Father (available at Pounds 14.95 from the Chiltern Agency, Kingston Street, Chinnor, Oxon OX9 4NL). It is a beguiling narrative, woven around his father's diaries and his own memories. At the other end of the scale is Casting Far And Wide (David and Charles, Pounds 17.99), a collection of adventures in far-flung parts compiled by John Bailey. I have not actually read it, for the economy-conscious publishers sent me no more than the dust jacket. But the references on that to Balkan catfish, Danube salmon, the vast arapaima of Brazil and the mailed mahseer of India made me eager for more. If contemporary writing is going through the doldrums, the business of exhuming the jewels of the past proceeds apace. It is led by Justin Knowles, who is my nomination as publishing hero of the year. His Fly Fisher's Classic Library continues to offer, in handsome reprints and at reasonable cost, classics which previously could be found only by assiduous skulkers around second-hand shops and delvers into specialist catalogues (people like me, in fact). The discovery of the year was James O'Gorman's The Practice Of Angling As Regards Ireland. It was published in 1845 and, although I had heard of it, I had never read it until Knowles sent me his reprint. The title might be a touch cumbersome but the text is rollicking stuff - great stories, splendid characters, and a vigorous and humorous style. At Pounds 67, it is a snip. Like the others, it can be obtained from Dartmoor View, Mary Street, Bover Tracey, Newton Abbot, Devon TQ13 9HQ. Negley Farson's Going Fishing (Fly Fisher's Classic Library, Pounds 32) is one of the deathless masterpieces. Farson was a seriously larger-than-life individual: war correspondent, womaniser, drinker, tale-teller. He was a habitual wanderer in wild and dangerous places and wherever he went - the high valleys of the Caucasus, the Gulf of Finland, the Andean foothills, the Dinaric Alps of Slovenia - he usually had a fishing rod with him. The writing style is all his own: laconic, lean, passionate and memorable. Like Farson, Arthur Ransome was a newspaper correspondent in Russia at the time of the Bolshevik revolution. But Ransome's fishing pieces for the Manchester Guardian - collected under the title Rod And Line (Fly Fisher's Classic Library, Pounds 38) - have none of the border-hopping restlessness of the American. Ransome's territory is domestic; his tone reflective, philosophical and inquiring. He roves where he wills over matters such as the wisdom of carp, the traditions of northern fly dressing, the piscatorial side-effects of an eclipse and the uncertain temper of bulls. The book is one of my absolute favourites. My only regret about this edition  -a substantial one - is that, unlike others, it does not include Ransome's translation of the exquisite work of Sergei Aksakov, whom Ransome called the first and most delightful of Russian writers on fishing. It is well worth hunting down a second-hand copy in the old Traveller's Library; it should cost no more than a pound or two.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU leaders back cuts in wages: Summit set to endorse Delors plan to beat recession and unemployment European leaders yesterday endorsed tough measures to cut real wages as a means of strengthening competitiveness and steering Europe out of recession. At the end of the first day of the Brussels summit, EU heads of governments appeared poised to adopt the white paper on jobs and growth prepared by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, as an 'action plan'. EU leaders seem likely today to approve the white paper as a framework which offers each member state options for strengthening competitiveness and attacking unemployment. The message of the summit was that Europe's workers must accept short-term pain in order to hold on to their jobs and escape the worst recession since 1975. Outside the summit building, trade unionists marched in protest against the Belgian government's plans to cut social security and freeze real wages. The summit was dominated by the jobs crisis, but tense talks took place aimed at settling objections over the cost to French agriculture and Portuguese textiles of a world trade deal. Heads of government, including Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, praised Mr Delors' job-creating prescriptions, including more flexible labour markets, while recognising there were no miracle cures for unemployment. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany stressed that job creation must have priority over wage increases. When Greek ministers spoke out against real wage cuts, they were countered by a united front made up of representatives of the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said people in work should accept lower wages in the interests of solidarity with the Union's 18m unemployed. French president Francois Mitterrand said the white paper was a 'charter for what is possible' which would 'relaunch Europe.' But there was opposition yesterday to Mr Delors' proposal for the Union to borrow large sums on the capital markets to help fund road, rail, energy, environmental and advanced telecommunications projects. Anglo-German opposition surfaced towards the European Commission's proposal to issue 'Union bonds' to boost available EU funding for such projects from Ecu12bn to Ecu20bn (Pounds 9.14bn to Pounds 15.24bn) a year to the end of the century. The borrowing plan is expected to be handed to EU finance ministers for further review, despite Mr Mitterrand's complaint that this amounted to 'burying' Mr Delors proposals. Last night, a senior British official signalled a potential compromise. He said he expected projects to be submitted for scrutiny by finance ministers who would approve the level of funding for each individual project. Government heads were expected to focus on the question of how to accommodate French and Portuguese demands on agriculture and textiles after extensive bilateral negotiations yesterday. Portugal's threat to veto a deal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because of an inadequate US offer on market access for textiles was treated seriously and with sympathy. But the EU faces strict budget ceilings which complicate efforts to meet Portugal's request for aid to restructure its textile industry. France insists on a guarantee that its farmers will not have to take more land out of production because of Gatt. This could be very costly if Brussels has under estimated agriculture output over the next six years. EU summit, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 10 Trade ministers meet, Page 26</p>

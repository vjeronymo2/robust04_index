			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Farmer's Viewpoint: Mr Boardman hopes for a season to be jolly - Britain's only professional grower finds the holly business profitable but risky LONG BEFORE the word diversification had any obvious relevance to farming, a young friend of mine decided he would earn a bit of extra Christmas income from selling sprigs of holly from the trees in the hedgerows on his farm. He had cashed in on them modestly before when he had allowed gypsies to trim his trees for a few pound notes. But this time, he decided he would retail his crop in the local town and maximise his returns. Previous experience had taught him that the berries on his holly trees were particularly attractive to hungry birds. So, to deny them the opportunity of ruining his enterprise by eating his profits, he went out with his pruning shears while the trees were full of red berries in early November. It happened to be a very good year and he was thrilled at the quantity of full-berried holly he was able to cut. But there is no market for the stuff until a couple of weeks before Christmas, so to protect it against predatory birds he carefully carted it all down into the cellar of his old farmhouse. For the following few chilly weeks he took enormous pleasure in watching hordes of songbirds fluttering around his neighbours' holly trees. Every berry they ate, he thought, would increase the value of his cellarful of perfection. Indeed he spent many winter evenings calculating the size of the windfall that would be his and working out how to spend it. Eventually, in the middle of December, he judged the time was right to bring up the holly and make a killing on the market. But when he went to collect it from its hiding place he discovered to his horror that while he may have stopped the birds from eating his berries he had forgotten about the mice in his cellar. They had clearly enjoyed an early Christmas dinner and scoffed the lot. Last week I visited a professional holly grower. Indeed he claims to be the only one in Britain. His holly trees were an imaginative gift, in 1938, from his late father. He has over 1,000 of them on 3 acres of his 200-acre (80-hectare) fruit and arable farm and he can identify and name in excess of 100 different holly species that are growing there. His name is Peter Boardman and his farm overlooks the valley of the Ant at How Hill, one of the most beautiful spots in the Norfolk Broads. Throughout his life he has studied holly in Britain and abroad. He has propagated dozens of different varieties, both the plain green-leaved and variegated, and many imported from other countries, in an experimental corner of his farm near the house. He talks knowledgeably about them; about the need for a few male, non-berry bearing trees in a plantation to pollinate the females, which are the ones with berries, and the fact that it takes 15 years for a holly tree to produce a viable amount of holly to cut and market. Even then there is no guarantee that the trees will produce a full-berried crop each year. He too has to cut his vulnerable holly early to avoid problems with hungry birds. But careful observation over many years has shown that only a few varieties are attractive to them before Christmas, so these are always cut first. And Mr Boardman's professional way to cut holly and keep it fresh and bright until the market is ready for it is in a sealed, mouse-free cold store. Once Christmas spirit begins to flow, the red-berried sprigs are brought out, packed in cardboard boxes (of the type usually used for chrysanthemums) and sent off to wholesale markets around the country. Many go to the New Covent Garden market at Nine Elms in London and to the new Spitalfields market. Each box holds about 9 lb of holly in a good year. That is to say when there are plenty of berries, for they are far heavier than the wood and the leaves. Mr Boardman expects to receive something over Pounds 1 a lb from the wholesaler and hopes to harvest a crop of about 1 tonne an acre. But where does the compulsion to bring expensive, prickly vegetation into our houses at Christmas time originate? Apparently it comes from a mixture of pagan and Christian traditions and dates back, at least, to the druids. They believed its evergreen characteristic meant that the sun never deserted the holly tree and that it was a sacred plant. It was therefore their custom to decorate their houses with holly so that woodland spirits might take refuge in it from the rigours of winter. On the other hand, some say that holly is a corruption of a Holy in Christian terms. Moreover the German word for holly is Christdorn and it is symbolic of the crown of thorns worn by Jesus at Calvary. The berries, the legend goes, take their red colour from Christ's blood. Some of the superstitions associated with holly, however, are rather more secular. For instance, in some parts of England and Germany it is believed that if rough, prickly holly is brought into a family house the husband will dominate the home for the year ahead. If the holly has smooth leaves and few prickles, however, the wife will rule. Inevitably holly is claimed to have medicinal properties. 'A dozen ripe but undried berries eaten in the morning', an ancient herbal states, 'will expel wind and is good for colic'. And American Indians were said to make a kind of purgative tea with the berries. Even more horrific to contemplate was the recommendation that to be soundly thrashed with holly branches was the finest possible cure for chilblains. At least, I suspect, it would stop a sufferer complaining about them ever again. These days medicinal markets do not feature in Peter Boardman's budgets. He restricts his holly sales to the Christmas period for harmless commemorative wreaths and decoration. But is it profitable? On the face of it a potential gross return of well over Pounds 2,000 an acre seems attractive. But as Mr Boardman points out, it is high risk. For some years there are no berries and therefore no sales. It is very labour-intensive and the prickles make cutting rather uncomfortable work. The market is entirely seasonal and a very short season at that and there is a 15 year wait, following planting, before there is any return at all. His greatest competition comes from what I will politely call itinerant entrepreneurs, who strip and often damage trees, sometimes with permission and sometimes without, in order to make a fast buck. But the fact that he alone in the UK has a professional holly garden, and that a small one, is eloquent testimony to the fact that there is not enough money in it to make it a reliable farming diversification.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Technology: Good ideas stay out of the drain - A programme which aims to close the gap between inspiration and profit In the endless debate about British industrial performance and its gradual decline relative to other countries, there is rarely any complaint about a shortage of ideas. The problem lies not so much in inventiveness as in the ability to make money out of new products and technologies. 'We're actually a small and very inventive country,' says Sir Ronald Oxburgh, rector of Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, part of London University. 'It could be argued that we're almost too inventive for our own good.' Whether the fault lies in lack of money, a cultural and educational bias against industry or an unwillingness by enough companies to take risks, there are numerous examples of UK ideas that have been successfully exploited abroad. To help close the gap between inspiration and eventual profits, Imperial College has embarked on a venture which it believes is unique among British universities. Called IC Parc, it is a partnership between Imperial's own research staff and resources and companies such as British Airways, British Telecommunications and ICL (the UK-based computer subsidiary of Japan's Fujitsu). Its purpose is to find solutions for the complex computer needs of its clients stretching into the next century. Barry Richards, director of IC Parc and professor of computing science at the college, says it was set up 'to remove the problem of a good idea which doesn't go forward'. IC Parc works on medium-term problems - such as complex aircraft scheduling for BA, data delivery for the videoconferencing and other visual broadcast services planned by BT, and telepublishing (with text stored digitally) - which companies understand but need extra help to solve. 'IC Parc is seen as addressing the task of ensuring that ideas don't go down the drain or across the Atlantic,' he adds. It focuses on the development of advanced software in areas of vital importance for future applications of information technology: planning, scheduling and decision support. Launched last month and arising out of Imperial's computer forum linking academia and industry, it stresses the establishment of strong relationships with the partner companies, which it calls technology clients. Catherine Griffiths, a research fellow at IC Parc, says the forum showed 'companies had special needs that were not being addressed'. Their problems were of a complexity that could not be simply solved by consultants. Solutions have to be developed in such a way that they can be integrated easily into companies' differing organisations. 'Some companies are very clear about their problems,' says Richards. 'In other cases, they say 'we know broadly what we want to achieve in the medium term but we're not clear how to do that'. It's one thing to conceive what technology might be useful and another to make something out of that technology and work out how to apply it. You have to know the company very well and assess the likely impact.' BA, for example, knows it will be scheduling aircraft in the future, says Griffiths. 'They want to know how to do it better; they want to build on the need that they have.' Bill Teather, BA's head of information management, is enthusiastic about IC Parc's potential benefit for the airline and other companies. 'For a university to organise itself so it can present a business-oriented front to business - as a planning rather than a computer department - makes a tremendous difference for the senior managers in the airline by helping them understand what is on offer.' For BA, IC Parc offers the opportunity to schedule aircraft in an even more complex way than at present. 'We have enormous assets in our aircraft,' says Teather. 'A small percentage rise in aircraft utilisation can save money and help us deliver customer service better.' If aircraft have to be rescheduled because of bad weather, for example, the new software systems being developed at IC Parc could enable BA to do this more efficiently by taking into account a greater range of factors (including other flight schedules and passenger connections) than at present. 'This offers potentially the next step change in how to tackle planning problems,' he says. 'It should allow us to do what we do now more generally  -to do it on a bigger scale.' Teather hopes such software solutions can also be applied to other scheduling tasks such as the deployment of maintenance staff in airports. 'There are complicated scheduling problems for which IC Parc is in a position to provide general solutions as opposed to specific home-grown ones which can be expensive and need lots of changes to meet different situations,' explains Teather. The question of scalability is a big problem in innovation, not just in the IT field. What works in a limited environment may not translate easily to the wider practical world. Sir Ronald recalls from his days as chief scientific adviser with the Ministry of Defence that some of the biggest problems arose with software. Systems which worked beautifully in small-scale demonstrations could throw up new problems when developed on a much bigger scale. 'You're building systems that are too big for individuals to get their minds round,' he says.</p>

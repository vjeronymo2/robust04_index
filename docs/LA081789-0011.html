			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  ABOUT WINE: OAK IS TRENDY, NOT ALWAYS TASTY  </P> <P> John Parducci, one of California's greatest wine makers and a man who does not  prefer the taste of oak in his wines, once said, "If you want oak, go chew on a  two-by-four," or words to that effect.  </P> <P> Yet, Americans seem smitten by oak flavor in their Cabernet Sauvignons, in  their Chardonnays and even in wines that clearly would do as well with no oak  whatever. If this trend continues, I anticipate some day a winery selling a  bottle full of wine-dipped toothpicks.  </P> <P> Since Americans like the taste and smell of oak in their wine, wine makers  accommodate them. They oak the most delicate of wines and strip from them the  very elements that may give them some passing resemblance to the grapes from  which they were made.  </P> <P> To say which came first is a chicken-and-egg sort of argument. I can't be  certain whether Americans demanded oak so wine makers gave it to them, or  whether a few wine makers over-oaked a few wines, the wines received plaudits,  and that gave other wine makers a great idea.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Reminder  </P> <P> Either way, oak is here and it will be with us for at least the remainder of  the current generation -- a generation that has been carefully taught that if a  little oak is a good thing, a lumber factory is wonderful.  </P> <P> (This should be a reminder to us all that sometimes the wines that win the  highest praise are, after all, only one style of wine. And that equally as good  are wines with little or no oak that taste of the grape, but which, for lack of  "oomph," get none of their richly deserved praise.)  </P> <P> As a part-time wine evaluator, I have a debate on my hands with this recent  "more is better" school of wine making. On one hand, I realize that big,  full-flavored, oak-scented wines will be appreciated by a lot of people. So  when I'm evaluating wine, I understand and deal accordingly with such brooding  giants.  </P> <P> I, on the other hand, love wine that speaks of the grape, wines that offer  delicacy. And when I'm not evaluating wine but consuming it with dinner, I try  to ignore the big guys and go after subtlety.  </P> <P> A discussion of oak came up the other day when I was conducting a tasting of  newly released Merlots. A few of the wines clearly had a lot of oak, evidence  of aging in new French-made barrels, and a few of the tasters noted that the  oak character was a little strong for the fruit in the wine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ample Fruit  </P> <P> Other tasters admitted that the wines in question were oaky, sure, but that  they had ample amounts of fruit and would obviously be great wines with a few  years of bottle age.  </P> <P> The debate, I suggested, really centered on the individual's tolerance for oak.  If you were raised to like a lot of oak in wine, then you're drawn to oaky  wine; anything less is too simple, too innocuous. If you were raised,  conversely, on wine that smells and tastes like grapes, then oaky wine bores  you. It bores me.  </P> <P> But I am being won over to the oaky style of wine if only because California  (and to a degree Australia) does it so well. Oak can be a seductive element in  wine, especially great Cabernet Sauvignon, and after a while you can be smitten  by its charms.  </P> <P> But what is this element that intrigues us all so much? What does it smell like  and taste like?  </P> <P> That, unfortunately, is a difficult thing to pinpoint because putting into  words the precise aroma and flavor components of oak can't be done easily with  standard English terms. Moreover, there is the question of what kind of oak are  we talking about. There is French oak and there is American oak, and usually  they are miles apart in terms of flavor components.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Oak of Choice  </P> <P> French oak is the oak of choice in the fine wine districts of California, even  though it is far more expensive than the American variety -- at $400 a barrel  it's nearly twice as much as the domestic oak barrels.  </P> <P> French oak tends to give a subtler character when it is young; American oak is  a bit more pungent. But as barrels age, they become neutral and impart little  if any oak to wine. The life cycle of a wine barrel is about five years. After  that it's merely a vessel in which to hold wine, not impart character.  </P> <P> French oak can have a vanilla/chocolate kind of aroma and the perfume of it can  be heady. It lends to a red wine, especially, a kind of cedary tone and can  imply roasted nuts.  </P> <P> American oak aromas are more direct, more obvious. When American oak barrels  are used young and raw, a major component of the aroma of the wine that goes  into it is dill weed or pickle barrel. More faintly, it gives an impression of  pine, resin or green olives.  </P> <P> (The differences between these two oaks is more a product of their manufacture  than of the trees themselves, and if the inside of a barrel is toasted by fire,  the character of the barrel changes radically. But that's a story for another  day.)  </P> <P> The choice of which oak to use is often based on price. Most wine makers know  that French oak's character is more subtle and traditional and that Americans  tend to like French oak character in wine better than American oak.  </P> <P> However, the successes of some wineries that use American oak has persuaded  some wine makers that you can make an excellent wine with the less expensive  oak. (Or is this simply a rationalization?)  </P> <P> Historically, oak barrels were used to give red wine a more mature, developed  character, not mere oak flavor. In France, oak was used for centuries, before  stainless steel was invented, to mellow the wine before it was consumed. The  character that developed so intrigued wine lovers that it became a part of the  context in which wine was evaluated.  </P> <P> In the United States, large oak tanks and small oak barrels were used from the  start of the industry, in the 1850s, and by the latter part of the 19th  Century, Inglenook and Beaulieu in the Napa Valley had long established the  idea of aging wine in barrels. But again, not for a hit of oak, but as a means  of rasping off the rough edges of a new wine.  </P> <P> Beaulieu was one of the first wineries to use oak as a flavoring agent, but  soon after the end of Prohibition, when Andre Tchelistcheff joined BV to become  its wine master, that oak was still viewed as only a grace note, not a standout  element.  </P> <P> BV used American oak (it was then the only kind of oak used in this country),  but it did so with a clear understanding that the oak itself had a persona that  could blend with the fruit. Throughout the years, the "BV style" of Cabernet,  with its faint but still evident note of American oak, has convinced other wine  makers that such a regimen can make great wine.  </P> <P> But what some wine makers don't know is that the BV system is to use a tiny  amount of new oak each year, and it is new American oak that lends a wine such  pungency as to make it briney. Some wine makers have yet to understand this and  their use of new American oak gives their wines a too-dense oak character.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stunned With Its Charm  </P> <P> Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma was the first U.S. winery to use French oak and its  first release, a 1957 Chardonnay, was a revelation that stunned California  watchers with its charm.  </P> <P> Today, French oak is the standard by which classic Cabernets and Chardonnays  are judged. The fruit of a great wine enhanced by the roasted notes that come  from the slightly charred interior of a French oak barrel is a component some  tasters expect.  </P> <P> Those who choose to use American oak run the risk of creating controversial  wines, liked by some, detested by others for their exotic, non-traditional  characteristics.  </P> <P> In recent years, some smaller U.S. barrel producers have made their American  oak into barrels using French techniques, and the charring so common inside  French oak barrels is now seen as a component of some American oak barrels too.  </P> <P> Still, the evident American oak character found in the Zinfandels of DeLoach  and Ridge and the Cabernets of Ridge, Silver Oak, Kenwood and Fetzer is to some  people an eccentric and curious element that stands out as different.  </P> <P> If one wine seems to withstand the American oak treatment, it is Zinfandel,  that spicy and often intensely flavored wine whose violet- or cassis-like  elements seem enhanced by American oak's audacious pungency.  </P> <P> But when ZD in the Napa Valley began years ago to age its Chardonnay in  American oak, it created a love-or-hate wine. Recently, the 1987 Chardonnay of  New York State's Wagner Vineyards, which was fermented and aged in American  oak, created a similar impression. Some traditionalists feel the wine is awful.  Others who don't see the oak character as a flaw like it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stylish Pinot Noir  </P> <P> Robert Stemmler has won plaudits for a stylish Pinot Noir that is aged in  American oak, and others use American oak for other varieties.  </P> <P> However, in the last few years there has been a swing toward more use of French  oak. For instance, Kenwood and Fetzer, both innovative wine companies, are  slowly moving away from American oak and toward French. And Silver Oak makes a  Bonny's Vineyard Cabernet that is aged in half French and half American.  </P> <P> One reason for this is to capture the flavor profile the American consumer  seems to demand, even though the cost of the French oak barrel is so much  higher.  </P> <P> One winery that has made its reputation on grape flavor and not oak is the  Louis Martini Winery. Throughout the years, the red wines of this Napa Valley  property show well early and late, defying the critics who argue that such  "light style" wines don't age.  </P> <P> For those who like the taste of fruit from the grape without oak, a number of  wineries should be considered, not the least of which is the Parducci winery,  whose use of oak is minimal and the wines are excellent. Also, Callaway makes a  Chardonnay that is not aged in oak, and Rodney Strong, Fetzer, Buena Vista and  a host of others make Sauvignon Blancs that see no oak.  </P> <P> But oak seems to be an element that enhances many wines, notably Cabernets, and  although it is appealing, it is also giving a lot of newcomers to wine a false  sense of what great wine is. Instead of sensing the fruit, they get oak and  think that's the only way great wine is made.  </P> <P> And what that does is develop a whole generation of folks who think wine is  made from two-by-fours with grape juice added for flavor.  </P> <P> Wine of the Week: 1986 Orlando Jacob's Creek Cabernet Sauvignon ($6) -- This  wine continues to impress me. Made by the second largest winery in Australia,  it has perfect Cabernet character: fruit, a slight herbal tea hint and a  chocolaty-ness. The oak is muted and the tannin is soft enough for immediate  consumption, but since I first had it nine months ago it has improved.  </P></p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Some arithmetic for the UK Budget Benjamin Disraeli was one of the few political leaders who had to be cajoled into becoming chancellor of the exchequer. For, unlike his arch-rival William Gladstone, he did not think that fiscal arithmetic was his particular metier. He was finally persuaded by an old pro who said: 'They give you the figures.' Nowadays, they still give some figures to the chancellor. But the Treasury gives very skeletal indications to the public at large. So the annual Green Budget* produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, in conjunction with Goldman Sachs, is a godsend. For full value, it should be read together with the new Goldman Sachs UK Economics Analyst. The documents give chapter and verse for the case for some discretionary fiscal stimulus over and above the automatic recession-induced Budget deficit, which I outlined without commitment in last week's Viewpoint. The argument is that the strain of German unification requires unusually high interest rates on the part of the Bundesbank, to which Britain is held by the ERM. This special situation is said to justify some departure from medium-term guidelines. How is all this translated into terms of Budget arithmetic? The authors assume that there will be discretionary tax relaxations of Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn in the March 10 Budget - based not on any fine economic arithmetic but on a balance between what is politically required to resist pressure to leave the ERM or devalue and the need not to upset financial confidence. Over and above these somewhat modest tax adjustments, the Green Budget forecasts some upward slippage in public expenditure plans. The net result is expected to be an increase in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement from nearly Pounds 12bn in 1991-92 to Pounds 23bn in 1992-93, rising to a peak of Pounds 26bn in the following financial year, even if there are no further relaxations. How worried should we be about such deficit numbers? In terms of sterling, they are much higher than the ones which horrified the International Monetary Fund in its bail-out operation in the middle 1970s. Expressed as a proportion of gross domestic product, the picture is, however, different. The PSBR during the last year of the Labour government came to 5.5 per cent of GDP. According to the present projections, it will reach a peak of 4 per cent in 1993-94 before turning down towards 3 per cent in the following year. Thus the Conservative aim of a balanced Budget seems out of reach over the next parliament - although not necessarily over the whole business cycle, if we are back with old-fashioned cycles lasting a decade. The Green Budget attributes to Labour the aim of a 3 per cent PSBR. Even with this latitude, a Labour government would have the greatest difficulty in making net additions to public spending (above those financed by tax increases) at least until the last half of a new parliament. Whether it arises because the Conservatives are boxed in, or because Labour has freely chosen it, is a 3 per cent PSBR outlook sustainable? Paradoxically, the more credible the exchange rate mechanism parity, the more choice a government can have in how much to borrow before facing a run on its currency. Nevertheless, not all choices are equally sensible. To keep the public-sector debt to GDP ratio stable over the medium term, the PSBR should, on Green Budget arithmetic, be no higher than 2 per cent of GDP. To achieve the more prudent objective of a stable level of government net assets, privatisation proceeds should not be counted. This leaves a PSBR aim of 1 per cent of GDP on present definitions - nearer to Conservative objectives. The Green Budget draws comfort from the fact that even with a 3 per cent PSBR, public sector debt levels would not rise rapidly and start from relatively low levels. But that is hardly a reason for moving off in the wrong direction. More borrowing now means higher taxes later for a given real national income. These debt servicing considerations would, however, deserve to be laid aside if more government borrowing allowed a sustainable increase in the real national income which we could not otherwise have. Would it? The Green Budget argument needs some unravelling here. The underlying logic seems to be the following. In the authors' very considered view, the present savings ratio is likely to fall. Nevertheless, the authors admit that they may be wrong. In that case, an attempt to slash government borrowing, even in the medium term, 'could well leave the economy very short of demand'. This is the core of the economic argument for a sizable and continuing fiscal stimulus. But is it valid? Like most fiscalist arguments, it leaves out at least two other possibilities. First, it ignores the likelihood of monetary policy coming to the rescue in the medium term. The need for high real interest rates in Germany is not permanent. Eventually the Bundesbank will have to reduce rates to nearer normal levels. But there is a more specific UK point. If a country or region has a surplus of savings relative to requirements, the normal outlet is overseas investment. This means a current payments surplus to finance a capital outflow. That is how Japan and the old German Federal Republic managed to maintain high employment even when savings were also high. Anyone who supposes that the UK could never run such surpluses, or could never do so without devaluation, is quite excessively time-bound and has forgotten the payments surpluses as recently as the early 1980s, which were then attributed to oil. * * * What would I do? I am still not reconverted to fiscal tuning. But if some action has to be taken, it should be directed towards investment, private or public, and any tax cuts should be strictly temporary with a built-in cancellation date. How should such tax cuts be allocated? It would cost Pounds 2bn just to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p. In my view, this would be the worst possible option. There is no comparison with a similar 1p tax cut made before the 1987 election when the public sector was moving towards surplus rather than large deficit. Even in political terms, there would, as the Green Budget says, be the risk of the government 'appearing to panic and attempting to buy votes'. For about the same amount, personal tax allowances could be increased by some 10 per cent over and above indexation. It would also bring far more benefit to people with lower to middle incomes. The IFS points out for good measure: 'Labour would find it politically hard to reverse such a change. But if it did not, it would find its scope for increasing public spending thereby reduced.' The IFS rightly goes out of its way to take a swipe at Labour's favoured idea of a reduced rate of tax band. 'It cannot be written too frequently if the objective is to reduce the tax bills of the least well off, raising allowances is always more effective: it is better to be taken out of tax altogether rather than face a reduction in the amount of tax paid.' It is a defect of an unreformed two-party system that Labour is taken much too much at face value as friend of the worst-off. The Green Budget concludes that relief on non-domestic rates would do more faster for hard-pressed businesses than any further cuts in corporation tax. But better than either would be strictly temporary measures to encourage investment. If the expiry date were taken seriously it would not interfere with the structural changes in the 1984 Budget designed to remove distortions. Neither the Green Budget nor anyone else is saying much about indirect taxes. This is hardly surprising, as a 1 percentage point cut in VAT would cost Pounds 1.7bn. The 'Regulator' allows the chancellor to vary indirect taxes at any time. Unfortunately, when used in the 1960s and 1970s, nothing was said about later reversals. An indirect tax reduction would, however, have its maximum effect in encouraging spending in the shops if consumers knew it was to expire soon - perhaps before the end of the calendar year. I would keep it in reserve as an emergency measure. *Tax Options for 1992, 7 Ridgmount Street, London, WC1E 7AE, price Pounds 6.  ------------------------------------- UK TRADE: TEENAGERS' GUIDE  ------------------------------------- Volume % change (exc oil and erratics)                Imports     Exports  ------------------------------------- 1986             +7.1        +2.5 1987             +8.9        +7.5 1988            +14.6        +4.8 1989             +7.3        +9.3 1990             +0.2        +7.4 1991             -2.5        +2.7 1991 1st half*   -4.6        +3.7 1991 2nd half*   +4.1        +3.1  ------------------------------------- *Over previous six months  ------------------------------------- Source: CSO  -------------------------------------</p>

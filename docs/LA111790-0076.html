			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION III;  </P> <P> SMITH, ESPERANZA ROLL PAST ALHAMBRA  </P> <P> Esperanza High School's Jarod Smith rushed for 174 yards on just eight carries  and scored three touchdowns to lead the Aztecs to a 47-0 romp over Alhambra  Friday in the first round of the Division III playoffs.  </P> <P> Esperanza will face the winner of tonight's game between Crespi and Leuzinger  in the second round.  </P> <P> The Moors (4-7), the only team with a sub-.500 record in the Division III  bracket, did not seriously challenge Esperanza (11-0), the No. 1 seed, after  Smith took his first handoff from quarterback Keith McDonald and raced 85 yards  for a touchdown.  </P> <P> When the Moors attempted to punt on their next series of downs, the ball was  snapped over the head of the punter and recovered by Esperanza at the Alhambra  four. Garrick Emry scored on a two-yard run two plays later to put the Aztecs  on top, 15-0.  </P> <P> Things didn't get any better for Alhambra. On their next series, the Moors  attempted to punt, but again the ball was snapped high and squirted through the  end zone for a safety that gave Esperanza a 17-0 advantage.  </P> <P> McDonald (five of 10 for 41 yards) passed for one touchdown of 16 yards to Reid  Pullen.

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POSTING OF GUARDSMEN AT BORDER DRAWS CRITICISM OF LATINO GROUPS  </P> <P> The 36 National Guardsmen who have been posted at the Otay Mesa border crossing  to aid U. S. Customs officials as a help in stopping drug smuggling drew harsh  criticism Thursday from some Latino community members. They called the move a  step toward militarization of the border.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the National Guard and the U. S. Customs Service refused to  provide details on how long the operation will last or exactly how many troops  were posted, saying it would compromise security. The unarmed guardsmen have  been inspecting containers and truck cargo, not private cars, in the joint  operation.  </P> <P> The Mexican consul general in San Diego, Hermilo Lopez-Bassols, was in Mexico  City on business but other community members voiced anger at the posting of  troops. The planned deployment had already drawn sharp criticism in Mexico.  </P> <P> "Our organization has been opposed to the militarization of the border. This is  a first step," said Irma Castro of the Chicano Federation. "We have to deal  with Customs and (the Border Patrol), why does the National Guard have to be  there doing the Customs Service's job? What kind of message is this going to  send to both visitors to California as well as residents?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increased Congestion  </P> <P> Roberto Martinez is director of the U. S.-Mexico Border Program for the  American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit organization that monitors  immigration policies and advocates immigrant rights. "To take this kind of step  toward militarization at the border is not only going to strain U. S.-Mexico  relations. . . . We don't need another agency on the border that we have to  monitor," Martinez said.  </P> <P> Carolyn Goding, a customs house broker for International Automated Brokers,  said the posting of the National Guard had increased congestion and upset  truckers. Her company completes the paper work for importers. She estimated the  wait for some truckers at two hours.  </P> <P> The U.S.-Mexico border, stretching for almost 2,000 miles, is considered a  prime entry point for an array of illegal drugs, notably cocaine, marijuana and  heroin.  </P> <P> Maj. Steve Mensik, a spokesman for the state National Guard in Sacramento, said  the purpose of the operation is "to put more eye and hands in the searching  aspect to stem the flow of narcotics."  </P> <P> Mike Ritz, a spokesman for the National Guard in Los Angeles, said: "The United  States government finds it necessary to step up efforts at drug interdiction,  and the use of the National Guard is simply one way to assist U. S. Customs in  the effort to quell the influx of drugs into the U. S."  </P> <P> Mensik said the troops could be moved, at the direction of Customs officials  from the border to the ports of Long Beach or Los Angeles, two other areas  where National Guardsmen have been recently deployed to combat drug smuggling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A First for California  </P> <P> "They arrived (at the Otay crossing) about Sunday or Monday. They're going to  be in various places throughout the month. I'm reluctant to say they're going  to be right there for the whole month," Mensik said. "Because of the fluidness  of the operation, the number's going to vary. It could be 50 to 60 today or  four tomorrow."  </P> <P> This is the first time the National Guard has been involved in container  inspection in California, but similar anti-drug smuggling programs have been  run in Florida and Texas. Mensik said the program will be evaluated when it is  over.  </P> <P> There is no plan to arm the soldiers, Mensik said. "There's no need for it."  </P> <P> "The only thing we will be inspecting are containers and truck cargo . . . that  may free up more Customs people to spend more time with the you and me driving  through in our private automobile."  </P> <P> The Otay Mesa, Long Beach and Los Angeles operations have been federally  funded. Mensik said Congress has appropriated $40 million for the National  Guard "to support drug interdiction and eradication" around the country.  Several other states plan to run similar operations, he said.  </P> <P> U. S. Customs spokesman John Miller said about 800 National Guardsmen have been  activated in eight states to fight drug smuggling. About 300 National Guardsmen  are now deployed in California, he said.  </P></p>

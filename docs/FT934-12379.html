			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Thatcher believes government has failed to honour debt to the UDM LADY THATCHER believes the government has failed to honour its debt to the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which opposed the National Union of Mineworkers' strike of 1985, Roland Rudd writes. In tonight's episode of the BBC TV programme Thatcher: The Downing Street Years, she says: 'I understand now that those marvellous working miners, the Democratic Union, feel a sense of betrayal. 'Things have happened since I left, to the coal mines and those working miners, that I would never have countenanced had I been there.' The threat of further coal closures will be discussed today during a Commons debate on the industry. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday said the 10 coal mines most at risk are financially viable. Evidence from British Coal sources confirmed that 10 of the pits the government claimed to have reprieved last March were down for closure or mothballing, he said. The 10 were: Wearmouth, Tyne and Wear; Prince of Wales, W Yorks; Bentley, Frickley, Hatfield and Kiveton Park, all S Yorks; Point of Ayr, N Wales; Bilsthorpe and Calverton, Notts; and Silverdale, Staffs.</p>

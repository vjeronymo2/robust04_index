Mr Bolter resigned after an internal inquiry into the reasons for the bill. He told the inquiry he should have been more careful in checking what he thought was an attractive tender for the work. He said he was not aware BNF had been billed for the work by the contractor, who also worked for the company. He added: 'Ignorance is no excuse for what has happened.'</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Neste swings back into black after shake-up Neste, the state-owned Finnish oil and petrochemicals group, staged a dramatic return to the black in the first four months of the year, rebounding to a FM210m (Dollars 39m) pre-tax profit from a loss of FM719m in the same period last year. The turnround reflected a big restructuring plan instigated last year to halt a succession of losses and prepare the group, at present 97 per cent owned by the state, for partial privatisation. The government intends to keep a majority stake in Neste, but will eventually sell off the rest of the company. Group sales in the four months to the end of April fell to FM17.9bn from FM24.6bn, following the merger of Neste's petrochemicals and polyolefins operations in a 50:50 joint venture with Norway's Statoil, called Borealis. Turnover was also reduced as Neste trimmed its trading activities to ensure trading operations did not account for more than their historical 50 per cent share of group turnover. Neste intends to focus increasingly on oil and energy. Low crude oil prices held down profitability for Neste's oil production, and refining margins were tight. But operating profit was up sharply at FM443m, compared with FM229m last time, and financial costs tumbled to FM233m from FM948m, producing the turnround at the pre-tax level.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARNESS BACKERS SUE BOARD FOR POMONA DATES  </P> <P> Lloyd Arnold and Chris Bardis, the two leading proponents of harness racing in  California, have sued the California Horse Racing Board for racing dates at  Fairplex Park in Pomona.  </P> <P> In the suit, filed in Sacramento, Los Alamitos Racing Assn., of which Arnold  and Bardis are owners, asks the court to overturn a decision by the CHRB that  denies the group the right to run harness racing three nights a week at  Fairplex between Oct. 26 and Jan. 12.  </P> <P> The CHRB denied the racing dates at the last meeting, saying that it impacted  thoroughbred racing, which uses Fairplex as a training site. The proposal to  race was supported by Ed Allred, who runs a quarter horse meeting at Los  Alamitos, but a group that represents quarter horse owners and trainers opposed  the licensing. The proposed Fairplex harness meeting would run at the same time  as the Los Alamitos quarter horse meeting.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that the denial of a license would effectively kill harness  racing in California as a racing and breeding proposition. It also says the Los  Angeles County Fair, which owns Fairplex, could profit by as much as $750,000.  The fair is guaranteed $500,000. The state would also benefit in handle.  </P> <P> The case will be heard Wednesday. JOHN CHERWA  </P></p>

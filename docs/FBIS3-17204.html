Deputy director Martynov also said that his enterprise and  another company, whose name he did not disclose, has began to  produce a physical amplifier (metathrone) Miranda, developed on  the basis of fundamental achievements in the field of  psychotronics.    The weekly conducted an independent research, which revealed  that work indeed had been done at the plant to produce  metathrones, which are regarded as a side branch of psychotronic  weapons. Such devices have long been used in the American  industry to locate and establish the causes of any systemic  failures.    The weekly cites specialists as saying that "on September  24,  1990 an agreement was signed between the Central Intelligence  Agency (CIA) of the United States and the KGB of the USSR on  joint research in the field of psychotronics".    The weekly said however that cooperation in this field has  not developed.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Olivetti registers smaller than expected loss OLIVETTI, the troubled Italian computers and office equipment group, yesterday clarified uncertainties over its 1991 results by reporting a preliminary loss of around L290bn (Dollars 242.2m). That is appreciably smaller than the L380bn suggested by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the company's chairman and controlling shareholder, earlier this week. Mr De Benedetti said losses for 1991 would be equivalent to around 4.4 per cent of last year's group sales of L8,600bn. Discrepancies arise in the allocation of extraordinary costs stemming from the company's restructuring plan, announced in late 1991, but only being put into effect this year. Olivetti said the L290bn loss included the cost of 7,000 job cuts in 1991, but excluded any provision for the restructuring announced last November. The company also revealed that earnings at the operating level had been around break-even last year. A final earnings figure for 1991 will depend on how extraordinary expenses linked to the restructuring plan are allocated between the 1991 and 1992 financial years, a decision that will be taken by Olivetti's board in April. Olivetti gave no indication of the size of allocation necessary for the current restructuring programme, which envisages 2,500 job cuts and two plant closures in Italy, as well as unspecified redundancies and factory closures abroad. However, even in the extreme event of all the restructuring costs being attributed to the 1992 accounts, the L290bn loss is still considerably higher than analysts had expected before Mr De Benedetti's statement. Meanwhile, talks were continuing between the company and union leaders on the restructuring programme and the possibility of closer collaboration between Olivetti and the public sector.</p>

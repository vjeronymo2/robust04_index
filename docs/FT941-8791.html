			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Aid workers 'at risk' in Bosnia air strikes: UNHCR officials warn staff would be compromised as would a programme that keeps 4.2m people alive For the past 18 months more than 400 truck drivers have criss-crossed the former Yugoslavia delivering 73,200 tons of food and clothing a month to 4.2m people under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Each day, they receive reports from UNHCR offices scattered throughout Bosnia and decide whether to set out or not. Sometimes the weather forces them to abandon their run. 'When it snows, we cannot see the mines,' said Ms Sylvana Foa, the spokesperson for the UNHCR in Geneva. For instance, last Tuesday a convoy was due to travel to eastern Mostar in western Hercegovina which Croat forces have bombarded for the past year. 'There were no deliveries going into Mostar on Tuesday. The mines were covered by snow,' she said. Other days, the drivers, who travel in convoys backed by UN armoured personnel carriers, hear from the local UNHCR offices about road blocks, intimidation, food stolen from depots, shots fired at the trucks, colleagues being attacked, sometimes shot dead, and endless delays in obtaining or extending papers required to pass through Serb- and Croat-held territories across Bosnia. As the deadline looms for the Nato ultimatum, under which Serb-held positions around Sarajevo will be hit if all heavy weapons are not withdrawn or placed under UN supervision, UNHCR officials are becoming anxious. If the air strikes lead to any retaliation on the ground, which could seriously disrupt the steady flow of food, clothing and medicines, more people will die, they say. 'The point is that if the UN gives the go-ahead for air attacks, and the UN will lose its impartiality. Aid workers will be at risk, since they are working under the auspices of a UN agency,' a British military expert said. The UNHCR has some contingency plans. 'The most inessential staff will be withdrawn from the region,' said Ms Foa. 'We will try and keep the logistics and radio staff on the ground. But we will have to take each day as it comes,' she added. But no one can predict how Serb local commanders will react if Nato strikes the hills surrounding Sarajevo. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, is already distancing himself from taking responsibility in the event any aid workers are attacked. 'I assure you, the aid will continue, and it will be allowed to continue. But I cannot tell you what will happen if I do not have control on the local level,' he said in Geneva last week. 'Much will depend on what kind of messages will come from the top Serbian leadership,' a UNHCR official said. General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army, has already suggested that the lives of foreigners will not be safe if air strikes take place. In an interview in the Belgrade-based Interfju weekly magazine, he said: 'We are openly telling everyone: In case of air strikes, all foreigners who find themselves on our territory will become hostages,' he said. 'Those include International Red Cross and (UN relief) workers, and sadly, journalists too,' Gen Milovanovic was quoted as saying. The aid, sometimes interpreted as serving as a pretext for maintaining the arms embargo, or blocking any outside military intervention, is, however one of the unacknowledged 'successes', despite the terror and violence in Bosnia. In that republic alone, more than 2.7m people are dependent on aid which is distributed from seven centres throughout Bosnia, involving more than 600 UNHCR staff, and a further 1.8m throughout the other republics. Many will be unable to return because entire villages and towns have been destroyed, or 'ethnically cleansed'. 'Sometimes people forget that the aid is keeping people alive,' said Ms Foa. But she added that the monthly food requirement continued to fall short of deliveries from donor countries. For instance, last December, the city of northern Bosnian city of Banja Luka required 3,400 tons. Less than 2,700 tons was delivered. UNHCR officials reckon that Bosnia requires 46,413 tons a month. The shortfall already exceeds 15,000 tons. Any slowdown, or disruption of the aid would not only lead to a worsening refugee crisis, UNHCR officials warned this week. 'Europe will be saddled with a refugee problem for a very long time,' said Ms Foa. It would also facilitate 'ethnic cleansing'. Civilians would lose the will to remain in villages cut off by food and this would facilitate 'ethnic cleansing' and consolidate territorial gains by all sides, they warned.</p>

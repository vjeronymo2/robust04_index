			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Vendome offers a place for luxury THE RAREFIED world of European luxury goods caught the scent of a new name yesterday with the christening of Vendome, the planned holding company for the portfolio of luxury brands owned by Richemont of Switzerland. Cartier, Piaget, Mont Blanc, Dunhill and Karl Lagerfeld will be injected into Vendome, which is to be listed in London and Luxembourg if a restructuring of Richemont's subsidiaries is approved by shareholders. Analysts estimated the new company could be valued at up to Pounds 3bn, making it a member of the FT-SE 100 index in London, even though luxury brands are out of favour because of recession. Richemont, controlled by the Rupert family of South Africa, yesterday spelt out its plan to simplify its complex group structure by splitting off the tobacco arm, Rothmans International, and combining the two luxury goods businesses, Luxco and Dunhill Holdings, into Vendome. Dunhill is at present a 57 per cent owned subsidiary of Rothmans. Shareholders in Rothmans and Dunhill Holdings are being offered cash and shares in the new tobacco and luxury goods companies. Richemont said the new structure would lead to savings and improved marketing. 'We are trying to get the operational structure to reflect operational necessities,' said Mr Johann Rupert, managing director. The restructuring will also bring to an end Dunhill Holdings' life as a publicly listed company. The company, which was set up by Alfred Dunhill exactly 100 years ago, was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1923. Lord Douro, Dunhill's chairman, said Vendome's individual brands would continue to be managed separately and the disappearance of Dunhill's listing was not significant. 'We believe Vendome is one of the most distinguished group of brand names. It would be immodest to say more than that,' he said. The new company is named after Paris's upmarket Place Vendome. Mr Robert Hocq, the entrepreneur who reunited the divided house in the 1970s, also used a company named Vendome Holdings, which later became Cartier Monde. Richemont has controlled Cartier since 1984. Offer details, Page 10 Lex, Page 24</p>

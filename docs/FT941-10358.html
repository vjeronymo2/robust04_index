			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Turkey's economic crisis deepens Turkey's economic crisis deepened yesterday in the wake of last month's devaluation, with the government forced to raise rates on official paper to a record 125 per cent, amid continued division over economic policy. With many bankers arguing for a further realignment of the lira, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, is facing signs of internal opposition with her own True Path party (DYP), anxious that the economic problems should not affect the party's performance in next month's municipal elections. In a move clearly aimed at appeasing her critics, the prime minister has appointed Mr Cemil Dogan, an old ally of President Suleyman Demirel, as a new co-ordinating minister on the economy, and announced creation of a new money management board. Turkey devalued by 12 per cent last month after a two-week run on its currency, triggered by the announcement that Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two leading credit rating agencies, were downgrading Turkish risk. The crisis resulted in the resignation of central bank governor Bulent Gultekin. A replacement has still to be found. Indeed, when Mrs Ciller moved to offer the job to Mr Zekeriya Yildirim - which the markets would have welcomed - she was forced to retract after reports that he had had consultations with Mr Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the main opposition Motherland party. Yesterday's sharp increase in Treasury bill rates, which compares with 78 per cent on January 19 for one-year paper, is clearly aimed at sucking in excess lira liquidity which overhangs the market.</p>

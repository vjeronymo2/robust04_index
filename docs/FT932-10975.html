			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Question mark hangs over Matsushita's largesse: Costly Philips venture buy-out will strain company THERE was an echo of the good old days about Matsushita's announcement last week that it was finding billions of yen to buy out Philips of the Netherlands from their ailing semiconductor joint venture. Matsushita will pay Y185bn (Pounds 1.08bn) - in cash by the end of the month  -for Philips' 35 per cent stake in the venture which ranks 10th in the world league of semiconductor producers, well behind the industry's US leaders. Only two and a half years ago Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics group, paid Dollars 6.1bn (Pounds 3.96bn) for MCA, the Hollywood film company, in a bold move to marry entertainment to its core televisions, video recorders and audio equipment business. The scale of the transactions is their only similarity. The MCA acquisition seemed to symbolise Matsushita's determination to internationalise and buy growth. The purchase of Philips' stake in their joint-venture, the Matsushita Electronics Corporation, heavily involved in commodity chip production, seems to have been largely forced on a reluctant Matsushita by Philips' desire to get out. Philips' motivation was financial; the only surprise is that the Dutch company is getting such a hefty sum for its shares. But the more intriguing question is why Matsushita, facing a 60 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, was prepared to pay so much for what appears so little? The company faces a sharp downturn in Japanese consumer spending, compounded by loss of export competitiveness after the yen's rise against the US dollar. This downturn has amplified structural changes in its main consumer markets. About a fifth of Matsushita's sales come from television and video recorders. Markets for these products in developed countries are saturated. New products such as high-definition television have not taken off. The disappointing record of HDTV is one reason why Matsushita's purchase of MCA has been less successful than hoped. The scale and complexity of Matsushita's operations - it has 315 subsidiaries - combined with its conservative management mean it is unlikely to cut costs or restructure aggressively, in spite of a management reshuffle. Indeed, the deal with Philips may add to the impression of Matsushita being driven by events. Mr Dudley Eustace, Philips' finance director, declined to say yesterday how large a book profit the Dutch company could expect on the deal. Analysts, who estimate Philips stands to show a gain of between Fl 500m (Pounds 180m) and Fl 1bn, are confident the group will now be able to report a substantial profit for 1993. The partnership, established in 1952, has not brought Philips the access to Asian markets it once hoped for. By contrast, benefits for Matsushita are harder to fathom. Matsushita says the venture, with plants in Europe, the US, south east Asia and China, was suffering from cumbersome decision making. It thought Philips may have been wary of sanctioning heavy investment. By severing the partnership Matsushita will now be able to compete for semiconductor business in Europe against Philips. Matsushita is in a much stronger financial position than Philips. But the deal will add to growing strain on its balance sheet. Its gearing for last year is likely to be above 40 per cent. In addition, Matsushita will now have to carry all the burden of investment in MEC, when other semiconductor makers are increasingly relying on alliances to cut costs and risks. Several factors could explain why Matsushita decided to pay such a high price for the stake. Matsushita may see something in MEC no one else can spot. Matsushita may have feared Philips would obstruct the venture's development or worse try to sell its stake to a competitor. Far more important for both companies are collaborations in new products such as compact disc interactive. But some fear Matsushita has not learned from the experience of paying so much for MCA. As one western analyst in Tokyo put it: 'They still think they are rich enough to pay too much for assets they want. It could have been strategic but it could be that old habits die hard.'

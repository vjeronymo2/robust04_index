			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Expressway  construction in south China's Guangdong Province is attracting  attention from big financial groups abroad.    So far, more than four billion U.S. dollars from abroad has  been put into or has been promised to 15 ongoing projects.    A 120-km expressway costing 1.2 billion U.S. dollars will  link this capital of the province with the boom town of  Shenzhen. The project has already received 1.56 billion Hong  Kong dollars from the Hong Kong-based Hopewell Holdings Ltd and  a loan of 800 million U.S. dollars from international  consortiums.    Li Ka-shing, a Hong Kong tycoon, has injected 100 million  U.S. Dollars into the building of a freeway from Shenzhen to  Shantou, which will need 2.5 billion yuan in total.    Two Malaysian companies, the Ho Hup Construction Company  Berhad and United Engineers Berhad, have poured 6.6 billion yuan  into the building of a 188-km expressway from Yangjiang to  Zhanjiang.    Li Shaofeng, general manager of the province's expressway  construction company, said that the market outlook is good as  the number of vehicles has been soaring in Guangdong in recent  years.    The province had 3.27 million vehicles in 1993, compared  with  only 747,000 in 1985.    Low risks and high returns in the projects have also enticed  overseas investors, he said.    An expressway running from Guangzhou to Foshan, the  province's first foreign-financed road, has a daily income of  300,000 yuan, tenfold the figure four years ago.    Meanwhile, the province is to raise foreign capital through  new measures. For instance, foreigners will be allowed to  operate freeways for limited periods.    By the end of this century the province is expected to have  over 1,300 km of expressways.</p>

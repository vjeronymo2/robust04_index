In a statement to SPA after the session, Information  Minister  'Ali Hasan al-Sha'ir said: The custodian of the two holy mosques  opened the session with a comprehensive analysis of some issues  concerning current events at the Arab and international level.    Through a critical review of the current situation in the  Arab arena, and in light of new developments in the course of  the Palestinian issue and on the basis of the persistent  historical role played by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia devotedly  and sincerely in support of the Palestinian people since the  painful tragedy of their suffering started until now, the king  made clear to the council the nature of the meeting held  recently between him and Yasir 'Arafat, president of the State  of Palestine and chairman of the PLO's Executive Committee. He  said that he had wished success for the positive initiative  'Arafat had undertaken and for the attempts that were still  being made and persisting on the peace path to achieve autonomy  for the Palestinian people in the territory of their homeland in  the form that would satisfy them and which they would view as  appropriate to their aspirations.

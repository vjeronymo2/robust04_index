			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Stakes raised in Andreotti hearing MR Giulio Andreotti has raised the stakes in his battle with magistrates seeking to remove his parliamentary immunity so that he can be questioned for allegedly consorting with the Mafia. By accusing the Palermo magistrates of conspiring to discredit him with cooked evidence from former Mafia 'supergrasses', the Italian life senator and former prime minister is no longer merely protecting his own reputation. He has placed the 23-member Senate commission hearing his case in an increasingly awkward position. The hearing, which began on April 14, has turned into an inquisition that can now reach one of only two conclusions. Either his parliamentary colleagues regard him as 'economical with the truth' or they reject the evidence of the Palermo magistrates. If Mr Andreotti loses his immunity, parliament will be seen to have deserted Italy's best known politician and confirmed the links long suspected at the highest level between the Christian Democrat party and the Mafia. If the decision goes the other way the public will be convinced that Mr Andreotti is hiding behind the unacceptable device of parliamentary immunity, and his own party will be the chief loser. More important, any rebuff to the Palermo judiciary will undermine the state campaign against the Mafia. Mr Giancarlo Caselli, the Palermo attorney-general, was brought in from Turin last year after the killings of the two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino, to deal decisively with the Sicilian Mafia, Cosa Nostra. He has put behind bars several top figures in Sicily's organised crime network, including Mr 'Toto' Riina, the alleged 'boss of bosses'. The key has been the use of former Mafia figures who have agreed to give evidence under plea-bargaining programmes - the pentiti (supergrasses). Their evidence has led to the allegations against Mr Andreotti. The evidence against Mr Andreotti comes from three main sources - Mr Tommaso Buscetta, Mr Francesco Manino Mannoia and Mr Baldassare Di Maggio. Both Mr Buscetta and Mr Mannoia are confessed senior members of Cosa Nostra living in the US under witness protection programmes. Their evidence has been central to prosecution cases in all the main Mafia trials of the past seven years: evidence accepted up to, and including, the appeal court. Mr Di Maggio has been co-operating with the Italian authorities for less than six months but his evidence as former chauffeur to Mr Riina led to the latter's capture after 23 years on the run. All three are fundamental to Mr Riina's prosecution on charges including multiple murder. Thus if the allegations against Mr Andreotti are dismissed, doubts must be sown about prior evidence by these pentiti. The system of pentiti - the most effective means of prosecuting the Mafia - is at risk. The thrust of the accusations against Mr Andreotti is that he was for long the Mafia's point of reference in Rome. The specific allegations range from his being party to the decision by the Sicilian Mafia to the 1982 murder of General Carlo Alberto della Chiesa, the Palermo chief of police, to his links with Mr Salvatore Lima, the Euro-MP murdered last year by the Mafia and now acknowledged in a report by the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission to be associated with Cosa Nostra. To these accusations last week came Mr Di Maggio's testimony of being present when Mr Andreotti met Mr Riina, Mr Lima and other Mafia leaders in Palermo in September 1988. Mr Andreotti has belittled the evidence as either hearsay or unreliable. On Thursday his allies on the Senate commission (a majority who reflect faithfully the composition of the outgoing government coalition) secured a further delay of five days. The excuse was the need to know the names of individuals left blank by Palermo magistrates in the latest set of documents supplied this week. The names had been omitted to protect the secrecy of other anti-Mafia investigations in progress. But this delay has merely heightened the atmosphere of confrontation.</p>

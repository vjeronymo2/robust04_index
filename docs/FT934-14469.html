			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Craig &amp; Rose omits interim after loss Craig &amp; Rose, the paint and varnish manufacturer, lapsed into losses in the first half of 1993 and passed its interim dividend. The pre-tax deficit of Pounds 135,000 came on turnover of Pounds 2.64m (Pounds 2.96m) and compared with profits last time of Pounds 134,000, although that figure included a one-off profit of Pounds 148,000 on realisation of investments. Directors said the company had an 'exceptionally poor' first quarter and bad debt problems remained. A return to the black in the second half was unlikely. Losses per stock unit were 32.25p (earnings of 25.25p). An interim of 2p was paid last year.</p>

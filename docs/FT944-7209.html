			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Forward edges ahead and makes Pounds 3m sale Forward Group, the USM-quoted specialist circuit board maker, yesterday reported a small increase in interim profits and the Pounds 2.96m sale of its Chemical Express offshoot to its management. Pre-tax profits rose by Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 940,000 in the six months to July 31, on turnover of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 10.2m). Earnings per share dipped to 7.5p (8p), but the interim dividend is raised by 25 per cent to 2.5p (2p). Mr Ray Chamberlain, chairman, said the result, though in line with expectations, was affected by temporary disruption which occured at Forward Circuits' Tamworth factory, while a large-scale investment programme in new inner layer manufacturing capacity was undergoing commissioning trials. Margins fell temporarily as certain sub-contract services had to be purchased, he explained. This situation would also have an impact on second-half results, he said, but trading prospects 'remain very positive.' Chemical Express together with its subsidiary, the One Stop Chemical Shop, makes and markets a range of cleaning, maintenance and janitorial products. But because it is no longer considered part of the group's strategic plan, it is being sold in a cash deal, which will in the short term, substantially reduce gearing. However, Mr Chamberlain said: 'We are currently considering a number of business opportunities and should negotiations be successfully concluded, then a substantial proportion of the proceeds will be reinvested in businesses which strengthen the core activities.'</p>

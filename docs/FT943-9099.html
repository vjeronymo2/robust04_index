			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / US decides that sharing is better than warring: Washington will supply N Korea with water-cooled reactors made in the west Unlikely as it may seem, the US is to supply advanced nuclear technology to North Korea to stop its atomic bomb project. This may appear like helping an alcoholic by giving him a bottle of Scotch, but it could be the best way to resolve the dispute. The joint statement from North Korea and the US after talks in Geneva this week contained a US pledge to supply the Koreans with water-cooled reactors and agreement by Pyongyang to shut down its gas-cooled graphite stations and to 'forgo reprocessing' of spent uranium fuel rods which the west fears pose a radiation risk. The difference between the two types of reactor is important because water-cooled reactors would make it more difficult to start an illicit nuclear weapons programme. Nuclear reactors produce energy for electricity by splitting uranium atoms and releasing heat. They can also be used to produce material for atomic weapons because other nuclear reactions occur in the fuel rods of a reactor. One of the most important is the conversion of uranium into plutonium - a man-made element which can be used as the explosive in atomic bombs. All reactors produce this plutonium, but the kind which is most explosive in atomic bombs is called Plutonium-239. This is made in the early months that the uranium fuel is in use. Once the fuel has been in the reactor for some time, the Plutonium-239 is itself converted into other forms of the same element called Plutonium-240 and Plutonium-241, which are much less explosive. So to make atomic weapons, the nuclear fuel is ideally only used in a reactor for a few months, taken out and the constituents chemically separated. The nearly-pure Plutonium-239 is then available for bombs. Graphite reactors - such as used by the North Koreans and by the UK for nuclear weapons manufacture - often have their fuel in the reactor for a much shorter time than in water-cooled reactors, the type used for power production by the US and France . This is because they use less expensive fuel which loses its reactive qualities more quickly. They therefore tend to produce more weapons-type plutonium than water-cooled reactors. Water-cooled reactors use a more expensive fuel which is pepped-up or 'enriched' with the more reactive form of uranium. They can thus run for much longer between fuel changes and indeed must do so if the extra cost of the fuel is to be justified. As a result, water-cooled reactors produce plutonium which has a much lower content of the explosive form. Graphite reactors are also easier to shut and restart than water-cooled, and the fuel can be removed more quickly. An operator who wanted to skirt international restrictions would find it hard to disguise from international inspectors the minimum four-or five-day shutdown a water reactor requires for refuelling. If North Korea uses water-cooled reactors they will produce less bomb-quality plutonium and will be easier to monitor, but there are several snags and loopholes. First, building a water reactor to meet North Korea's electricity requirements will be expensive. The plant would be about half the size of the recently-completed Sizewell B plant in Suffolk, England, which cost more than Pounds 2bn. It is far from clear who would pay to build one, still less certain what message this would send to other potential weapons states. It is also possible, if uneconomic and more difficult, for North Korea to cheat using a water-cooled reactor. Furthermore the North Koreans have enough used graphite reactor fuel to make several atomic bombs which would have to come under international controls. If the International Atomic Energy Agency, the body responsible for monitoring, does not get a free hand to inspect all Korean facilities, Pyongyang could restart a small weapons reactor elsewhere or convert plutonium it has hidden into weapons. But without appropriate inspection arrangements, promising western high-tech goods to the Koreans may not lift the threat of a clandestine nuclear state developing.</p>

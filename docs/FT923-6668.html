			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: D-Day for the dollar A cynical view of yesterday's disastrous intervention to support the US currency is that it was orchestrated by the Federal Reserve to save the newly endorsed Candidate Bush the embarrassment of an all-time dollar low against the D-Mark. Whatever the rationale, the exercise backfired. Central banks bought dollars in insufficient size at a time when the market was already braced for such action. Little wonder that foreign exchange dealers were immediately emboldened to test the real resolve of the authorities. Supporting the dollar was always going to be an uphill struggle while the market believes the interest rate differential between the US and Germany could widen. But yesterday's action raises questions about the credibility of internationally co-ordinated exchange rate policy. The subsequent performance of US financial markets underlines that currency weakness is not just a political embarrassment. Yesterday's sharp fall on Wall Street reflected anxiety that further interest rate cuts are not on the cards for the moment. Perhaps more seriously, higher bond yields will, if sustained, make it more difficult for the US government to fund the deficit and increase the cost of long-term funding for companies. European central banks which joined yesterday's intervention - not least the Bank of England - also had a legitimate interest in propping up the dollar and softening the D-Mark to ease pressure within the ERM. Sterling's close in London below DM2.80 for the first time since joining the mechanism leaves it less than three pfennigs from the level at which intervention, or a rise in interest rates, is mandatory. With a month still to go before the French referendum on Maastricht, that leaves little room for further jitters.</p>

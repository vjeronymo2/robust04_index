			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Falling in love with Mr Rochester - Literature or rather with Mr Rochester - when I was 12. I used to talk with Mr Rochester on the way to school. 'My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer are all nothing to you?' 'I am going, sir.' 'Withdraw then; but remember, you leave me in anguish.' Years later, reading Muriel Spark's The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, I discovered her adolescent character Sandy chatting to Alan Breck, the hero of Kidnapped, and realised that generations of bluestocking teenagers fantasise about literary heroes as others idolise pop stars. Jane Eyre was an overwhelming literary experience. I read it almost non-stop, day and night, over 72 hours. It was the first classic novel that I enjoyed and the one that suggested what literature was about. It is a compelling story, but reading it, I suddenly saw that there is more to a great book than a good yarn; that fine original language and the brilliant artistic cohesion of form, words, images, create the pleasure of the text. I re-read it obsessively, for the joy of its highly wrought language and fevered emotional pitch. Charlotte Bronte's near Biblical cadences thrill with romance. Jane Eyre is the perfect teenage novel. Jane Eyre closed the door on children's books and opened up a brave new world of Victorian fiction. Many people recall the frenzy of adolescent reading - Graham Greene wrote of 'the missed heartbeat, the appalled glee,' at a new discovery on the library shelf. For me it was evoked by each Bronte novel, then by Pride and Prejudice, The Mill on the Floss, Tess of the D'Urbervilles where romantic satisfaction was denied - in Madam Bovary, say - I wilfully misread the book, inventing happy endings or lovers of Rochester-like machismo and fidelity. Indirectly, Jane Eyre sparked off many cultural pleasures. Its intense vision was so enticing that it tempted a search for other ways of losing oneself in an artist's imaginative world, in drama, opera. In museums, there was the chance to seek Rochester or D'Arcy lookalikes among 19th century portraits. All this was a mixed blessing. While most teenagers in the 1970s were out disco dancing, I was locked into Victorian England. It was a shock to find that there was more to life than prim governesses, and that men were not like Mr Rochester. Yet I still find Jane Eyre a great love story, as consoling and satisfying as Cinderella, the archetypal tale on which it is unconsciously based. Cinderella talks to the wronged child in all of us, and makes us feel special and redeemed; so does Jane Eyre.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GULLS END ROAD TRIP WITH LOSS  </P> <P> The Gulls never fully recovered from an early deficit and fell 5-4 in the last  of their six-game road series in an International Hockey League game seen by  14,999 Saturday night at the Bradley Center. The crowd was the fifth largest in  the 45-year history of the league.  </P> <P> The Admirals (11-10-2) jumped to a 3-0 lead, paced by Dave Mackey's  back-to-back goals at 1:22 at 2:48 in the first period. It marked the 20th time  in 26 games the Gulls have been scored on first.  </P> <P> Mackey's second goal was with Milwaukee playing short handed. It was the first  of two short-handed goals the Gulls (13-11-2, 4-2 on this road trip) allowed  for the night. For the season, they have given up five.  </P> <P> The Gulls pulled to 3-2 when Bob Jones scored a short handed goal at 4:25 in  the second, and teammate Clark Donatelli got his 10th goal on the power play at  9:42, with an assist by Derek Mayer, which extended his scoring streak to 10  games in a row.  </P></p>

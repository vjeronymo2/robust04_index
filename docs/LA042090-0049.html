			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOJOURN IN THE LAND OF TOFU-EATERS;  </P> <P> FAULTY GROUND BY GABRIELLE DONNELLY, GOLLANCZ/DAVID &amp; CHARLES $19.95, 254  PAGES  </P> <P> Attitudes toward California seem to harden as one travels east, mellowing only  after the international dateline is crossed. This tentative theory may explain  why New Yorkers and Londoners write satiric books about us while the Japanese  scramble to annex us.  </P> <P> Susan Barnes, the central character in this novel by an Englishwoman now living  here, would never have come to Los Angeles if the ceiling of her London flat  hadn't fallen in. Susan is a literary scholar, at work on an introduction to a  new edition of Jane Austen's "Emma," a task she finds impossible to complete  under a shower of plaster. When a letter from her cousin Joanna arrives with a  glowing description of her blissful life in Southern California, Susan  impulsively decides to visit the city "she'd always associated with sun-beached  surfers, movie stars and Disneyland."  </P> <P> Once recovered from jet lag, Susan finds herself enjoying Los Angeles despite  her misgivings. Joanna has turned the garage into a guest room for her cousin;  her handsome filmmaker husband Mike actually seems pleased at the thought of a  house guest, and the beach is within walking distance. Reluctantly, Susan  acknowledges that the place may actually have some merits. There are even  "well-thumbed" books in the house, an amenity Susan hadn't expected.  </P> <P> Of course, Joanna has changed. Once a fiercely talented painter, she has become  an art teacher, turning out blandly pretty pictures in her spare time,  demonstrating that once an artist moves here, she will never do any good work  again. Contentment has blurred her edges and broadened her hips, alterations  perceived by Susan as ominous.  </P> <P> Instead of using her summer vacation profitably, Joanna seems happy to spend  her days reading romances and her evenings playing earth mother to undeserving  acquaintances. Susan, on the other hand, has remained lean and ambitious in  London, her wit honed by her affair with her publisher, a married man with no  intentions whatever of leaving his wife. Joanna considers this situation  deplorable, and would like nothing better than to see her cousin a happily  married convert to the Southern California lifestyle.  </P> <P> After meeting her hosts' circle of friends, a haphazard and stereotypical mix  including an unhappy homosexual pair, a promiscuous actress between jobs and a  vacuous couple who epitomize yuppiehood in the late '80s, Susan finds her  initial enthusiasm fading. Only one member of the group is familiar with Jane  Austen; the food and wine taste equally of sugar, and she feels as if she might  be drowning "in a butt of Malmsey," though she has become so Californianized  that she can't remember the source of the quote. Worse still, Joanna's  mother-in-law Eileen has attempted to fix her up with a young doctor, a gesture  Susan finds grossly insulting.  </P> <P> After Susan sees a man shoot a woman on a Venice street, her disenchantment is  complete. Happily, her English lover Felix will be in Los Angeles for a few  days, and they'll be able to demolish the California cliches together.  </P> <P> Alas, when Felix arrives, looking "unwholesome and grey," he suffers by  comparison to Joanna's appealing husband Mike. Felix's acerbic wit seems to  have suffered a sea (or air) change, and his comments seem egregiously flip and  ill-natured.  </P> <P> When Susan tells him about the street murder, he quite fails to see its  significance. Susan "took a sip of her wine, distancing herself from him,  wondering whether it was the Los Angeles air that presented him in so  unattractive a light."  </P> <P> In a sudden apercu, Susan realizes that she's fallen in love with Mike,  becoming yet another victim of his careless and superficial charm. Clearly,  Susan must return to London at once, while she still can salvage the moral  integrity so imperiled by her sojourn among the tofu-eaters and adulterers.  </P> <P> Just before her departure, Joanna's well-meaning, widowed mother-in-law invites  her to a farewell dinner. "Susan smiled, her old, acid London smile. 'If you're  so desperate for company,' she asked, 'why don't you buy a guinea pig?' " So  much for that vaunted tart English wit, which makes Californian insincerity  seem adorable.  </P> <P> We leave Susan boarding the plane to London, sadder and wiser, having confirmed  the Myth of the Mindless Surfer and successfully resisted its insidious lure.  </P> <P> Next: Carolyn See reviews "To the Birdhouse" by Cathleen Schine.  </P></p>

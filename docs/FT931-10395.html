			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Military staff for UN urged THE United Nations should have a permanent military staff as the requirements for intervention move beyond traditional peacekeeping operations, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute, The London-based defence studies organisation calls for the UN's 'largely symbolic' Military Staff Committee, comprising the military heads of the five permanent members of the Security Council, to be regenerated with a full-time chairman and representatives of all the Security Council countries. This body would determine the principles for military intervention and outline the logistics necessary for sending forces. A control centre would also be required to provide political and military guidance to commanders in the field. In the first issue of a new annual International Security Review, the institute forecasts increasing pressure on the US, Britain and France to provide UN forces. The shift in emphasis to peace-enforcement will increasingly require heavily armed professional soldiers from countries skilled in high-level command, it says. It warns that much of this burden may be placed on America's allies since Washington will be reluctant to commit ground forces where no US national interest is at stake. There is strong case for a UN military staff to establish operating procedures and rules of engagement, it says, especially if eastern European or other non-Nato countries are to be accommodated into a Nato-style operation. However, it rejects as unrealistic the proposal by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, for forces to be made permanently available on standby for the UN. The report is highly critical of western, and particularly European, responses to the crisis in former Yugoslavia, saying 'much could have been done' to avert the disaster in Bosnia. It accuses western governments of now playing a 'cynical' game, officially rejecting the carve-up of Bosnia while not intending to take any action that would reverse the territorial gains made by Serb forces.

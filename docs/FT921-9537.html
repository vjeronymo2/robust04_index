			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Buoyant Whirlpool rises to Dollars 170m WHIRLPOOL yesterday announced an advance in after-tax profits to Dollars 170m for 1991, compared with Dollars 72m in 1990, despite a declining market in the US for major home appliances and flat European demand. In the fourth quarter of the year alone, Whirlpool - the world's largest maker of leading domestic appliances and now the full owner of the former Philips' businesses in Europe - made a net Dollars 40m, against a Dollars 54m loss in the same period of 1990. Whirlpool shares gained Dollars 3 to Dollars 43 1/2 on the news. Mr David Whitwam, Whirlpool's chairman, claimed the year had been 'very good' under the circumstances and attributed part of the advance to reductions in working capital and costs and increased market share. Sales for 1991 overall totalled Dollars 6.55bn, compared with Dollars 6.42bn in 1990. Profit comparisons between the two years are slightly muddled by restructuring charges and other one-off items. In 1990, Whirlpool took a Dollars 52m charge related to the refrigeration operations, partly offset by a Dollars 22m gain on the sale of a floor-care business; in 1991, there was a Dollars 20m charge for the Italian compressor facilities. The Brazilian interests also showed an improvement, contributing equity earnings of Dollars 3m, against a loss of Dollars 33m in 1990, although Whirlpool warns that the situation here remains 'volatile'. The company said its North American shipments rose by more than 5 per cent in the last quarter, but declined by over 5 per cent during the 12 months. Mr Whitwam predicted a 5 per cent rise during 1992 overall, but suggested the gain would come in the second half. In Europe, Whirlpool said shipments were flat in the last quarter but up by 1 to 2 per cent for the year. This year, shipments are estimated to increase by 1 per cent. The US company has been using dual branding - combining its own name with that of Philips - but says it is now phasing out the Philips name from UK advertising, a move which will be replicated in other markets early this year. The finance subsidiary made net profits of Dollars 31m, up 15 per cent from 1990.</p>

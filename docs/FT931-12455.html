			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Norwegian savings bank bounces back into black SPAREBANKEN Nord-Norge, Norway's third-largest savings bank, bounced back into the black in 1992 with a net profit of NKr160.4m (Dollars 23.9m), compared with a NKr41.2m loss a year earlier. The bank said the improvement was due to a reduction in credit losses, lower costs and improved interest earnings. Credit losses were cut by NKr114.7m to NKr245m, while net interest income was lifted by NKr17.6m to NKr893.7m. Credit losses of NKr127m stemming from non-corporate customers were higher than the board had anticipated, the bank said. Operating profit, before credit losses, was up by NKr86.9m to NKr405.4m. Operating costs fell to NKr330.7m last year from NKr385.2m in 1991.</p>

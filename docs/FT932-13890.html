			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Chemical Banking ahead at Dollars 374m CHEMICAL Banking, the third-largest US commercial bank, yesterday reported a healthy 44 per cent increase in its net profits to Dollars 374m, or Dollars 1.35 a share, for the first quarter of 1993. The net income figure was struck after a Dollars 30m restructuring charge related to the acquisition in February of assets from First City of Texas by Texas Commerce Bancshares, a Chemical affiliate company. The net profit benefited from a Dollars 35m net gain related to a change in accounting. Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman of Chemical, said the bank's performance was helped by strong net interest revenues, record total trading revenues and increases in several fee-based services, such as corporate finance and trust activities. Bad debt provisions at Chemical were Dollars 312m in the quarter, down from Dollars 375m a year ago. While credit costs remained at high levels, the bank's credit quality continued to improve, according to Mr Walter Shipley, president of Chemical Banking. He added that non-performing assets were Dollars 5.7bn at the end of March, down from Dollars 6.2bn at the end of the 1992 first quarter. The bank's tier one ratio of capital to assets was 7.4 per cent at the end of the quarter, up from 6.6 per cent a year ago. The bank, which was formed last year by the merger of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical, said its return on assets rose to 1.06 per cent from 0.75 per cent a year ago. Net interest income in the quarter was Dollars 1.15bn, up slightly from Dollars 1.12bn a year ago. Non-interest revenue for the quarter was Dollars 925m, up by 15 per cent year-on-year. On Wall Street, Chemical's shares were Dollars  3/8 down at Dollars 40 1/4 . Banc One, the expanding Ohio-based bank that specialises in consumer banking business, reported a record net profit of Dollars 272m, or Dollars 1.03 per share, for the first quarter of 1993, against Dollars 179m a year ago. Banc One's return on assets was 1.58 per cent, one of the highest levels in the US banking industry. Mr John McCoy, chairman of Banc One, said continued retail loan demand helped the net interest margin, which was 6.64 per cent in the first quarter. At the end of March, Banc One had total assets of Dollars 70bn and operated 60 banks with 1,277 offices in 11 states. On Wall Street, the bank's shares were Dollars 57 1/2 , down Dollars 5/8 . Bankers Trust, the New York bank, said first-quarter net profit jumped by 49 per cent to Dollars 230m, or Dollars 2.69 a share. After restating the figures for accounting changes, the net income for the first quarter of 1992 was Dollars 600m and the net for the first quarter of 1993 was Dollars 155m. Net interest revenue was 41 per cent higher at Dollars 315m. Total trading revenue of Dollars 346m was up 60 per cent and was attributed mainly to sharply higher revenue from several of the firm's proprietary trading activities. Bad debt provisions were Dollars 30m, down from Dollars 55m a year ago. Non-performing assets declined by 7 per cent to Dollars 2.29bn. In Pittsburgh, Mellon Bank said its first-quarter net profit was Dollars 34m, down from Dollars 86m a year ago. In California, Wells Fargo said its net earnings in the first quarter declined by 9 per cent to Dollars 108m. The main reason for the drop in profits was higher expenses on the non-interest side of the bank. Mr Carl Reichardt, chairman, said Wells was encouraged that its problem loans declined in the quarter, but said 'we continue to be cautious given the still fragile condition of the California economy.' On Wall Street the Wells Fargo share price was Dollars 5 1/2 lower at Dollars 113 7/8.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SURFERS' MUSIC  </P> <P> In his April 21 review of "Surfers -- The Movie," Michael Wilmington mentioned  "anthems of the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean."  </P> <P> As music supervisor for the picture, I worked in tandem with director Bill  Delaney to create a soundtrack that includes the Pogues, PIL, Bob Marley, U2  and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. We intentionally omitted anything which could be  called anthems of the Beach Boys or Jan and Dean.  </P> <P> DANNY HOLLOWAY, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: 'Real Time' from Israel -  Theatre The Tmu-Na Theatre of Israel has arrived in Hammersmith and confirms the company's reputation for passionate intensity. The acting is also full of conviction. If you want to see writhing bodies against a musical background in a bar in Tel Aviv on the eve of the Yom Kippur war, here is the opportunity. You may see something else besides: an excellent company groping for a play. Possibly one is too far outside the culture to appreciate them, in which case I apologise. I saw some wonderful productions in Israel last year, but my impression even then was that the Israelis have developed a talent for acting and directing without producing the scripts to match. It was explained to me that the Israeli theatre suffers from self-censorship: it is unable to write directly about contemporary questions, such as relations between Jews and Arabs and what is happening on the West Bank. What it can just about do is to write about relations between Israelis: newcomers and old hands. Real Time has a shot in that direction. Almost the first line is the best. 'I didn't talk for a year after I came to Israel,' says a Russian immigrant working as the caretaker of Eva's Bar. He was afraid of saying the wrong thing, making mistakes in the language or generally being misunderstood. 'All countries hate foreigners,' he adds. The rest never lives up to that. The fact that it is set on the eve of the Yom Kippur war is about as trite as another play on the night that Kennedy died: more nostalgia than comment. There is a lot of quite attractive sexual sleaze: four women to two slightly decrepit men. Some of it takes place on and around a lavatory bowl, prominently set backstage centre. One wondered why. If it is satire, it is heavily coded. It looks like outmoded trendiness. Tmu-Na is Hebrew for images in motion. The company was founded in 1982 by Nava Zukerman who wrote and co-directs Real Time. If the company had a real play, it could be terrific. Lyric Studio, Hammersmith until May 1 (081) 741 2311. Then on to Glasgow Mayfest</p>

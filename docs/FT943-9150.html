			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Finland raises CDollars 200m over 10 years Amid the turmoil in Europe's government bond markets following interest-rate tightening in Sweden and Italy, activity in the eurobond market all but ground to a halt. The only significant deal of the day was a CDollars 200m issue of 10-year bonds for the Republic of Finland via joint lead managers Paribas and Swiss Bank Corporation. The bonds were priced to yield 27.5 basis points over the Canadian 10-year government benchmark bond at their re-offer price of 99.845. While the leads reported good demand from the Benelux region and Switzerland, boosted by the 9.5 per cent coupon, other dealers felt the issue had been too tightly priced. 'Given the size and the timing of the deal, I think it should have had an extra 10 basis points' on the spread, said one syndicate manager, adding that the timing of the deal, amid a raft of US inflation indicators, was 'bizarre.' After the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened to around 31 basis points. While more swap-driven Canadian-dollar issues are expected soon, activity is expected to remain quiet near-term, with most of Europe closed for Assumption holiday on Monday. The Hong Kong Housing Society, a non-profit making organisation which provides affordable homes for Hong Kong people, issued a HKDollars 2bn floating-rate note for general funding purposes, writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong. The 2 1/2 -year notes, the bulk of which will be placed locally, carry an interest rate of 0.85 per cent over the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate. The offering will not be listed on any stock exchange. There is a call option after two years and three months. Wardley Capital arranged the issue and HSBC Markets is book-runner.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise on series of mishaps OIL PRICES moved higher yesterday as traders bought crude after a series of accidents at oil refineries in the US and Saudi Arabia. The price of North Sea Brent crude for June delivery rose by 25 cents to Dollars 20.10 a barrel in an active market. Saudi Arabia's Yanbu refinery on the Red Sea coast was operating below its 275,000 barrels a day capacity after the catalytic cracker unit - a key piece of sophisticated refining equipment - broke down on Wednesday. There were some indications there could be delays in deliveries. Prices for unleaded gasoline moved higher in the US after news of a fire at a Shell refinery in Louisiana. These later dragged up crude prices by about 5 cents to Dollars 21.83 for the June futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange by midsession yesterday. As traders rushed into the London market, the rally started to feed on itself and some were puzzled about the strength in price. 'I'm confused,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, director of Lehman Brothers energy desk, 'refineries are stuck with crude, but short of products and crude rallies on the back of it.' Refined products prices were also higher and gasoline moved up to Dollars 255 a tonne in Rotterdam from Dollars 246 a tonne. Mobil, the US oil company, a joint venture partner in the Saudi Yanbu refinery, reportedly notified customers of some May delivery delays.</p>

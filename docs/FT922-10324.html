			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Yeltsin attacks legislature President Boris Yeltsin dismissed Russia's supreme legislature yesterday as a 'talking shop' and called for a referendum on constitutional change to abolish it, Reuter reports from Moscow. 'It's a big talking shop where very little gets decided,' Mr Yeltsin told steelworkers north of Moscow, referring to the 1,060-member Congress of People's Deputies. Itar-Tass news agency, quoted him saying: 'I think we should put the new constitution to a popular vote and all will be decided, there will be no more congress.' Speaking in the town of Cherepovets at the end of a tour of northern Russia, he said it was vital to change the system of parallel standing and supreme legislatures introduced under former president Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika reforms. 'Nowhere else in the world does such a thing exist - a parliament and a congress,' he said, urging workers to gather signatures in favour of a referendum.</p>

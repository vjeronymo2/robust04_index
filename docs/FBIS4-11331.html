			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 23 Apr (PL) -- Authorities of the  Mexican State of Quintana Roo today reported the arrival of a  boat with 94 Cubans aboard, in the second such incident in less  than 15 days.    According to press reports, 47 men, 27 women, and 20  children  had been aboard the boat "Casilda 127," which sailed furtively  from the island on 15 April bound for Miami, Florida. The boat,  however, was forced to change course for Mexico because of an  engine malfunction.    Mario Villanueva, governor of Quintana Roo, has told EL  FINANCIERO that Cubans apparently use this state as a  "springboard" to the United States.    As for another group of 85 Cubans who arrived at Chetumal on  11 April, the Government Secretariat has reported that they were  given legal authorization to stay on Mexican territory for 180  days under a non-immigrant visitor status. The Secretariat  announced that the boat, "Ferrocemento 25," will be put at the  disposal of its legal owner, the Cuban Government, as soon as  its legal ownership is determined. [sentence as received]    The U.S. Department of State recently announced that it will  continue to refuse entry into the United States of Cubans who  use third countries. In turn, the Havana Government has  systematically denounced the political manipulation by the  United States of the flow of Cuban emigrants. It has been said  that, while the U.S. Interests Section in Havana grants visas to  30 percent of those who request them, the U.S. Government  accepts and gives special treatment to those who arrive  illegally.    U.S. legislators have pointed out the discriminating  treatment given to other illegal immigrants, including Haitians  and Mexicans, who are returned to their countries.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil price to rise by 550 per cent in June THE PRICE of oil in Russia is to rise in June from Rbs350 a tonne to between Rbs2,000 and Rbs2,600 a tonne in June, or between Dollars 22 and Dollars 29 on the official exchange rate (Rbs100 to the dollar). Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian deputy prime minister, said in a newspaper interview yesterday that the rises would put the Russian prices at about 25 per cent of world prices. The freeing of oil prices has been postponed from the target date of April 1, under pressure from other republics fearful of the effects on their ravaged economies of further rises dictated by Russia. However, Mr Gaidar said that oil and other energy price rises were essential to avoid economic collapse. His comments confirm indications given earlier this month by Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the republic's energy minister, that the government was seeking a rouble exchange rate in the range of 25 to 30 to the US dollar, based on the oil price. Mr Lopukin said that Russian oil would reach world price levels of Dollars 130 a tonne when the rouble was pegged at a new exchange rate. The June rises, if delivered, would raise the cost of petrol to drivers from Rbs1.2 to between Rbs5 and Rbs7 a litre. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said yesterday that it was a 'serious step, we must think seven times before we take it'. He said, however, that the International Monetary Fund was insisting on the move. However, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the government's sternest critic and chairman of the Russian parliament, said that any presidential decree to raise oil prices would be vetoed by the parliament. He said that '40 per cent of the oil is sold at free prices and that is enough'. Mr Gaidar confirmed in his interview that 40 per cent of oil had been sold through oil exchanges at free prices - but used this to point to the shock of all prices being liberated not being as great as feared. Mr Frans Andriessen, vice president of the European Community, said in Moscow yesterday that the EC was seriously concerned over the 6-fold increase in the export of aluminium from the former Soviet Union to community countries over the past two years. In talks with Mr Genady Burbulis, the Russian first deputy prime minister, he warned that Russia must scale down the level of its imports or face curbs. He said that a team of officials and experts would come to Moscow next month for talks on the exports.</p>

A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement monitored by  NAEWOE  press here said Pyongyang would not send a delegation to the  third high-level meeting with the United States slated for  Monday (Washington time).    "North Korea would find no other way but to translate into  action the measures which were pronounced in its statement on  March 12 (on withdrawal from the NPT) in order to defend the  nation's right to independence and the security of the country"  should the United States avoid high-level talks and resume Team  Spirit, and the IAEA distort inspection results and expand  impartiality, thereby stepping up its high-handedness and  pressure on Pyongyang, NAEWOE, South Korea's observer of North  Korean affairs, quoted the statement as saying.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, aired by the  North Korean Central Broadcasting station and Radio Pyongyang,  said North Korea would no longer feel obligated to guarantee the  continuity of nuclear safeguards.</p>

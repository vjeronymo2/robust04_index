			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In proposing this change, we acknowledge the cost implications of complex interrelationships among program administration, quality services and availability of child care options in the context of rapidly increasing family and community needs. Many States and localities want to develop more cohesive, integrated and sophisticated child care management, delivery and payment systems. Activities undertaken under &sect;98.50(d) can contribute to the development of child care systems which more effectively support informed consumer choice and the delivery of quality care through community-based providers. This change will provide grantees with the flexibility to balance priorities and develop more responsive child care programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, we propose that the CCDBG rules be amended to specify that the amount generally allowed for activities related to administration, quality and availability is 15 percent at &sect;98.50(d)(2)(ii). Therefore, the amount specified for direct services is at least 85 percent at &sect;98.50(d)(2)(i). The change will also remove &sect;98.50(d)(3) which requires grantees to petition for the additional five percent and remove a reference to &sect;98.50(d)(3) which occurs in &sect;98.52(c). It will also remove a related reference at &sect;98.13(a)(6)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Availability of Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992, section 658J(c) of the CCDBG Act was amended to eliminate the time restrictions on obligation and to extend the length of time grantees have to expend funds received each fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Block Grant funds awarded to States and Territories had previously been available for obligation by the grantee in the fiscal year in which the grant funds were awarded and in the succeeding fiscal year (year 2). Unliquidated obligations at the end of year 2 were to be liquidated during the next fiscal year (year 3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statutory amendments eliminate the restrictions on obligation of funds by States and Territories by providing that CCDBG funds are expendable in the fiscal year in which they are awarded and in the three (3) succeeding fiscal years. For Tribal grantees, the amendments also extend the expenditure period from three (3) fiscal years to four (4) fiscal years. Thus, the expenditure period for all grantees (States, Territories, exempt Tribes and non-exempt Tribes) now extends to four (4) fiscal years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments were not effective in time to remove the September 30, 1992, obligation restriction on FY 1991 grant funds awarded to States and Territories. However, the amendments do provide an additional year to expend funds for obligations made with FY 1991 funds, so that States and Territories now have until September 30, 1994 (rather than September 30, 1993), to expend FY 1991 funds which were obligated by September 30, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tribal grantees who received FY 1991 funds were required to expend their funds by September 30, 1993. Because the amendments provide an additional year during which FY 1991 funds may be expended, Tribal grantees have until September 30, 1994, to expend their FY 1991 grants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, for all grantees (States, Territories and Tribes), FY 1992 and subsequent fiscal years' funds must be expended by the end of the expenditure period (the fiscal year in which the funds are awarded plus the three succeeding fiscal years). To reflect these changes, we propose amending &sect;98.2 by removing and reserving paragraph (z) and revising paragraphs (y) and (cc) and &sect;98.60 by revising paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(4), (h)(1), and (h)(3) and removing paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), (e), and (h)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Financial Reporting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We propose revising &sect;98.63(a)(1) and (b) to change the dates by which States must report funds for reallotment to other State grantees. Reallotment rules do not affect Territories or Tribal grantees since those grantees may not receive reallotted funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each fiscal year, States must specify the amount of any CCDBG funds which will be available for reallocation or else report that all funds will be expended. The deadline for submission of this information was previously April 1 of the second fiscal year of the obligation period. As a result of the extension of the expenditure deadline by section 8 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992, the date by which States must report CCDBG funds for reallotment has been extended to April 1 of the fourth (and last) fiscal year of the expenditure period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the amendments did not remove the September 30, 1992 obligation deadline for FY 1991 grant funds, this change in reporting did not affect FY 1991 awards. For FY 1992 funds, States must report on the availability of funds for reallotment by April 1, 1995. Funds reallotted from one fiscal year's grant are subject to the same period of availability as the grant year from which the funds were awarded. Thus, FY 1992 funds, if any, reallotted in May of 1995 must be expended by September 30, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Annual Report Requirement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

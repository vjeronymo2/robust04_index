			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stas Stremidlovskiy: "`Skokov Is Real "Shadow" </F> Prime Minister Whom I Always Seemed To Have in Mind' (Boris  Yeltsin, `President's Notes')"]    [Text] Informed sources in the Russian Government and in  Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin's entourage report  that the question of Viktor Chernomyrdin's resignation for  health reasons from the post of prime minister and the  appointment of Yuriy Skokov to this post has been resolved in  principle. Viktor Stepanovich himself allegedly agrees with  this formulation. And that is obviously what explains  Chernomyrdin's unexpected departure to Germany, where he  underwent investigation and a course of treatment for a kidney  stone illness.    According to unofficial reports, last Monday Boris Yeltsin  had already had a meeting with Yuriy Skokov as a result of which  only Boris Yeltsin's signature is lacking to the necessary draft  presidential edicts.    Yuriy Skokov is now public chairman of the federation of  Russian commodity producers and entrepreneurs and before that he  held the post of Security Council secretary, and since October  1992 has engaged in earnest in the affairs of the regions, where  he has acquired considerable popularity.    Yuriy Skokov tries not to expatiate on his political  activity, calling himself a "politically homeless person." His  recent contacts have included those with people from the  entourage of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and leaders of the "New  Regional Policy" deputies' group. In addition, Yuriy Skokov did  not sign the "Social Accord Treaty," which put him on a par with  Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov and Agrarian Party  leader Mikhail Lapshin.    So far we can only guess whether Boris Yeltsin will appoint  Skokov as acting head of the cabinet or will try to submit his  candidacy to the Federal Assembly for approval as a full prime  minister.    In the opinion of a number of experts, the decision to  appoint Yuriy Skokov was prompted by the fact that the Russian  parliament is ceasing to be controlled by the president. A  parliamentary majority has not been successfully formed on the  basis of the democratic parties in the State Duma. The  Federation Council has also proved disobedient. That was shown  by the situation involving the approval of Aleksandr Ilyushenko  for the post of general prosecutor.    Therefore, experts believe, it is most likely that Yuriy  Skokov, in exchange for his appointment as head of government,  has promised Boris Yeltsin to ensure the passage of presidential  draft edicts in the State Duma. If you consider that Skokov  recently signed an agreement on cooperation with the State Duma  "New Regional Policy" deputies' group, which includes 65  deputies, he will obviously be able to fulfill that promise.</p>

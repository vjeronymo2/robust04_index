			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (2): Recovery in the ruins - London's outlook is not as bad as it seems AMID the bomb debris and 'To Let' signs littering Fenchurch and Leadenhall Street it is only too easy to form the impression that London's insurance market is in terminal decline. Indeed in the spring of this year news of reinsurance company withdrawals and a continual stream of disaster and scandal at the Lloyd's markets combined to create a mood of near despair among professionals about the fortunes of the market. Six months later the picture is a good deal brighter. Reinsurance rates are still rising, the weather in the Caribbean and Europe has - at least until the end of August - been kinder to reinsurers, and the market has been buoyed by higher than expected investor interest in new reinsurance ventures both at Lloyd's and in the company market. London's problems began when a series of catastrophe losses squeezed between the two European storms of October 1987 and January 1990 hit the highly specialist market for retrocessional cover. At a time when the market was introducing new technology to speed up claims payments, the combination of both the number and scale of the losses eventually overwhelmed lead underwriters backed by Lloyd's agencies such as Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Devonshire, Rose Thompson Young and Bromley. Syndicates such as 290 and 540/42 made losses in 1989 and 1990 which exceeded their total capacity by more than 200 per cent, leaving their Names with unsustainable losses and a tangle of litigation. Losses at Gooda Walker's seven syndicates - three of which were regarded as leaders in the 'spiral' market - are expected to exceed Pounds 1bn, about a sixth of Lloyd's total losses in the last five years. Even underwriters such as Mr David King, whose syndicate 745 was popular among professionals, has been driven out of business by the losses. The number of syndicates fell from just over 400 in 1990 to 228 in 1993, with a fall to fewer than 200 forecast for 1994. Syndicates which had occupied four of the Lloyd's building's trading floors in 1989 were accommodated on only two floors this year. London-based reinsurance companies were hit in less spectacular fashion but in some cases the damage was sufficient to force withdrawals from the market. Mercantile &amp; General Re, the subsidiary of the Prudential Corporation, was so badly affected by claims from the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion in July 1988 that it first markedly reduced its exposure to general reinsurance business, and then in 1993 announced its decision to concentrate on life reinsurance. A second wave of losses in 1991 and 1992, culminating in hurricane Andrew - the US's biggest ever catastrophe loss - damaged a number of companies specialising in direct reinsurance, leading earlier this year to the decision by market leaders such as English &amp; American, Norwich Winterthur (a joint venture backed by Norwich Union, Winterthur and Chiyoda of Japan) and NRG, the subsidiary of the Netherlands' biggest insurance company, Internationale Nederlande Groep, to leave the market. Mr Willem Dikland, chief executive of NRG, explained that reinsurance did not offer 'a sufficient return on capital. Catastrophes are getting bigger. You cannot get any retrocession (reinsurance of reinsurance) protection, and original rates, especially in France and Germany, are totally inadequate.' At least a dozen companies, some of whom such as Chancellor had an extensive involvement in the reinsurance and retrocession markets, have gone into liquidation. More generally the scale of losses and obvious volatility of the market led to the withdrawal of companies such as Royal Re, the subsidiary of Royal Insurance. Moreover, the problems of many Lloyd's syndicates and smaller reinsurance companies have heightened fears about reinsurance security. Increasingly brokers have shied away from placing business with reinsurers who have less than Pounds 50m in capital. At the same time the greater preparedness of brokers to place business directly with large European companies in their home offices has also weakened London's position. And stung by heavy losses themselves many European companies have become much more concerned to exercise more direct control over the business they write. In a significant development in June Munich Re announced that it was downgrading its London office. A notice to brokers issued on 30 June said that the company's previous policy in which international treaty business had been underwritten in London 'had lead to accumulations which have to be more tightly and centrally controlled'. In future international treaties would be underwritten either in the Munich home office or in Munich Re's local subsidiaries and branches in the respective markets, it added. Yet in recent months there have been initial indications of a slow recovery in London's fortunes. Rates for almost all reinsurance policies have increased to more adequate levels, increasing the prospects of a return to profitability. The Lloyd's business plan, published in April, highlighted a sharp rise in reinsurance rates between 1989 and 1993 and a big increase in the size of deductibles that buyers are being forced to accept (see graph). During the summer there have been a number of new investments. NAC Re, the eighth largest US reinsurance company, injected Pounds 50m into a London reinsurance subsidiary in June, after recruiting Mr Charles Catt from NWRe to head up the office. Liberty Mutual, a Boston-based insurer, also announced in June that it intends to invest Pounds 85m in its London market subsidiary. The investment increased paid-up capital of the company from Pounds 15m to Pounds 100m. Liberty had earlier recruited Mr Dick Hazell, the former deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, as the chairman of its London subsidiary. Mr David Holmes, of the London Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association (LIRMA), says his organisation, which represents the London reinsurance community, has received a number of other inquiries especially from US companies. In August Eagle Star, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, announced it was converting its London market division into a fully fledged marine and reinsurance company, with a dedicated capital of Pounds 125m. In August it also emerged that the Benfield Group, a broker, which specialises in high level excess of loss market, was intended to form a new reinsurance company, with paid-up capital of some Pounds 50m. There has also been higher than expected investor interest among UK and US financial institutions in the efforts of Lloyd's of London to attract corporate capital to its market. At least some of this capital - which could amount to Pounds 500m according to some early indications  - will be channelled into the reinsurance market. Sentiment was also boosted in July by the government's decision to allow companies to establish tax free catastrophe reserves for the first time. The changes were outlined in consultation document issued by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Inland Revenue and published in July. Even so investor interest in London is dwarfed by recent developments in the Bermudian marketplace, where more than Dollars 1bn in fresh capital was pledged in the summer. At present underwriters of the new Bermudian companies are currently content to underwrite so-called 'following' lines on policies whose price, terms and conditions are decided by 'lead' underwriters in London. Yet as their confidence grows the new Bermudian companies may soon start to seek to lead business themselves, posing a potentially serious competitive threat. The London market will need to consolidate its recent recovery if it is to defend its position successfully.</p>

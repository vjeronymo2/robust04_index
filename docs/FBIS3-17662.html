We have invited you to participate today in the solemn  signing of our first Constitution -- the Constitution of the  Republic of Belarus -- which we adopted at the 14th session of  the Supreme Soviet on 15 March. I have repeatedly noted that  the Constitution was worked out during two and a half years with  the participation of all members of the Supreme Soviet  Presidium, who also acted as members of the Constitutional  Commission. Also participating in the work on the Constitution  were the majority of our deputies, the government, leading  lawyers and scientists of our Republic, and the voters, who came  forward with many proposals and remarks after the draft  Constitution was published in the media. All this was taken  into account, and it contributed to the adoption of the  Constitution in the present form.    I would like to point out that this Constitution emphasizes  and protects civil and human rights for the first time. The  Constitution, for the first time in the Republic of Belarus,  defines our political system. It has pronounced that Belarus  will be a presidential republic. Tomorrow, we will debate  legislation concerning elections of the first president of the  Republic of Belarus.    The Constitution, for the first time in history, approves  the  Constitutional Court, which has not existed in our public life,  and includes an entire range of other proposals.    Therefore, before signing the Constitution, I would like to  congratulate all members of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the  government, all people's deputies, people who participated in  the work, and all citizens upon the adoption of this important,  basic law in the life of our Belarusian people. I believe that  the Constitution will become the first, extremely important step  toward strengthening the independence of our state -- the  Republic of Belarus.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Fund managers adapt to new imperatives: The dynamics of talks between Henderson and Touche Remnant Selling unit trusts to a public now painfully aware of the vagaries of the stock market is hard work. A unit trust, like its older cousin the investment trust, offers the average investor the opportunity to play the stock market without the agony of picking individual shares. For the fund management companies that manage these two types of trust, public anxiety over share prices is not the only worry; they must also cope with fierce competition. Recent figures from the Unit Trust Association show that last year the number of unit holder accounts, at 4.46m, was the lowest since 1987, but the number of unit trust companies had risen 13 per cent in the meantime, to 157. 'It is no secret that there is overcapacity in this business,' said Mr Ian Jocelyn, senior consultant at Touche Ross Management Consultants which recently analysed the unit trust industry. Its study found that more than half of unit trust companies were operating at a loss or were earning less than 5 per cent profit on income. Mr Jocelyn said that, to survive, unit trust companies must build bulk, either by increasing sales or by merging. Investment trusts have a different cost structure, but face the same pressure to generate economies of scale. Faced with the choice of selling more or merging, M&amp;G, Britain's largest independent unit trust company, is following the first approach: it is overhauling its sales methods. The second approach has appealed to Henderson Administration, one of the main independent fund management companies, which is close to acquiring investment trust manager Touche Remnant. Together, the two account for 10 per cent of the UK's investment trust market. For M&amp;G, the need for higher sales is underlined by figures from Datamonitor, a market research firm. These show that M&amp;G's market share has fallen in 1992 to 7.92 per cent, from 8.62 per cent five years before. The group's chief executive, Mr Paddy Linaker, is considering for the first time the establishment of a direct sales force; he has recruited a sales chief from Allied Dunbar, one of the Britain's hardest selling life insurers. Mr Linaker says the company's sales efforts will be aimed at improving the servicing of M&amp;G's network of independent financial advisers (IFAs) who account for two-thirds of its unit trust sales and almost all its life and pensions products. M&amp;G already accounts for about 15 per cent of all unit trusts sold through IFAs; a formidable percentage. Mr Linaker says that, in the long term, he is concerned about the ability of the IFA sector to keep pace with the increasing competition from direct sales agents and so-called tied agents, often building societies who sell the products of one company exclusively. M&amp;G's shift of strategy emphasises the increasing difficulty unit trust groups are having in containing the costs of distribution. The Touche Ross report concluded that all of the unit trust industry's sales methods - independent financial advisers, direct sales agents or tied agents - are carried out at a loss. Simply put, this means that the costs of making a sale are exceeded by the charges levied on customers for it. The only way to remain profitable in these circumstances is to increase funds under management and keep each customer longer. That way, annual fees may rise enough to offset the losses incurred on each sale. If sales cannot be increased, then merger may be necessary. There have been no recent mergers of unit trust managers, but the industry is alive with suggestions that, for some groups, such deals may be the only escape from the profitability squeeze. For investment trust managers, by contrast, distribution costs are not such a headache. Their products, which take the form of shares in publicly quoted investment vehicles, are largely distributed by stockbroking firms, at much lower cost. The drawback of this approach is that it makes it hard to raise fresh funds for investment trusts when the stock market is weak. That keeps investment trust groups from growing large enough to achieve the necessary economies of scale. Henderson and Touche Remnant have sought to avoid this problem by combining to form a bigger group with lower cost ratios. Touche Remnant has had an uneasy relationship with its parent company, Societe Generale since it was acquired three years ago. Funds under management at Touche Remnant have fallen, disappointing the French bank, while Touche Remnant feels it has made little headway in selling its products in Europe. Touche Remnant had decided that if the relationship with SocGen ended, there was no real hope of going it alone. Henderson has also been losing volume: in the six months ended March 31, 1992, it experienced a six per cent drop in funds under management, although profitability rose. The company's poor investment performance in the late 1980s has seen the number of its pension clients fall to 168, from 246 in 1987. The company has fought back by achieving above average investment performance during the past three years and by entering into a series of joint ventures and acquisitions. Several of Touche Remnant's investment trusts have shown above average performance and Henderson is hoping to capitalise on TR's investment expertise. The dilemma common to both unit trust and investment trust managers is this: to achieve adequate profitability, you must sell enough of your products at an acceptable cost. Unit trusts have achieved relatively high volumes, but at a cost which risks becoming increasingly unacceptable. Investment trusts, by contrast, have tolerable distribution costs - but cannot generate the volumes they need. For independent fund managers in both sectors, the writing on the wall is clear: only the big survive. Lex, Page 22</p>

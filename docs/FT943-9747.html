			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kuwaiti bank reports KD26m interim profit National Bank of Kuwait (NBK), the emirate's largest commercial bank, reported net profit after provisions of KD26.25m (Dollars 88m) for the first six months of 1994, Reuter reports from Kuwait. There was no comparison with the corresponding 1993 period because this is the first year Kuwaiti banks have been required to report half-year earnings under new central bank regulations. However, the result is in line with 1993 full-year profits of KD52m. The group's total assets rose to KD3.535bn as of June 30 1994 from KD3.267bn at the end of calendar 1993. The loan portfolio grew to KD1.153bn from KD1.086bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] We go back to the Rwandan problem with our guest,  Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko. Assane Diop met him in  Tunis this morning. He asked him if he really thought that the  Rwandan belligerents will respect the cease-fire agreement  negotiated under the mediation of the Great Lakes countries:    [Begin recording] [Mobutu] I think so. The two parties  promised to respect the cease-fire and its immediate  implementation unconditionally in the presence of the heads of  state of the region.    [Diop] What will your role be later in the implementation of  the cease-fire?    [Mobutu] In the Rwandan conflict, my role has always been  that of a mediator. Now, concerning the follow up and the  supervision of this cease-fire, either all the heads of state of  the region will go to Arusha for the dialogue that will be  started immediately, or each of us will send a delegate or a  representative [to Arusha].    [Diop] And what have you decided about the peacekeeping  force?    [Mobutu] I believe eight African countries have already  agreed to provide the UN with troops.    [Diop] What about France's position on this issue, Mr.  President?    [Mobutu] My deputy foreign minister followed [French Foreign  Minister] Mr. Juppe's statement on TV. As far as I am concerned  there are two things: either the two parties [to the Rwandan  conflict] who have agreed on a cease-fire, behave with honesty  toward each other or they do not behave with honesty. I think  France is not the only state [prepared to become involved].  Other states are ready to intervene to put an end to this  horror. As far as Zaire is concerned, had we intervened in  Rwanda, the situation would be different today.    [Diop] Has your meeting here [in Tunis] helped to remove  suspicion?    [Mobutu] I have two answers to your question: First, those  who have proof that my country supplied arms [to the Rwandan  Government] should provide it. Second, Museveni was the first  to congratulate me on the success of the mini-summit of heads of  state of the region that I chaired on Tuesday. There is no  problem regarding this issue. [Words indistinct] for the  liberation of his country. I think that as far as Rwanda is  concerned, we, the heads of state, absolutely should not be  hypocritical. It is easy to say Zaire is supplying arms. Let  me emphasize again that if Zaire intervened [in Rwanda] the  situation would be different. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / International Company News: Czechs seek new partner for CSA The Czech government is seeking a new partner for CSA, the troubled national airline, in which Air France, the Caisse des Depots and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) jointly have a 40 per cent stake. Mr Jan Strasky, Czech transport minister, said that his government was ready to buy back Air France's stake, and sell it to another investor. He denied negotiations were under way with Delta of the US, and suggested a Czech bank may buy Air France's stake. Analysts say this could only be a temporary solution to the crisis at CSA. Air France, which invested in CSA in 1992 in a move to establish a base in eastern Europe, wants to maintain its participation, but on the condition that the original shareholder agreement is maintained. Air France opposes a proposed change to voting procedures in which at least one of the six foreign shareholders must vote in favour of strategic and financial decisions. CSA was partially privatised in 1992, with about 49 per cent of the shares remaining in state hands. EBRD paid Dollars 30m for its 20 per cent, with the Caisse des Depots, the French state financial institution, and Air France paying the same amount for their shares. The bulk of Air France's investment was in the form of technical assistance, training and modernisation. The Czech airline, burdened with ageing Soviet aircraft, expensive leases on new aircraft contracted before 1992, and a surplus of employees and unprofitable routes, has fallen deeply in the red with losses expected to be about Kcs1.2bn (Dollars 41m) for 1993. The airline's worsening financial situation has caused growing tensions between its foreign shareholders and the government.</p>

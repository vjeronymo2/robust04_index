			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report 'London Metal Exchange COPPER trading was less active than on Friday, with the market looking to settle into a new range following the sudden ending of the technical squeeze on supplies that had been propping up nearby values. Prices ended slightly lower. The newly-established cash/three months contango (forward premium) was also fairly stable, fluctuating between Dollars 11 and Dollars 13 a tonne.  The ZINC market built on last week's trade-influenced rally and broke above the Dollars 900-a-tonne level for three months delivery.  Commission house selling and profit-taking was generally absorbed, and final business was at Dollars 905 a tonne, up Dollars 12. ALUMINIUM prices fell back in late trading after running into selling as the three months position approached Dollars 1,140 a tonne. The price closed at Dollars 1,129.50, down Dollars 8.50 from Friday. At the London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE prices bowed to pressure from the US in the afternoon, with the November contract dropping back to Dollars 1,275 at the close, down 19 on the day. Earlier it had peaked at Dollars 1,306 a tonne, at which point at least one trader thought the market was 'a little overbought'. Compiled from Reuters</p>

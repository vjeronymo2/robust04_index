			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa vowed Monday [14 February] that Japan will make  voluntary efforts to reduce its trade surplus with the United  States before the summit meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7)  major industrial countries in Naples in July.    Hosokawa made the remarks at a meeting of government and  ruling coalition parties after he and U.S. President Bill  Clinton failed during a summit meeting in Washington on Friday  to reach on accord on a new trade framework, officials said.    Hosokawa was quoted as saying it is "not favorable" for  Japan's 50 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. to  continue and the situation "must be improved." He said it is  imperative for both the private sector and the government to  make appropriate efforts.</p>

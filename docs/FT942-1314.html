			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: GE Capital out of Kemper race Kemper, the US insurance, fund management and stockbroking group, was on the verge yesterday of falling to a highly-leveraged Dollars 3.25bn bid from a smaller US insurance concern. Conseco, a 15-year-old company based in Carmel, Indiana, offered Dollars 67 a share in cash and securities for Kemper, topping a nearly Dollars 3bn, or Dollars 60-a-share, all-cash offer from GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of General Electric. Hours after Conseco's bid, GE Capital announced it was dropping out of the race. In a move which appeared designed to throw GE Capital off-balance, Conseco had said its offer would expire on Sunday. GE senior management has been mired recently in the gathering crisis at its Kidder Peabody securities subsidiary, which culminated in a change in management at the firm on Wednesday. Yesterday, GE Capital responded to the new offer with a brief statement wishing Conseco and Kemper success and adding it would not submit a counter-bid. Mr Stephen Hilbert, Conseco's chairman, said he had proposed a merger to Kemper a year ago, but had been rebuffed. The new bid follows Kemper's move to put itself up for sale, a decision which was prompted by the unwanted approach from GE Capital. Conseco has taken over 11 insurance companies since it was set up by Mr Hilbert in 1979 with capital of Dollars 10,000. The scale of its acquisitions grew sharply after 1990, when it set up a buy-out fund to bring in additional finance. GE Capital was one of the partners in that fund, Mr Hilbert said. If successful in its bid for Kemper, Conseco said it would transfer the company's life assurance and real estate businesses to a recently-established fund. This fund has committed equity of Dollars 624m, and its two biggest investors are Conseco and Calpers, the public-sector pension fund, each with Dollars 100m. Conseco said it would pay Dollars 56 in cash for each Kemper share, together with Dollars 11 worth of its own shares, based on the closing price of Dollars 50.50 on Wednesday. It said it had obtained a commitment from Citibank for Dollars 1.22bn of senior bank finance, and a letter from Morgan Stanley expressing confidence in its ability to raise a further Dollars 750m of subordinated debt. The acquisition, and sale of some Kemper businesses to the new buy-out fund, would leave Conseco with gearing of 47 per cent, compared with a current level of around 17 per cent, said Mr Hilbert. He added, though, that the Kemper businesses would bring it secure fee income, enabling it to support the extra debt costs.</p>

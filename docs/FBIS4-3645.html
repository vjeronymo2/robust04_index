			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Lord David Owen, co-  chairman of the Coordination Committee of the International  Conference on Yugoslavia, arrived here from London on Wednesday  [20 April] to discuss with Russia on its participation in the  Bosnian issue.    Thorvald Stoltenberg, another co-chairman of the conference,  is expected to arrive later.    The two international mediators are scheduled to have talks  with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Russia's  participation in adopting political resolutions on the war-torn  Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the six former Yugoslav republics.    Before his departure from London, Lord Owen said Russia  should not only take part in drawing a chart dividing  Bosnia-Herzegovina and attend talks on lifting sanctions against  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but also join the adoption  resolutions on what military actions should be carried out by  the world community in this area, according to the ITAR-TASS  NEWS AGENCY.    On Tuesday, Kozyrev told a news conference: "I would  strongly  recommend the Serb side not to try patience of the international  community."    His deputy Vitaly Churkin said on Wednesday that "all Serbs  (in Bosnia-Herzegovina) are on the brink of catastrophe, which  may have grave consequences for the world."    Moscow's recent tough statements on Bosnian Serbs should not  be viewed as backtracking on its previous policy, Churkin said,  adding that "if Serbs find strength to turn to peace," Russia  will continue acting as a "channel of communication between  Serbs and the world community."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 12 (AFP) -- Aid workers hoped  Sunday to be able to unload urgently-needed medical supplies for  Yemen's war wounded from a Red Cross ship stranded off the coast  of Aden for 24 hours awaiting security guarantees.    The Bonsella has been off the port city since Saturday  trying  to unload its cargo destined for Yemeni hospitals where stocks  are rapidly running out, the International Committee of the Red  Cross (ICRC) said.    Sandro Barana, head of the ICRC delegation in Aden, said  they  hoped to be able to enter the port on Sunday after obtaining  guarantees from rival north and south leaders.    The Bonsella had tried on June 7 to enter the port but was  prevented by the fighting.    The ICRC has been providing aid to both sides in the Yemen's  civil war which broke out on May 5 between troops loyal to  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his southern rival 'Ali Salim  al-Bid.    Northern Yemeni gunners killed two and wounded 22 in Aden  late Saturday in the latest round of fighting which has seen  three ceasefires collapse.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] General Raul Castro Ruz, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces, reiterated on Saturday in Guantanamo  City that Cuba will never renounce its sovereign right over  Caimanera, where the United States maintains a military base  against the will of the Cuban Government and people.    In a speech commemorating the 33d anniversary proclaiming  the  socialist nature of the Cuban Revolution and Militiamen's Day,  Raul Castro denounced the United States, saying that at a time  when the United States is closing bases in its territory and in  other countries to reduce its gigantic military budget, it  maintains its enclave in Caimanera as a point of constant  provocation and humiliation of Cuba.    Castro, who is also second secretary of the Central  Committee  of the Communist Party of Cuba, pointed out that in 1993 and so  far in 1994, a climate of tranquillity has predominated on both  sides of the fence that separates Cuban territory from the U.S.  Naval Base. He said I will do everything in my power so that it  continues this way. That is why, underscored Raul Castro,  necessary measures will be adopted to frustrate the outrageous  attempts by those intending to leave the country through the  Caimanera base -- attempts which not only seriously endanger  their lives, but can also cause warlike incidents of  unpredictable consequences.    The leader of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces called on  the United States to discourage illegal departures by Cubans,  not only those through Guantanamo, but also those using unsound  vessels to reach the Florida coast, where they are allowed to  stay -- something that is not granted to any other foreigners in  the United States.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (3): Modems get faster and smarter - Progress in an important area of communications For most serious portable computer users a modem is another essential piece of kit to be packed alongside the spare battery pack, the power adapter and connecting cables. A modem (modulator/de-modulator) enables a computer to exchange digital data over an older-style analogue telephone line with another machine, typically a head-office computer which is also equipped with a modem. Traditionally, portable modems have commanded a 40 per cent price premium over their desktop counterparts, but new competition is beginning to erode the differential. At the same time, advances in silicon integration and chip design have enabled modem manufacturers to build much smaller devices - including some which fit into the credit-card sized PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) slots found in an increasing number of portables. This new breed of lightweight portable modems offers much faster transmission speeds than its predecessors, with sophisticated data compression and error correction features and increasingly the ability to send and receive faxes as well as data. Until recently, the portable computer user had relatively little choice in terms of modems. Often the only alternatives were paying a premium price for a proprietary internally fitted card-modem, or buying an external cigarette-packet sized portable modem made by one of only a handful of manufacturers. Most devices were capable only of transmitting data at a relatively slow 2,400bps (bits per second), also known as V22bis. While competition was fierce and modem prices fell quickly in the US, in Europe the price of modems approved for connection to the public telephone systems has remained high, sparking controversy in the UK in particular and encouraging a flood of imports that have not been passed by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications. While market analysts and others have argued that the price of approved modems has been maintained artificially in Europe, manufacturers, including the recently formed Modem Approvals Group in the UK, insist that the higher prices reflect the added costs and delays involved in obtaining separate approval for devices for use in each of the main European markets. In the longer term the European Commission plans a streamlined pan-European approvals process, although this is unlikely to be in place much before the end of the decade. In the meantime, however, some US modem manufactures, including US Robotics and Express Technology, have broken ranks and begun selling cut price, high-speed BABT-approved desktop modems in the UK. Modems are also getting faster and smarter. The current business standard is for data transmission at 14,400bps (also known as V32bis) coupled with V42 error correction and V42bis data compression which allow even higher transmission speeds. Most portable models, which currently cost from about Pounds 200 to Pounds 400, can also send facsimile messages. Some notebook computers, such as AST's PowerExec and Bravo ColourPlus ranges, are now being bundled with high-speed PCMCIA modems - in AST's case Pace Micro Communications' new Microlin V32bis fax/modem. Meanwhile a new international standard, dubbed V Fast or V34, covering data transmission at 28,800bps is expected to be agreed by the International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunications standards committee shortly. However, the delay in approving this new standard has already led to a confusing plethora of new proprietary interim standards including 19.2Kbps, V32 turbo and V Fast Class (VFC) promoted by various manufacturers. While modem hardware is becoming increasingly sophisticated, so is the software which operates with it. For example, US-based XcelleNet has developed an integrated suite of remote business applications and communications software, which has been dubbed RemoteWare. RemoteWare, which is already used by more than 400 companies in the US and a growing number of customers in the UK including Windsor Life, the direct sales assurance company, enables head-office IT staff to manage communications - including distributing software - with portable computers in the field over ordinary dial-up telephone lines. Currently most portable modems, including PCMCIA card modems, are designed to be plugged into a wall telephone socket. However some niche products are designed to cope with special situations. For example Tricom, a UK-based manufacturer, sells modems which are designed to work with 'virtually any telephone in the world'. The company's two Pearl fax/modems feature a fold-out device which can be attached to the telephone handset enabling them to be used with pay phones, mobiles, hotel phones or anywhere else where a telephone wall socket is not available. However wireless modems, designed to be used with the existing analogue cellular telephone services or, in the case of the Ram Mobidem, with the new breed of dedicated mobile packet-switched data networks, represent the ultimate in portability since they will allow mobile computer users to transmit or receive data and faxes from virtually anywhere. Eventually, however, there may be no need for modems at all since, at least in theory, it should be possible to plug a digital device, including portable computers, directly into the next generation of mobile telephones operating on digital cellular networks. Some devices, such as personal digital assistants, may even combine the portable data processing and voice telecommunications functions.</p>

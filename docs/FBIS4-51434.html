			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic </F> cooperation, at "International Symposium on China's Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation Strategy in the 1990's":  "Opportunities and Prospects: Basic, Tentative Ideas on  China's Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Development in  the 1990's"]    [Text] Respected Vice Premier Li Lanqing, respected  guests, ladies and gentlemen:    On this occasion of the grand opening of the "International  Symposium on China's Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation  Strategy in the 1990's," please allow me, on behalf of the  sponsoring organization -- China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] -- to extend a warm welcome and  our heartfelt thanks to domestic and foreign guests,  specialists, scholars, and personalities from the industrial and  commercial circles who have come to attend this symposium at our  invitation. This is the first time since reform and opening up  began in China, and even since the founding of the people's  republic, that MOFTEC, as a functional department under the  State Council in charge of foreign trade and economic  cooperation for the whole country, has held a high-level  development strategy symposium in which domestic and foreign  noted personalities and specialists have participated. Many  noted personalities have come to the symposium despite many  claims on their time and many other friends, who have friendly  feelings toward China but who, for certain reasons, have not  been able to come, have extended good wishes to the symposium.  I believe that with the concerted efforts of Chinese and  foreign participants, this symposium will achieve complete  success and its fruitful results, will certainly be written into  the history of China's trade, economic development, and  exchanges with foreign countries.    I would now like to give, for our friends's discussion, a  brief account of the general situation of the development of  China's foreign trade and economic cooperation and of some  tentative basic ideas for the development and reform of foreign  trade and economic cooperation in the 1990's.    As our friends all know, in the 15 years since China began  to  implement the reform and opening up policy at the end of the  1970's, the national economy has developed in a sustained  manner, comprehensive national strength has gradually increased,  and the people's living standards have constantly improved.  Besides, these 15 years have also been a period in which China  has continuously opened wider to the outside world and foreign  trade and economic cooperation have developed rapidly. With the  change of China's economy from a sealed and semi-sealed type  into an open one, and the change from the planned economy to the  socialist market economy, foreign trade and economic cooperation  have occupied a more important position and played a greater  role in the national economy and social development with each  passing day. More and more people have come to realize, through  their personal experience, that China's opening wider to the  outside world and the rapid development of its foreign trade and  economic cooperation have not only promoted the progress of  modernization in China, strengthened comprehensive national  strength, and brought actual benefits to the Chinese people but  have also made important contributions to strengthening  Sino-foreign cooperation and to the development and prosperity  of the world economy and trade.    China's foreign trade and economic cooperation are an  indispensable part of the world economic and trade system and  are not much different in content from other countries.  However, as far as concrete contents are concerned, we usually  divide foreign trade and economic cooperation into six parts  according to the nature and the needs of business management and  of guidance work: 1) The import and export trade of  commodities, that is, the tangible trade which is the foundation  and focus of the entire foreign trade and economic cooperation  of China; 2) the absorption of foreign capital, including the  absorption of direct investment from outside the border, the  setting up of various forms of enterprises with investment made  by foreign businessmen, and various kinds of foreign loans; 3)  the import and export of technology, that is, trade in  technology; 4) contracting projects and providing labor services  abroad; 5) economic and technical aid to foreign countries; and  6) carrying out multilateral trade and economic cooperation with  UN development systems and other international organizations  concerned.    In the 15 years of reform and opening up, China's foreign  trade and economic cooperation have always maintained a good  momentum of development. Calculated according to comparable  items, the import and export trade volume of the whole country  has maintained an average annual growth rate of 16 percent.  This rate is higher than the average annual growth rate of the  GDP and is also higher that the growth rate of world trade  during the same period. In 1993, the total volume of China's  import and export trade reached $195.8 billion, of which exports  accounted for $91.8 billion and imports, $104 billion. China's  position in world trade had risen from 32d in 1978 to 11th and  the percentage of China's total export volume in the world  export trade had risen from 0.75 percent in 1978 to 2.5 percent  in 1993. The product mix of export commodities has been  continuously improved and in the early 1990's, we completed the  change from exporting mainly primary products to mainly  manufactured goods. The percentage of manufactured goods in  exports rose to over 81 percent in 1993. The receipts and  payments in foreign trade are quite normal. Since 1987, the  state foreign exchange reserves have increased annually and by  the end of 1993, the total volume of foreign exchange reserves  was $21.2 billion.    Absorbing foreign capital is a new undertaking which has  been  developed since reform and opening up began. From 1979 to 1993,  the amount of foreign capital absorbed, as stated in agreements,  was $314.2 billion while $137.8 billion of foreign capital was  actually used, of which the amount involved in agreements on  foreign loans was $85.8 billion and $71.8 billion was actually  used. The accumulated total of projects for direct investment  made by foreign businessmen approved throughout the country was  174,000, whose agreements involved $221.9 billion in foreign  capital of $61.8 billion was actually invested. In recent  years, the percentage of projects in China invested in by major  foreign enterprises and famous transnational corporations has  increased and the ways of cooperation in investment have become  increasingly diversified. By the end of 1993, foreign-invested  enterprises across the country which had begun operations  numbered 83,000. They are playing a positive role in the  economic and social development of our country. Last year, the  output value of foreign-invested enterprises exceeded 300  billion yuan and their import and export volume reached $67  billion, accounting for one-third of the country's total import  and export volume. The number of people employed by  foreign-invested enterprises in China exceeds 10 million.    At the same time, China has also made great developments in  exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries in the fields  of technology and labor services. Foreign trade and economic  cooperation are developing from the old pattern with unitary  contents, narrow channels, and relatively low levels to a  pattern of "extensive trade and economic cooperation" in which  commodities, capital, technology, and labor are closely linked  and promote one another.    The 15 years since reform and opening up began is a period  in  which China has made important developments in multilateral and  bilateral trade and economic relations with foreign countries.  For many years, we have constantly deepened the reform of the  foreign trade and economic cooperation structure in accordance  with the demands of the establishment of the socialist market  economy structure and with international standards. On the  other hand, we have upheld the principle of equality and mutual  benefit and made efforts to develop various forms of  multilateral and bilateral trade and economic relation with all  the countries and regions of the world. By the end of 1993,  China had established trade and economic relations with more  than 220 countries and regions of the world and had joined many  international economic organizations, including the World Bank,  the International Monetary Fund, and the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation Forum. Talks on restoring China's status as a  signatory state in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) are currently being held. The development of  multilateral and bilateral trade and economic relations has  provided a good external environment for reform, opening up, and  modernization in China.    Ladies and gentlemen, in the course of developing our  foreign  trade and economic cooperation, various localities and  departments in our country have closely cooperated with one  another and forged ahead in unity. At the same time, many  international organizations and friends in foreign industrial  and commercial circles and other circles have cooperated with us  in a friendly manner. I would like to take this opportunity to  express our heartfelt thanks to Chinese and foreign friends who  have made great efforts to support us and cooperate with us.    We are fully aware that China has carried out modernization  at relatively low economic and technological levels and on a  relatively poor foundation in various aspects. Although China  has made great development in foreign trade and economic  cooperation, we still cannot meet the needs of the situation for  the socialist modernization of our country. Viewed from the  trends of developments in the world economy and trade, and from  the conditions of various aspects of Sino-foreign exchanges, the  potential for development in China's foreign trade and economic  cooperation is still quite great.    At present, the level of China's foreign trade and  economic cooperation is still low and the ties and exchanges  between China's economy and the world economy are still  insufficient. In particular, the national economy is developing  at a relatively high speed, the growth in exports lacks  strength, and the pressure of balancing receipts and payments in  trade is increasing. Last year, there was a deficit of $12.2  billion. In a certain sense, if this situation is not changed,  it will affect the expansion of all trade and economic exchanges  with foreign countries and will not be conducive to giving full  play to the tremendous potential of the market in China. The  investment environment in China has apparently improved but, to  meet the needs of further investment and cooperation properly,  we must make greater efforts to continue to perfect the  investment environment. We must also further improve the  quality and raise the level of projects invested in by foreign  businessmen. A new round of reforms in the foreign trade and  economic cooperation structure is being carried out in China  and, in the course of such reform, the tasks of maintaining good  operational procedures, standardizing the behavior of  enterprises, and changing the operational mechanism in foreign  trade enterprises will also be very heavy.    The 1990's will be a crucial period of modernization in  China  in which China wants to attain the second-step strategical goal  of modernization and to upgrade the national economy on the  basis of optimizing structure, increasing economic results, and  speeding up technological progress. The tasks are very heavy  and arduous.    In the 1990's, the supply and demand conditions in China's  economy will change greatly. With the accelerated establishment  of the socialist market economy structure, the environment  system for economic operation in China will also see a series of  important changes. A conspicuous characteristic is the economic  operation mechanism will move further toward the rules of  international economic operations. It can be expected that in  the course of doing so, China will encounter many opportunities  and challenges in the development of its foreign trade and  economic cooperation.    What should particularly be pointed out is that the 14th CPC  National Congress made it clear the goal of the reform of the  economic structure of our country was the establishment of the  socialist market economy structure; and the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee also comprehensively  and specifically worked out the magnificent blueprint for the  establishment of the socialist market economy structure in our  country. At present, a new round of comprehensive and  coordinated reforms of the economic structure is being carried  out in China. It is planned that the basic framework of the  socialist market economy structure will be established before  2000 and the reforms of the foreign trade structure will also be  further deepened in a comprehensive manner. This series of  reforms will totally change the environment systems for the  operation of the economy and foreign trade and economic  cooperation of China, lead to the gradual establishment of a  mechanism for foreign trade operations which conforms with the  current rules governing the international economy, and provide a  guarantee in terms of system to ensure the sustained, rapid, and  healthy development [chixu kuaisu jiankang fazhan 2170 4958 1816  6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of foreign trade and economic  cooperation. In the middle and late 1990's, China's national  economy will still maintain a relatively rapid growth and  foreign trade and economic cooperation will also have a more  solid material foundation for development.    In the middle and late 1990's, with the further development  of the multipolarization of the world politics and economy,  peace and development will still be the main theme of the times,  economic competition will gradually replace political and  military confrontation and become the main melody of the times,  and competition in science and technology will become an  important foundation for competition in comprehensive national  strength. Since the end of the Cold War, more and more people  with breadth of vision have realized that trade and economic  cooperation have become an increasingly important field in  international exchanges today. Because of the influence of  factors such as a widened gap between the north and the south,  continual regional conflicts, and the debt crisis, it will be  difficult for the "golden situation" of the 1960's and the  1970's to reappear in the world economy and trade. Nevertheless,  the general trend of the world economy and trade in the 1990's  will be a growing one. The economy of the Asia-Pacific region,  mainly East Asia and the West Pacific region, will maintain a  relatively fast growth rate. At present, the pace of the  economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and the  subregion is tending to further quicken. Therefore, with the  new achievements made in the readjustment of the economic  policies of various countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the  economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region, mainly East Asia,  will continue to be faster than other parts of the world in the  1990's and the region will become an increasingly important  motive force promoting the development of the world economy.  This has become the consensus of almost all countries and of  most specialists. This situation is very gratifying to us.    Another gratifying matter in international trade is the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks which attracted  worldwide attention and the signing of the final document.  After that, the international multilateral trade structure was  further strengthened. We hope that within that multilateral  framework, various forms of trade protectionism can be curbed  and the global trade environment can become more harmonious and  open. I think this will be greatly welcomed by all our friends  who are engaged in trade and economic cooperation with China.    The following factors in the course of the development of  China's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the 1990's are  quite worthy of attention: A) The quickened development of the  tendency to form regional groups in the world economy will  inevitably lead to the tendency of the partial replacement of  interregional trade by trade within a region, that is, the  so-called "trade shift effect." Besides, trade protectionism  will be very popular in many fields of international trade.  Some countries will even politicize economic relations,  advocate unilateralism, and exert pressure on their trade  partners through unilateral measures. This will directly  threaten the operation of the multilateral trade structure and  will be quite harmful to the development of China's foreign  trade and economic cooperation. B) As a developing country,  China's production and technological levels are low, the  economic development of different regions and trades is quite  uneven, and China is still at a relatively low level in the  international economic and trade system. C) In the course of  changing the domestic economic and trade structure, conflicts  between the new structure and the old are unavoidable. This  means that in the course of implementing the strategy of the  development of foreign trade and economic cooperation, we must  properly handle the relationship between reform and development.    Faced with the general situation of the international  economic and trade development, China should, in the 1990's,  seize the opportunities, take up the challenges, formulate, in  light of China's reality and extensively absorbing and using as  reference successful international experience, a correct  strategy for foreign trade and economic cooperation to give  guidance to the development and reform of its foreign trade and  economic cooperation, make overall planning, and painstakingly  implement such planning in a bid to attain the strategic goal of  speeding up the process of modernization.    According to the new demands put forward by the domestic and  foreign environments and the modernization of China in the  1990's, considering the needs of further deepening reform,  opening wider to the outside world, and promoting development  and in light of the reality of the development of foreign trade  and economic cooperation, China must, in its foreign trade and  economic cooperation in the 1990's, implement the "big economic  and trade strategy" which is based on import and export trade;  enables mutual infiltration and coordinated development of  commodities, capital, technology, and labor service cooperation  and exchanges; has the joint participation of departments of  foreign trade and economic cooperation, production, science,  technology, and finance; and which upgrades foreign trade and  economic cooperation enabling it to give better play to its  strategical role of promoting economic growth, structural  readjustment, and technological progress, and increasing  economic results.    We shall further develop foreign trade and economic  cooperation in depth and in breadth to form a pattern which is  open, through various channels, to the whole country and the  outside world in all directions and in various fields. On this  basis we shall, in accordance with the requirements of  international trade standards and norms, further reform the  economic structure, especially the foreign trade and economic  cooperation structure, speed up the change of the enterprise  operational mechanism, speed up the convergence of the domestic  economy and the world economy, and establish a basic pattern of  China's open-type economic system.    We shall speed up the general merging of various businesses  of foreign trade and economic cooperation, mainly the merging of  foreign trade, utilization of foreign capital, making investment  abroad, and other businesses of economic and technical  cooperation with foreign countries, and we shall bring about an  overall and coordinated development of commodity trade,  technology trade, and service trade. With the prerequisite of  giving support to and actively participating in the global  multilateral trade system, we shall strive to bring about an  organic integration of multilateral trade and economic  cooperation, regional trade and economic cooperation, and  bilateral trade and economic cooperation, and form joint forces  as a whole for China's participation in international  competition. With the reform of the management structure and  operational mechanism for exchange rates, taxation, and tariffs,  we shall combine the macroregulation and control of foreign  trade and economic cooperation with the macroregulation and  control of the national economy, and regard the sustained and  stable development of foreign trade and economic cooperation and  the maintenance of a balance in international receipts and  payments as the direct target of state macroeconomic regulation  and control.    To meet the demands of economic development in foreign trade  and economic cooperation in the 1990's, we shall take the road  of intensive development, make efforts to improve quality,  further implement the strategy of "winning victories with  quality," make greater efforts to "optimize structure, speed up  technological progress, and increase economic results," and  strive to complete, before 2000, the change from an export  product mix which mainly consists of textile products to an  export product mix which mainly consists of electrical,  mechanical, heavy industry, chemical, and new- and high-tech  products; and the change from an export product mix which mainly  consists of rough-machining and low value-added products to an  export product mix which mainly consists of finished-machining  and high value-added products, bringing about a relatively big  improvement of the structure and economic result of foreign  trade and considerably improving the quality and economic  results in using foreign capital, investment abroad, and other  businesses of foreign economic and technological cooperation.    Market pluralization is an important principle for expanding  and developing our foreign trade and economic cooperation. The  goal of market pluralization is, through our efforts, to  gradually form a rational market structure with the Asia-Pacific  market as the focus, peripheral markets as the support, and with  a balanced layout of markets in the developed countries and  those of the developing countries, to maintain a balanced and  coordinated development of foreign trade and economic relation  and to develop foreign trade and economic relations in all  directions.    We shall promote the rational division of work among the  various localities. In the 1990's, in the links of the  development of export-oriented industries and foreign trade and  economic operation of various localities in China, we will form  a work division pattern which facilitates the division and work  and cooperation and which can give full play to the strong  points of the various localities and enables them to have their  own characteristics. We shall basically eliminate the  irrational phenomenon of duplication in the development of  export-oriented industries in various localities, promote the  formation of a unified domestic market, reduce contradictions  and conflicts between localities, and form a pattern of rational  and coordinated development of foreign trade and economic  cooperation between various localities.    In accordance with the basic demands of reform, opening up,  and modernization in China in the 1990's, we shall adopt a  series of important, practical, and effective measures and  strive to attain the strategic goal of China's foreign trade and  economic cooperation satisfactorily.    Active participation in the global multilateral trade system  and making efforts to develop multilateral trade and economic  relations have a direct bearing on the improvement in the  external environment for China's foreign trade and economic  cooperation. China firmly supports the international  multilateral trade system represented by GATT and is stepping up  work in talks on restoring its status as a GATT signatory state.  China's determination to participate in the international  multilateral system is very firm and we have made tremendous  efforts in this respect. In accordance with the requirements of  international trade standards and norms, China has carried out a  series of important reforms in the foreign trade structure, its  market access conditions have markedly improved, and the  transparency of its economic and trade system has greatly  increased. Through a new round of reforms which begin this  year, China's economic and trade structure and the international  rules will further converge. The increase in the extent of  opening China's market has a positive impact on the development  of the world economy and trade.    As we all know, China comprehensively participated in the  Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, made positive  contributions to the success of the talks, and signed the final  document from the talks last month. Besides, the conclusion of  the Uruguay Round of talks has also added new meaning to China's  reentry to GATT. Talks on China's reentry to GATT have lasted  for eight years. We are willing to work, together with all  signatories, for strengthening of the global multilateral  economic and trade system and to make due contributions to the  prosperity and development of the world economy and trade. I  would like to take this opportunity to thank the great majority  of signatories for their support for China's reentry to GATT and  hope certain signatories will earnestly fulfill their promises  and actively give support to China's reentry to GATT.    I have already mentioned that, in recent years, the tendency  to form regional groups in the world economy has been developing  at a higher speed. We hope that the establishment and operation  of regional economic and trade groups and the global  multilateral trade standards, can converge and these groups  should not become exclusive protective organizations.  Proceeding from this point, China takes a positive attitude  toward the strengthening of economic cooperation in the  Asia-Pacific region. We stand for following the principle of  "mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, opening to each  other, and common prosperity" in carrying out economic  cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and do not agree with  trade protectionism. On the basis of strengthening the global  multilateral trade system, we will promote deepening economic  cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and make greater  contributions to the growth of the world economy and trade.    To better develop multilateral and bilateral trade and  economic relations, we will continue to follow the principle of  equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation, oppose  exerting pressure on another party in trade and economic  exchanges, and disagree with unilateralism or other forms of  trade protectionism.    We will constantly deepen the reform of the foreign trade  and  economic cooperation structure in accordance with the demands of  the operation of China's socialist market economy and the rules  for the operation of the international economy. At present,  while promoting reforms in the taxation and financial fields, we  are making efforts to carry out a new round of reforms of the  foreign trade structure. The core of the reforms is to bring  about a unified foreign exchange rate and to institute a unified  and managed floating renminbi exchange rate system based on  market supply and demand. The new structure has operated  normally for the past four months and the momentum of the  development of import and export trade is very good. This has  further strengthened our confidence and determination to deepen  the reforms and to carry them out to the end. It can be  expected that following this round of reforms, the operational  mechanism of China's foreign trade enterprises will become more  standardized and macromanagement will become more scientific and  standardized. We will basically complete the establishment of  the framework of a new foreign trade structure in the last few  years of this century.    China upholds the policy of basically balanced import and  export trade, that is, on the basis of increasing exports, China  opens its domestic market to all trade partners and opposes all  forms of trade protectionism. We will adopt positive measures  to achieve a balanced development of import and export trade.  This means we will make efforts to increase sources of export  goods, widen trade channels, develop foreign markets to increase  exports, and increase the capacity for payment for imports in a  bid to achieve a positive trade balance. I hope our trade  partners can adopt an objective and fair attitude toward China's  exports, abolish discriminative treatment against China,  earnestly observe international trade rules and norms, and  safeguard the fair and open multilateral trade system to promote  a sustained development of international trade. We understand  that the industrial and commercial circles in all countries of  the world have a keen interest in the tremendous potential of  the market in China. However, it is quite evident that only with  a sustained growth in exports will the momentum of the growth in  China's imports be maintained and the tremendous potential of  the market in China tapped. According to the needs of  modernization, the total volume of China's imports will reach $1  trillion in the coming seven years.    Active and effective absorption of investment by foreign  businessmen is an important aspect of China's efforts to expand  foreign trade and economic exchanges. We will maintain the  continuity of our policy toward foreign capital and continue to  encourage foreign businessmen to make investment in China. We  will sum up experience, keep abreast of the new situation, and  give clearer guidance in terms of production sectors for foreign  businessmen to make investment. In accordance with the  industrial policy of China, we will absorb more foreign capital  for carrying out projects at a higher technological level and on  a relatively larger scale, encouraging foreign businessmen to  use various forms proven to be effective abroad to make  investment in China's basic industries and infrastructure so  that investment by foreign businessmen and China's strategy for  economic development can converge. In this way, we will also be  able to provide better conditions for ensuring the interests of  foreign businessmen in making investment.    In the course of deepening reforms of the economic and trade  structure, we have always paid attention to respecting and  protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign  businessmen. I would like to tell you that in the new round of  reforms of the foreign trade structure, we will institute the  foreign exchange settlement and sale system in state-owned  foreign trade enterprises and will adopt a transitional method  for all foreign-invested enterprises. That is, we will allow  them to continue to keep their spot exchange account to  facilitate their production and operation, including operational  activities of imports and exports. Another example is that in  the new round of reforms of the taxation structure, the tax  burden of foreign-invested enterprises will not increase on the  whole and we have worked out corresponding compensation methods  for individual enterprises whose tax burden has actually  increased, to ensure that foreign businessmen can really enjoy  the preferential conditions stated in the laws of China and in  agreements on cooperation. None of our preferential policies  for foreign businessmen to make investment have changed. We  will improve unremittingly the investment environment and create  conditions for foreign businessmen to enjoy the same "treatment  as for Chinese nationals." We will make greater efforts to  introduce technology, improve the methods and structure of  introducing technology, and take an open road of introduction;  at the same time, we will energetically develop international  technological cooperation and increase technology imports. In  this field, we will constantly raise the level of protection for  intellectual property so that trade in technology will develop  along a healthy and standardized track.    We will continue to contract more projects abroad and to  develop the market and the scope of business and cooperation of  labor service. We will also continue to increase the  international competitive power of China's service trades such  as financial insurance for foreigners, transportation for  foreigners, and contracting labor serviced abroad. We will keep  abreast of the development of international trade and gradually  open service trades to foreign countries. At the same, we will  make great efforts to raise the level of service trades. While  opening China's service markets to the outside world, we will  make efforts to develop the international markets, nurture and  develop service trades with strong points, raise China's service  trades to a higher level, and achieve a basic balance in the  receipts and payments in China's service trades.    We are making great efforts to strengthen building of the  legal system regarding foreign trade and economic cooperation to  ensure foreign trade and economic enterprises operate according  to law and to constantly raise the level of macromanagement  according to law. China's first "Foreign Trade Law" has been  submitted to the ongoing Seventh Meeting of the Eighth National  People's Congress Standing Committee for examination and  discussion; and laws and decrees to supplement the "Foreign  Trade Law" are being drafted. Within three years, we will  basically establish a relatively sound law and decree system for  foreign trade and economic cooperation. To meet the demands of  the operation of the new tax and financial systems, we will  firmly grasp the improvement and perfection of the export tax  reimbursement system and strengthen and perfect the foreign  trade credit system and the risk mechanism in accordance with  current international practices.    In the course of developing foreign trade and economic  cooperation, we will continue to give play to the strong points  of coastal areas in the new situation. At the same time, we  will speed up work to open the hinterland faster to the outside  world and to bring about a situation wherein the coastal areas  and the hinterland complement each other in terms of their  strong points and develop together. The coastal areas were  opened to the outside world earlier and the level of their  economic development is also relatively higher. From now on, we  will give support to coastal areas so that they can optimize  their structure at a relatively higher starting point and can  continue to develop. Regarding the vast hinterland, we will  concern ourselves more with it and give it more support. We  will promote development with opening up, pay special attention  to giving play to the resources of the hinterland, encourage  foreign businessmen to make investment in exploiting resources,  and gradually establish hinterland industries which have a  competitive edge. We will also use successful practices in  regional development abroad for reference and will adopt  necessary preferential policies for opening up and developing  the hinterland. The central and western regions are the hopes  for China's economic development in the next century.  Farsighted and enterprising entrepreneurs will find the regions  full of opportunity and hope if they make study tours there.    Ladies and gentlemen, the world is advancing toward the 21st  century and opening up, readjustment, and development are the  common tasks of the world economy. China's policy of opening to  the outside world is firm and unshakable and China's  determination to further develop its trade and economic  relations with all countries in the world is also firm and  unshakable. China will make increasingly important  contributions to the prosperity of the world economy and trade  through continuously opening wider to the outside world and  developing its foreign trade and economic relation with other  countries in depth. We sincerely hope that all Chinese and  foreign noted personalities, specialists, scholars, and  entrepreneurs present will put forward their valuable  suggestions and proposals on developing China's foreign trade  and economic cooperation in the late 1990's, will increase  exchanges and cooperation with us, and will help us improve our  work and raise our level of policymaking decisions. Finally, I  want to express my sincere thanks again to all present and to  personalities from all countries, regions, and international  organizations in the world who have enthusiastically shown  concern for, and given support to, China's foreign trade and  economic cooperation.    I wish our guests good health and I wish the symposium  success.    That is all. Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] A new era in Malaysian-Cambodian relations has begun  with the three-day visit this week of Prime Minister Dr.  Mahathir Mohamed to Phnom Penh. The ties between the peoples of  the two countries had begun centuries ago. The relations have  always been cordial. In Dr. Mahathir's words, Malaysia will  take every means to improve the existing interaction. Cambodia  has always remained close to the hearts of Malaysians. The  civil war that had raged in that country with the government  facing the lots of the three guerrilla factions had been a  matter of deep concern for the Malaysian Government and people.  Malaysia was in the forefront among countries that wanted  Cambodia to return to a peaceful era. Malaysia played a leading  role in the Cambodian peace process and in the United Nations  Transitional Authority in Cambodia or UNTAC.    Malaysia has always felt that peace in Cambodia is vital for  the stability and prosperity of the Southeast Asian region. In  his talks with the Cambodian president [as heard], Prince  Norodom Sihanouk, and co-prime ministers, Prince Ranarridh and  Mr. Hun Sen, Dr. Mahathir invited Cambodia to consider becoming  a member of the ASEAN family. With the participation of  Cambodia and possibly Vietnam and Laos, ASEAN can turn into a  vital organization for regional cooperation. A more united  Southeast Asia will make countries of the region stronger and  more capable of facing the challenges of the future in a world  that is becoming increasingly competitive. The Malaysian  premier expressed his hope that ASEAN with the participation of  all the ten countries of the region, including Myanmar [Burma]  can work with the other countries of East Asia to develop a more  resilient and progressive pattern of prosperity in the region.  Already, Southeast Asia is now acknowledged as one of the  fastest growing economic regions in the world. With the entry  of the other four countries, ASEAN can become an entity that  will be looked upon with awe and admiration.    A fruitful outcome of the Malaysian premier's visit to  Cambodia is the agreement between the two countries to set up a  joint commission to enhance bilateral cooperation. Cambodia is  already benefiting from the Malaysian technical assistance  program. It has also requested Malaysia's help in the areas of  training, rural development, oil refinery and exploration,  forest management, and the rehabilitation of its palm oil and  rubber plantations. Cambodia has also sought Malaysia's advice  on the setting up of free trade zones. Malaysia is ready to  send its officers to conduct seminars and training courses for  their Cambodian counterparts. Cambodia has opened its doors to  foreign business investment. The large number of businessmen  and entrepreneurs in Dr. Mahathir's delegation is reflective of  Malaysia's keen interest in that country's economic  reconstruction and development program.</p>

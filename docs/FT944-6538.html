			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Green's Heron offer clears its first hurdle Mr Steven Green's HNV Acquisition yesterday cleared the first hurdle to gaining control of Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, by getting substantial support from ordinary shareholders for his offer. Acceptances were received in respect of 54 per cent of ordinary shares, while a further 38 per cent are held by Heron's banks, which are understood to have agreed to support the offer. The Annual Meeting was held yesterday, and all the resolutions were passed by more than 95 per cent of voters, including changes to the company's articles of association, which remove a number of standard shareholder rights. However, the key to Mr Green's success remains in the support of the senior and junior bondholders, who will meet tomorrow. Swiss Bank Corporation, which is advising HNVA, said that 'voting instructions indicate substantial support for these bondholder resolutions'. A sufficient number of votes have been received to ensure that there will be a quorum at the bondholders' meetings. Heron's investors are being offered a cash value that represents 45 per cent of the nominal value of senior bonds, 6 per cent of the value of junior bonds, and Pounds 7.50 per 1,000 ordinary shares. Parties who looked at Heron when it was auctioned earlier this year, have suggested that HNVA was offering a full price for the company. Mr Gary Klesch, a dissident bondholder, said last week that there was another interested party who might present a package which would offer a lower risk means of participating in the future recovery of Heron. No buyer has emerged, and Heron is adamant that the only alternative to HNVA is liquidation, which would bring in less than Mr Green's cash offer, while involving far longer delays in payment.</p>

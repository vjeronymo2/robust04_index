			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RANCHO BERNARDO  </P> <P> U.S. Border Patrol agents intercepted a tractor-trailer rig late Tuesday packed  with 105 illegal aliens on Interstate 15 near Rancho Bernardo, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Agents stopped the truck about 11:30 p.m. and arrested the driver, Frank  Ellinger, 45, of National City on suspicion of smuggling aliens, patrol  spokesman Michael Gregg said.  </P> <P> The truck was apparently headed toward the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> The stop is part of a continuing investigation by agents of the San Diego  sector that began last November and has led to the arrests of five people.  </P> <P> The group of aliens consisted of 102 Mexican nationals, three Jamaicans, and  one each from Guatemala and Honduras. Included in the group were 30 women and  children.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported, Gregg said.  </P> <P> "They were all in pretty good shape," he said. "They were not in the back of  the trailer for very long before it was stopped. It could have been a different  story if it had been in the daytime."  </P> <P> Most of the aliens were deported, but several were held as material witnesses,  Gregg said.  </P></p>

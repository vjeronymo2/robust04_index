The KDH does not deem it suitable to consider the use of  Hungarian as official language in Slovakia, Simko said. It is  necessary, however, to look for a feasible solution which would  make it possible to use the mother tongue in administrative  contact, he added.    Simko said that the Komarno, south Slovakia, meeting of  January 8 had not contributed to straightening up of the  relations between Slovaks and Hungarians.</p>

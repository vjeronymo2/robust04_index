			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Railtrack's proposed contracts upset train operators Potential train operators have attacked Railtrack, the company set up to take over British Rail's track and signalling after privatisation, for abusing what they see as its dominant position in contract negotiations. The proposed contracts appear to offer operators the repayment of their track charge if a bridge or stretch of line becomes unusable but to provide no compensation for any loss of income. 'The terms and conditions clearly transfer all the risk and obligations of running a railway to the franchisees,' said Mr Peter Field, managing director of South West Trains, which hopes to win a franchise on routes from London Waterloo. 'We need guarantees that provide an absolute assurance that the infrastructure will be looked after. The performance regime really has to hurt Railtrack if it does not deliver.' Mr Chris Green, who is due to take over the running of ScotRail next month with plans ultimately for a buy-out, said: 'There should be a sharing of risk, but at the moment it feels like a one-way transfer. The consequences of a bridge washing away for three months would be huge in terms of the train operator's income but low in terms of the cost of bridge replacement to Railtrack.' He also called for contracts that take account of economic changes beyond the control of the operators, with Railtrack's charges falling in a downturn. Another area of disagreement has emerged over timetables. One prospective franchisee, who declined to be named, said Railtrack was pressing for very frequent changes to allow it to slot in more trains if a new operator came along. That would pose difficulties to existing operators, he said. Railtrack responded that it was negotiating 'in the open' and under the scrutiny of the government, the franchise director, who is to arrange the sale of BR franchises, and the British Rail board.

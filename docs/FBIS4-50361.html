			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Focus" by Geoffrey Murray: "Japan Vying To provide </F> China's Planned Bullet trains"]    [Text] Beijing, May 13 KYODO -- China hopes to have a  high- speed railway line linking the capital with Shanghai in  operation by the end of the century and Japan, France and  Germany are competing to supply the technology.    As the pioneer of the high-speed rail technology with its  shinkansen "bullet train," Japan is a prime candidate to provide  the necessary equipment but it faces strong competition from  France's TGV and Germany's ICE.    Shen Zhijie, chief engineer of the Ministry of Railways,  said  China has a strong capability in building railways but it needs  to import some key technologies and equipment, including the  rolling stock, communications and automatic train control  systems.    Japan, France and Germany all offered certain advantages and  China would choose the model that best suited its conditions,  Shen said, stressing, however, that it is still too early to  predict which country will win the race.    Also still under consideration is the way the railway will  be  financed, given that the cost of the line is currently estimated  at more than 8 billion dollars.    According to Shen, the possibilities include raising money  from local and central government sources and business sources,  as well as issuing stocks or borrowing internationally.    The existing Beijing-Shanghai railway, connecting five large  cities each with a population of over two million, is the  busiest in the country, with its trains handling an estimated  five times more passengers and cargo than the national average.  The line accounts for 2.8 percent of the country's total track  length but carries 14.3 percent of all passengers and freight.    Various local and foreign experts have agreed that the best  solution is to build a high-speed passengers-only link running  parallel to the existing track, which would be devoted entirely  to freight haulage.    Running at speeds up to 250 kilometers an hour, the bullet  train would slash the traveling time between Beijing and  Shanghai -- the nation's political and commercial capitals,  respectively -- from more than 17 hours at present to about  seven hours, Shen said.    With rapid economic growth, particularly in the eastern part  of the country encompassing the coastal development zones, China  faces severe transportation bottlenecks, opening up the prospect  for a number of high-speed rail links between key cities.    One is already under construction between Xiamen -- one of  the five "special economic zones" set up in the 1980s to  spearhead market-oriented economic reform -- and the city of  Fuzhou some 270 km away, using Japanese technology and a large  capital injection. The cost of the project is estimated at 2.1  billion dollars.    But China is not only in the market for high-speed railway  equipment. There is growing demand for subway networks in  various major cities to overcome the surface road congestion  that threatens to throttle the country's explosive development.    Given the vast distances involved, railways will continue to  play a key role in the movement of goods and people -- an  estimated 1.04 billion passengers will be carried on the  national network this year.    Government experts point out that China only has 54,000 km  of  track at present for a land mass of 9.6 million square  kilometers with a population of 1.2 billion people.    By comparison, India has 60,000 km of track for a country of  2.9 million sq km, while the United States, with a land mass  close to that of China, has more than 200,000 km of railway.    The present system can cope with only an estimated  two-thirds  of the goods requiring shipment. The Ministry of Railways chief  economist, Zhang Youmin, estimates that "rail gridlock" cost the  country more than 57 billion dollars last year.    China needs at least 100,000 km of track, Zhang said, and  current plans call for expansion to 70,000 km by the end of the  century.    The creation of separate high-speed passenger lines to leave  the way free for freight on existing major lines would be an  important contribution to easing the strain.    In the major cities, meanwhile, the emphasis increasingly is  on going underground. Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai have  extensive subway systems which are being expanded, providing  increasing opportunities for foreign involvement.    French and German companies have done very well out of the  Guangzhou subway development, but Hitachi and Mitsubishi of  Japan have managed to get their foot in the door.    Shenzhen, the most successful of the special economic zones,  situated close to Hong Kong, is now seeking central government  approval for construction to begin next year on the first phase  of its subway system, involving just over 25 km of track linking  the local airport with the city center.    And moving inland, Chengdu and Chongqing in Sichuan Province  are both seeking foreign technology and capital for their own  underground railway systems.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, since the Commission has deferred the requirement that oil pipelines file Form No. 6 on an electronic medium, in addition to paper filing, &sect;385.2011 of Part 385 of Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations will not be changed as proposed in the NOPR at this time. The Commission will issue a final rule on this subject at an appropriate time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Discussion of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Order No. 561, the Commission stated that it would be the pipelines' responsibility in the future to perform depreciation studies to establish revised depreciation rates for oil pipelines. The Commission further stated that the specific requirements for such studies would be developed in this proceeding. <FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>  In the NOPR, the Commission proposed a new Part 347 to its regulations, encompassing the information required to be submitted by oil pipeline companies to establish revised depreciation rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs, &para; 30,985 (1993), at 30,967&hyph;8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentors provided comments concerning the process for the establishment and/or changing of depreciation rates for common carrier property. Based upon a review of these comments, several modifications will be made to the regulations as proposed in the NOPR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentor <FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>  suggested that the transmittal letter, which submits a request for new or changed depreciation rates, only be filed with the Commission and not sent to all shippers and subscribers. The Commission disagrees. It will continue to require the transmittal letter to be sent to all shippers and subscribers. Depreciation rates as set or as subsequently modified can have a considerable effect on a pipeline's rates; and as such, shippers need to be kept informed as to when the rates are being requested to be established or changed. As Davis states, ``To apprise shippers and subscribers of the change in the depreciation rate is alerting them that a forthcoming rate change could be challenged on the basis of the rate of depreciation.'' <FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>  If a change in the tariff rate is requested resulting from an approved change in the underlying depreciation rates, then protests filed because of a lack of adequate information about the change in depreciation rates could be prevented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Davis, p. 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Modifications to the proposed regulations (18 CFR 347.1) which delineate the information which should be filed when seeking to establish or change depreciation rates have been requested by several commentors. <FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>  As to those claims that certain data are not available, the Commission has provided in &sect;347.1(e) for consideration of individual circumstances. Section 347.1(e) states, in part: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Davis, Marathon, and AOPL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Modifications, additions, and deletions to these data elements should be made to reflect the individual circumstances  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> of the carrier's properties and operations. [emphasis added]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This statement allows for the modification of the data elements for individual pipelines to account for, among other things, information which is not available to the pipeline. Therefore, a pipeline which does not have up-to-date engineering maps <FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>  could submit ``simplified maps or drawings that contain such information *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Where information is not available, that data element may be omitted by simply stating that the information is not available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Davis, pp. 3&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comments concerning oil field reserve and production information <FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>  are well taken and that portion of the regulations [18 CFR 347.1(e)(5)(ix)] is modified from that previously proposed to require only that the pipeline disclose the fields or areas from which crude oil is obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Davis, pp. 4&hyph;5, Marathon, pp. 5&hyph;6, and AOPL, pp. 40&hyph;41.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, the comments concerning the proprietary nature of individual shipper information are also well taken. <FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>  The portion of the proposed regulations in 18 CFR 347.1(e)(vi) is modified to require that pipelines supply only a list of shipments and their associated receipt points, delivery points, and volumes for the most current year. Such information shall be provided in such a format to prevent disclosure of information which would violate the ICA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Davis, p. 4; AOPL, pp. 41&hyph;42.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, as requested by AOPL, <FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>  all information submitted pursuant to 18 CFR 347.1 will be publicly available unless specific confidential treatment is sought by the filing carrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AOPL, p. 40, n. 69.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Depreciation Regulations Adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other than as discussed above, the Commission is adopting depreciation regulations as proposed in the NOPR. The Commission adopts the following regulations as new Part 347 of the Commission's regulations, which requires the following information to be filed by oil pipeline companies to justify a request for either new or changed carrier account depreciation rates:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. A brief summary of the general principles on which the proposed depreciation rates are based ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  why the economic life of the pipeline section is less than the physical life).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. An explanation of the organization, ownership, and operation of the pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. A table of the proposed depreciation rates by primary carrier account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. An explanation of the average remaining life on a physical basis and on an economic basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

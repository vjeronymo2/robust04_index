			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Severn Bridge tolls to rise 9% Tolls to cross the Severn bridge on the M4 motorway between England and Wales will rise almost 9 per cent in the new year, taking the cost for a car to Pounds 3.70 from Pounds 3.40, Roland Adburgham writes. The announcement yesterday by Severn River Crossing, the consortium which operates the bridge, provoked an angry reaction from motoring and haulage organisations. Tolls rose nearly 10 per cent in January this year. Under a formula set by the Severn Bridges Act, the coming increase will be the last allowed above the rate of inflation. The tolls, which are charged in the westbound direction only, are used to maintain the bridge and finance the Pounds 300m second Severn bridge, under construction three miles downstream. The toll for a heavy truck will rise by Pounds 1 to Pounds 11.10, prompting fears that this will cause a further increase in traffic avoiding the bridge by taking a detour through Gloucestershire. In June a study for the Highways Agency showed about 2,700 vehicles a day were doing this.</p>

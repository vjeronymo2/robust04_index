			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Technology: Consultant's Critique - Software at Work David Field, the AFC engineer, reminded me of the poor marine engineer who appears in disaster films - up to his chest in water while the passengers waltz on the deck above. Many of the systems he is using are obsolete. This is bad news for everyone except a few contract programmers. They are able to cash in on the rarity value of their skills and charge a premium - often twice the going rate. It is true that whatever decision you make about computer strategy could be wrong. London Underground chose Pick as the basis of its systems. At the time, it looked to have advantages over systems such as Unix. Often, blind chance seems to decree which will be the swan and which the turkey. For this reason, companies must remain flexible in their IT strategy. Those that declare that open systems are the only way forward may be left in the wake of the Windows NT rush. Technicians are fond of declaring which is the best operating system but that often has little to do with its success or failure in the market. I saw one chap at the Underground copying data manually from one screen to another all day. The two systems were unable to talk to each other. It was a depressing sight - human beings were never meant for such drudgery. Planned enhancements to Divorced will free him for more productive work. The Underground seems plagued with such incompatibility - the old Romance system passes data between two systems on magnetic tapes. The format used is common to neither system. One computer converts data into that format then the other converts it back. I feel that the benefits put forward are a long way from real management information. While the old system was horrendous, the new one is in danger of standing in isolation. It is essential that any IT strategy embrace all the aims of the company rather than taking a parochial view.

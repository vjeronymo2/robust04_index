			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Geest warns of second half loss - Shares fall as damage to banana production takes toll The aftermath of the tropical storm that severely damaged banana production in the Windward Islands will push Geest, the fresh and chilled food group, into the red in the second half. Shares fell 30p to 190p yesterday following the warning from Mr David Sugden, chief executive, who presented a strong set of interim results. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 17.9m for the six months to July 2 on turnover ahead at Pounds 353.8m (Pounds 332.7m). 'The business has been performing well, but is overshadowed by considerable uncertainty,' said Mr Sugden, referring to the European Commission's laxity in responding to the company's plea for permission to purchase replacement bananas in Latin America. The EC banana management committee failed to agree on Wednesday on measures that would allow Geest to purchase alternative bananas from Latin America under the EC quota system. The committee does not meet again until October 5. Tropical Storm Debbie hit the Windward Islands earlier this month, causing extensive flooding around St Lucia and damage to roads and bridges. Geest, which is under contract to ship all the islands' bananas, estimates that output will be 40 per cent down. Last week the first ship to arrive since the storm was half full. The company is expecting to load only 2,400 tonnes a week, compared with a normal load of 4,000 tonnes. The first half, however, showed the company recovering from the uncertainties surrounding the EC banana regime, introduced last July, as well as an attack of disease on its Costa Rican plantations, which left it Pounds 5.4m in the red at the end of last year. Operating profits in the fresh produce division improved from Pounds 2m to Pounds 15m on sales of Pounds 285.6m (Pounds 276.5m). The food preparation division, which supplies chilled salads and other products, lifted operating profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 4.2m on sales of Pounds 66.6m (Pounds 54.4m). The result this time included an exceptional gain of Pounds 2.5m from a disposal. Net interest payable rose from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 3.2m. Earnings per share were 18.9p (2.7p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 3.7p. COMMENT While the problems of disease in Costa Rica appear to have gone away, Geest's troubles with the European Commission and the banana regime are not over yet, thanks to Tropical Storm Debbie. In spite of its successful efforts to boost its food preparation division, the group remains vulnerable to the banana industry, which is highly political and subject to natural disaster. It has also only two main areas of supply, leaving it looking inflexible beside companies that source more widely. Adding to its problems is gearing of more than 100 per cent. Best guesses at this year's final outcome seem to be around Pounds 9m of profits - better than last year but a far cry from 1991's Pounds 26.2m. See Commodities</p>

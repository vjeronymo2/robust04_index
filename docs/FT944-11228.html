			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (14): Distribution survives the downturn - Sectoral performance / Paul Cheeseright looks at different parts of the regional economy Business parks are being developed or considered right across the West Midlands - in urban and rural areas, along the M6 and the M42, and at the northern ends of the M5 and the M40. The region, at the centre of England and within easy reach of big concentrations of population, has provided a firm base for certain types of property investment. Geographically, it is convenient. It has not been subject to the same sharp movements of, for example, the London office market. This steadiness has not escaped London investment managers. 'Distribution and warehousing markets in the West Midlands have proved to be relatively recession-proof,' said Mr Andrew Nesbitt, property director of AXA Equity &amp; Law Investment Managers. 'Demand for space has remained constant, and supply has stayed tight.' This may not be the case in future. Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors, has estimated that around 20 motorway junctions within 25 miles of Birmingham there are 1,500 acres of land for which planning permission to establish distribution parks exists or is being sought. This could translate into between 22m and 25m square feet of built space, according to Mr Dick Harvey, in charge of JLW's Birmingham office. 'That's a lot of space. With low inflation, you have to get the product and the location right to get it away,' he said. By comparison with south-east England, land prices are modest, between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 250,000 an acre in the Birmingham area. And rents, said Mr Andrew Jackson, industrial property specialist at Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, are not really moving: 'They stay fairly flat at the moment, which is a function of the available space. But that is getting absorbed steadily.' He quoted rents of Pounds 4.50-Pounds 5.00 a square foot along the M42, Pounds 4.00-Pounds 4.50 in Birmingham and Pounds 3.50-Pounds 4.00 in the Black Country. They had been at these levels for at least two years, but 'for existing buildings, the level of incentives is starting to fall and that is the first sign of rents beginning to rise.' In any case, for new property, leasing arrangements will have to reflect the higher construction costs which are emerging as raw-material prices rise from levels depressed by the recession. Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors, noted: 'Demand for design-and-build units is increasing across the Midlands from local industrialists, but 60 per cent of warehouse demand currently comes from third-party contract distribution companies seeking only 5-10 year leases.' Given that the development of the West Midlands distribution sector has gathered pace over the past 10 years, this points to changing patterns of demand for space. 'On the warehousing side, the move towards a more efficient form of distribution was led by retailers,' explained Mr Jackson. 'But in recent years there has been an increasing number of manufacturers who have been taking space. If they are able to hold stock more efficiently, they can save money, because they'll hold less of it - but also their customers want them to provide much quicker delivery times.' PROFILE: Hams Hall is an old power station site which is now the location for a rail freight terminal and business-distribution park on the grand scale. 'It is the largest by miles of any such project which can be built over the next few years,' claimed Mr Alan Winter, managing director of Trafalgar House Properties. The site is owned by PowerGen, which has a joint venture with Trafalgar House to provide the infrastructure. The joint venture will then sell land for development. 'We are not going to build speculative space,'said Mr Winter. Powergen's land is close both to the junction of the M6 and M42, and to the railway network on the east side of Birmingham at Coleshill. There are 380 acres, which offer the possibility of about 5.5m square feet of business and distribution space in addition to the rail freight terminal. The project provides an example of the way in which redundant industrial land is being transformed through alternative uses. Mr Winter does not expect to sign any deals with potential occupiers until work on the site has started next year. But the interest is coming primarily from West Midlands industrial companies. Theoretically, the first freight train could run into Hams Hall in 1996, he said. Whatever happens with the privatisation of British Rail, Hams Hall goes ahead. It is probably running slightly ahead of a similar project on a greenfield site near Daventry. 'If both schemes are up and running, they do compete,' Mr Winter acknowledged.</p>

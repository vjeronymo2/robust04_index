			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Santa Fe turns down Union's higher offer Santa Fe Pacific, the US railway company at the centre of a bidding war between two other big US rail operators, yesterday said its board had unanimously voted to reject an increased bid from Union Pacific and reaffirmed its commitment to a friendly merger with Burlington Northern. Last Sunday Union Pacific increased its hostile offer for Santa Fe to Dollars 3.74bn, well above the value of an increased offer from Burlington the previous Thursday. Burlington's all-share offer was last night worth Dollars 3.08bn. Santa Fe and Burlington continue to argue that the Union Pacific offer is meaningless because it would almost certainly be ruled out on anti-trust grounds. They say that the Burlington offer, though worth less than Union Pacific's, is much more likely to succeed.</p>

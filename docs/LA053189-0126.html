			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BURBANK WANTS AIRPORT PANEL ON TV  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council, which for years has been unsuccessfully pressuring  the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to hold its meetings at night  so the public can more easily attend, now wants the meetings broadcast on  television.  </P> <P> The council voted Tuesday to ask the airport commission to allow the taping of  its Monday morning meetings for broadcast during evening hours. The tape delay  would allow residents who cannot attend the meetings to become involved with  airport issues, said Commissioner Mary Lou Howard, who represents Burbank on  the panel.  </P> <P> Council members and Burbank commissioners have repeatedly complained that it is  inconvenient for the public to attend the authority meetings held at 9 a.m. on  the first and third Mondays of each month.  </P> <P> The authority last week rejected a proposal by Burbank commissioners to have  night meetings. It was the third time in four years that the authority has  turned down such a proposal.  </P> <P> Composed of three representatives each from Glendale, Pasadena and Burbank, the  authority oversees operation of Burbank Airport.  </P></p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Management: Spreading the word on not being quoted - A look at a company that discovered freedom when it went private For the last four months, Swraj Paul has been free. He has also saved more than Pounds 100,000. Since November 7 last year when he withdrew Caparo, his medium-sized engineering company, from the stock exchange, life has been simpler and more prosperous. Paul estimates that the loss of his listing will save Pounds 500,000 in a full year - equal to some 3 per cent of the company's profits. Fees alone for the teams of PR men and stockbrokers to assist in what Paul calls 'the shenanigans of quoted companies' cost at least Pounds 150,000 a year for the most basic service. Anything fancy and the fees shot up. Further large savings have come from moving the accounts department from the centre of London to Birmingham. Now that Caparo no longer has to be in close touch with the City, there is no point in being in expensive premises in London, says Paul. Another change has been in the sort of employees the company requires. Finance department staff who concentrate on dealing with the accounts come cheaper than those whose role includes talking to merchant bankers. Total saving from the move, including rent, is Pounds 350,000 a year, Paul estimates. There are other, non-financial benefits. One is that the company will be quicker on its feet. 'Before, you were always wondering what the City would think and your judgments were slowed down.' The message is clear for all medium-sized companies in old fashioned industries: a stock exchange listing may not be worthwhile. Paul reckons that there are many companies that would love to leave the City behind, but can't raise the money to buy out their shares. It was only possible for him because a mere 20 per cent of Caparo's shares were in the market anyway. The stock exchange typically put such a low rating on his shares - some six times earnings - that raising money through share issues was more expensive than borrowing from the bank. Paul makes the time-honoured complaint about the City being greedy for immediate results. 'Now we can think long term. Two, three or four years is well beyond the range of most institutions. Yet that is the timetable over which most investments will pay off.' When Caparo tried to undertake big investment projects, updating plant and machinery, Paul found that the City would not wear the heavy depreciation charges. 'You can only grow by a steady 20 per cent in terms of profit if you engage in financial engineering,' he says. A stock exchange quote also has a bad effect on management, he says. 'I like to see the share price high in the paper. It shifted my priorities away from the real stuff.' Paul, one of the most successful Indian businessmen in Britain, regrets the passing of the old days of trust and decency in the City. The stock exchange itself has greatly deteriorated, he thinks, with deregulation and Big Bang creating an atmosphere were 'everyone is trying to do better than their neighbours'.</p>

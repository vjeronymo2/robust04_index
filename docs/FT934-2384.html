			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Standard Life new premiums top Pounds 2bn Standard Life, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, said yesterday that its new premium income in the UK over the year to November 15 had increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 2.08bn. It said that continuing increases in single premium investment had more than compensated for the trend away from annual premium business. In both annual and single premium products, however, the amount of new business in individual pensions was lower than in the previous 12 months. New business from annual premium individual pensions was down 4 per cent to Pounds 66m, while from single premium personal pensions it was down 9 per cent to Pounds 648m. Individual pensions were the only single-premium products to record a fall in new business. Standard Life said that the personal pensions market as a whole had been affected by the recession, with people giving priority to meeting their day-to-day needs rather than longer-term saving. There was a sharp increase in new investments into Standard Life's investment bonds, which more than doubled over the year from Pounds 190m to Pounds 467m. Standard Life attributed this to the return of confi-dence to the stock market as well as its own investment record. The company said that 65 per cent of its new business came from financial inter-mediaries, with the rest coming from tied agents and the small direct sales force it is building up now that its 'tie' with the Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, is to be broken. Including business in Canada and the Republic of Ireland, Standard Life's new premium income rose 15 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn.</p>

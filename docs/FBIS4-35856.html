			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference held by Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, </F> minister of information and minister of state for cabinet  affairs, with unidentified correspondents in Amman on 4 June --  italicized passages recorded]       [Excerpts] [Announcer] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of  information and minister of state for cabinet affairs, held a  news conference today in which he elaborated on the issues and  topics raised during today's cabinet meeting. He also spoke  about the government's interest to improve employees' general  performance and conditions.    [Al-'Anani] [passage omitted] Regarding the prevailing  Arab conditions, many of the brothers wonder, for example, about  current developments in the Yemeni issue. As you know, at the  request of the disputing Yemeni parties, the two parties came to  Jordan about seven months ago and asked Jordan to mediate among  the parties concerned. When Jordan mediated in the Yemeni  issue, it did not do to impose its role, but was basically in  response to the requests of our brothers in Yemen. Jordan cannot  but accept the Yemeni legitimacy. This is because this  legitimacy was not imposed by any Yemeni party on another party,  but was the result of a purely internal Yemeni process in which  the leaders of the north and south agreed to unite their  country. They have also taken the necessary measures for this,  including the amendment of the Yemeni Constitution and the  holding of free elections in Yemen. This has given legitimacy  to all Yemen through its recognized leadership which passed  through all the constitutional and legal stages. Therefore,  Jordan recognizes the Yemeni legitimacy which was approved by  all the institutions of the Yemeni people, in accordance with  which the Yemeni people adopted measures which led to the  creation of the united Yemeni institutions. This process was  basically continuing. Jordan will continue to be with the  legitimacy in Yemen until something else is decided by an Arab  consensus or anything else. But, for us, we do not fight  anyone, we do not stand against anyone, and we do not have any  political agenda in Yemen. However, we are with the legitimacy  because this is an entrenched and basic Jordanian principle. We  must not open the door for casting doubts on the legitimacy of  states because this will be a precedent that could lead to bad  consequences.    In the presence of his majesty the king, some ministers  reviewed their various visits which you might know of. Dr.  Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of higher  education, reviewed his visit to Syria and his meeting with  President Hafiz al-Asad, who stressed the need for cooperation  and integration with Jordan. At the same time, he emphasized  his deep relationship with His Majesty King Husayn, and the need  to upgrade the level of cooperation in the economic and  political fields between the two countries to the highest  possible level. The higher joint committee is expected to meet  soon to discuss economic issues and other areas of cooperation,  culture, youth, information, and education.    The interior minister also reviewed his visit to Iraq  and his meeting with President Saddam Husayn, which came at the  Iraqi leadership's request. In fact, the interior minister went  there to discuss some issues related to the Jordanian nationals  in Iraq. He found a great response from the Iraqi officials in  this respect.    The minister of state for foreign affairs also reviewed  his participation in the nonaligned foreign ministers'  conference in Cairo, and his meetings with the officials there.  The major point that was discussed was the future of the  Nonaligned Movement, particularly following the changes in the  balance of powers in the world which left the United States at  the top of the pyramid of international power. It seems that  the discussion has not led to very clear results toward which we  can adopt a clear stand. Of course, this was an opportunity to  meet with some Arab foreign ministers. I believe that the  minister of state for foreign affairs spoke about this after his  return.    We also listened to a report by the telecommunications  minister, who attended the second phase of ARABSAT, and the  meeting of the ARABSAT board of directors. The reason which led  to the stumbling of this project, particularly the second phase  of it, was that the launching of Ariane, the French missile, was  not successful. It was supposed to carry a new Arab station.  In this regard, we have instructions from his majesty the king  to cooperate with the fraternal Arab states in the field of  telecommunications, and to develop Jordan's abilities in the  field of telecommunications, television transmission, and  cooperation with the Arab states in this regard.    These are almost the most important points that were  discussed today.    [Announcer] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani then answered  correspondents' questions. Concerning the border issue and  Israel's seriousness to discuss this issue in detail, he said:    [Al-'Anani] In fact, the Israeli side has expressed its  readiness to discuss this issue within the so-called working  group on security, border, and territories. Therefore, a  Jordanian team and an Israeli team will discuss this issue. If  an agreement is reached, then it will be necessary to discuss it  on the border site in the region in order to be settled, and so  that demarcation and the appropriate measures can be taken.    [Correspondent] [Passage Indistinct].    [Al-'Anani] (?There will be) a tripartite committee  meeting to discuss the issues related to the Palestinian-Israeli  economic agreement and its effects on us, particularly in the  field of trade and banks. There will also be a meeting to  demarcate borders and to set a program to develop the Jordan  Valley area, with all its dimensions. This is to prepare for  future studies to discuss these issues and to emphasize that  these issues cannot take place unless border problems are  resolved. In the past, the U.S. stand was in agreement with  this idea, and the Israeli stand was hesitant. Now, it seems, I  say it seems, but we are not sure until we sit, negotiate, and  know their reactions--but it seems that as long as they are  ready to discuss, and we are always ready to discuss our rights,  there might be something which makes us say that some change has  occurred in the Israeli stand in this regard.    [Announcer] Concerning the employees' pay increase, Dr.  al-'Anani said:    [Al-'Anani] The Council of Ministers is still  discussing this issue with all seriousness. A ministerial  committee has discussed this and approved some principles. The  Council of Ministers today began discussions on it, but it has  not yet completed the discussion. We hope to be able to  complete discussion on this issue during the next Council of  Ministers' meeting.    [Correspondent] [Passage indistinct]    [Al-'Anani] No, no, the overall picture is clear, but  there are attempts to improve the draft plan. As you know, the  draft plan was set by a ministerial committee, and the Council  of Ministers must express its opinion about the ministerial  committee's proposals. There are some ideas either by some  specialized sectors, or in the overall picture.    [Announcer] On the date set for His Majesty King Husayn's  visit to Washington, the information minister and minister of  state for cabinet affairs, said:    [Al-'Anani] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to  Washington will take place during the first half of this month,  June. His Majesty King Husayn will go to have a regular medical  checkup. This is to let people know. After His Majesty King  Husayn underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic, he was supposed to  have a medical checkup every six months. This is the last  semiannual medical checkup. This, God willing, will confirm  that His Majesty King Husayn's health is as good as usual, and  then the medical checkup will be done annually. This is  something normal, a routine medical checkup. His Majesty King  Husayn's health is very good, and we must be happy and  congratulate ourselves on this.    His Majesty King Husayn will, of course, visit the  United States, where he will meet with President Bill Clinton,  Christopher, and senior U.S. officials. They will discuss the  peace process, bilateral relations, developments in the region,  and other issues. As you know, these issues appear to be  repetitive, but every time, due to the rapid changes and  developments, they gain new dimensions. Thank you very much.</p>

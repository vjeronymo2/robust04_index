			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clean-up scheme for UK farms proposed PROPOSALS WERE announced by Britain's National Rivers Authority yesterday for every farm to produce its own waste management plan giving details of the type and volume of effluent produced and methods of disposal. The scheme is intended to cut down on the amount of organic wastes and agrochemicals that get into the rivers damaging fish and threatening the drinking-water supply. Although the authority says that the scheme is voluntary, it does envisage that farmers who fail to comply would not receive existing grants for other pollution control measure such as the provision of storage for waste. However, it is proposing that government aid should be available to help pay for drawing up the plans. If a voluntary scheme fails, then the NRA says it will press for tough new regulations imposing a duty of care on farmers to control pollution. Mr John Gummer, the minister of agriculture, announced that a pilot study would be carried out by the ministry to test the feasibility of pollution-control plans. 'Although only 11 per cent of total reported pollution incidents are caused by agriculture, there are still too many of them,' said Mr Gummer. However, the NRA said that it had made 954 prosecutions for water pollution over the past two years and 404 of these were against farmers. Between 1979 and 1990, the number of farm pollution incidents had more than doubled, from just under 1,500 to over 3,000. The authority maintains that agriculture has lagged behind industry in dealing with waste. If necessary it would like to see large 'factory' farms building their own treatment plants. Under the proposals, every farm plan would include a map showing land available for spreading wastes, a statement of management and maintenance, the disposal system required and details of contingency plans in the event of accidents. The National Farmers' Union welcomed the report and said it was prepared to co-operate in drawing up a scheme. It pointed out that Pounds 75m has already been spent on better waste handling facilities on farms.

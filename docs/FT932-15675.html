			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A Christmas without charity - At a glance Figures for Gift Aid, the scheme which allows tax-free donations to charities, show that people were less generous in the three months leading up to Christmas. Total donations during the final quarter of 1992 were Pounds 43.4m, disappointingly down from Pounds 68m in the previous quarter. Donations from individuals fell from Pounds 37.9m to Pounds 25.5m. However, the total donated under the scheme now stands at Pounds 351.1m in two years, while a total of Pounds 117m has been paid in tax repayments to charities.</p>

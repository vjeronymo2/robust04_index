The visit was scheduled for today to discuss the  results of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to  Tunis and his meeting with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat last night.    The visit has been postponed despite the PLO's approval for  receiving Ross today in accordance with a proposal by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher in his message to 'Arafat  yesterday. Under the proposal, Ross was scheduled to visit Tunis  and Israel today and tomorrow as part of the ongoing efforts to  bring the PLO back to the peace talks.    The same sources pointed out that perhaps Washington is  worried about Kozyrev's visit to Tunis and his meeting with  'Arafat, which were made as part of a unilateral Russian  initiative without coordination with the United States.</p>

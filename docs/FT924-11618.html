			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Health services in London 'face serious damage' HEALTH services and medical research in London face serious damage unless their restructuring is properly funded, the inquiry into the capital's healthcare warned in its report yesterday. It is essential, the report says, that adequate transitional funding is provided to ensure service changes take place in an orderly fashion. 'The level of such funding will to a large extent dictate the pace of change. Change that is not managed and funded in this way is likely to be chaotic.' It was inevitable that reaction to Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report would focus initially on the hospitals that it has recommended for closure. Anti-closure campaigns by threatened institutions, such as St Bartholomew's in the City, are under way. Although Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, emphasised yesterday that the report was 'advice to government, not government policy', most of the campaigns will almost certainly fail. The government accepts that there are too many hospital beds in central London, and ministers are expressing determination to tackle at last difficult decisions that have, periodically, been reviewed and shelved throughout the century. This means that, when the first emotion over the proposed closures dies away, attention must turn to Sir Bernard's emphasis on the need for proper funding to support the changes. The campaigns to save specific hospitals might give the impression that the Tomlinson report faces total opposition in the National Health Service. That is not so. Organisations such as the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing agree with the Tomlinson committee's overall view that resources must be shifted from hospitals to better family doctor and community services. Supporters of Sir Bernard's basic approach were disappointed that his report did not propose more stringent arrangements for ensuring that money released from hospital closures is actually reinvested at community level. 'We are concerned about the lack of clear recommendations on how much government funding is needed and for how long,' said Ms Christine Hancock, RCN general secretary. London has more hospital beds per head of population than the rest of the country - 3.9 per 1,000, compared with an English average of 2.5. Many of the London beds are in relatively expensive teaching hospitals which, since the introduction of the contract-based system of financing healthcare last year, have lost patients and run into increasing financial difficulties. But family doctor and community services are less well developed than in the rest of the country. The NHS is a substantial employer in London. It has about 73,000 staff, and health service unions claim that up to 20,000 jobs might be threatened by the Tomlinson proposals. There are almost twice as many consultants in the capital as elsewhere, up to 700 of whom may lose their jobs. Arrangements for medical education will change radically. Without waiting to make decisions on hospital closures, the government accepted the broad conclusion of the Tomlinson committee that most medical education should be concentrated on four London University colleges - Imperial, University, King's and Queen Mary and Westfield.

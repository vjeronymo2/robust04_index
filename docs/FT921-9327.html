			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Federal Express considers restructuring FEDERAL Express, the Memphis-based express package delivery company, yesterday confirmed market suspicions that it is actively looking to restructure its international operations, although it would notspeculate on when any decisions might be reached. After the company's shares shot Dollars 3 1/2 higher yesterday on heavy volume, Federal Express released a formal statement saying it had been considering various options aimed at reducing its losses overseas. These options, said the company, could include restructurings as well as co-operative or other business arrangements with third parties. Preliminary talks had been held with various outside parties, it added, but the delivery company stressed the examination of available options was 'at this stage, exploratory only'. It stated 'no conclusions have been reached with respect to any courses of action the company may take, nor have there been any agreements with third parties'. On the stock market, final volume in Federal Express shares totalled 1.54m, against an average daily trading of 166,400 shares. The bulk of Federal Express's problems overseas have come in Europe and the UK. Last spring, the company took a Dollars 121m charge against earnings to cover workforce and other cuts in the UK and a large part of its British operation has been sold back to Littlewoods, the privately-owned UK retailer. But in the second quarter of its current financial year - to end-November - Federal Express still reported operating losses of Dollars 64.5m, up from Dollars 54.7m a year earlier and said it was 'disgusted' with the performance. Analysts have speculated that, while it would be difficult for the company to abandon service to European destinations for competitive reasons, it could try to cut fixed costs by using third party agents or entering into joint venture arrangements on a regional basis.</p>

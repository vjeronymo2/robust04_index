			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Markets: At a Glance - BIT dividend unchanged British Investment Trust, the UK's sixth largest, reported net assets per share up 3.1 per cent for the year to March 31; that compared with a fall of 1.8 per cent in the FT-A All-Share Index over the same period. The trust, which has assets of Pounds 590m, is paying an unchanged final dividend of 13p. BIT proposes to change the par value of the shares from 25p to 5p, with the aim of reducing the nominal share price and thereby widening demand for the shares.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Mirror in move to end rift with press watchdog A DEAL that could end the crisis over the Princess of Wales pictures and pave the way for Mirror Group Newspapers to return to the Press Complaints Commission appeared to be taking shape last night. Lawyers acting for MGN met commission officials as senior figures in the newspaper industry tried to prevent the breakdown of press self-regulation and the imposition of statutory controls. Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, has made it clear he will enter into negotiations on returning to the regulatory body if Lord McGregor of Durris, commission chairman, withdraws remarks criticising the Daily Mirror and advocating a readers' and advertisers' boycott. Three MGN titles quit the press watchdog on Monday after Mr Montgomery accused Lord McGregor of exceeding his powers and behaving unfairly. MGN is angry that Lord McGregor appears to have prejudged any possible complaints on the Mirror's use of pictures of the Princess exercising at a gym. It is believed that senior figures such as Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, and Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers, have given informal undertakings that attacks on the Daily Mirror by their publications will cease. Last night a spokesman for the Mirror said other newspapers had promised to end the 'dog eat dog' criticism of its use of the pictures. In today's edition an editorial says the 'abusive campaign' had pilloried the paper before any hearing. Lawyers for the Princess of Wales yesterday issued two writs, against MGN and the L A Fitness Club, where the unauthorised pictures were taken. The writs made it clear the Princess wanted the illicit pictures and negatives. Mr Montgomery was advised by at least one senior newspaper executive that MGN should apologise to the Princess and make a payment to charity. MGN has received undertakings that controversial remarks by the press watchdog will not be repeated. Lawyers Theodore Goddard wrote to Lord McGregor arguing that 'it is not, as I am sure you will accept, the role of the commission and its chairman to call for penalties to be imposed on a newspaper in circumstances where no proper or indeed any inquiry has been made into the case'. The lawyers added that Lord McGregor had exceeded his powers in urging a boycott. The regulatory body will meet today as planned, but will not discuss the pictures because the matter is 'sub-judice', Lord McGregor said last night.</p>

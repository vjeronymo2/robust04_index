			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / People: Mengers quits Simpson Johnny Pierre Nicholas Mengers, the colourful pony-tailed chairman of DAKS Simpson, has left the Piccadilly clothing store after 40 years' service. His departure comes just over a year after Simpson's was bought by Sankyo Seiko, the Japanese clothing group. Mengers was due to retire on reaching 60 next year and his early departure fuelled speculation that there had been some friction between him and the Japanese shareholders. The company yesterday played down the suggestion and said Sankyo Seiko had lived by its promise at the time of the takeover largely to preserve the autonomy of the British management. Mengers was yesterday unavailable for comment. No announcement has been made about his successor. ***** Ralph Browning, the UK-based chairman of REMY &amp; Associes until its merger with Pavis last December, has retired from his executive responsibilities with the group. He will remain a director on the main Remy Cointreau board. ***** John Aries-Tyler has resigned from FRANK USHER HOLDINGS. ***** The Hon Edward Davies and Derek Baer have retired from TEMPLE BAR INVESTMENT TRUST. ***** Richard Hurst has resigned from CAPITAL RADIO.</p>

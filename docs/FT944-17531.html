			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Barry Wehmiller hit by tough trading conditions Annual pre-tax profits at Barry Wehmiller International declined by 28 per cent from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 5.12m, as the packaging equipment manufacturer endured tough trading conditions, particularly in Europe. However, Mr Stewart Brown, chief executive, said second half trading had improved over a weak first half and that the outlook for 1995 was 'encouraging'. Operating profits fell 24 per cent to Pounds 5.18m (Pounds 6.82m) in the year to July 31, but the rate of decline slowed to only 10 per cent in the second half. Annual turnover slipped 4 per cent to Pounds 82.1m (Pounds 85.2m). The fall was most marked in the group's Asian markets, which slid 41 per cent to Pounds 4.41m (Pounds 7.53m). Mr Brown said the decline was due to a slump in regional aerosol sales, which were now recovering. Aerosol turnover fell 30 per cent to Pounds 9.41m (Pounds 13.42m), a fire at a production plant disrupting output. Of its main regional markets, Europe was the chief casualty, turnover retreating 8 per cent to Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 18.19m). Operating profits across the group's three divisions all showed a fall, with the optical business having the steepest decline, down from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 73,000 over the year. Mr Brown said that margins had been squeezed by a drive for market share in the beer and soft drinks industry, particularly in the first half. 'Our order intake for the second half and in current trading has recovered significantly,' said Mr Brown. 'This, together with our substantial investment in our product and marketing in the past year makes us well positioned for steady growth.' He added that the group, which is relatively ungeared, was looking to make an acquisition in the coming year, with the pharmaceuticals packaging business a likely target area. Earnings per share fell 32 per cent to 7.5p (11p). The final dividend was maintained at 4.3p for a same-again 6.7p total.</p>

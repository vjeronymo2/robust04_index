			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UN votes for tighter sanctions against Serbia THE UN Security council last night voted to tighten sanctions against Serbia, empowering states to halt shipping, if necessary, and inspect cargoes and destination documents. The measure, aimed at Danube and Adriatic traffic, follows reports of extensive violations of the UN embargo, particularly in oil shipments, through falsified papers. In approving the resolution without dissent, but with China and Zimbabwe abstaining, Security Council members ignored an 11th-hour appeal by Mr Ilija Djukic, Yugoslavia's foreign minister, for the lifting of sanctions. He called the ban harsh, one-sided and unjust. The rump state of Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and Montenegro. There have been allegations of vessels flying the Greek and Maltese flags violating the UN embargo. The governments of both countries have promised investigations.</p>

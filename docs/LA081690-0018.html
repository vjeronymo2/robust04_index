			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Nelson Sues: Country singer Willie Nelson filed a $45-million suit in a Dallas  federal court on Wednesday alleging a violation of the racketeering law by his  former accounting firm, Price Waterhouse.  </P> <P> According to Jay Goldberg, Nelson's attorney, the suit alleges that the  prestigious international accounting firm, acting as Nelson's investment and  tax advisers, had engaged in a persistent pattern of fraud since 1979,  including making inappropriate investments that lost substantial sums of money.  "If the allegations are proven, this will be a terrible breach of fiduciary  duties by one of the most prestigious accounting firms in the country,"  Goldberg said. Efforts to reach a spokesman for the accounting firm were  unsuccessful. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

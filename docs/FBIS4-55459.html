			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, 13 May (TANJUG) -- President of the  Democratic Alliance of Kosovo (DSK) Ibrahim Rugova said today  that his party would continue its activities despite  announcements that it would be outlawed. At a news conference  Rugova described as "a provocation" the statement by the head of  Kosovo district Milos Simovic that the authorities should ban  the DSK for failing to register. He warned that this could be  "a dangerous move" and that such a decision "would not be taken  lightly by the international democratic public." Rugova claims  that his party was registered in the former SFRY, that it was in  possession of valid registration documents, and stressed that it  would continue its work even if banned.</p>

The  recombinant plasmids pSAG1-19, pSAG2A-19 were identified by  restriction digestion, Southern blot hybridization and detection  of antigenicity and immunogenicity of the fusion protein from  transformed E. coli. The inserted BamHI-7 fragment,  approximately 6.9 kb, of the recombinant plasmids contained the  glycoprotein gp50 gene.</p>

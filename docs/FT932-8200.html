			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US steelmakers call energy tax unfair THE US steel industry warned yesterday that implemention of the proposed BTU tax on energy in the US would hit producers hard, putting them at a disadvantage against imports. Speaking at the general meeting of the American Iron and Steel Institute in New York, Mr Thomas Usher, president of US Steel Group, said: 'It would place new costs on US-produced goods that our foreign competitors would not have to bear.' He said the industry would face direct annual costs increases of as much as several hundred million dollars - money urgently needed for modernisation. The industry had approached Congress with alternatives, he said, which included a flat fee per ton, which could apply to domestic production as well as imports, and at a rate equal to the proposed BTU tax. The industry's hard line on imports and trade was held at the meeting. Last year, US steel producers petitioned the International Trade Commission over alleged dumping in the US by foreign producers at unfair prices, and government subsidies to overseas groups.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DRUG-ADDICTED BABIES TAX SYSTEM, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> There are not enough senior social workers or foster homes to care for babies  born with drug dependencies in Orange County, according to a grand jury report  released Wednesday.  </P> <P> The report said there were 202 drug-exposed babies born in Orange County from  July, 1988, through April, 1989. Because there are not enough foster homes,  some babies are unnecessarily kept in hospitals at a significantly higher cost  to the government.  </P> <P> The cost for a hospital to accommodate a drug dependent baby is up to $7,500  per month. In a foster home, the cost ranges from $559 to $867 per month, the  report said.  </P> <P> In conclusion, the grand jury recommended that the Social Services Agency  "actively pursue a recruitment program for additional foster families" and that  it try to hire more senior social workers.  </P> <P> The report also recommended that the county explore the possibility of  developing special homes where drug dependent babies can remain with their  birth mothers while they are in drug treatment programs, as other counties have  done.  </P></p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Deputy chairman of Lloyd's quits posts under pressure MR STEPHEN MERRETT, one of the most controversial underwriters at Lloyd's of London, resigned as deputy chairman of the insurance market and from its ruling council yesterday after heavy pressure from other senior figures. Mr Merrett's agency - one of the biggest in the market - faces substantial difficulties after a sharp fall in its popularity among Names, the individuals whose assets support the market. Mr Richard Keeling, deputy chairman of Lloyd's agency Murray Lawrence, was elected to succeed Mr Merrett as deputy chairman. In his letter to Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, Mr Merrett attributed his decision to resign to an increased workload. He said: 'We have spoken a number of times over recent weeks about the problems that I have arising out of workload, already substantial and likely to increase as a result of the challenges and opportunities facing the Merrett group.' Last week members' agents - who handle the affairs of Names and channel them into syndicates - explained that Names had lost confidence in the management of the Merrett group and that capacity - or capital - supplied by them to syndicate 418, the group's biggest syndicate, would fall from about Pounds 150m in 1993 to about Pounds 50m in 1994. As a result, the group has been forced to step up efforts to persuade corporate investors to back its syndicates. The group is currently negotiating with Marsh McLennan, the US broker, and JP Morgan, the bank, about converting a company, set up earlier this year to provide reinsurance to Merrett syndicates, into an incorporated Name that would invest directly in the group's nine syndicates. The Association of Lloyd's Names, the biggest organisation of Names, yesterday welcomed the resignation, claiming that 'it is constructed for Lloyd's as a whole'. Names argue that Mr Merrett's interest as an insurer of fellow Lloyd's agents against legal awards for negligence conflicts with his position as a member of the council, at a time when the Lloyd's council could be involved in helping to negotiate out-of-court settlements in litigation between lossmaking Names and agents at the market.

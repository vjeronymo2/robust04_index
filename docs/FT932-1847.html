			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: Backstroke in a Crowded Pool - Theatre What happens when folk try swimming backstroke in a crowded pool? Lynsey and Chrissie, two young female lifeguards standing on the brink, know only too well. They spend their time trying to stop collisions and drownings; and this play plunges headlong into the hectic comedy of pool life, with the two girls keeping up School of Joyce Grenfell ('Don't do that, George') lines on the scores of people in the water. We soon know which lane is for beginners only, what their colleague Melvin is like, and which chaps these girls find most gorgeous. It is part of the skill of Jane Coles's new play that we have been busy laughing at all this before we realise that the pool is also a metaphor for our modern society, in which Lynsey and Chrissie have to swim along too. Lynsey has fallen for Hashim Jalib, a handsome young Moslem. No minor crush this: she prays to Allah, reads the Koran, plans to become his worthy wife. And Hashim has eyes only for her. There are advantages to such a liaison; Moslems don't drink, and my favourite line in the play comes when Chrissie remarks wistfully 'Imagine being made love to by someone who's sober.' Coles shows us not only Hashim and Lynsey, but their mothers too, neither of them racist. Fahmida Jelib, in fact, is the best-realised character in the play, wise, patient, religious and droll; and her sequiturs are more disconcertingly funny than most people's non-sequiturs. But Lynsey's mother Carol is a militant animal-rights campaigner, opposed to the ritual sacrifices of Islam. When the pool is this crowded with conflicting creeds, who can swim backstroke? (At the pool, the lifeguards keep remarking 'The pool's getting too crowded . . . And they're still letting more people in.' Very Winston Churchill.) So much about this play is so acute, and its mix of humour and serious social drama is so deft, that I wish its faults were invisible. Sometimes, however, it nervously overdoes comic touches (as at the end of Act One); or overdoes its pool symbolism (in Act Two). The big Islam-vs-animal-rights dialectic in the Act Two dinner-party comes too pat. And the ending manages both to be too ambiguous about Lynsey and too ickily optimistic about Chrissie. A more obvious problem is that John Dove, directing, has the cast of five speak Coles's lines all at one speed, with minimal change of tempo or dynamics. Most of them do nice work in characterising their roles - especially Leena Dhingra as Mrs Jelib, Sophie Stanton as Chrissie, and Raji James as Hashim - but with all of them there are creaky patches when we are reminded that they are reciting lines they have learnt. But, though these real flaws diminish the play, they by no means wreck it. Coles not only manages to make the different home-lives of Lynsey and Hashim equally real, she also brings off excellent scenes between Lynsey and Mrs Jelib, and between Carol and Chrissie. No one in Britain today could watch Backstroke without feeling its relevance, or sensing how much it manages to achieve. It is, by the way, the product of an association between the Royal National Theatre Studio and the Bush, and one of the several emotions it prompts is hope. At the Bush Theatre, W12, until July 24</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Revenue hits out at DTI creditor plan THE Inland Revenue yesterday criticised proposals by the Department of Trade and Industry that threaten its preferential status as a creditor to companies in financial difficulties. It argued that its priority ranking above other creditors was 'necessary', and wanted it to be maintained in any changes to insolvency legislation. The comments were in response to a DTI consultative document issued on Tuesday which called for an overhaul of existing procedures for company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and administration orders. The document said some countries were eliminating or reducing the number of preferential tax creditors, and suggested that 'Crown preference' for pay-as-you-earn, value added tax and other measures could be removed. Banks yesterday maintained their tentative support for the proposals, which would require them to lose some of their rights as priority creditors by abiding by CVAs and giving a company seven days' notice before appointing receivers. One banker said he supported the principle of trying to rescue more companies. 'We are not trigger happy,' he said. 'We have lost a lot of customers and we want to stop losing them.' But he questioned how far the proposals would succeed. 'So many of the companies we see are bust by the time they suggest a CVA,' he said. 'They are terminal cases and don't seek professional help in time.' He also stressed the need for close supervision of a company's directors once a CVA was under way to ensure that assets were not removed. Consultation on the DTI document is open until until the end of January next year. Mr Tim Hayward, head of insolvency at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, also welcomed the document. He stressed the need to balance the concerns of directors in financial difficulties against the need to act where there was no case for keeping an insolvent company operating.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: India and Taiwan angry at US sanctions INDIA and Taiwan reacted angrily yesterday to the US decision to act against the two countries over their alleged failure to protect intellectual property rights. The Indian government said the US decision to reduce trade benefits to India was 'unjustified'. Members of parliament from all parties accused the administration of trying to bully India into falling in line with its thinking on world affairs, especially international trade issues. The US cut Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.8m) worth of Indian goods from the US duty free preference scheme, directed at Indian exports of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and related products. The US said it was in retaliation for India's inadequate protection of patents in the pharmaceuticals industry. Mr P Chidambaram, the Indian minister of commerce, said the government had neither yielded nor would it ever yield to pressure from the US on trade or any other matter. The Taiwanese government yesterday condemned as unfair the US decision to add Taiwan to its 'priority watch list' for infringement of US intellectual property rights. Mr Sheu Ke-sheng, director general of the board of foreign trade, said the action would only hinder the development of trade relations between the two countries. Taiwan, the world's 14th largest trading nation, was recently warned by the US that it would join India and Thailand on the list of nations found to engage in unfair trade practices if it failed to curb copyright violations, which consist largely of software, video and US brand-name piracy. Although Taiwan submitted its action plan to the US in mid-April, it appears not to have satisfied US demands for self-inspection of goods for export, and heavier penalties for violators. The island could face retaliatory tariffs of up to 100 per cent, or even restriction on some exports. Hardest hit by any retaliatory action would be Taiwan's fast-growing personal computer industry, which is making inroads into the US market.</p>

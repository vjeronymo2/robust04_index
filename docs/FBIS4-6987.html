			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan will review its  long- standing policy of banning construction of oil-burning  thermal power plants, a senior energy agency official said  Friday [22 April].    Elements of a revised policy will be included in a report  forecasting Japan's long-term energy demand and supply toward  the next century, set for release on June 21, said the official  at the Natural Resources and Energy Agency, who declined to be  named.    The official said the review is in response to requests by  power firms to "fine-tune" the amount of energy supply during  the peak energy usage time in summer.    Under the adjusted policy, the agency will allow renovation  of outmoded oil-burning thermal power plants, the official said.    But building completely new facilities will still not be  allowed under the terms of the June report, he said.    Construction of new oil-fired thermal power plants has been  prohibited since 1980 as part of efforts to promote the  development of alternative energy following the second oil  crisis in the late 1970s.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Shipbuilding The progress of international negotiations intended to eliminate shipbuilding subsidies has revealed a worrying shift in US thinking. After initiating the present round of talks five years ago, with the aim of removing subsidies, the US now seems bent on increasing the support it gives its own shipbuilding industry. Last week US negotiators at the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development took a tough new line by insisting on the freedom to require that ships financed by its export credit schemes be built in US yards. Other delegations saw this as an attempt to establish an unacceptable principle, contrary to the very purpose of the negotiations. It is particularly unfortunate that this apparent setback has occurred when Japan and South Korea, long regarded as the least flexible in this matter, have finally shown themselves willing to offer concessions. They have, in fact, declared themselves ready to accept an anti-dumping code for ships, to prevent 'injurious pricing.' It is ironic, too, that the US is not a large builder of merchant shipping, though the decline in naval orders in the wake of the ending of the cold war may be a partial explanation of its stance. Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that the US administration will back the Gibbons Bill, which would penalise ships docking at US ports if they came from countries with 'unfair' shipyard subsidies. At the least the new stance seems internally inconsistent, with the US intending to act against the subsidies of others, while resorting to subsidised export promotion itself. One unwelcome outcome of the new US approach could be to split opinion within the European Union. Governments in southern Europe, in particular, are under strong pressure to relax subsidy rules. The EU has made good progress with its subsidy reduction regime in recent years. But this could now be reversed. Sweden's ambassador to the OECD, Mr Staffan Sohlman, chairman of the shipbuilding talks, will attempt to produce a document which he hopes will be acceptable to all participants in the talks. The aim is to reach a final agreement by May. Reaching such an accord is important. Failure would not only hurt those shipyards which have improved their efficiency but would rebound on the shipping sector. Unbridled, subsidised production of new ships adds to the problems of liner conferences already faced with overcapacity on many routes. There is a danger that pressures for shipbuilding subsidies will not just be maintained, but strengthened. Despite the decline of shipbuilding activity in many western countries, it is important that agreement on subsidies is reached. A failure here would provide encouragement to the pro-subsidy lobby in other important areas, such as steel and aircraft manufacture.</p>

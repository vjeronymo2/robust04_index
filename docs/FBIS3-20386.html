			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Turkey has described as utterly unacceptable the  Greek Government's arbitrary decisions to eliminate the most  basic rights of the Turkish minority in Western Thrace granted  to them by international agreements.    Replying to a question at this weekly news conference today,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman recalled that Article  40 of the Lausanne Treaty grants the Turkish minority in Western  Thrace the right to establish, run, and inspect its own  educational institutions. Within this framework, Ataman said,  Turkish teachers from Western Thrace are supposed to teach in  the minority schools. However, he added, the Greek Education  Ministry terminated these teachers' contracts and announced that  it would appoint the teachers itself.    Ataman explained that following this decision, the Turkish  teachers started a boycott of the schools from 28 March to 1  April, with 100 percent participation. He stressed that in this  way, the Western Thrace Turkish minority protected its rights  and expressed its reaction to the decision by the Greek  authorities. He added: The elimination by the Greek Government,  through arbitrary decisions, of the most basic rights of the  Turkish minority in Western Thrace -- rights granted to them  through international agreements -- is utterly unacceptable. We  are making the necessary representations to ensure that the  decision is corrected. At every forum, Turkey will continue to  raise and elaborate on the issue of the violation of human  rights in the Western Thrace. We expect and demand the Greek  Government to stop this unjust practice as soon as possible.    Asked to comment on Greek press reports that Turkish  warplanes intensively violated Greek airspace on 25 March,  Ataman said that Turkish planes carried out routine and  individual training flights in the international airspace of the  Aegean on 25 March, flights that do not call for issuing an  alert to pilots. He said: Planes of the Turkish Air Force have  been carrying out training and exercise flights in the  international airspace of the Aegean for years, within the  framework of rights granted to them by international law.  During these flights, the pilots are always careful not to  violate the 6-mile national Greek airspace.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Alcatel Alsthom likely to win Framatome control Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications, engineering and transport company, appears set to gain control of Framatome, the state-owned nuclear power station group, according to an official at France's atomic energy authority. Mr Philippe Rouvillois, the general director of CEA Industrie, who has been charged by the government to draw up plans to privatise Framatome, said that Alcatel Alsthom was likely to be offered a further 15 per cent of Framatome's shares in addition to its existing stake of 44 per cent. In an interview with Les Echos, the French financial daily, Mr Rouvillois said that Alcatel Alsthom could be offered part of CEA Industrie's stake in Framatome and the 5 per cent of Framatome held by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank. EdF, the state electricity group would maintain its holding at 10 per cent and the 5 per cent stake held by employees would also be unaffected. The share structure would leave the state with a blocking stake of about 34 per cent, according to Mr Rouvillois. 'This would guarantee the preservation of essential interests in nuclear policy and in the company's co-operation with Siemens of Germany.'</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S MOVES SPARK FEARS IN CONGRESS;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS: LEADERS SHARE WORRIES THAT WAR MAY ERUPT DURING RECESS.  </P> <P> Members of Congress expressed serious concern Friday that President Bush's  deployment of more than 200,000 additional troops in the Persian Gulf signifies  a major change of strategy that could lead to war with Iraq.  </P> <P> With Bush himself and his top aides stressing that the United States may resort  to a military attack if the Iraqis refuse to withdraw from Kuwait, members of  Congress said they see the military buildup as a sign that the Administration  is losing patience with economic sanctions and is preparing for offensive  action.  </P> <P> So many Democratic members of Congress have begun raising questions about  Bush's policy that House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) has planned a  meeting in Washington next week to discuss the matter. He plans to return to  the Capitol today from his home in Washington state.  </P> <P> Foley said a date has not been set for the meeting, but presumably it will take  place before Wednesday, when Bush is to confer with congressional leaders on  the Persian Gulf situation.  </P> <P> "I think we're going to continue seeing more questions raised about this  matter," Foley said.  </P> <P> Democratic congressional leaders, who left Washington last week worried that  war might erupt while Congress is in recess, made it clear that the new  deployment has increased their fears. They urged Bush to consult more with  Congress and to spell out his gulf policy more extensively to the American  people.  </P> <P> Foley, though not declaring himself opposed to Bush's course, stressed that his  support for the President's decision to send troops to the area in August "has  been based on defensive operations -- and it still is."  </P> <P> Rep. William S. Broomfield (R-Mich.), ranking minority member of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee, called the sending of a much larger force "a major  change" in policy and said Bush should have consulted with lawmakers more to  assure full congressional backing.  </P> <P> "The whole question is one of putting more pressure on (Iraqi President) Saddam  Hussein," Broomfield said. "But if you want the broadest support, Congress has  got to be in on the takeoff as well as the landing."  </P> <P> Broomfield said Bush's failure to keep Congress better informed could undermine  his gulf policy and pointed out that he and committee Chairman Dante B. Fascell  (D-Fla.) asked Bush in an Oct. 26 letter to consult with Congress on any  additional deployment of forces or any change in military mission.  </P> <P> Fascell said it is unlikely that Saddam Hussein can be "bluffed out" of Kuwait  and "this means that we cannot keep increasing our forces in Operation Desert  Shield unless we are ready, willing and able to use them in an offensive  operation."  </P> <P> A congressional source said that when Foley met with Bush two weeks ago to  discuss the Persian Gulf crisis, he emphasized that, while Democrats backed his  policy, the President could not necessarily count on the party's support if the  United States launches an attack on Iraq without clear provocation. In a  telephone interview, Foley declined to confirm or deny that account.  </P> <P> Several Democratic members, speaking on condition that they not be identified,  explained that members of Congress who have questions about Bush's policy find  themselves in an awkward position because challenging Bush's move publicly  might relieve some of the pressure on Hussein.  </P> <P> "Nobody wants to give comfort to Saddam Hussein," one member said. "But some  members would like to see this policy more fully debated in public."  </P> <P> Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the House majority leader, said: "Democrats  have supported the President's policy and continue to do that, but what is  needed is greater consultation with Congress and discussions with the American  people so that, if the policy or underlying strategy is changing, people will  understand that."  </P> <P> Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), describing the American people's support for  Bush's policy as broad but "very thin," said, "There's a great deal of  uneasiness about all of this. They do not want American casualties. They feel  that very, very strongly."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the statute only requires the ABS, and not other IACS members, to be ISO&hyph;9000 certified. Another commenter proposed that IACS members should be certified to the ``IACS-Quality System Certification Scheme (QSCS),'' rather than the ISO&hyph;9000 standard. As to compliance with laws and regulations, several commenters requested that the provision be clarified to state that Eligible Export Vessels need comply only with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of the country of registry, and treaties and conventions to which the country of registry is a party, or the laws of the ports it serves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD Response: MARAD disagrees with the comment that MARAD is required to recognize solely the ABS as its agent in all matters related to Vessel classification. It is MARAD's position that it has the authority under section 1104A(b)(6) of the Act to set classification standards for Eligible Export Vessels without relying on the classification standards of ABS. Section 1104A(b)(6) of the Act specifically states that the guaranteed vessel ``shall be in class A&hyph;1, American Bureau of Shipping, or shall meet such other standards as may be acceptable to the Secretary *&blank;*&blank;*.'' There was nothing in the subsequent enactment of 46 U.S.C. 3316(b) that either explicitly or implicitly repealed MARAD's ``other standard'' authority. That phrase is not limited to a different ABS class than A&hyph;1, as ABS contends. For instance, ABS does not class all Vessels eligible for Title XI loan Guarantees. MARAD does not believe that the government's security will be in serious danger if the Vessel is not maintained in Class A&hyph;1 ABS, so long as it is classified by an IACS member in accordance with MARAD-approved standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, MARAD does not agree that the QSCS standard is more appropriate than the ISO 9000 standard. MARAD believes that the ISO 9000 series reflects a broader and more appropriate set of classification standards, and should be required. MARAD agrees essentially with the comments about the applicability of U.S. laws and regulations and has modified this provision accordingly to clarify that Eligible Export Vessels need not comply with all U.S. laws and regulations as to Vessel condition and operation, but must be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the International Maritime Organization that are in force at the time of the Vessel's delivery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 298.12&blank;Applicant and Operator's Qualifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that this section be expanded to include the concept that a shipyard may be the applicant for Guarantees for Eligible Export Vessels and may be the initial party to the documentation, with the ultimate purchaser assuming the obligations of the contracts as a party upon delivery of the Vessel. Another commenter stated that the information required with regard to the identity and ownership of the applicant by paragraphs (b)(1)(v) and (vi), which were not amended by the interim final rule, is primarily relevant to establishing citizenship and should not be required of applicants for Eligible Export Vessel Guarantees. A commenter stated that the content of this section does not recognize certain structures for corporate entities that exist only in foreign countries, e.g., a ``Gmbh'' under German law, and suggested that there be a separate section for foreign applicants. That commenter also stated that the required disclosure in paragraph (c)(4) of whether the applicant or a predecessor has been ``in default . . . with others'' during the past five years needs clarification and should be limited to a default with respect to a financial instrument that gave rise to a right of the non-defaulting party to receive accelerated payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the information sought by MARAD in paragraph (c) concerning the applicant's structure, business applications, activities and management, a commenter remarked that the expense to the ``smaller'' applicant may be burdensome, particularly where legal and accounting services are required, which services are excluded from the project's Actual Cost, and that the Secretary's ``waiver authority'' in section 298.13 (``Modified requirements'' in paragraph (h)) should be amended to exempt such applicants for Guarantees for Eligible Export Vessels from having to provide such information. Another commenter stated that the information required by paragraph (f)(2) concerning all management personnel of an Eligible Shipyard applying for a Guarantee for AST/MST is too broad and should be limited to senior supervisory personnel of the shipyard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD Response: A shipyard can be an applicant for a loan Guarantee under the existing regulations. The shipyard would, like all applicants, be required to demonstrate successfully that it meets the regulatory requirements for the program, i.e., that, among other things, it is creditworthy to be the Obligor for the guaranteed Obligations, has an economically sound use for the Vessel, and can offer sufficient collateral for the guaranteed Obligations. Building a ship solely on the speculative hope that it could be sold would not qualify. A shipyard, like any qualified Obligor, could transfer the Title XI obligation before or after delivery to a qualified purchaser with the consent of MARAD. No amendment to the regulation is necessary as such transfer is allowed as a matter of contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

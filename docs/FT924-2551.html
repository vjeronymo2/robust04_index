			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Norwegian bank floats krone NORWAY succumbed to heavy selling by currency speculators yesterday and effectively devalued the krone. Norway's finance ministry said it was removing the currency from its peg to the Ecu and allowing it to float, writes Peter John. The drama, heightened by early rumours of a coup in Russia and then replaced by tension emanating from a prolonged Bundesbank meeting, was a further blow to the stability of the exchange rate mechanism. The outcome of the Bundesbank meeting, a reaffirmation of existing interest rates, buoyed the D-Mark but ensured that the dollar failed to react to more positive economic news from the US. Norway's action yesterday morning prompted a sharp rise in the Norwegian stock market but placed immediate pressure on vulnerable currencies within the ERM, the Danish krone and the Irish punt. The French franc was also sold and at least one dealer said the french central bank had been intervening. The Norwegian central bank said it floated the krone as it expected pressure on it to continue. Mr Leif Eide, the bank's director said; 'It became too hard to fight, we saw little chance . . . of getting out of this, no matter how much currency reserves we used.' The krone has been allowed to swing 2.25 per cent either side of a central rate of NKr7.9940 per Ecu. It fell steeply after the move to close in London at Nkr4.295 against the D-Mark from NKr4.0840 previously. Afterwards, attention returned to the ERM and especially to the Danish currency which many now see as the prime devaluation candidate. The Danish currency, which is approaching its ERM floor of DKr3.9012 against the D-Mark, fell but rallied to close virtually unchanged at DKr3.8820. The punt replaced the franc at the bottom of the ERM floor and fell to DM2.6285 from DM2.6378. The franc drifted further towards its own limit against the D-Mark to reach FFr3.413. In the afternoon, there was growing tension as the Bundesbank Council meeting was prolonged for an hour, suggesting that some serious change of policy could be announced. The commitment to high interest rates was a disappointment but the statement that the M3 money supply target for 1993 was to rise to between 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent coupled with a switch from a variable repo rate to a fixed rate of 8.75 per cent for the next three weeks steadied nerves. There was further relief from action by the Dutch and Belgian central banks who cut key interest rates, Holland by 0.25 of a percentage point and Belgium by 10 basis points. Sterling recovered from a low of of DM2.4419 to end the day a pfennig off at DM2.4550 and slightly stronger against the dollar at Dollars 1.5765. The impact of encouraging employment and producer price statistics helped the dollar recover some earlier weakness to end up against the D-Mark at DM1.5765 although it was weaker against the Yen at Y123.50.</p>

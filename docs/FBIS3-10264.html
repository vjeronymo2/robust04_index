			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] At the conclusion of the first stage of talks in  Chiapas, the government responds with firm commitments to the  demands of the Indians, who are represented by the EZLN  [Zapatist National Liberation Army], while the government also  responds to the nation's demands. Such is democracy.    Ten days have passed since the negotiating table was  established in San Cristobal de las Casas; of the 34 points  presented, two are not resolved. The commitment of greatest  transcendency is the summons of special Congressional sessions  for electoral reforms that will bestow trustworthiness on the 21  August elections. Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis said  democratic policy is the road to change and on this point he  made reference to guarantees for the nation's progress. Here is  what Manuel Camacho Solis said:    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] Of the 34 initial points on  the list of petitions, the two referring to national democracy  are not part of the negotiation; however a response has been  clearly given for these. Instead of taking the confrontation  down a dead end street, we will all be part of a process of  political and institutional changes. This process must take  place in the civil society's institutions, in political parties,  in the state branches, and in public opinion. Democratic policy  is the road to change. The announcement that there will be  special sessions in the Congress -- with the political parties'  agreement -- to make reforms that will guarantee the  impartiality of the electoral institutions and the communities'  participation, is an important step toward democratic change.  This will contribute to the construction of peace in Chiapas.  [end recording]    This morning at the San Cristobal de las Casas cathedral, in  front of the media and the EZLN delegates, Camacho Solis said  that the results of the peace negotiations are unique and are a  source of pride for Mexico. Camacho Solis said that the road to  justice has been traced without winners or losers, as the  patriotism of the participants involved prevailed without  adversely affecting the legitimate rights of third parties.  Camacho Solis acknowledged that there were limitations in the  dialogue, noting, however, that neither constitutional order nor  sovereignty were ever hampered.    In the document entitled Commitment for a Worthy Peace, the  EZLN was offered the choice of the type or nature of its social  participation. Deadlines from 60 to 90 days were fixed to  initiate programs and resolutions on the demands of extension  for electricity projects, rehabilitation of hospitals and health  clinics, emergency programs to combat malnutrition problems,  support for womens community organizations, and support for the  transportation sector, as well as the concession or purchase of  a radio station controlled by the Indians.    With regard to the land problem, it was acknowledged that  the  agrarian reform process was not fully carried out in Chiapas.  As a result, an initiative was presented on a general law on  the Indian communities' rights, in response to the demands of  government autonomy, as well as on economic, political, and  cultural demands. Article 4 and parts of Article 27, which  strengthen the State's powers for the restitution of lands and  the division of vast land estates, will also be reformed. Also,  in response to the EZLN's list of petitions, the creation of the  Prosecutors Office for the Defense of Indians' Rights is  highlighted.    In addition, the Treasury Secretariat, within 60 days will  respond to expired loans, while the eviction of Indians will be  considered a crime. The Trade Secretariat will analyze NAFTA's  impact on Indian communities while a new electoral law will be  enacted in Chiapas. With regard to the EZLN demands to stage a  political trial against former governors Patrocinio Gonzalez,  Absalon Castellanos, and Elmar Zetzer, it was said that the  spirit of peace should wipe out resentments.    It was indicated that the release of political prisoners  would be carried out once peace is signed and in keeping with  the amnesty law. In addition, it is guaranteed that aid to the  victims of the conflict will be channeled through community  representatives.    Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis indicated that the  Federal Government's response includes all the Chiapas sectors  although they have broader repercussions. Camacho Solis said  that after consultations held by both of the dialogue  participants on these proposals, the final peace agreement in  Chiapas will be signed by the attorney general, the secretary  general of Amnesty and Reconciliation for Chiapas, the secretary  general of the Government, and the prosecutor. Meanwhile, for  the EZLN, general staff representatives will be appointed.    The consultations with the Indian communities and at  government institutions' levels could be concluded before the  end of this month. Meanwhile, the EZLN acknowledged that the  response to their demands put on the San Cristobal negotiating  table reflects true interest in finding peace. At the  conclusion of this first phase of the peace and reconciliation  efforts in Chiapas, EZLN delegates read communiques in which  they set out their position on the negotiations. An EZLN  representative -- who on this occasion was not Subcommander  Marcos -- acknowledged that a true dialogue had taken place  without deceit or lies, without the purchase or sale of dignity.  Here is what an unidentified EZLN representative said:    [Being EZLN representative recording] We found willingness  and eagerness to hear the truth which we spoke. The San  Cristobal dialogue was a true dialogue, there was no deceit or  lies, nothing was hidden in our hearts [words indistinct] reason  and goodness. There was no sale or purchase of dignity; we spoke  and were heard on an equal level. It was a true and good  dialogue. [end recording]    The EZLN widely acknowledged its appreciation of Manuel  Camacho Solis of whom it was said did not limit himself to just  hearing and understanding them, rather he searched for  alternative solutions. The EZLN also acknowledged its  appreciation of Bishop Samuel Ruiz' true concern to overcome the  obstacles found on the road to peace. The EZLN said that the  mediators fulfilled their tasks not in the middle of peace and  war, but as two voices that are still trying to find each other.  The EZLN indicated that now it must speak to the collective  heart of the Indians who are in the mountains. The armed group  also thanked the honest and altruistic work of the  nongovernmental organizations the representatives of which  formed a peace cordon around the San Cristobal cathedral where  this first stage of the dialogue for peace and reconciliation  took place.    This morning Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las  Cases, also gave his views on the conclusion of the dialogue's  first stage. Ruiz said that the conclusion of this first stage  of the efforts for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas  represents a landmark in Mexican history in which the Indians  demand and proclaim everyone's participation. Moreover, Ruiz  indicated that hidden forces representing state control and the  return to former ways which have been combated have been felt.  The Chiapas conflict mediator said that the peace agreements  will not be the result of discussions at a negotiating table but  of the willingness of each member of society to contribute his  part for the common well-being.    The San Cristobal de las Casas bishop indicated that Chiapas  had contributed to the nation's richness by its sacrifices and  now it contributes to the enhancement of a new nation as it  progresses in the construction of peace. Samuel Ruiz thanked  the EZLN for their serious and appropriate list of petitions.  Of Manuel Camacho Solis he said: We are now united on a common  road, while he thanked him for his sincerity and eagerness to  attain successfully a general consensus in the first stage of  the dialogue.    To conclude, the bishop said that the San Cristobal de las  Casas cathedral will be protected in order to subsequently hold  the final meeting of the peace and reconciliation efforts that  will be preceded by initiating the implementation of the  agreements.

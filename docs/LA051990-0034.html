			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO HAD OKD DEAL FOR DOCTOR, U.S. SAYS  </P> <P> Top Mexican law enforcement officials initially agreed to an "under the table"  deal to smuggle a Guadalajara doctor into the U.S. so he could face charges in  the 1985 torture-murder of drug agent Enrique Camarena, according to documents  filed Friday by federal prosecutors.  </P> <P> The April 2 kidnaping of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain by bounty hunters, who  delivered him the next day to Drug Enforcement Administration agents in El  Paso, has been denounced repeatedly by Mexican officials and has strained  relations between the two countries.  </P> <P> But the new documents, giving the first detailed U.S. government account of the  incident, suggest that Mexican Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo -- one  of the vocal critics of U.S. actions -- may have been a party to an earlier  agreement to swap the doctor for a Mexican bank embezzlement suspect hiding in  the U.S.  </P> <P> In negotiations late last year in Los Angeles, representatives of the Mexican  Federal Judicial Police asked that "the arrangement be 'under the table'  between the governments" so it would not "upset" Mexican citizens, according to  a legal brief and series of affidavits filed in U.S. District Court in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The brief, submitted in opposition to Alvarez's motion to dismiss charges  against him, reports that the doctor actually was detained in Mexico, but the  swap fell through when DEA officials refused to pay $50,000 in advance to the  federales who promised to bring him to the U.S. Later, prosecutors state,  informants advised the DEA that the doctor "had paid a bribe" to the federales  and was released.  </P> <P> Only after learning that Alvarez was free did a Los Angeles-based DEA  operative, Antonio Garate Bustamante, arrange the successful abduction through  contacts in Mexico, according to the documents. Garate, a former Mexican  policeman who admitted working for drug traffickers at one point, was promised  "a $50,000 reward" plus expenses.  </P> <P> Mexican officials could not be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> But Alvarez's lawyer, Robert K. Steinberg, dismissed as "an insult to the  intelligence" the prosecution's claim that Mexico was going to cooperate in  getting his client across the border.  </P> <P> The defense attorney said he was "delighted," however, that the documents  acknowledge that Garate arranged the abduction in close consultation with DEA  agent Hector Berrellez, who heads the Los Angeles-based task force  investigating Camarena's murder.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised that Berrellez admits a reward," the defense attorney said.  </P> <P> The DEA has long sought Alvarez, a gynecologist who allegedly revived Camarena  during the torture sessions that led to his death so the agent could be  questioned further about his knowledge of drug trafficking and official  corruption in Mexico. But the Mexican government refuses to extradite its  citizens for trial in other countries.  </P> <P> The outcry over the abduction began soon after the doctor was snatched from his  office and flown to El Paso. One Mexican official called it "a sort of  invasion" by the U.S.  </P> <P> On May 2, U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh met privately in Santa Fe with his  Mexican counterpart to explain the U.S. government's version of the incident.  It was "not a cordial session," one source said, and afterward Alvarez del  Castillo pledged to continue to prosecute those responsible for "the  deprivation of liberty and kidnaping."  </P> <P> The documents filed Friday maintain that discussions with Mexican officials  concerning the doctor began last year after Garate started helping the DEA  pursue additional leads in the Camarena killing, for which nine men already had  been indicted by a Los Angeles grand jury.  </P> <P> "In December, 1989, Garate was contacted telephonically by (Mexican judicial  police) commandante Jorge Castillo del Rey, who sought to meet with Garate and  representatives of the DEA in Los Angeles," the legal brief says.  </P> <P> At the Dec. 13 meeting, the account continues, "Castillo del Rey advised that  he was present in the United States with the full knowledge and authority of  the attorney general of Mexico."  </P> <P> Mexican officials were willing to give up Alvarez in order to get their hands  on the banker believed hiding in California "because he was alleged to have  stolen approximately $500 million from various politicians in Mexico," the  brief states.  </P> <P> The DEA reportedly agreed to find the Mexican fugitive and deport him as an  illegal alien.  </P> <P> Garate later continued negotiations by phone with Javier Orosco-Orosco, the  chief of the judicial police fugitive detail in Mexico City. But he demanded  "$50,000 in advance for an airplane and other expenses to transport  Alvarez-Machain to the United States," according to the prosecution account.  </P> <P> Four other Camarena defendants are on trial in federal court. Trial for Alvarez  has been delayed by the defense motion to dismiss charges on the grounds of  "outrageous government conduct."  </P></p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Citicorp back in profit at Dollars 722m CITICORP, the biggest US commercial bank, produced results for 1992 that indicate a solid recovery when compared with hefty write-offs and a full-year loss in 1991. Citicorp's return to the black for the whole of 1992 was mirrored by improved earnings at other big US banks. The New York-based Citicorp, which has weathered 18 months of criticism from analysts on Wall Street, produced full-year 1992 net profits of Dollars 722m (Pounds 475m) (Dollars 1.35 per share), compared with a loss of Dollars 457m in 1991. In the fourth quarter of 1992 Citicorp had net earnings of Dollars 280m (53 cents a share), against a Dollars 133m loss in the last quarter of 1991. Net loan write-offs in 1992 totalled Dollars 3.6bn, compared with Dollars 4.9bn in 1991. The commercial property loan portfolio, which suffered a Dollars 1.3bn loss in 1992, had write-offs of Dollars 1.1bn for the year, up from Dollars 572m in 1991. Total bad debt provisions were Dollars 4.1bn, up from Dollars 3.9bn. Mr John Reed, chairman, said the bank had completed its two-year plan of building capital and reserves, restoring earnings and building on core franchises while selling non-strategic assets. He said operating revenues rose by 5 per cent to Dollars 16.6bn while expenses were down to Dollars 9.5bn from Dollars 10.1bn in 1991. The global consumer business earned Dollars 941m in 1992, up from Dollars 530m in 1991. Corporate finance earned Dollars 1.1bn, sharply up on Dollars 293m in 1991. The bank's return on assets in 1992 was still a paltry 0.32 per cent, less than half the US industry average. Its common equity-to-assets capital ratio, while clearly on the mend, was only 3.7 per cent, up from 3.4 per cent in 1991. The tier one capital ratio was much improved at 4.9 per cent against 3.7 per cent in 1991. Mr James McDermott, president of bank analysts Keefe Bruyette, said Citicorp's profits were helped by wider interest margins and the impact of expense reductions. 'The results were better than expected, although they are not out of the woods yet and need to do more on cost-cutting and capital strengthening,' he said. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, revised its ratings outlook for the bank from 'negative' to 'stable'. Other results, Page 26</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Blair House and the French PM FRANCE AND Ireland have sometimes made common cause against a common 'Anglo-Saxon' enemy, but Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, who visits Paris this week, is not that kind of Irishman. Some of his French hosts, indeed, will see him as little better than an Anglo-Saxon messenger boy, although the message he brings - that last year's Blair House agreement between the EC and the US on agricultural trade cannot and must not be reopened - has the support of the vast majority of the 106 countries taking part in the Uruguay Round negotiations. His task of getting this message through to the French has been made more difficult by the German chancellor who, after talks with the French prime minister the week before last, declared publicly that Germany too had 'problems' with the Blair House agreement, and implied that he expected a new or supplementary agreement to be negotiated. Several of his ministers and spokesmen hastened to explain that this was not what he had really meant, and Mr Kohl himself allayed Mr Sutherland's anxieties on the point last week. But clearly he did mean to signal at least some sympathy for the French position. Bilateral Franco-German talks on the subject have now started, although the Germans insist their object is to find a solution that leaves Blair House intact. Hard to accept The trouble with this approach is that no solution can both modify the agreement (as the French insist it must) and not modify it. But politics obeys different laws from logic. Nearly a year of intensive surenchere (mutual outbidding) by French politicians in denunciation of the agreement has left them with a real, if unnecessary, problem. Even a prime minister of Mr Edouard Balladur's unprecedented popularity would find it very hard now, after all that has been said, simply to accept the agreement without any kind of quid pro quo. What then can be done to make this unwelcome pill easier for the French body politic to swallow? As far as agriculture is concerned it would be unrealistic to expect any further concessions from the US. At most the EC might go through the motions of demanding, or asserting, a right to take some kind of protective or compensatory action in the event of very large and sudden movements in prices, or in currency parities. But any tangible satisfaction will have to come from within the EC itself, and take forms that do not infringe the agreement. Commercial policy The French government might reasonably ask its partners for an undertaking that they will resist any US demand for guarantees that food imports will supply a specific share of the EC market. Less reasonably, but on past form not unrealistically, it may expect a direct transfer of financial resources, in other words a bribe. Almost certainly it will be encouraged to bribe French farmers from its own national resources, provided it does so in ways that neither stimulate increased production nor subsidise lower prices. As far as possible, however, France's partners should seek to shift discussion away from agriculture on to the broader questions of commercial policy that France has raised. The demand for the EC to equip itself with more credible powers to retaliate against arbitrary protectionist measures taken by the US or other powers is not unreasonable, so long as those powers are not abused to placate producer lobbies within the EC; and the demand that the EC presses for an effective international body, to make sure that new trading rules are observed, is one that all sincere free traders should support. In raising such questions France is behaving more like the great industrial power it actually is, and less like the carefully fenced rural reserve that is how it sometimes sees itself. In the last resort, the job of breaking the French obsession with subsidised agriculture is one for France's own leaders. Behind a smokescreen of demagogy, they have in fact moved a long way in that direction. In the present conjoncture they might be able to go further if at the same time they relaxed their monetary policy, giving industry a better chance to absorb the labour which, willy-nilly, will continue to leave the land.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Mortgage rise points to fragile homes recovery Signs that a fragile recovery in the housing market is continuing came yesterday with figures from the Bank of England showing a small increase in the number of mortgage approvals. The number of new loans approved was slightly higher in October than in September, prompting the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents building societies and banks, to welcome the figures as evidence that the recovery was gathering pace. Net lending during October in both seasonally adjusted and non-adjusted terms was slightly lower than in September, when it amounted to just over Pounds 2bn. In spite of the fairly flat numbers lenders have been encouraged by the Budget decision not to abolish mortgage tax relief altogether. The lending figures came as two surveys from the UK's largest building societies show prices rising slightly compared with last year. But the surveys do not present a clear picture of price movements compared with last month. The survey for the Nationwide, the UK's second largest society, shows house prices were 2.3 per cent higher than a year ago. The Halifax survey says that prices were 1.5 per cent higher than a year ago, and on course for an overall increase of 2 per cent this year. But while the survey for the Halifax shows house prices rising slightly in November, the Nationwide survey shows a fall of 1.5 per cent from October prices. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, said that there was little evidence yet of a strong recovery, and added that he thought the increase in mortgage approvals reflected people switching from building society mortgages to fixed rate mortgages. He said however, that not having a Budget in March would assist the recovery as it would end uncertainties in the spring, which was a good period for the housing market. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said that now pre-Budget uncertainty had ended there was every reason to expect that the stronger levels of mortgage approvals to feed through into advances.</p>

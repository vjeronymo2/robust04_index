			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Industries' efforts to sway Commission shift into gear - Lobbying has gained in priority Industry's contacts with the European Parliament are for the most part a by-product of the well-oiled machinery that tries to exert an influence on the European Commission. Commissioners are likely to remain the first stop for any industry lobbyist. But for some, the parliamentary elections have signalled that members of the European Parliament may deserve more attention than can be given in the spare time of a Brussels lobbyist. The chemicals industry has one of the more powerful lobby organisations in Brussels, Cefic, with a full-time European Parliament liaison officer. Some countries, such as the UK since the 1989 Euro elections, have established direct links with MEPs. The two routes to Strasbourg are useful when differences arise between national bodies and with Cefic. These are inevitable in the chemicals industry because of the different make-up of national groups: the UK group, for example, is an employers' association, whereas the German group is not. The European textiles industry is an even more accomplished player of the Euro-lobby game. It has a European Parliament lobbying group, set up nearly four years ago by Mrs Carla Piejs, a Dutch Christian Democrat MEP. The group, including representatives from the textiles trade and unions as well as industry, has four meetings a year. These are open to specialist speakers and journalists. It can point to the establishment of an anti-fraud unit dealing with schemes to avoid tariffs and trade quotas, and it successfully lobbied the parliament to win greater assistance for exporters of textiles and clothing. Then there is the electronics industry, which sees the European Parliament as at best more bureaucratic entanglement, and at worst as an irrelevance. Companies complain of a lack of initiative and focus compared with Brussels, which is seen as the centre for policy making. MEPs are not particularly visible nor easy to interest in industrial matters. The European computing services industry provides an illustration. During the past three years, the industry has been much concerned about a software directive, ostensibly designed to curb software piracy, but with significant implications for the freedom of software developers to build new products. Few directives have seen fiercer lobbying by the opposing camps. The lobbying took place in Brussels, however, not Strasbourg. The parliament was not thought to have had much influence on or grasp of the principle at stake. UK retailers are also sceptical and deal with European institutions through the national trade body, the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Brussels trade groups and bodies such as the European Retail Alliance, set up by Ahold of the Netherlands, France's Casino and Argyll of the UK, and EuroCommerce do their share of lobbying, but the BRC usually prefers to deal directly with MEPs, says Mr James May, its director general. Mr May says UK retailers follow the line of the ruling UK Conservative party in not wanting more powers to go to the European parliament. 'The role of the parliament is to act as a watchdog on the commission,' he says . The construction sector, too, tends to approach Brussels through national industry bodies, and national interests have a strong role in what each group presses for. It has concentrated on lobbying the commission about the harmonisation of standards for the design and construction of buildings. It may now take a greater interest in the parliament and its committees, which can influence the legislation under preparation. The planned regulation of environmental emissions is one issue that is being watched by both construction and chemicals industry groups. The telecommunications business is by necessity more international in its outlook than retailing and construction, where companies tend to be nationally based. British Telecom has had a Brussels office since 1990. It is now five-strong and will soon be enlarged. Mr Peter Mackie, its director, says however that 'more than 80 per cent' of its time is devoted to the European Commission. 'We have not been very active with the parliament - just on an ad hoc basis. About half of what we have done - briefings and so on - has been with British MEPs, about half with others,' he said. 'We are looking to devote more time to the parliament now that co-decision is more important, but most of the decisions affecting us will still be taken in the Commission and the Council,' he adds.

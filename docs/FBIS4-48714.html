			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 24 SAPA -- A joint working group, under  the leadership of KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose and  African National Congress Natal leader Jacob Zuma, was  established on Tuesday to resolve differences over executive  portfolios in the provincial legislature. The group was formed  when a delegation led by Dr Mdlalose and an ANC delegation met  in Durban in a bid to break the impasse over the allocation of  portfolios.    The conflict arose last week when Natal's three anc  ministers, Mr Zuma, S'bu Ndebele and Zweli Mkhize, excused  themselves from the swearing-in ceremony in Pietermaritzburg.    The ANC was dissatisfied with the portfolios allocated to  the  three ministers, and charged Dr Mdlalose should have consulted  with them before a decision was taken.    A joint statement issued after Tuesday's meeting said the  group would meet in Durban on Thursday to finalise matters so  the KwaZulu/Natal Executive Council could begin to exercise its  responsibility.    Mr Zuma said the re-allocation of portfolios was still under  discussion.    Both delegations committed themselves to working together  and  Dr Mdlalose said the provincial government of unity was "on  track".    "Full and frank discussions were held in a cordial  atmosphere. Both sides committed themselves as a matter of  urgency to finding solutions to outstanding issues and good  progress was made in this regard," read the statement.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG CHILDREN CAN GET FREE SPEECH THERAPY;  </P> <P> LANGUAGE: PUBLIC SCHOOLS OFFER SPECIAL PROGRAMS TO HELP 2- TO 5-YEAR-OLDS  TACKLE SPEECH PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY REACH THE CLASSROOM.  </P> <P> Christina David was only 3 1/2 when her parents realized that only her family  could understand her speech.  </P> <P> The pediatrician told her parents that Christina's frequent ear infections --  which limited her ability to hear -- may have contributed to her language  problem, and recommended speech therapy.  </P> <P> Her parents, Dotty and Pablo David, spent about $3,500 for a year and a half of  private speech therapy, yet still felt Christina was difficult to understand.  </P> <P> Then the Davids found out that the Los Angeles Unified School District offers  speech and language assessment and therapy, and they tried it. Within a few  months, Christina had made great progress, and by the time she entered  kindergarten, she had no speech problems. Now their son Mickey, 4, is getting  speech therapy at Morningside School in San Fernando for a similar problem.  </P> <P> Many parents are not aware that the best time to catch speech and language  difficulties is early -- at age 2 to 3 -- which is several years before  children start school. Some may not realize that help is available through the  public schools for children that young.  </P> <P> But the Los Angeles Unified School District offers a range of programs designed  to meet the needs of preschool and kindergarten students. The programs are  available free to all children in the community, even if they are headed for or  enrolled in private or parochial schools.  </P> <P> The programs are mandated by federal and state laws that specifically require  that services be available to children ages 3 to 5 as well as to those who are  in school.  </P> <P> The programs range from five-day-a-week classes for children with severe speech  problems to once-a-week programs for children with minor speech lags. The  programs include classroom enrichment designed to stimulate the language  development of children in socio-economically disadvantaged areas to more  traditional speech therapy with licensed, credentialed speech and language  specialists. There are 78 speech and language therapists in the San Fernando  Valley, serving 181 elementary, secondary and special education schools.  </P> <P> According to Barbara Staley, a speech and language specialist at Montague  Avenue School in Pacoima and at Morningside School, the first step for parents  who think their children may have a problem is to call the Valley's Special  Education Services office (818-997-2466) to request a screening. A speech and  language specialist, a psychologist and a motor development specialist will  assess the child's socialization, speech, language and motor skills and make a  formal recommendation.  </P> <P> Children who show a mild delay in speech and language development may be  referred to the Early Education Program, a 90-minute, once-a-week class that  gives children special attention designed to build language skills and provide  parents with language-related information and a parent support group. Children  age 3 and older with more severe speech problems may be offered one of 55  Special Day Class programs, which give special attention to six to eight  children in a classroom five days a week.  </P> <P> When Christopher Stone, 7, started the five-day-a-week special day class at  Dearborne School in Northridge three years ago, he had a learning and speech  delay problem that made even saying simple words difficult, said his father,  Alan Stone, a Van Nuys graphic artist.  </P> <P> Now Christopher is starting first grade -- and doing well -- with the added  special reading and motor skill support from the school's resource teacher.  "The language programs are one thing the school district does really well,"  Stone said. "And it's free. Chris' teacher treated him like he was her own  child, and gave personalized attention to all six or eight kids in the class."  </P> <P> Stone said he found that the private schools he checked into didn't have the  facilities to work with children with special needs.  </P> <P> Stone said he feels Christopher was lucky that his problems were identified  early. Many of the children in Chris' kindergarten class, he said, clearly  would have benefited from additional speech and language training but their  parents were either unaware of the children's special needs or they assumed  their speech development would eventually catch up.  </P> <P> Many parents don't realize that language problems do not necessarily go away as  a child matures, Staley said. What is considered cute baby talk for a toddler  may not work when children are put in social situations with other children.  The child whose speech sounds different from the others can be singled out and  teased, or may become self-conscious, frustrated or reserved, she said.  </P> <P> In addition, failing to get speech help early can lead to failure in school.  "Reading and writing are just another dimension of oral language, and if  children can't hear and say the words correctly, they will have trouble  learning to read and write," Staley said.  </P> <P> Just as some parents don't move aggressively to have their children's speech  assessed when potential problems present themselves, Staley said others seem  overly concerned and tense about their preschooler's failure to enunciate  perfectly.  </P> <P> "Many parents want to fix things right away, they want the language problems to  be solved immediately," she said. "But parents, while they need to have  problems looked at, also need to relax. You can't go to the bathroom for your  child, you can't eat for your child and you can't make them talk. You have to  build their self-esteem and have faith that things will start to happen."  </P> <P> To help speed the children's development of language skills in  socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, the school district has  targeted 18 kindergarten classrooms for the Oral Language Development Program.  The program is designed to build the communication skills of kindergartners who  may not have had the benefit of such language stimulation in a preschool  environment, said Esther Meyers, a speech and language specialist and a program  coordinator in the Valley. Speech and language specialists work with  kindergarten teachers to build skills that the teachers can use immediately and  with future classes, and they work directly with the children to help them  learn to talk in the more formal environment of the classroom.  </P> <P> Staley, who works with 90 children in the program at Montague, said: "Many  children are coming from a home environment where their family always knows  what they're talking about, and when they're in the classroom they may not  realize that the teacher and other students don't necessarily understand what  they are talking about."  </P> <P> Staley said the program teaches children to talk in front of the class and to  speak in complete sentences, and it enriches the children's vocabulary through  play activities and songs.  </P> <P> Once their child has been identified as having a speech or language problem,  some parents wonder whether they should use the school district services or  give their children private speech therapy.  </P> <P> Bernice Sedlik, a private speech and language specialist in Canoga Park, said  she always advises parents to seek services through the public schools.  "Parents usually do contact the public schools," she said, but added that there  are situations in which the structure or the design of the services may not  meet the parents' or the children's needs.  </P> <P> "A school schedule may not be compatible with a parent's schedule, or parents  may have a negative view of the services they will receive in the schools," she  said. Sometimes, parents have expressed concern that the people testing the  children do not seem comfortable working with preschoolers, or the services  seem inconsistent due to holiday school closures or staff meetings that  interrupt the regularly scheduled speech therapy sessions or classes.  </P> <P> The benefit of private speech therapy is that the child gets more personal  attention, since private sessions usually involve only one child while the  public school speech therapy sessions often include two or three children. But  she said that if a child qualifies for the early education program, she  recommends that program over private therapy.  </P> <P> "While parents sometimes wonder if their children can improve their speech  skills in a classroom setting, by three-quarters of the way through the year,  the parents realize the children have learned to speak well without one-to-one  attention. You're changing their speech environments for the rest of their  lives, by modeling for the parents and teaching the parents how to facilitate  speech development, too."  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Talk, Listen to Kids  </P> <P> Tips for improving your child's speech and language skills from the Special  Education Services Unit of the Los Angeles Unified School District:  </P> <P> * Don't talk to your children as if they're 30. Speak slowly, use words they  can understand and check to make sure they understand what you are saying.  </P> <P> * Stop and listen to your children. Reinforce what they say by responding to  them, letting them know you understand them.  </P> <P> * Don't correct a child's mispronunciations; try to use the word for them  properly, but casually, so they can hear it said correctly.  </P> <P> * Try to enrich your child's vocabulary in daily life. Build on the words they  use. If a child says, for example, "Look at this pretty flower," you can say,  "Yes, I love the shape of the petals."  </P> <P> * If you're unsure about your child's speech development, seek professional  help.

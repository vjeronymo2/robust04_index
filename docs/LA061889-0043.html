			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TARDY TRIBUTE  </P> <P> For three years beginning in mid-1950, the United States committed millions of  men and billions of dollars to an international effort that prevented the  conquest of South Korea by the Communist regime to its north. That undertaking  initially commanded broad support among the American people. In time, though,  it became both a subject of major domestic political controversy and, even as  it was still being fought, a matter of increasing public apathy. A conflict  that produced some of the most dramatic and heroic episodes in U.S. military  history and -- after China intervened with its forces in late 1950 -- did much  to set the course of Sino-American relations for the next two decades,  eventually came to be thought of as the Forgotten War.  </P> <P> It would be more proper, of course, to see the conflict in Korea as one that  has been simply neglected in American historical consciousness. For certainly  it has not been and never will be forgotten by those who fought there, or by  the families of the dead, the wounded and the missing, or by the hundreds of  thousands of U.S. servicemen who subsequently were assigned to South Korea to  help safeguard that country's security, an obligation that continues to this  day.  </P> <P> Curiously, in this nation that tends to be both generous and sometimes not too  choosy in erecting monuments to events and persons both great and  insignificant, U.S. participation and sacrifices in the Korean War have never  received adequate official national recognition. That oversight is at last  about to be corrected. If the final $2.8 million that is needed for a privately  funded $6-million memorial can soon be raised, a 2-acre site across the  reflecting pool from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., could  be dedicated by June 25, 1991, the 41st anniversary of North Korea's invasion  of South Korea.  </P> <P> More than 54,000 Americans died in the Korean War, of whom 33,629 were killed  in action. Another 103,284 were wounded; of these, more than 2,000 subsequently  died. The missing in action totaled 5,866, and more than 2,700 men died in  captivity. When the war was over, those who had fought came home and for the  most part, without parades or speeches or other ceremony, quietly reintegrated  themselves into civilian life. The nation has been too long in suitably  remembering the services they performed.  </P></p>

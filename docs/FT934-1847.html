			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia to join International Cocoa Organisation Malaysia, one of the world's top five cocoa producers, will join the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO), according to Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the country's primary industries minister, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur. He said he had instructed the Malaysian mission in New York to begin the signing and tabling of instruments to enable Malaysia to join the International Cocoa Agreement by February, and subsequently become a member of the ICCO. Malaysia likes the new agreement, which started in October, because it no longer tries to maintain a buffer stock, a ministry official quoted Mr Lim as telling a luncheon meeting on Tuesday. Members of the organisation decided in September to liquidate its 230,000 tonne stockpile over four and a half years. The ICCO will also send a team to Indonesia, which is set to overtake Malaysia this year to become the biggest producer in the Far East and the fourth biggest in the world, to try to persuade it to join the organisation, Mr Lim said. Representatives of coffee producers from Indonesia, Brazil, Colombia, Central America and Africa will meet in New York today and tomorrow to evaluate the operation of the coffee-retention scheme with which they are trying to boost world coffee prices, said Mr Arnoldo Lopez, president of the Costa Rica Coffee Institute, reports Reuter from San Jose. 'It'll be a reunion of the administrative committee of the retention plan to analyse compliance' with the scheme that went into effect in October, he said. 'We should also receive information about how Asian countries are incorporating retention mechanisms,' said Mr Lopez, who is also vice president of Costa Rica. Latin American coffee producers agreed at a meeting in October in Brazil to retain 20 per cent of exports to boost low market prices. African countries joined the scheme and Indonesia, the world's third-largest producer, is expected to begin retaining coffee on April 1. 'We hope other Asian countries such as Vietnam, India and Papua Nueva Guinea adopt the mechanism to increase the effectiveness of the retention scheme,' said Mr Lopez. He said that the leaders of the global coffee-producers' association established in Brazil would discuss assuming control of the export retention scheme at the New York meeting. The initial results of the retention scheme were encouraging, Mr Lopez said.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINCO DE HYPE;  </P> <P> SOME COMMUNITY LEADERS QUESTION IF HOLIDAY IS TOO COMMERCIAL IN THE SOUTHLAND.  OTHERS WELCOME SPONSORS AND THEIR MONEY.  </P> <P> If Vivien Bonzo has her way, Cinco de Mayo celebrants will leave Olvera Street  this weekend with a sense of Mexican orgullo -- pride. Mariachi music will  remind Angelenos of the city's origins. Colorful ballet folklorico dancers will  remind them of Mexico's rich cultural heritage.  </P> <P> Bonzo's fear is that the crowds tomorrow and Sunday -- expected to number  40,000 -- will leave, not with a sense of orgullo, but rather, with free  cigarettes, disposable diapers and laundry detergent.  </P> <P> "I want my people to leave Olvera Street with pride, not products," says Bonzo,  who is president of the Olvera Street Merchant's Assn. and one voice in a  growing chorus of concern over the commercialization of Cinco de Mayo.  </P> <P> Corporate sponsors now underwrite a portion of the costs of the Olvera Street  festivities -- which commemorate the Mexican victory over the French forces of  Louis Napoleon in the Battle of Puebla 128 years ago -- and sponsorship  sometimes includes product giveaways. In the past, corporate sponsors of May 5  celebrations in Southern California have included beer and alcohol companies.  </P> <P> Indeed, for many Angelenos, Cinco de Mayo has become synonymous with rowdy  behavior and drinking. Last year, gang-related violence, bolstered by  drunkenness, ruined a holiday celebration at Lincoln Park in East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Bonzo and other Latinos would like to substitute history for hype and are  working to ensure that the holiday is observed with less fanfare and more  dignity -- as it is in Mexico.  </P> <P> Alberto Diaz, spokesman for the Mexican Consulate, says that in Mexico, Cinco  de Mayo is celebrated "on a smaller scale by civic groups." He says only the  southeastern Mexican state of Puebla celebrates May 5 on a grand scale.  </P> <P> Says Juana Mora, research associate at UCLA's Chicano Studies Research Center:  "The commercialization of Lincoln Park's event all but destroyed it." (The  event, which featured rock bands and attracted 60,000 people last year, was  shut down early and led to this year's ban on alcohol. It also prompted a  return to a family-oriented atmosphere after more than 20 community-based  organizations met to plan this weekend's event, "without major entertainment  and without beer," says event chairman Tony Trancale.)  </P> <P> Historian Rudy Acuna, a professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Northridge,  agrees with Mora.  </P> <P> "I just don't like the commercialization of Cinco de Mayo. In the past, the day  was celebrated (in the United States) like a regular Mexican holiday, but now,  everybody wants a piece of it -- the commercialization. It's become the Cinco  de Mayo happy hour."  </P> <P> "It's not like Black History Month. There is a meaning to Black History Month,  (but) I don't think there is too much meaning that you find with Cinco de Mayo.  There should definitely be more thought coming into the real reason for  celebrating that day -- political, historical and cultural reasons."  </P> <P> For many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, Cinco de Mayo serves as "inspiration  for their own struggle against injustice," says Fernando Guerra, chairman of  the Chicano Studies Department at Loyola Marymount University.  </P> <P> "Commercializing Cinco de Mayo allows you to communicate it to a much broader  audience, but in the process, the real meaning is diluted -- and that meaning  is survival of a culture."  </P> <P> Guerra adds that the event's "commercialization makes it acceptable to be  Mexican on Cinco de Mayo, especially with the younger kids, because it has been  taken in by the larger culture as a holiday. But it should be acceptable to be  Mexican or Mexican-American if that's your culture and to be proud of the  Mexican culture every day."  </P> <P> Leticia Quezada, a board member of the Los Angeles Unified School District,  says this is the first year the board -- at her urging -- mandated that  teachers devote lesson plans to Cinco de Mayo and El Dia del Maestro (Teacher's  Day), another tradition observed in Mexico in May. Teachers have been devoting  this week -- and some, the entire month of May -- to enlightening students  about Mexican history, leaders and culture much in the way Black History Month  is observed. Parents and community leaders also have been involved.  </P> <P> "It's important for Latino children (who make up 62% of the district's  enrollment) to feel proud about who they are, proud about the Mexican culture  and to see that Mexican culture held up as a model because then that raises  their self-esteem as Mexican children," says Quezada. She adds that although  corporate sponsorship for Cinco de Mayo events "enables these activities to  carry on in the absence of government funding it is important that Mexican  celebrations not lose their cultural value because of heavy drinking and  violence."  </P> <P> Historically, Acuna says Cinco de Mayo observances first became "popular among  Chicano activists in the early 1970s. That's when beer and other corporate  sponsors jumped on the bandwagon" by helping to promote the celebration in  Mexican-American communities. Before that time, academics say, the celebration  was usually a neighborhood or family affair.  </P> <P> "The media picked up on it and so did the beer industry," says Mora, who is  presently conducting a two-year research project on Mexican-American women and  alcohol. She says that in 1988, alcohol companies spent close to $25 million on  Cinco de Mayo promotions in Southern California alone.  </P> <P> Mora, who contributed to "Marketing Disease to Hispanics," a booklet published  last year by the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest,  has researched the roles alcohol and tobacco companies play in the Latino  community. With the center's support she and Acuna are working to establish the  Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco "to counter some of the negative aspects  brought on by the commercialization of holidays in the Chicano community.  </P> <P> "We are also critical of Latino national organizations and local ones who  accept funding for events (like Cinco de Mayo) and how they allow corporate  sponsors to promote products such as beer and cigarettes that endanger the  health of our community."  </P> <P> Olvera Street's May 5 celebrations have been partially funded by commercial  sponsors for several years. This year's events -- produced by Riverside  Promotions, a Hollywood-based Latino marketing firm appointed by City  Councilman Richard Alatorre -- have 50 commercial sponsors.  </P> <P> Mike Mariscal, owner of the Velasco Souvenir Shop on Olvera Street and a member  of the merchant's group, says, "If the commercialization of it can be toned  down and the Mexican culture elevated that would be terrific." (Some merchants  are also upset over the city's plans to restore the area; they accuse the city  of wanting to "dilute" Olvera Street's Mexican-American flavor by bringing in  multi-ethnic businesses and attractions nearby.)  </P> <P> Al Avila, chief deputy for Councilman Alatorre (Olvera Street is located in  Alatorre's district), and Fernando Favela, general manager for Riverside  Promotions, say corporate sponsors who will foot the six-figure bill for the  Olvera Street fiesta are necessary because of cutbacks in city funding for such  events.  </P> <P> Avila and Favela contend that because of corporate involvement, there is more  money to publicize events and pay for entertainment. This year, Cinco de Mayo  events and entertainment at Olvera Street include mariachi bands, ballet  folklorico dancers, singers and bands.  </P> <P> "These celebrations are not cheap," Avila says about the celebration he calls  "the premiere event in Southern California."  </P> <P> "You have to do everything from closing streets, build stages, take care of  electrical systems, set up booths and pay for entertainment. There is a lot of  overhead and you need sponsors for that." (Last Sunday, commercial sponsors,  including Procter &amp; Gamble, AT&amp;T, Kern's Juices and Acapulco  restaurants, helped underwrite a $1-million pre-Cinco de Mayo festival attended  by 500,000 in downtown Los Angeles.)  </P> <P> Avila says Cinco de Mayo participants must look beyond the commercialization of  the event and enjoy and share the Mexican culture.  </P> <P> "It's not just a party in a park. It's a party in a historical monument,"  Favela says, referring to the Olvera Street's Mexican market area as Los  Angeles' birthplace.  </P> <P> As for the sponsors he has assembled for the Olvera Street event (as well as  for the Cinco de Mayo celebration at Centennial Regional Park in Santa Ana --  one of the largest in Orange County) Favela says visitors do not have to  partake in the product giveaways or drink beer.  </P> <P> He says critics who oppose the commercial sponsors do not realize "that the  commercialization needs to be there to make the event work."  </P> <P> "It says a lot about a company when that company recognizes the Hispanic  community and that the community has a lot of potential as consumers," Favela  says.  </P> <P> Two of the Olvera Street booths, as well as some of the restaurants, will sell  beer.  </P> <P> None will be sold at Lincoln Park because last year, more than 150 police  officers were called to the park to quell a disturbance after one man was shot  and several others were injured, including a police officer, when fighting  erupted between street gangs.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of drinking going on," says Trancale, who adds that $22,000 worth  of beer was sold. (Miller beer was a sponsor of the event.) "We had a lot of  gang violence and there were thousands of people and families who wanted to  have a good time and didn't."  </P> <P> But, he points out that corporate sponsors bought top-name entertainers like  Sheila E. And "thousands of kids in the area were benefiting from the money  raised."  </P> <P> This year's liquor ban at Lincoln Park has resulted in little attention from  major sponsors, which will make the three-day event, which starts today,  "financially difficult" to produce, Trancale says. But two sponsors are helping  to pay for a carnival and a children's entertainment area highlighting  acrobats, folklorico groups and the California Youth Theatre ensemble.  </P> <P> Trancale is glad to be a part of an event that is being returned to area  families.  </P> <P> "We're offering another option to people. We are trying to rebuild the park's  credibility with the public. We are giving back Cinco de Mayo to the area's  Mexican and Mexican-American families."  </P> <P> Guillermo Hernandez, co-chairman of the United Neighborhoods Organization, says  he and other parents are happy about the renewed focus for this year's event.  </P> <P> But they are most pleased with ban on beer.  </P> <P> "Our celebration this year is more in the spirit of Cinco de Mayo," says  Hernandez, who lives a few blocks from Lincoln Park and has been attending the  Cinco de Mayo celebrations there for years.  </P> <P> "We've always wanted for Cinco de Mayo in Lincoln Park to focus more on the  family and the kids. Most of the time these celebrations use beer companies to  make money but they never focus on why we are celebrating, on the culture.  </P> <P> "So this year we're having different folklorico groups and mariachis -- no rock  'n' roll bands, no product giveaways. We want to show different communities  that we can do an event without beer and have fun."  </P></p>

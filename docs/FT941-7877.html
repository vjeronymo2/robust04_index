			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US may submit tariffs this week The US said yesterday it hoped to submit by the end of this week its final tariff schedule under the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. Washington's delay in producing its schedule following a row with Japan over tariff concessions has held up other countries' submissions and threatened the tight timetable for checking and printing schedules before ministers meet in Marrakesh in April to sign the Uruguay Round accords. Failure of the US and its Quad partners - the European Union, Japan and Canada - to submit tariff schedules by the agreed February 15 deadline came in for strong criticism at an emergency session of top trade negotiators in Geneva yesterday. Shortly before that deadline, the Quad group agreed they would submit their schedules together, after cross-checking to ensure they reflected agreed concessions. Tokyo has threatened retaliation and accused the US of bad faith after Washington said it was withdrawing offers on wood, white spirits and some industrial electronics goods made last December, on the grounds that Japan had failed to match these with tariff concessions of its own. The US action has sown confusion among trading partners who fear the ripple effects if other nations too decide to adjust their tariff offers. The EU, Japan and Canada have said they are waiting for the US schedule before deciding whether to retract concessions. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, is believed to have said yesterday that tariff offers made in December could not be withdrawn, only improved upon. US officials told the meeting that the delay on Washington's part was due to 'technical problems' and the schedule, covering thousands of items, would be in 'hopefully by the end of the week'.</p>

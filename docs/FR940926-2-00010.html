At the request of the Department of Commerce (the Department), petitioner filed a supplement to support and clarify the petition's data on September 16, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12 (1994), petitioner alleges that carbon steel pipe nipples (pipe nipples) from Mexico are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner states that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, such party should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential antidumping duty order must submit its request for exclusion within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice. The procedures and requirements regarding the filing of such requests are contained in 19 CFR 353.14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this investigation are carbon steel pipe nipples, both finished and unfinished, defined as cut carbon steel pipe having a maximum length of 12 inches. Unfinished pipe nipples (nipple blanks) have not been subjected to any machining following the cutting of the pipe. Finished pipe nipples have been machined after the cutting, including, but not limited to, the following processes: reaming/deburring, chamfering, and/or threading. The type of finish on one end of a pipe nipple need not be the same as the finish on the other end. For threaded pipe nipples, threading is performed along the outside diameter to permit fastening of the pipe nipple to other components with a matching inside diameter thread.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pipe nipples manufactured from plain (black), galvanized, welded and seamless carbon steel pipe are included within the scope of this investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The products under investigation are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.99.5015 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price and Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner based U.S. price (USP) on F.O.B. U.S. port price lists (for November 1993 and July 1994) obtained for pipe nipples produced by a Mexican manufacturer. Petitioner calculated USP by subtracting the estimated cost of shipping expenses based on the percentage difference between customs value and C.I.F. value for pipe nipples from Mexico. Because petitioner provided home market price quotes from 1994, the Department is basing USP on the 1994 prices. We recalculated USP to include value-added taxes (VAT) in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act. In making our adjustment for VAT, we followed the instructions of the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal Mogul Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  834 F.Supp. 1391 (CIT 1993). We also deducted the amount of tax due solely to price deductions in the original tax base. By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that could cause the creation of a dumping margin even where pre-tax dumping is zero. For discussion of this adjustment see Final Results of Administrative Review: Certain Industrial Forklifts from Japan, (59 FR 1374, January 10, 1994) and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Stainless Steel Wire Rods from France, (58 FR 68865, December 29, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner based foreign market value (FMV) on a home market price list for identical merchandise, exclusive of VAT, obtained from a Mexican manufacturer of pipe nipples. These prices are August 1994 ex-factory prices. We recalculated FMV to include VAT. FMV was converted to U.S. dollars based on the New York Federal Reserve's quarterly exchange rate for the period July 1 through September 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner also supplied information on constructed value. Because petitioner was able to provide information on home market sales, and because of the regulatory preference for a home market price-to-price comparison over constructed value, we based FMV for purposes of this initiation notice on the home market price-to-price comparison (19 CFR 353.12(b)(7) and 19 CFR 353.48).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The range of alleged dumping margins of pipe nipples from Mexico, based on a home market price-to-price comparison, is from 1.71 to 92.64 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

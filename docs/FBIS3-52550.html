He said they also discussed the  situation in many areas and bilateral relations. Musa was  speaking at a joint news conference held with the Italian  foreign minister following their talks today.    Musa noted first that President Husni Mubarak received the  Italian foreign minister this morning.    The Italian foreign minister said he had the honor of  meeting  President Mubarak and left with the impression that the  president is determined to achieve peace in the area. He noted  that the Egyptian-Italian talks covered developments in the  area, the peace process, and the situation in the Gulf region.    He paid tribute to the effort to achieve Middle East peace  and expressed Italy's hope that the efforts will achieve their  goals, especially in this vital region. He said he hopes a  Palestinian solution will be achieved despite the obstacles.    He said they discussed Somalia and noted that he will  discuss  this problem and achieving security and stability there when he  meets U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Brussels on  Monday.    He explained that Italy realizes the importance of solving  the Somali problem before the UN forces withdraw next March to  prevent anarchy.    Andreatta added that Italy, which currently chairs the  European Conference on Security and Cooperation, submitted a  plan to increase cooperation with the Arab states. It included  granting observer's status to Egypt, Morocco, and Algeria.    The Italian foreign minister said he asked Foreign Minister  Musa, in his talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who  is scheduled to visit Cairo on 16 January, to include the issue  of increasing European cooperation with Egypt, Algeria, and  Morocco.    He added that he and Musa also discussed bilateral  relations.  He said that despite the economic difficulties facing Italy, it  will continue to provide assistance for development projects in  Egypt.    On Bosnia, the Italian foreign minister said that despite  the  European Union's efforts, no agreement has been reached among  the three parties to solve the problem. This has prompted the  European countries to consider withdrawing their forces from  Bosnia in an attempt to pressure the three parties to accept a  peaceful solution to the problem.    The Italian foreign minister explained Italy's views on the  GATT Agreement. He emphasized that it will free international  trade and will not work at the expense of the developing  countries. It will open markets to the products of the  developing world, especially as tariffs will be reduced by 50  percent.    Commenting on this issue, Foreign Minister Musa said that  while international cooperation in international trade must be  established, the talks in the Uruguay round took place mainly  among the developed countries to serve their own interests and  against the interests of the developing countries in some  fields, particularly agricultural and food products.    He said the situation demands considering the interests of  the developing countries and assisting them in a specific period  to reform their economies and increase their production to  enable them to compete.    Musa concluded the news conference, saying that in such  circumstances, the agreement works in favor of the rich  countries. He called for cooperation between the developing and  developed countries to achieve the interests of both parties.</p>

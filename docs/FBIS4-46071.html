			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nobody Is Allowed To Slander DPRK's Replacement of Fuel </F> Rods " -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries a commentary denouncing the United States and the forces  following it for rendering the situation extremely strained,  threatening "sanctions" as regards the replacement of fuel rods  at the five megawatt experimental nuclear power station of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    The author of the commentary says: The refueling is an  inevitable consequence of the breakup of the DPRK-U.S. talks by  the United States and nobody can decry it in view of technical  safety.    Our starting of the replacement of fuel rods in the absence  of inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  is entirely an inevitable result of the unreasonable acts of the  United States and the IAEA Secretariat.    Declaring that the United States and the Secretariat of the  agency have no justification to decry our refueling, the analyst  further says:    The Secretariat of the agency, before slandering us, must  reflect on its acts in avoiding its obligation to guarantee the  normal nuclear activities of the member nation. It is an  unavoidable duty of the agency to come to the spot, verify  things and take necessary measures when an abnormal situation is  created in the nuclear activities of a member nation.    Though we requested the agency to immediately take  appropriate measures including a quick removal of the seal under  unavoidable circumstances, the Secretariat of the agency avoided  presence in the replacement of fuel rods for the reason that we  refused to meet their unilateral demand for being allowed to  choose and keep some of the replaced fuel rods. And it is now  raising quite a row, informing the member nations of the Board  of Governors of the agency and the United Nations Security  Council that we unsealed the facilities and violated the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. This is obviously a mean,  conscienceless act unbecoming to an international organization.    The U.S. act is none the better. If the United States had  responded to the talks with the DPRK and brought a package deal  to a success as demanded by the DPRK, such complicated problems  would have not been raised. But the United States avoided the  third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks, ignoring our proposals and  persisting in unreasonable preconditions. And now it is making  a case of our replacement of fuel rods. This reminds us of a  thief turning on the master with a club.    Some quarters of the United States are now spreading the  rumor that we are replacing fuel rods to extract plutonium  enough for the manufacture of four or five nuclear bombs. It is  ridiculous, indeed.    Though we have started the replacement of fuel rods without  the presence of the agency under unavoidable circumstances, this  work is now going on under the strict observation of the  inspection cameras installed by the agency and as soon as fuel  rods are taken out, they are kept under the containment and  surveillance devices of the agency. We are replacing fuel rods  in such a manner as to fully preserve the possibilities of  measuring all the replaced fuel rods when the nuclear issue is  resolved in a package deal and the partiality of the agency  removed. This matter can be solved through negotiations between  the DPRK and the IAEA.    Nevertheless, some forces of the United States are now  linking the refueling in a far-fetched way with "nuclear arms  development." This is a despicable trick to find a pretext for  "sanctions" against the DPRK by intentionally rendering the  situation strained.    An attempt to justify one's unreasonable logic with  speculation and supposition does not work now. The nuclear  issue, too, requires a fair solution based on a proper judgement  of the reality.    The United States and the Secretariat of the agency must no  longer make mistakes in the solution to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula but take a proper position for honestly solving  the issue.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to orders manually entered by users, MMX will include guarantees by MMX market makers. These market makers will be Exchange members who register with the Exchange to be MMX market makers. As such, they will be obligated to guarantee a maximum execution size to all users of the system. It is currently anticipated that the maximum size of the guarantee will be ten thousand shares per issue for a certain class of stocks, five thousand shares per issue for another class of stocks, and two thousand shares per issue for a third class of stocks. MMX market maker guarantees will automatically be entered at the beginning of the Pre-Cross Period and will include a default liquidity fee or credit to be associated with a specific MMX guarantee. (Liquidity fees and liquidity credits are discussed below.) MMX market makers can improve this liquidity fee or credit and increase the size of their guarantee during the Pre-Cross Period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Users other than MMX market makers will have the option of having their orders displayed to other users of MMX. If a non-market maker user elects to have its order displayed, the order will be displayed under certain circumstances. Users will be charged lower fees for using the MMX Facility if they agree to have their orders displayed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the CHX's CQS quotation will automatically be fed into the MMX Facility on a real-time basis. When the consolidated best bid and offer spread of an issue is 1/8, the MMX Facility will look at the CHX quote to determine whether there are orders which would be executed if a trade took place at the consolidated best bid or best offer ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  if the CHX quote equaled the consolidated quote). If so, this bid and/or offer will be entered as an order in MMX. If entered, these orders will have the highest priority of execution. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All matched orders will be executed at a random time within a pre-determined ten minute window period at the market price at such time. The market price will be calculated based upon the spread of a particular issue. In issues where the spread in the consolidated best bid and offer is 1/4 or other even fraction point spread, the cross will be priced at the middle of the spread. In issues with a consolidated best bid and offer spread of 3/8 or other odd fraction (other than 1/8), the price will be at the 1/8 closest to the last sale. In issues with a consolidated best bid and offer of 1/8, if there are more shares offered for sale in the MMX Facility (excluding the MMX market maker guarantee), then the 1/8 spread issues will cross at the bid. If, however, there are more bids than offers in the MMX facility, then the 1/8 spread issues will be crossed at the offer price. In the event that there are an equal number of shares on both sides of the CHX quotation, the cross will execute at the offer. Executions in MMX will be limited to those equity securities that are either listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges (``UTP'') on the CHX. Users may, however, enter orders for securities in which the Exchange does not have UTP; if a match is found in these securities, the cross will not be executed in MMX. Instead, these orders will be delivered to a broker-dealer who is eligible to execute the cross in the market in which it is traded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Food poisoning 'hits 5% of adults' Poor storage and handling of fresh produce has led to one in 20 adults suffering from food poisoning in the past year, the Food and Drink Federation said yesterday. The figure was slightly down on the previous year. It said just 61 per cent of those questioned in a survey by MORI, the research organisation, knew that food should be refrigerated to prevent it going off. The survey of 2,082 people found that 81 per cent always or usually looked at 'best before' or 'use by' dates, but 20 per cent said they did not tend to follow manufacturers' instructions for storage, preparation or cooking. The most frequent causes of food poisoning was food not cooked or heated properly, poor personal hygiene and the storing of produce at the wrong temperature.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROKE RULES TO AID SEN. D'AMATO, EX-HUD OFFICIAL SAYS  </P> <P> A former regional director of the Department of Housing and Urban Development  testified Friday that he endorsed a list of five rent subsidy projects  requested by Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) without proper documentation and  in violation of HUD rules.  </P> <P> The witness, Joseph Monticciolo, estimated that at least half of the HUD  decisions involving Section 8 moderate rehabilitation projects were made on a  political basis instead of on their merits.  </P> <P> Section 8 subsidies for 380 of the 655 units sought by D'Amato in March, 1987,  were approved by top HUD officials the next month, congressional sources said.  Of those units, 250 were in Puerto Rico and the remaining 130 were in two  communities in Upstate New York, congressional sources said.  </P> <P> "You were working hand in glove with Sen. D'Amato on the 'mod rehab' list,"  Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.) told Monticciolo, who was head of the HUD  region that included New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands  from 1981 to 1988.  </P> <P> "There's nothing more political than this," said Rep. Christopher Shays  (R-Conn.).  </P> <P> Monticciolo, who got his HUD post with D'Amato's support and later hired one of  the senator's former top aides to be his executive assistant at HUD, agreed  that he supported the subsidies requested on what a HUD memo termed "Sen.  D'Amato's list."  </P> <P> The memo, written by former HUD Assistant Secretary Thomas T. Demery, said that  there was "no record of a PHA (public housing authority) application on file"  for any of D'Amato's requests. Under HUD rules for rent subsidy grants,  requests were supposed to originate with local public housing authorities.  </P> <P> However, previous testimony at hearings of the House Government Operations  subcommittee on employment and housing has indicated that public housing  authorities often submitted applications after decisions were made on  earmarking of government funds for favored developers who had hired Republican  consultants.  </P> <P> There was no immediate comment from D'Amato's office on Monticciolo's testimony  or the HUD memo indicating for the first time that a GOP senator apparently had  benefited from top-level contacts within the housing agency.  </P> <P> Monticciolo, who seemed to contradict himself at times during four hours of  testimony, acknowledged also that, while at HUD, he made recommendations  favorable to developers who are now his partners in a private business that  pays him $125,000 a year.  </P> <P> He said that he arranged the formation of the business, Eagle Capital Group  Ltd., during his final weeks as HUD regional director by contacting a New York  developer, Sheldon Goldstein. As a result, Monticciolo said, he did not have to  put up any money in return for his salary and a 15% ownership interest in the  firm.  </P> <P> "There was a quid pro quo," Shays said. "I expect the attorney general's office  to look at this. You've cashed in."  </P> <P> However, Monticciolo said that his recommendations regarding HUD actions that  eventually benefited Goldstein and others were not decisive because HUD in  Washington had the final say.  </P> <P> But Shays argued that the New York developers made a "phenomenal profit" from  actions taken by Monticciolo involving their acquisition of HUD-owned  properties.  </P> <P> "I made recommendations to Washington that ultimately benefited individuals who  are now my partners," the witness acknowledged.  </P> <P> He said also that a Puerto Rican developer who benefited from HUD subsidies  administered by the New York regional office is now his partner in an apartment  project. While in his HUD post, Monticciolo said, he approved the relocation of  the San Juan HUD office to a building owned by the same developer.  </P> <P> Monticciolo said that Deborah Gore Dean, the former top assistant to ex-HUD  Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., once recommended a private consultant, Los  Angeles lawyer Thomas R. Broussard, for housing work in Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> Dean exercised considerable influence on the allocation of rent subsidies under  the Section 8 program, which was designed to provide incentives for the  rehabilitation of housing for low- and moderate-income renters.  </P> <P> The former HUD regional official said that he met once with Broussard  concerning 300 units available for rehabilitation in Puerto Rico and said that  Broussard went there "to make his services available."  </P> <P> Broussard, contacted by telephone, said only that he had worked for a client in  regard to a moderate rehabilitation project in Puerto Rico. He refused to  answer other questions about his activities for the client.  </P> <P> Broussard said that he had spoken to Dean when she was at HUD but did not know  her personally.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Tietmeyer in prices warning The recent decline in west German inflation will be slowed next year by rising charges for local government services and indirect taxation, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, warned last night. The central bank would guard against a more general increase in prices, he told economists in Zurich. However, he indicated that the central bank believed the monetary situation was stabilising. Money supply growth had been following a 'more normal' route for several months, he said, and had moved 'strongly' towards the upper end of its target range since the summer. The prospects for prices were brightening. The November cost of living index had shown a year-on-year increase of 3.7 per cent, and in the last three months consumer prices had risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of around 2.5 per cent, he said. He said that the central bank had started reducing interest rates last autumn when, although money supply was far above target, prospects for inflation were improving. Mr Tietmeyer claimed current policy, although based firmly on the growth of money supply, was flexible and never driven by parochial considerations. 'We do not try to hold money supply on course, come hell or high water, in the short term,' he said. His remarks, two days before the Bundesbank central council is due to meet and consider interest rates, seem likely to encourage expectations of a reduction in the internationally sensitive 5.75 per cent discount rate. Industry was cheered by reports of rising foreign demand in the mechanical engineering and electrical and electronics sectors. New orders for plant and machinery rose in October for the first time since March 1992, according to the VDMA industry association. While there was little sign of recovery in the domestic market, where November engineering orders were 3 per cent lower than a year earlier, the association said foreign demand surged a real 17 per cent. The ZVEI association, representing electrical and electronics companies with annual sales of DM200bn (Pounds 79bn), said a strengthening in electrical exports had consolidated in the third quarter.</p>

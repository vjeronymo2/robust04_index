			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Polish defence row simmers The Polish parliament's defence committee yesterday came out strongly in support of Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the defence minister who is at the centre of a dispute over control of the armed forces between the government and President Lech Walesa. The committee, meeting on the day after Mr Walesa asked Mr Kolodziejczyk to resign, called on the government to examine the circumstances of an alleged 'revolt' by the top military command against Mr Kolodziejczyk last week on manoeuvres in Drawsko. President Walesa, who wants to control the army directly through the general staff, explained in a letter to the committee yesterday that he had indeed asked Poland's top generals to express their view on the progress of army reforms. Yesterday, however, Mr Kolodziejczyk, a retired admiral and once a Walesa favourite, said the president had asked the generals to vote on his record. 'Eleven voted against and two for,' Mr Kolodziejczyk said, adding that he would not resign until the issue of bringing the army into politics in this way had been resolved.</p>

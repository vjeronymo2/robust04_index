			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Personal View: High cost of liquidity - Amar Bhide on the downside of US investor protection rules Policy makers around the world who seek the Nirvana of frictionless trading found on Wall Street have enthusiastically en-dorsed the US model of securities laws and other investor protection rules. The imitators may not, however, appreciate the costs. US rules to protect investors and the integrity of stock markets impair firm governance. They discourage shareholders from providing informed oversight and induce executives to neglect their fiduciary duties. The worldwide scramble to mandate accurate and complete disclosure, incarcerate insider traders and eliminate shady trading practices will likely benefit stockbrokers rather than stockholders. As the experience of Continental countries suggests, liquid equity markets do not easily sustain themselves. Wall Street financiers, who argue passionately for free enterprise, in fact owe a great debt to their regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission reassures the speculators who provide market liquidity by certifying the integrity of exchanges. Casinos with reputations for rigged games eventually drive away patrons. Penalties for insider trading similarly undergird a liquid market in which many buyers bid for stocks without much regard for the identity or motivations of the seller. The fear of trading against better-informed insiders would otherwise require protracted negotiations between known parties. The SEC's enforcement of accurate disclosure facilitates the trading of claims on companies that neither buyer nor seller has personally examined. Early this year, for example, the SEC filed a complaint accusing the Bank of Boston of failing to disclose fully the deterioration of its loan portfolio. Whatever the merits of the case, such actions reassure traders that they can buy a company's stock without an independent audit of its loans. Laws that protect mutual fund investors and pension plan beneficiaries by enjoining broad diversification of portfolios also contribute to market liquidity by fragmenting shareholding of stocks. The concentration of stockholding in a few hands impairs liquidity. Diffused, arm's-length stockholding also discourages investors from playing an effective role in the governance of companies. Pension and mutual fund rules that direct their trustees and investment managers to diversify holdings widely make relationships with a small number of managers unlikely. The seemingly irreproachable insider-trading rules place special restrictions on investors who hold large positions in a company's stock, serve on its board, or receive any confidential information about it. They must report their transactions, forfeit short-term gains, and try to avoid any appearance of trading on inside information. But why should investors become insiders and be subject to these restrictions just so that everyone else can enjoy the benefits of a level trading field? They don't. Institutional investors, with fiduciary responsibilities, usually refuse to receive any private information from managers. They may grumble about a company's performance, but they will not sit on its board for fear of compromising the liquidity of their holdings. Without such rules, the same institutions would likely demand access to confidential information before they even considered investing. The rules thus make large investors resolute outsiders. And outside shareholders cannot provide effective oversight. Evaluating chief executive officers - distinguishing between their luck and ability - requires considerable confidential and contextual information. But managers have a fiduciary duty to conceal strategic information from shareholders. The dialogue between managers and the public investment community therefore usually revolves around quarterly earnings estimates even though both sides are dubious about their long-run significance. Disclosure requirements, too, impose special burdens on insiders and thus encourage arm's-length stockholding. For example, rules requiring disclosure of transactions with insiders make a company's banks, suppliers or customers less willing to hold large blocks of stock or serve on boards. Disclosure rules, intended to treat all investors equally, make anonymous shareholding safe. If company reports were sketchy or unreliable, shareholders would likely require an inside role and ongoing access to confidential information. Market liquidity itself weakens incentives to play an inside role in firm governance. All companies with more than one shareholder face what economists call a free-rider problem. The oversight and counsel provided by any one shareholder benefits all others; therefore all of them may shirk their responsibilities. The issue is of particular concern if a company faces a crisis. The absence of a liquid market prevents shareholders from running away easily and forces them to pull together to solve the problem. With stock liquidity, however, it makes more sense for each investor to sell out instead. US investors who have been locked out of an inside role see many CEOs as entrenched, overpaid and self-serving while CEO's complain about their shareholders' short-sightedness. The alienation helps make public equity markets an unreliable source of equity. Accepted beliefs notwithstanding, the exceptional liquidity of US markets does not give publicly traded companies advantages in issuing equity. Investors regard stock issues with suspicion and companies issue equity as a last resort, or opportunistically, in overheated markets. Managers in fact go to considerable lengths to insulate themselves against fickle investors. They reinvest profits, sometimes in marginal projects. Or they acquire companies in unrelated businesses to generate counter-cyclical earnings. Managers also don't try very hard for anonymous shareholders. Several studies have shown dramatic improvements in a company's performance after it has been subject to a leveraged buy-out, with just a few private shareholders. Overall, the robustness and vitality of US business owes little to publicly traded companies. Closely-held entrepreneurial companies have for more than two decades provided the principal source of innovation and growth. In the US it may be too late to undo the damage. Elsewhere, regulators ought to re-think their opposition to multiple classes of stock, poor disclosure, limited float, insider trading and other impediments to stock market liquidity. Liquid markets play a valuable economic role - in physical commodities or well-secured, standardised contracts such as government bonds or currency futures. With the more amorphous equity claims, the traditional private relationships are usually best. The author is associate professor, Harvard Business School</p>

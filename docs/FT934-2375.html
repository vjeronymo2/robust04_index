			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook delays interim statement Tiphook, the container leasing and transport rental group, said its half-year results would be announced 'rather later' than usual because of talks about the possible sale of its container division to Transamerica, the US financial services and leasing group. The UK group normally reports its mid-term results in December. Tiphook's operating container fleet in November stood at 491,633 20 ft equivalent units, down 3,975 on October's level. November's average utilisation was 81.98 per cent, against 82.31 per cent. The European truck trailer fleet stood at 25,192, up 127 on October. Average utilisation was 83 per cent, against 78.3 per cent.</p>

Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri is to put the proposal to the  Cabinet at its meeting on Tuesday, the sources said.    The proposal is that 39.6 million baht be allocated for the  purpose from the fiscal 1994 budget and 39.6 million baht from  the fiscal 1995 budget. Both allocations should come from the  Highways Department budget. The bridge is to be built over the  Moei River to connect Mae Sot district, Tak province with  Myawaddy town in Kachin state. The proposal has been approved by  the Budget Bureau and the Finance Ministry, sources said.  However, the ministry said Thailand should have full rights  over the bridge and the collection of tolls.    The secretary-general of the National Security Council,  Charan Kunlawanit, wrote to the Cabinet approving the  Thai-financed construction of the bridge. Interior Minister  Chawalit Yongchaiyut backed the project in a report to the  Cabinet, saying the area around the proposed bridge is a  "temporary passage" between the two countries which should be  upgraded into a "permanent" one, sources said.    It should be made clear whether goods transported over the  bridge can reach Rangoon, because those that go over the  Tachilek passage point in Mae Sai district, Chiang Rai are only  allowed to be transported as far as Chiang Tung [Keng Tung] town  in Shan state, he said.    Defence Minister Gen. Wichit Sukmak wrote in his report to  the Cabinet that the the bridge will benefit both countries and  will not affect security, sources said.    The project was initiated by the Chatchai Chunhawan  government when his cabinet adopted a resolution in its favour  on August 1, 1989. The Foreign Ministry was to set up a  committee to study the issue and seek capital from the UK, Japan  and other countries. The estimated cost of the bridge in 1989  was 60.5 million baht.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: In the volcano's shadow - Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are now in Chile. We left Portillo just as the first real guests were arriving at the Chilean resort's colonial-style 1940s hotel, which sits like a beached cruise-ship on the shore of the Laguna del Inca. Suddenly, after a surreal week of waiting - during which we often dined as the only guests in the wood and leather-panelled restaurant - the principal characters seemed to step out of their sepia freeze-frames to materialise into full, animated colour. Jimmy Ackerson, who had guided us around Heavenly ski resort in California last January, was here wearing his bright red Portillo fleece for his eighth annual term of office as ski school director during the California summer. The menu, which we had come to know and love during our week of exotic exile (smoked salmon every day), suddenly changed - and would change again every night for the next three weeks before rotating all over again. The hotel stocks enough food for 400 guests for 21 days because the pass between Los Andos and Mendoza, across the Argentine border, can be blocked by snow for up to a week at a time. And two doctors were installed in the medical department, complete with glistening operating theatre, where surgery can be carried out in an emergency. Portillo's owner, Henry Purcell was on the mountain 'running the hotel from a radio in his hip-pocket as usual' as Ackerson put it. The new arrivals were mainly well-to-do Chileans with a sprinkling of guests from the US. Skiing is still an elitist sport in Chile. We celebrated our two-millionth vertical foot of skiing at Portillo. And thanks to our sponsors we are still on course to ski every day of 1994. Indeed, without our sponsors we would be very poor indeed - at the halfway stage of our expedition, we worked out that American Airlines have flown us 35,000 miles and eight Avis vehicles have carried us more than 18,000 miles. Including every form of transport - skis, ski lifts, Japanese bullet trains, cars and jets - we have travelled well over 70,000 miles, almost the equivalent of three times round the world, averaging more than 400 miles a day since January 1. Now we were about to commence our longest drive in a single day: 450 miles from Portillo to Termas de Chillan, to ski on a volcano. Chile has 55 active volcanoes, and some of them are ski areas. Llaima for example, where we shall be skiing next, has erupted 10 times this century - most recently in May this year. As we meandered back down the pass, we drove past miles of railway track - the legacy of the Transandean Railway, which early this century was effectively Chile's first ski lift. Rather like the one in Wengen, Switzerland which spawned the 'Down Hill Only' Club, it was used by Englishmen (mainly engineers working on the construction of the railway) who introduced recreational skiing to the area. But apart from the magic of the mountains, it was a nightmarish journey  - like driving along a completely unlit motorway with pedestrians, dogs and cyclists with no lights - mere shadows in the night - trying to cross your path at every opportunity, as huge trucks and coaches bear down on you at 80mph. Then, with 10 miles to go, the wheels of our estate car spun hopelessly on the ice-covered dirt track that serves as a road for the final 20 miles to the ski area. It was almost midnight. Walking the final 10 miles seemed ridiculous, as did trundling back along the 10 miles of rutted track and then driving a further 40 miles back to Chillan to try to find a hotel. We took one last run at it, but it was no use. It was our own fault: we had chains in the car but the thought of trying to put them on the middle of nowhere on a cold Andes night was just too daunting. We retreated to Chillan. It was 2.30am but we found an hotel open  -the Gran Isabel Riquelme. Exhausted, we slept, blissfully unaware of Chillan's tragic history: after being destroyed a number of times by foreign invaders, it was then flattened five times by earthquakes, the last - in 1939 - destroying 90 per cent of the city and claiming 15,000 lives. The next day, Termas de Chillan arranged for someone to travel with us to fix the chains, but thanks to a grim-faced piece of driving, his services were not required. Although skiing started in the area in the 1930s, Termas de Chillan has only recently begun to realise its potential, and only about one fifth of the possible ski area has been properly opened up. Imagine a snowscape with a few scattered fumeroles belching out sulphur, and you have an idea of the scale and the smell of the terrain. It is the only resort in South America with hot springs at the base lodge, and as many people come for the sulphur baths, hydro massage and mud therapy as for the skiing. The first proper ski lifts were installed 10 years ago. One of them, Don Otto, with a vertical drop of well over 2,000ft, is the longest in South America. One off-piste run, Shangri La, is almost nine miles long although you need a guide and transport back to the resort. But the widespread bowls, gullies and chutes on either side of the lift - all of them off-piste - give the resort its most exciting and challenging skiing. The head of the ski patrol, Hector Navarette Garrido, accompanied us on two superb runs: Condor, a steep, sweeping gulley, and Tres Marias, a gentler scenic run, almost three miles long. In his South America Ski Guide, Chris Lizza, a ski patrolman at Mammoth, mentions Pirigallo, a particularly challenging bowl. It was closed during our visit but Lizza reports that during this descent 'the faint scent of sulphur will begin to overwhelm already stressed lungs as skiers become engulfed in clouds of the noxious steam at the bottom of the bowl'. Lucy, who had nightmares as a child about volcanoes, is relieved that when we ski at Llaima, we shall be lodging a safe distance away at Robert Stanton's farm near a small community called General Lopez, near Temuco, Chile's fourth largest city. Stanton, more used to planning itineraries for summer clients of Passage to South America, a British tour operator, is helping us plan our skiing itinerary in Chile and Argentina. We have discovered that we are not allowed to drive a rented car across the border. Thus, we may have to get to Bariloche, Argentina's most famous resort, by bus. But this leaves at 6am - too early to ski before we set off  -and does not arrive until 6pm - too late to ski when we arrive . . . If only every detail of our expedition were as simple as Stanton's telephone number: the village is so small that it has just two digits - General Lopez 11.

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (8): Scope for plenty more - Foreign investment has held up well in a difficult EU climate As a home for foreign investment, France has remained relatively attractive in a European business climate that has depressed the 'animal spirits' of most investors. According to Mr Jean-Daniel Tordjman, the economy ministry's roving ambassador whose job is to woo inward investment, direct foreign investment flowing into France fell from FFr86bn in 1992 to FFr61bn last year. Using adjusted US Commerce Department figures, Mr Tordjman puts the actual stock of foreign investment in France at just over Dollars 130bn. Two years ago, France and Britain were the two countries which attracted the highest level of new direct investment and reinvested profits. This pecking order changed in 1993 as investment in China surged ahead and interest in the US recovered. But France is now at least matching Britain, in outward as well as inward investment. According to the economy ministry, French companies invested FFr65bn abroad last year. This is well down from the FFr100bn invested abroad in 1992 and only half the FFr126bn annual average in 1989-91. But the ministry estimates that this will still put France in second place behind the US and equal to Britain. The Balladur government's privatisation programme has provided new opportunities for portfolio investors in French equities. Mr Tordjman's main target has been the US pension funds. In theory, non-European investors can only collectively buy up to 20 per cent of the privatised stock; but as Mr Tordjman points out, this rule only applies to the primary issue, and non-Europeans can buy what they like in secondary trading. A bigger problem, Mr Tordjman says, is that 'many French companies are not used to working with pension funds, especially American ones which are extremely demanding for information.' France can offer a mix of human and physical advantages to the would-be investor. It remains a relatively low-cost economy - and not only because nuclear power gives it Europe's cheapest electricity and France Telecom is at last bringing down the cost of international phone calls. Its strong currency policy has pushed inflation to well below the European average, while the very fact of high unemployment - the big black spot on the French economy - has deterred strikes in the private (though not the public) sector. It is probably the combination of lower labour costs than northern continental European countries, and a workforce and physical infrastructure technically superior to most of its neighbours, which most attracts companies to France. Admittedly, one company, Ciba, the Swiss pharmaceutical group, did not have far to come when it recently decided to establish its FFr1bn bio-technology research centre at Huningue, near Mulhouse and just over the border from its Basle headquarters. In Basle, Ciba was faced with strong objections by Swiss environmentalists to bio-technology research being carried out there. It has sidestepped them by moving the project into France, where it believes it can employ equally good scientists cheaper. Further north is the example of US Robotics, the Illinois-based maker of data communications equipment. 'We entered France in 1991 by accident,' says Mr John McCartney, its executive vice president in Paris, 'when we bought a company in the US which happened to have four salesmen in Lille. But we have stayed and expanded our operation there to 36 people, because of the excellent logistics in the north, the new links with the TGV and proximity to major highways.' Last year US Robotics expanded its French operation by buying PNB, a suburban Paris assembler of modem, software and network systems. 'France is attractive to us because of its high-quality engineering work force, and because its relatively sophisticated telecommunications infrastructure makes it a market where we can test and develop products for it on the spot,' says Mr McCartney. Differing trans-Atlantic standards make it impractical to do this testing and development work back in the US, he says. 'Some companies are going to the ex-Soviet Union to find good engineers cheap, but the telephone system is so bad there that the products can't be tested.' In some of France's science parks, such as Sophia-Antipolis to the north west of Nice, telecommunications has become the leading speciality. Indeed, several companies and institutes based there - AT&amp;T, Aerospatiale, Ascom of Switzerland, British Telecom, Digital Equipment, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, France Telecom, IBM and Texas Instruments - have formed the 'Telecom Valley' association to promote telecommunications expertise in the Nice-Cannes region. Sophia-Antipolis, one of the oldest and most successful of French science parks, is reaching saturation point on its present 2,300 hectare site, says Mr Gerard Passera, its manager, and plans to start extending on to to another site of similar size in the late 1990s. At present it is home to about 1,000 companies - a tenth of them foreign-owned - providing some 16,000 jobs. There is constant turnover, says Mr Passera, but the balance is positive, with some 150 companies arriving or being created each year and about 100 companies leaving or being liquidated. 'The ones who survive tend to have established a solid high-tech research niche for themselves, with some limited production in, for instance, the pharmaceutical field,' he says, adding that attempts to provide services from Sophia-Antipolis have proved less successful. Sophia-Antipolis is even more closely integrated with its local university than other science parks or technopoles because it was set up at the same time as the relatively new university of Nice. As a result, many Nice university science students do their final year of study at Sophia-Antipolis, while the CERAM management centre also relies heavily on the technopole's facilities and expertise. Many of Sophia-Antipolis' training institutes now have a strong international flavour, and use English as their main working language. Foreign investment is perhaps more surprising in food and tourism, areas which, in contrast to computing and biotechnology, are areas of traditional French strength. But Mr Tordjman believes there is scope for further culinary and leisure investments. Ice cream, for example, a classic industrial food product, is still rather expensive in France - a fact which Mr Tordjman believes might incite other companies to follow Grand Metropolitan into the market; the UK group recently bought Haagen-Dazs and is building a new factory near Arras. Another classic industrial food product is frites, which McCain of Canada is now making in great quantities in France out of 200,000 tonnes of French potatoes a year. 'People have been obsessed by Euro Disney's problems,' says Mr Tordjman. 'But there are still, quite rightly, many plans for other attraction or theme parks in France, because we have 60m tourists and a total of FFr130bn in tourist revenue a year.' He sees the potential for more theme parks in France, as well as more three star hotels.  ------------------------------------------------------- Annual flows of direct foreign investment into France  -------------------------------------------------------         (FFrbns)  ------------------------------------------------------- 1982                 10.3 1983                 12.5 1984                 19.3 1985                 20.0 1986                 19.2 1987                 27.9 1988                 42.8 1989                 60.9 1990                 49.3 1991                 62.5 1992                 84.3 1993                 68.8  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

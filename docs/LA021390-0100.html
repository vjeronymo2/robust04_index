			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFEWAY TO GO PUBLIC AGAIN TO FUND GROWTH  </P> <P> Safeway Stores, which went private in 1986 to avoid a takeover by the  father-and-son raider team of Herbert and Robert Haft, said Monday that it  plans to sell stock to the public again to raise as much as $160 million to  build and remodel stores.  </P> <P> The big Oakland-based supermarket operator announced plans to offer 10 million  new shares, or nearly 10% of the company, at $13 to $16 a share on the New York  Stock Exchange. At the same time, the 1,100-store chain reported robust  improvements in 1989 operating earnings that analysts agreed should make the  company attractive to investors.  </P> <P> "It's a very cautious price," Brian E. Suher, an analyst with the Black &amp;  Co. investment house in Portland, Ore., said of the anticipated initial share  value. "I can't see how they won't be wildly successful with (the offering)."  </P> <P> According to documents filed by Safeway with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, neither Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which owns 70% of  Safeway shares, nor members of Safeway's management, who hold 10%, are selling  any common stock in the offering.  </P> <P> "Nobody's cashing out on this," said analyst Jonathan H. Ziegler with Sutro  &amp; Co. in San Francisco. Rather, he said, the company wants "to figure out  what they're worth" by having the market set a value.  </P> <P> Some observers said they were puzzled by the timing of the offering in a period  of great market volatility.  </P> <P> "I thought they could easily have done (the offering) at two times this price  if this had not been a hard market," Suher said.  </P> <P> A sale of stock would bring Safeway full circle from late 1986, when it  converted to private ownership in a $4.3-billion deal arranged by KKR, a  specialist in leveraged buyouts. Often in such deals, assets of the purchased  company are sold to reduce the heavy debt taken on to cover the transaction.  </P> <P> In Safeway's case, more than 1,000 stores were sold, reducing sales to $14.3  billion last year from $20.3 billion and slashing 60,000 employees from the  payroll. (Most of those workers were retained by the companies that bought the  stores.)  </P> <P> Proceeds of about $2.3 billion were used to pay off part of the company's $5.8  billion in debt, which now stands at $3 billion.  </P> <P> With its debt under control, Safeway said Monday that it wants to concentrate  on improving and building stores. It announced an ambitious $3.2-billion  capital spending plan for the years 1990 to 1994, double the amount spent in  the previous five years.  </P> <P> In its prospectus, it said it plans to open about 70 new stores and remodel  about 240 stores over the next two years.  </P> <P> Analysts, who have been expecting a Safeway public offering for two years, have  praised the company's efforts to pare its debt and improve operations by adding  high-profit salad bars, seafood shops and bakeries.  </P> <P> For the year ended Dec. 30, the company said its operating profits grew 42% to  $463 million. However, net income shrank to $2.5 million from $31.2 million in  1988, dragged down by a one-time $46-million tax charge. Moreover, the 1988  figure was aided by an after-tax gain of $48 million associated with the sale  of assets.  </P></p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Complaints against accountants rise 8% The number of complaints received by the largest UK chartered accountancy body has jumped by more than half in the past three years, its latest annual report shows. The professional conduct department of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales received 3,420 complaints last year, up 8 per cent from 1992. It said the current caseload of complaints under investigation was about 2,000, and added that uncertainty about future growth created 'a considerable challenge' in the management of the department. The largest single proportion of complaints related to allegedly poor work by chartered accountants on behalf of their clients. A similar proportion related to complaints about 'dilatory behaviour' by members of the institute in the conduct of their work. A further 13 per cent of complaints related to insolvency matters. Investment business, change of appointment and fee disputes each made up 9 per cent of complaints. There were 160 fines imposed on accountants last year after investigations, and 219 disciplinary orders made against practitioners, including 169 reprimands. Four accountants were censured, 24 given a severe reprimand and 21 excluded from membership of the institute. One received an admonishment, the mildest possible rebuke. The annual report, which is due to be debated by the institute's council on Wednesday, says about 85 per cent of complaints can be resolved by staff without reference to a professional conduct committee. In a separate report Mr Anthony Surtees, who was appointed as an ombudsman or independent reviewer of complaints in April 1992, says he investigated 33 cases last year. In 30 cases he found in favour of the institute and three cases were returned to the investigation committee for re-examination. Big Six results, Page 21</p>

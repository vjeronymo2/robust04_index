			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAF AND CAPRIATI WIN TO SET UP OPEN SHOWDOWN IN FOURTH ROUND  </P> <P> The first big women's singles showdown in the U.S. Open took shape Saturday  when Steffi Graf and Jennifer Capriati won their matches to set up a  fourth-round encounter.  </P> <P> Graf actually dropped a set to No. 121-ranked Elna Reinach but won, 6-4, 3-6,  6-1.  </P> <P> "Strange thing is, I felt better after losing the (second) set than winning the  first," Graf said. "Just getting into the (third) set, I felt better, I don't  know why."  </P> <P> Graf said she got into trouble because she felt out of rhythm, but Capriati  marched smartly into her meeting with the top-ranked Graf.  </P> <P> Capriati, seeded 13th, defeated Maria Strandlund, 6-1, 6-4, to set up a rematch  of her fourth-round match against Graf at Wimbledon, their only other meeting  in a tournament.  </P> <P> "I think that I'm going to have to attack more and come to the net and be ready  for the drop shot," Capriati said. "Also, I'll have to return serve better and  just hang in there with her."  </P> <P> Zina Garrison, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Katerina Maleeva and Jana Novotna won  their matches.  </P> <P> Garrison defeated Silke Meier, 6-4, 6-3; Maleeva defeated Rafaella Reggi, 6-4,  6-0 and will take on Novotna, a 6-3, 6-1 winner over Laura Gildemeister.

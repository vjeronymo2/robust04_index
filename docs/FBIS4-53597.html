			<p>BFN     [Text] A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman released the  following statement [tamhwa] on 19 May concerning the exposure  of an extra-large case -- the concealment of 70 kg of plutonium  at the nuclear fuel-making factory in Japan.    The statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman:    Recently, the true color of Japan as a nuclear criminal was  dragged into the light of day, causing quite a stir  internationally. As was already reported, an extra-large case  of the concealment of 70 kg of plutonium at the nuclear  fuel-making factory in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, was  disclosed.    Japan had so far boasted of its uprightness, claiming that  it  had opened to the public the amount of plutonium it had  stockpiled and had accepted strict inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. It was disclosed  recently, however, that the Japanese authorities had not  declared the amount of plutonium needed for the manufacture of  more than nine nuclear warheads in the total inventory of  plutonium, keeping it secret. This clearly showed their kind of  shamelessness. The concealment of plutonium is a violation of  universally recognized international law, which should be taken  seriously and denounced.    The case also clearly indicates that the so-called three  non-nuclear principles advertised so often by Japan are nothing  but a screen for concealing a large quantity of plutonium and  pushing ahead with nuclear armament in real earnest. Japan's  noisy row over our nonexistent nuclear issue, taking the van in  the intrigues to stifle the Republic, is nothing but a petty  guile to veil its nuclear armament and divert the public  attention elsewhere.    The Japanese authorities, caught red-handed, are these days  making excuses by talking about the so-called probe into the  truth and removal of suspicion, but no one will believe that.    Judging from the fact that many nuclear facilities of Japan  have been in operation for several tens of years, it is too  self-evident that the recently discovered plutonium is nothing  but an extremely tiny part of the amount concealed in Japan.    International circles are now demanding that the IAEA  Secretariat treat Japan's production and concealment of  plutonium as a grave case and take relevant measures. It says  if the IAEA Secretariat never takes issue with the dangerous  nuclear activities of Japan and continues to make the matters  complicated only over our fledgling peaceful nuclear activities,  throwing suspicion on nonexistent nuclear development, it cannot  be construed otherwise than an application of a double standard.    The IAEA Secretariat must pay due attention to this issue in  compliance with the principle of impartiality.    The United States, which has used our nuclear issue for a  sinister political purpose, calling for a cooperation system to  stifle our Republic, joining hands with Japan, the real nuclear  criminal, cannot evade the responsibility for this case, either.    We do not feel any need to make further argument about the  poor lot of the South Korean authorities [tangguk], who have  recklessly made a fuss about our nuclear issue, currying favor  with the United States and Japan, the two big powers. While  the South Korean people in authority [tanggukjadul] ran about  like mad, following Japan, the latter did what it wanted. What  a ridiculous sight they are.    The Japanese authorities must declare to the international  society the exact total amount of plutonium now concealed  nationwide, and immediately stop nuclear armament.    We consider that under the circumstances it has been  confirmed as a fact that Japan's nuclear armament is being  promoted to the danger line and the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula has become practically meaningless.    We appeal to [hosohanda] the governments of all countries,  international organizations, and antinuclear organizations to  make unbiased efforts to remove the danger of nuclear  development from our planet and, in particular, to launch a  joint action to check the nuclear armament recklessly  accelerated by Japan with the ambition of becoming a military  and a nuclear power.</p>

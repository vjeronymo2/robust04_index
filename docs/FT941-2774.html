			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (14): Smorgasbord of methods - Privatisation After a seemingly endless gestation, Poland's new National Investment Funds, or NIFs, should see the light of day within weeks. 'The first funds will be ready by the middle of the year and distribution of shares in the funds will take place around the end of the year,' promises Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the privatisation minister, who is from the SLD side of the coalition government. But a big logistical effort will be required to cope with the resulting explosion in share ownership. 'When the NIFs are up and running, 9m Poles will have shares and maybe 1.5m will retain them. This means we will have to develop our capital markets and the supporting institutions. At present there are only 400,000 investors who have accounts with brokers and a further 350,000 waiting to open one. We will have big organisational problems unless we find innovative solutions like selling shares through the post office or insurance companies,' the minister says. The ministry is looking for assistance from abroad, especially from the EBRD which has indicated it would consider lending up to Dollars 400m to help restructure companies involved in the scheme. More than 30 potential fund management groups, many of them joint venture partnerships between foreign merchant banks and financial institutions and their Polish equivalents, are competing for the privilege of managing a portfolio of 20-30 former state controlled enterprises each. 'The phrase mass privatisation is artificial. In fact it is a large restructuring programme covering about 10 per cent of Polish state companies', says Mr Kaczmarek of a scheme under which up to 600 of the formerly 8,000 state enterprises will be managed by NIFs on behalf of their ultimate owners, the 9m Poles who will be offered shares in the funds. Mass privatisation is only one part of a smorgasbord of privatisation methods used in Poland. Most of the biggest deals have essentially been trade sales to foreign investors, but many economists and businessmen believe that the most effective privatisation has involved various forms of asset-stripping of state enterprises, of more or less transparent legality. In this way many over-sized state companies have been effectively downgraded. In many cases the funds received, or part of them, have been used to help finance the restructuring of the enterprises' rump activities while the assets sold, including truck fleets, surplus warehousing or office capacity and selected workshops and equipment, have often been much more efficiently and profitably used by their new private owners. To a substantial but largely unquantifiable degree the availability of cheap assets from state enterprises helped to compensate for the initial shortage of capital in the private sector and sidestep the difficulty and high cost of borrowing money from the banks. But the often underhand and opaque process has inevitably brought charges of corruption and theft and engendered a degree of popular discontent with privatisation which surfaced at the last elections. Mr Kaczmarek, a strong supporter of privatisation like other senior SLD members whose experience of running a bankrupt command economy converted them to the virtues of private enterprise, says that one of his priorities is to try and change the image of privatisation and depoliticise the subject by making the processes of privatisation more transparent. His task has been made easier by the surge on the stock market which has given millions of Poles their first tangible evidence that a capitalist economy allows even the small man to benefit. Above all, a functioning stock market offers the government a new, and transparent way of privatising state assets and acquiring funds for the state treasury without raising taxes. 'We did not realise how much capital was available in Poland until the booming stock market flushed it out,' says Mr Kaczmarek. 'But I fear that many politicians remain suspicious of and hostile to capitalism and are capable of destroying this positive development,' he adds. Many of them are backwoodsmen in his own party. But perhaps the most outspoken critic of privatisation and the new capitalist system is Bogdan Pek, the Peasant Party privatisation spokesman who is head of the parliamentary privatisation committee. Tension between the two men is a reflection of the seismic fault lines which underlie the coalition of former communist Social Democrats and suspicious farmers imbued with anti-capitalist notions derived from their religious faith. The first test of privatisation through the stock market will come shortly with the initial public offer of shares in the Polifarb paint company which will simultaneously raise capital for the new company and funds for the treasury. But Mr Kaczmarek is also thinking of selling some of the 20-30 per cent shareholdings which the state retains in many privatised companies as a strategic move to help calm what many see as an overheated exchange by increasing the supply of shares. But the way in which the surging stock market has helped to increase the attractiveness of privatisation to workers and managers, who get 10 per cent of the shares in their privatised enterprise free, and preferential terms for additional shares, is sometimes proving a double-edged weapon. 'Workers and managers are sometimes tempted to try and lower the value of the enterprise before privatisation as this makes the shares cheaper,' the minister worries. The problem here is that the privatisation ministry is not in complete control of the privatisation process by any means. 'The ministry can prepare projects but it is the ministry of industry which has control of 1,100 enterprises which are sellable and many other assets are owned by provincial and municipal bodies who often apply different standards and procedures, confusing foreign investors, especially as some of the local authority heads remain opposed to privatisation on principle,' he adds. It is partly to reduce that confusion that the State Agency for Foreign Investment (PAIZ) has been reinforced in recent months with the aim of providing potential foreign investors with a one-stop institution specifically designed to guide them round the bureaucratic maze.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  will hold working-group meetings in Tokyo June 1-2 to discuss  two key areas for negotiations in bilateral trade "framework"  talks, a government source said Thursday [26 May].    The source said the early June meetings will deal with the  issues of insurance, and autos and auto parts, two of the three  sectors specified as "priorities" in the framework talks.    For the auto sector, vice ministerial-level talks are also  slated for the second week of June in Tokyo.    The series of meetings are the first since the two countries  agreed earlier this week to resume the framework negotiations,  agreed last July to bring down Japan's large trade surplus with  the U.S.    The trade process had been stalled since February this year  due to differences over a U.S. demand to set numerical targets  to gauge the openness of the Japanese market. Japan has  staunchly refused the demand.    A working-group meeting for the remaining area -- government  procurement -- has not yet been set, but will likely be held  within the month of June.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Arts: Troubled 'Don Carlo' at La Scala - Opera in Italy Though the performance of Verdi's Don Carlo (the Italian, 4-act version) that opened the season of La Scala was not televised, Luciano Pavarotti's cracked note in the second scene hit all the news broadcasts and kindled an inflagration of gossip, angry declarations, and, from the tenor himself, an apology and an admission that he had insufficiently prepared for this new role. He also promised that there would be no botched notes on the second night. He kept his promise; but he still did not seem in command of the character. He was simply a tenor going through his paces competently, with little feeling or psychological understanding. 'Pavarotti protagonista', the headlines yelled in the preliminary articles puffing the production; but though Carlo has the title role, he is not the protagonist. This is a grand opera whose drama is chiefly private; the excitement lies not in spectacular events so much as in the personal tensions, the alternation of suspicion and trust, condemnation and forgiveness, ardour and renunciation. Few of these inner conflicts were revealed in the Scala execution, but the fault was not entirely Pavarotti's. As the dreaded 'loggionisti,' the bellowing galleryites emphasised in their raucous opening-night protests, the casting was peculiar: if Pavarotti is no Carlos, then the otherwise charming Daniela Dess is a perilously light Elisabetta, and Luciana D'Intino is more a Rossinian mezzo than a Verdian (her 'veil song,' however, had a welcome lightness and a gaiety absent in Riccardo Muti's hectic conducting of the scene). A few years ago, in a Bologna Don Carlo, the young baritone Paolo Coni was a revelation as Rodrigo; critics immediately underlined his name in their programmes. Since then, Coni has appeared on both sides of the Atlantic, but sadly, in this short period, the warm, lyric voice has deteriorated: the top notes have become rough and unsteady, pitch is often uncertain, and Coni tends now to bluster. Only Samuel Ramey - La Scala's Filippo - sang with confidence, accuracy and a sense of his part. It is hard to find the youthful, athletic American bass credible as an aged monarch; Ramey was an unusually physical Filippo, and when he grasped Elisabetta in their great confrontation, there was a strong sense of sexual frustration in his rage. This was not an interpretation in the Pasero, Rossi Lemeni, Christoff tradition, but it was a three-dimensional creation. And Ramey's was the only really compelling performance. Blame for the inadequacy of so many of the singers was laid squarely at Muti's door, but the conductor had an even graver responsibility. Unlike his usual triumphs, at La Scala and elsewhere, Muti's Don Carlo lacked an over-all architecture. Needless to say, there were brilliant scenes (the auto-da-fe' especially) and there were moments of heart-rending emotion (the death of Rodrigo); but much of the time the performance was a patchwork: the fountain scene opened dully, the final tenor-soprano duet was drawn out until it sagged and became shapeless. Franco Zeffirelli's production, while cluttered and bustling, was also lacklustre. Even the crowd scenes were perfunctory: extras only half-pretended to be an unruly mob of onlookers were intermittently held back by guards in a cordon with gaps wide enough for an army to pass through; a pair of breech-clouted heretics struck choreographed poses, a cramped procession preceded the king's oddly tame coronation appearance (no solemn throwing open of doors, since the producer eliminated the doors, as he eliminated later the tomb of Charles V). The solo singers were also left to their own devices (comically, the Grand Inquisitor, despite his elaborate show of blindness, managed to descend some steps, unaided, and address much of his music straight at the audience from the footlights). Pavarotti's immobility obviously creates its own set of problems; keeping the other singers usually at a distance from him only underlines the lack of dramatic cohesion in the whole, undistinguished execution.</p>

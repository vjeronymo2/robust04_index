"Policies which do not respect the real state and national  interests of Montenegro and Serbia, or the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.), cannot secure peace and stability in the  Balkans," said Bulatovic in an interview to the NOVI SAD DNEVNIK  weekly published in the Serbian province of Vojvodina.    Hoping in a soon end of the "isolation, sanctions, and  international oppression being applied to the F.R.Y.," Bulatovic  said that "those wanting to exhaust ourselves totally can no  longer justify to their general public the senselessness of  everything that has been undertaken against the F.R.Y."    In May, 1992, the U.N. imposed comprehensive rigorous  sanctions on the F.R.Y. for its alleged involvement in the civil  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where, however, there have never been  any Yugoslav soldiers.    "Today it is clear to everybody that the Bosnian question is  being used in an attempt to solve the fate of NATO, relations  between America and Russia, global unity within the European  Union (E.U.), and open pretensions of Japan and Germany to  become permanent members of the U.N. Security Council," said  Bulatovic.    He pointed out that the road now followed by the Yugoslav  republics Serbia and Montenegro was neither easy nor entirely  certain, but this was the only possible road "in keeping with  the historical, state and national interests."    He reiterated a joint stand by Montenegro and Serbia that  the  Serb people outside the F.R.Y. were entitled to exercisinig  their freedom and equitable position that presumed also the  right to self- determination which had already been used by  other nations in the former Yugoslavia.    Denying the right to self-determination to the Serb people  in  the forcibly seceded ex-Yugoslav republics was one of the  principal causes of the current war in the areas of former  Yugoslavia.</p>

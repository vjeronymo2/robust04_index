			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bureaucracy stalls road building Sir, Long public inquiries are not the main reason for the length of time it takes to build a road. The average public inquiry lasts just 16 days. The lengthy public inquiries, such as those at Twyford Down or the M11, are the exception. The main reason it takes 13 years to plan and build a road lies somewhere within the cumbersome bureaucracy of the Department of Transport. Transport secretary John MacGregor's high-profile campaign ('Faster inquiries aim to cut years off road building', February 23) to shorten public inquiries will do little to alter that.

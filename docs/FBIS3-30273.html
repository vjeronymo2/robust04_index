			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 1 (AFP) --  Humanitarian groups in Zenica have introduced drastic security  measures to protect aid workers following the murder of a  British aid worker believed to have been killed by Islamic  fundamentalist mercenaries.    Aid workers have also reported thefts and problems with  local  people driven to desperation through hunger and hardship. One  aid worker said the situation in the central Bosnia Moslem  enclave was getting like Somalia where food aid has been  routinely looted by armed gangs.    In response to a request from the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) a contingent of UN British  troops moved into Zenica from their nearby base of Vitez on  Friday to reassure members of non-governmental organisations  (NGO).    On Thursday [27 January] night, Paul Goodall, Simon King and  David Court, all three employed by the British  government-sponsored Overseas Development Agency were kidnapped  at gunpoint while driving in Zenica.    They were taken to a spot outside the town where Paul  Goodall, a father of four, was shot dead and the other two were  wounded as they jumped into an icy river to escape.    Three men believed to have been among the killers were shot  dead Monday by Bosnian military police when they tried to break  through a road block near Sarajevo.    They were described as being of Arab appearance with false  Pakistani passports. Another three suspected Islamic  "muhajedeen" mercenaries are being questioned by police in  Zenica.    "It's a terrorist act. It's obvious that murder was the  intention and it's frightening," said Larry Hollingworth, the  leader of the UNHCR delegation in Zenica.    "For the first 24 hours, moral was very low among the NGOs.  So we asked for a military presence to be here," he said.    Hollingworth said aid workers have been warned to take more  precautions and to stay together. "We gave new instructions but  they are free to do what they want. I don't want people to go  alone into isolated villages. I want them to go out in groups,  to stay in at night unless they have an escort."    "I don't know who wants to stop us but that is the line some  groups are taking," Hollingworth said, adding: "There are  various elements here who are not under (Bosnian) government  control."    Sources in Zenica said between 200 and 300 Moslem  "mujahedeen" or holy warriors were based in Zenica and the  surrounding countryside. They have taken an active part in  fighting Croat forces and their influence over the local  population is growing.    "We had to move out of a house where he had planned to stay  because of threats from one of the mujahedeen who came and told  us to get out because we were too close to one of their bases,"  said Francisco Guevarra a French nurse with the Medecins du  Monde medical charity in Zenica.    "The local people are scared of them and we avoid them as  much as possible," he added.    But the presence of the Islamic mercenaries is not the only  reason why aid workers are becoming more security-conscious.    As supplies of food and other items run out, thefts have  increased, with international organisations becoming prime  targets.    "In three weeks, we have been attacked nine times with  garage  break-ins, burglaries of homes, diesel fuel stolen from vehicle  tanks," said Laure Bonnevie an administrator with the  Pharmaciens sans Frontieres organisation which deals in medical  supplies.    "People are hungry and will get more aggressive as time goes  on," she said.    "We are already taking maximum precautions. The only thing  we haven't done is hire bodyguards, and that we will not do,"  said Jean-Francois Delimoges of Medecins du Monde (doctors of  the world).    Gilles Groizeleau of the French charity Equilibre was  pessimistic. "We now have to employ policemen and private  security guards to protect our warehouses and residence. We are  slowly sliding towards a Somalia-type situation."    In the neighbouring town of Kakanj an angry crowd blocked  convoys several times last week and six Bosnian policemen were  shot and wounded in the turmoil.    "We'll achieve less than 20 percent of the needs in January.  All this helps to promote civil unrest. A lot of civil unrest  is because people are hungry," said Hollingworth.    "If we can get a lot of food here, we can remove one of the  major causes (of unrest). But the number of people who need to  be fed increases every single day and means to achieving it get  worse every day."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, February 17 (XINHUA) -- France today  expressed "deep concern" over Greece's retaliatory measures  against the Republic of Macedonia.    Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou announced the steps  on Wednesday [16 February], saying that Macedonia "insists on  its claims to Greek land."    The measures include closing the northern Greek port of  Salonica to Macedonia, and closing the Greek Consulate in the  Macedonian capital of Skopje.    French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said  Thursday  that the Greek decision "departs from the dialogue between  Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which  France has sincerely encouraged."    He stressed that in the present context "the easing of  tensions should be a common concern."    Macedonia, a former Yugoslav Republic contiguous to Greece,  declared independence in 1991 and was admitted to the United  Nations General Assembly last April.    Greece has been trying to block international recognition of  Macedonia, arguing that it has designs on a northern Greek  province that is also called Macedonia. But Macedonia's  government says it has no claims on northern Greece.    France established diplomatic relations with the former  Yugoslav Republic last December.    It has been reported that Greece did not inform its partners  in the European Union before Wednesday's announcement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of address by Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio </F> Aranibar Quiroga to the 24th OAS General Assembly in Belem do  Para, Brasil -- released by the Bolivian Foreign Ministry  Diplomatic Information General Directorate in La Paz on 8 June]    [Text] "Bolivia is immensely grateful to the Inter-American  community for its support over our just claim to a sea outlet as  expressed in 11 resolutions issued by the OAS General Assembly.  This support constitutes an OAS political and diplomatic legacy  toward our most important international dispute, which is yet  unresolved and which undermines our morale and our economic  development. The sea is an essential part of Bolivia's material  and spiritual integrity. We need a solution to this problem,  and we are obliged to find it.    "The community of the Americas has unequivocally recognized  the need for the two involved countries to achieve a peaceful  and friendly solution to the landlocked situation Bolivia has  endured since it lost its sea coast during the Pacific War.  This negotiation at the OAS level does not conflict with  bilateral or trilateral discussions on this issue, nor with  inevitable direct negotiations on the maritime issue. On the  contrary, they are in line with the friendly spirit that must  reign in hemispheric relations. It is only normal for nations  of the Americas to be concerned and to urge those countries  involved in unresolved conflicts to find friendly solutions.    "Was it not the support of the countries of the Americas  which paved the way for achieving the Torrijos-Carter agreements  through which Panama regained its sovereignty over the Panama  Canal? Was it not the support of the international community  which led to peace between Palestine and Israel? Was it not the  support of the international community which helped to  definitely eradicate apartheid in South Africa?    "I believe we are all obliged to build a peaceful, friendly,  and secure region for our children.    "Although the future seems bright, both Chile and Bolivia  are  determined to establish conditions and measures of mutual trust  and tolerance, and despite renewed appeals by the OAS General  Assembly, it is obvious that the governments directly involved  have been unable to achieve a suitable satisfactory solution.    "The international scenario has witnessed changes and  advancements at the end of this century which seemed utopian a  few years back. Ideological and racial barriers, and conflicts  between nations are giving way to agreements that honor justice,  solidarity, and international peace.    "In view of this why should countries tied by a common  heritage be unable to achieve agreements that will restore  Bolivia's original status as a Pacific rim country, and  definitely heal old wounds?    "There is no legal argument in the world that can override  the deep feeling of a nation that tells our governments to end  their defensive and negative positions, and formal speeches for  the sake of creative measures that will allow the establishment  of ethical international relations.    "We believe in integration and in the complementation of  countries with common interests that are able to ban chauvinism  and misunderstandings for the sake of uniting their efforts and  overcoming the challenges of a future filled with uncertainties,  in which the one single enemy is the poverty of our countries.    "Latin America is living in an era of democracy and cohesive  cooperation that demands a consensus. A new mentality of trust  and credibility is taking hold in the region. A mentality in  which neighbors do not look upon each other as potential  antagonists. One in which the creative force of our countries  is surging. One in which there is a clear awareness that the  countries of the region are one family and that they must unite  under the new breezes sweeping through contemporary history.    "We must support each other, without impositions or  exclusions. We must engage in common undertakings, encourage our  reciprocal knowledge, promote the rapprochement of our  societies, strengthen our cultural ties, and tear down the  fences of misunderstanding, prejudice, dogmas, and  insensitivity. This is definitely the state of mind with which  we must welcome the next century.    "Not so long ago, as a result of the new mentality upheld by  their respective administrations, and by overcoming Chaco War  grievances, Paraguay and Bolivia were able to achieve a  long-sought historic rapprochement. Current ties and friendly  relations bind today the two countries which optimistically seek  excellent rewards from trade, road interconnections, the  Paraguay-Parana waterway, the Pilcomayo river, and other  similarly important projects. Bolivian-Paraguayan ties  constitute a model for Latin America and an example that should  be followed.    "For the good of the Latin American community, the same is  occurring among other countries in the region where neighboring  countries which, until recently were faced with what seemed  insurmountable rivalries, have resolved long-standing border  problems in an exemplary manner, achieving an excellent level of  ties.    "Recent developments allow us to view with prudent optimism  Bolivian-Chilean ties. Meetings between high-ranking government  officials have been cordial. During President Gonzalo Sanchez  de Lozada's trip to Santiago, Chile, on the occasion of the Rio  Group presidential summit, several meetings were held between  the Bolivian and Chilean presidents. The preponderant role the  Catholic Churches of Chile and of Bolivia have played in this  process is also worthy of mentioning. It is clear, however,  that despite all auspicious circumstances that have been  discussed, Bolivia continues to suffer the consequences of its  landlocked situation. This is undoubtedly one of the most clear  obstacles in the path of full integration in the Americas.    "I am certain that all the countries represented here hope  to  see noble gestures from the countries involved and, by the next  OAS General Assembly, bear witness to a solution to this issue.    "The challenge facing the new administrations of Bolivia and  Chile today is to build together a future of peace and  cooperation. There is no better inspiration to achieve this goal  than the conviction expressed by the great Chilean Poet Vicente  Huidobro who said: `As a Chilean and as a human being, I believe  and assert that we must negotiate with Bolivia as soon as  possible and that the two countries should and must resolve the  serious issue involving Bolivia's outlet to the sea fraternally  and with generosity.'"</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Jan 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are expected to hold a  fourth round of negotiations on IAEA inspection of North Korean  nuclear facilities on Wednesday, informed sources said Tuesday.    Following a third round of working-level contacts Monday,  IAEA Operations Director Demetrius Pericos and Yun Ho-jin, a  councilor at the North Korean Embassy, met unofficially Tuesday  and agreed to hold a fourth round on Wednesday, the sources said.    The successive meetings could mean that the negotiations are  making rapid progress, IAEA sources said, hinting that there  could be early inspections.    As a result, they said, the two sides could reach an  agreement this week and the IAEA could start inspecting North  Korean facilities by 24 January at the earliest.    Or the two sides could work out some sort of agreement early  next week so that an IAEA inspection team could enter North  Korea by 31 January, the sources said.    This optimistic view comes after an official IAEA evaluation  that there was ``no green signal'' in the third round, but the  sources described the atmosphere of the talks as good and said  that the two sides managed to narrow their differences.    One IAEA source, who like the others declined to be  identified, said that both the IAEA and North Korea shared the  opinion that an IAEA inspection, in whatever the form, has to be  carried out before the IAEA holds its regular board of governors  meeting on 21 February.    In other words, an IAEA inspection team has to go into North  Korea in late January or early February in order for the IAEA to  submit a report to the Board of Governors for it will take at  least two weeks to inspect facilities and another week to  prepare the report, the source said.    The IAEA Secretariat, which is giving ``political  significance'' to the February board meeting because it is the  start of a new fiscal year for the IAEA, wants to get tangible  evidence to show in the negotiations with North Korea, which  have been dragging along for more than a year now, the source  said.    The Secretariat also likes to reach a kind of interim point  with North Korea on inspection ``in consideration'' of the  United States, which has publicly announced its agreement with  North Korea.    As for North Korea, the IAEA could expect some sort of  ``concession'' from Pyongyang because North Korea, too, has to  demonstrate a positive attitude toward IAEA inspection in order  to keep its negotiations with the United States going, the  source said.    Details of the perceived progress being made at IAEA-North  Korean negotiations are not known.    But what is known so far appears to be that the two sides  have agreed in principle on the need for inspections on seven  reported facilities, including the radiochemical laboratory and  the 5-megawatt reactor, the source said.    As for differences of opinion on thorny issues such as the  IAEA request for the collection of materials from the  facilities, the two sides could discuss them so that another  inspection team could be dispatched to North Korea later, the  source said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said that the Hashemite  Jordanian position on the Palestine question in general, and the  issue of Jerusalem in particular, has been an honorable one  based on enlightened principles of right and justice free of  delusion and ambiguity and incapable of change or alteration.  He added: Jerusalem is Arab and Islamic; its covenant is  'Umarite [a pledge Caliph 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab gave to  Christians when he entered Jerusalem]; and its safeguard is  Hashemite and is based on the determination of Husayn Bin-'Ali,  who is buried there, and the vision of 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn,  its martyr. It is along their path that we are marching.    In a letter to Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali,  ordering the re-formation of the Royal Committee for Jerusalem  Affairs under the chairmanship of His Highness Crown Prince  Hasan, his majesty the king added: On the blessed occasion of  al-Isra' and al-Mi'raj [Prophet Muhammad's midnight journey from  Mecca to Jerusalem and his ascension to heaven], we redouble our  faith in the value of holy shrines and Jerusalem--this immortal  city which has recently been witnessing a difficult and  complicated situation and is facing an ambiguous destiny,  something that underscores our duty toward it. It is dear to us  and lies deep into our hearts. We feel that any Arab or Islamic  relinquishment regarding it will be recorded in history with  pain and regret.    His Majesty King Husayn said: In order for the committee to  shoulder its noble responsibilities, achieve its lofty aims, and  follow up every affair related to Jerusalem and the holy shrines  in the religious, historical, political, cultural, information,  and legal domains, we order that the Royal Committee for  Jerusalem Affairs be re-formed under the chairmanship of my dear  brother His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan and the membership  of the following: His Excellency Field Marshal 'Abd-al-Rahman  Siwar al-Dhahab, His Excellency Ahmad al-Talib al-Ibrahimi, His  Eminence Shaykh Ahmad al-Khalil, His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad  al-Mukhtar al-Salami, His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Taqiy-al-Din  al-'Uthmani, His Eminence Dr. Fadil al-Husayn al-Jilani, His  Eminence Shaykh Isma'il Bin-'Ali al-Akwa', His Excellency Dr.  'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Duri, his excellency the minister of  information, his eminence the chief justice, His excellency the  minister of awqaf and Islamic affairs, his excellency the  minister of state for foreign affairs, His Excellency Dr. Hazim  Nusaybah, His Excellency 'Abdallah Salah, His Excellency Dr.  Jamal Nasir, His Excellency Dr. Kamil Abu-Jabir, His Excellency  Dr. Nasir-al-Din al-Asad, Bishop Salim al-Sa'igh, Bishop Samir  Qaf'iti, His Excellency Dr. Muhammad 'Adnan al-Bakhit, Father  Qustantin Qarmash, and His Excellency 'Awn al-Khasawinah.    His Majesty King Husayn had earlier sent a letter to Akram  Zu'aytir, expressing his profound thanks and appreciation for  him and for the [former] members of the Royal Committee for  Jerusalem Affairs.</p>

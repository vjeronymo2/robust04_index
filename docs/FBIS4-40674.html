			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>   [Text] Ashkhabad 19 June TASS -- Turkmen President  Saparmurad Niyazov leaves for Turkey today for an official  visit. Summit talks there will take two days, after which he  will have several days of rest in that country at the invitation  of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.    A memorandum on cooperation is expected to be signed during  the visit. It will further develop the already close  cooperation ties between the two neighbouring countries, which  believe that they are related to each other by the spirit,  language, and ethnic origin.    This is going to be Niyazov's fourth visit to an Asian  country over the recent period of time. The first three  countries he visited were Iran, Malaysia, and Indonesia.    A new political-geographic zone is being formed in that  region following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Turkmen  Deputy Prime Minister Boris Shikhmuradov, who shares Niyazov's  ideas, told ITAR-TASS. It includes the Indian peninsula, part  of the Near and Middle East, Central Asia, the Caspian and Black  Sea basins. According to Shikhmuradov, Turkmenistan's situation  changed in the new geographic zone. It moved from the outskirts  of Central Asia to the centre of the new political-geographic  structure, which focused on it the interest of both Western and  Asian countries.    Taking into account the fact that the natural and manpower  resources of the region, as well as its scientific and  technological potential, are truly enormous, the Turkmen  leadership and its president find it expedient to make use of  them on the basis of the mechanism of bilateral and multilateral  systems, without inventing or creating new ones. A series of  Niyazov's recent visits is in line with that task, Shikhmuradov  said.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Management: Culture clash on the Rio Grande - As Nafta takes root, Damian Fraser looks at business relations between the US and Mexico The difference between business cultures in the US and Mexico can be trying for both countries. They may have just signed a free trade agreement, but business practices in the two countries are strikingly different, and will probably remain so for some time to come. The culture clash, as weary US executives call it, has tripped up foreign companies thinking that business in Mexico will be much the same as that at home. Recently several foreign firms - including Commercial Union of the UK and Quality Coils of the US - have packed their bags, after trying and failing to do business south of the border. The differences range from the apparently trivial - the time lunch is taken and for how long - to more serious issues such as the way workers should be treated to bring out the best in them. While Americans complain that Mexicans abhor deadlines, and defer taking decisions, Mexicans say that Americans are always in a hurry and are too impersonal. For those who get it right, the rewards can be great. Some US plants in Mexico are among the most productive in the world, such as Xerox's in Aguascalientes and Ford's in Hermosillo. Roberto Batres, head of Arthur D. Little in Mexico, says 'the most powerful and basic force behind Nafta is the positive experience US companies have had with Mexican workers'. The differences in business practices partly derive from a lack of competition in Mexico. Until the late 1980s Mexico's economy had been closed to trade, and there was little incentive to be efficient. Companies enjoyed huge market power, so the customer was never considered important. Government regulations were often burdensome, so rule-bending and good contacts in the bureaucracy were essential. While this is now changing, many US executives are frustrated at the slow pace of modernisation. John Atterbury, head of Southwestern Bell in Mexico, which has a minority stake in Mexico's monopoly telephone company, says he has repeatedly tried to increase the number of operators working in directory services, without any success. 'Obviously any time you come into a country and have an advisory role it is difficult. The main problem is the union rather than the management. The unions have problems communicating with their rank and file,' he says. 'We have to change the culture to be more customer-orientated.' Simple administrative differences in Mexico compared with the US often surprise American companies, says Laurence Noclain of consultants Resource Valuation Limited. In Mexico, all bills, for example, have to be paid in person, since no company relies on the postal service. This means that salespeople are also in charge of collecting receivables. It is essential that they be rewarded not just on total sales but according to their success in collecting bills, says RVL. Mark Ehrlich, a psychologist who prepares US executives for work in Mexico, says some difficulties arise from different cultural traditions. Mexicans, he says, are more inclined to accept the intrinsic worth of individuals without demanding specific performance or achievement; Americans tend to judge everyone as equal, and value them according to results. Mexicans in his view rarely put abstract rules and principles over the needs of individuals. Americans believe strongly that no one is above the law, and avoid making exceptions. Mexicans tend to avoid confrontation for fear of offending people, whereas, in his view, Americans 'state the facts, regardless of the impact'. This has important implications for businessmen. Frank Digregorio, the head of Xerox in Mexico, says he tries to make all his Mexican workers feel part of a community, or family. If the workers have to start at 6am, he is there to greet them. He tries to have a meeting with the unions every two weeks, or at least every four weeks. 'Teamwork is essential,' he says. 'You need to communicate a passion for quality.' Guillermo Grim, head of Canada's Northern Telecom in Mexico, says: 'You can be cold and personal in Europe and the US and it works. In Mexico, the best way to do things is to be warm and friendly.' He warns Americans never to lose their temper, or embarrass Mexican colleagues in public. The element that perhaps most frustrates foreigners in Mexico is time. When Mexicans say 'right now' they often mean whenever they can. No one is surprised when meetings start late, or are interrupted by long telephone calls. Again, some of the explanation may be economic: when Mexico's economy was closed, a shortage of spare parts and raw materials meant planning was difficult, and improvisation essential. Like much in Mexico, this is now changing, both in the private and public sector. Whereas 15 years ago Luis Echeverria, then president, took pride in arriving several hours late for everything, President Carlos Salinas is almost always on time. The business-orientated north of Mexico is much more focused on punctuality than the capital, and in terms of time-keeping is almost indistinguishable from the US. With pay and educational gaps between management and workers much wider in Mexico than the US, Mexican companies tend to be more hierarchical, and less responsibility is delegated. 'There are fewer people taking decisions and more people supervising,' says Barry Wilson, head of Cadbury Schweppes in Mexico. Batres says that foreign companies should not mimic this kind of structure. In his view the lack of delegation in Mexican companies partly explains why productivity lags far behind the US. The centralised decision-making stifles creativity, and is economically costly, he says. 'US companies have learned something that, disgracefully, most Mexicans have not realised,' he adds. 'This is the tremendous value in the Mexican workforce. It is the gateway to a lean manufacturing process. But the workers have to be treated right.'</p>

Informed sources told ITAR-TASS that the talks focused on  the  political situation in Russia. The American side displayed deep  interest in how relations between the Russian president and  parliament are being established. The State Duma chairman  assured his interlocutor that notwithstanding all shades of  factions in the parliament and differences, the striving for  interaction with the president prevails among the legislators.    Such an interaction should be carried out in two key  directions: the first one is to untangle the whole knot of  economic problems of the country through a stable legislative  basis meeting the present state of reforms and the second - to  search for a broader consensus for national concord and  reconciliation, the duma chairman said.    Rybkin emphasized that as far as he understands, reforms are  not at all what was implied at an early stage of their  implementation, when the mood of economic euphoria and  romanticism were reigning.    Talbott agreed that now the time has come if not for making  radical, then at least significant reappraisal of what is  happening. Elections in Russia have given Washington a serious  signal as to which direction reforms should proceed in, he said.  According to him, as far as reforms are concerned the Duma is  in constructive mood.    The U.S. deputy secretary of state emphasised that from  Washington's point of view, Russia is now playing a positive  role in resolving the Bosnian crisis. In his turn, Rybkin said  that Russia gives top priority to cooperation with the United  States, since in the contemporary world two countries just canot  go without each other.    During the talks considerable attention was paid to  prospects  of cooperation with the CIS states. The American side in  principle agrees that Russia is a stablilizing factor in this  region and its peace efforts are for the time being not running  counter to universally acceptable political standards and  deserve Washington's support.</p>

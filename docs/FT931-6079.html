			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / People: Ambrose to mine cabinet efficiency Less than three years ago 30-year-old David Ambrose was running one of Lord Hanson's quarries in the heart of Shropshire. Now he has been packed off to help Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency, teach government departments how to get value for money from the resources they use. Ambrose, who has a doctorate in mining engineering from Nottingham University, has been seconded for two years to the cabinet office's efficiency unit. He only joined Hanson in January 1991 but managed to catch the chairman's eye at an early stage in his career. In 1991 Lord Hanson awarded him his annual Hanson Achiever Award as a result of his 'superior management qualities and the considerable cost savings, productivity and improved efficiency he introduced'. Before his secondment he was development manager of ARC Central, part of Hanson's aggregates business. Ambrose's secondment comes only a few weeks after Ian Stewart, a former chief executive of British Ever Ready before Hanson sold it, was seconded to the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

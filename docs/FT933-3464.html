			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Fund sows seeds of consistency - In A Nutshell Start-up companies have missed out on the growth of Britain's venture capital industry in recent years. As venture funds have grown it has become uneconomic for them to devote much time to time-consuming small investments. One fund which has displayed remarkable consistency in backing early-stage businesses has been the Seed Capital Fund, managed by Lucius Cary, publisher of Venture Capital Report, which attempts to unite entrepreneurs and investors. Cary is currently raising his fifth and largest fund yet and has set a target of Pounds 2m. Two large institutions have already promised Pounds 1m. Seed Capital's ideal company is innovative, with a technology base and within easy reach of Cary's offices* in Henley on Thames. The larger fund will allow Seed Capital to follow up its initial investment, typically around Pounds 50,000, with further funds when necessary, says Cary. *Boston Road, Henley on Thames, RG9 1DY.

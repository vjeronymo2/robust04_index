			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUING 2 TEXANS OVER AN EMPTY PENSION FUND  </P> <P> For all that Bernard Mass may have done to Whiteworth, so far it is only the  two Texans who gave him control of the company who have been held accountable  for Whiteworth's woes.  </P> <P> Don M. Sweatman and Larry V. Locke chose not to defend themselves against a  civil complaint filed in April by the U.S. Labor Department accusing them of  violating federal pension laws by raiding Whiteworth's pension plan in March,  1987, a few months after they took over the firm.  </P> <P> In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the government  charged that the brothers-in-law deposited more than $1 million from the plan  in the San Antonio branch of a Bahamian bank, then got $980,000 back as a loan  to Whiteworth.  </P> <P> Acknowledging that they are the objects of a parallel criminal investigation by  the FBI, the Texans cited the Fifth Amendment in refusing to respond to the  civil charges. The government lawsuit alleges that they violated their duty to  operate the pension plan for the sole benefit of its participants --  Whiteworth's employees.  </P> <P> Only after the transaction with the Bank of Nassau did Sweatman lay out the  details to the outside directors of the public company that he and Locke  controlled, which in turn owned Whiteworth.  </P> <P> "He said, 'You probably will want to resign when you hear this,' " recalled  Royce Diener, former chairman of American Medical International, the big  hospital management company. "At that point I felt I was involved with  something I had insufficient knowledge about and shouldn't have anything to do  with."  </P> <P> Some of the roughly 100 former Whiteworth employees who are due benefits from  the pension plan -- either now or as they get older -- complain that quicker  government action could have prevented the problems.  </P> <P> A. D. White, the company's founder, had taken steps to terminate the plan and  distribute its assets to covered employees before he sold Whiteworth early in  1986. But it wasn't until April, 1988, that the Internal Revenue Service  approved the termination.  </P> <P> By that time, the money apparently was long gone.  </P> <P> Since then, responsibility for the plan has been batted back and forth by the  Labor Department and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the government-owned  agency that insures private pension plans. The PBGC now is moving to place the  plan in trusteeship and begin making payments to the five former employees who  already qualify for benefits, an agency spokesperson said.  </P> <P> Because the assets are missing, all payments will come from the guaranty  corporation's already overtaxed coffers.  </P> <P> "The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing," said Thomas R.  White, the brother of A. D. White and former vice president of purchasing at  Whiteworth. The Fountain Valley man said he is owed more than $63,000 in  benefits. JIM SCHACHTER  </P></p>

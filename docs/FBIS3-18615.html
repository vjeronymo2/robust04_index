It is still  difficult for Austrian exporters to get credit guarantees from  the Control Bank. They are only granted in special cases.    According to Guenter Richter, the Austrian trade delegate in  Moscow, Austrian firms have so far established 475 joint  ventures in Moscow, in which they have invested about 2 billion  schillings. However, many of these enterprises only exist on  paper.    In 1993 Austria's exports to Russia decreased by 9.6 percent  to 6.2 billion schillings. This was a good result because  Russia's total imports decreased by 30 percent. About 1,200  Austrian firms deal directly or indirectly with the Russian  market. The most important export items are consumer goods,  equipment for the food industry, and supplies for the natural  gas and oil industries.    Last year, Austria's imports increased by 2.3 percent to 7.7  billion schillings. The most important import item is energy,  whose share decreased from 90 percent to 70 percent. However,  supplies of semifinished and finished products increased.</p>

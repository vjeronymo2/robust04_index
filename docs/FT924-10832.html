			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / What the election committee letters said Excerpts from the British and Chinese correspondence Douglas Hurd to Qian Qichen, Jan 18, 1990 If you wished to provide for the establishment of a grand electoral college in the Basic Law, and the arrangements for constituting this body were open and fully representative, we would wish to see it initiated in 1995 through consultations between our two sides. Hurd to Qian, January 31, 1990 It will also be important that the details of the composition and constitution of any grand electoral college are made clear to Hong Kong people to reassure them about the nature of their proposed future political system. We could then consider introducing similar arrangements in 1995, thereby ensuring continuity. UK paper handed to Chinese government, February 6, 1990 Main aspects on which we believe agreement would be necessary are  .. size and composition of the election committee, delineation of each category of membership and the selection of individual members from each category  .. procedures for the nomination and election of candidates to the legislature  .. the following principles could best form the framework for creating an election committee  .. it should not itself be an institution of government  .. composition should be designed, as far as possible, to avoid direct duplication with the membership of other constituencies returning members of the legislature   . committee should be as representative as possible  .. procedure for nomination  .. should be simple, open and prescribed in the electoral law  .. voting should be by secret ballot. Chen Ziying, China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, to British ambassador in Beijing, February 8, 1990 With regard to the electoral committee, the Chinese side agrees with the five principles concerning the committee proposed by the British side in the document. However, the Chinese side maintains that the provisions on the composition and ratio of the electoral committee as specified in  .. the Basic Law (Draft) must be followed in terms of its proportional composition  . China believes its provisions on composition and ratio are appropriate .. Hurd to Qian, February 12, 1990 I agree in principle with the arrangements which you propose for an electoral committee ..</p>

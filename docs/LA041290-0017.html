			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS / LANCASTER COUNCIL;  </P> <P> FIRST BLACK WINS ALONG WITH ROOT, INCUMBENT RODIO  </P> <P> Voters in Lancaster elected the high desert city's first black councilman, one  of two "managed growth" candidates who were elected along with an incumbent in  the crowded race for three City Council seats.  </P> <P> The Rev. Henry Hearns, 56, finished second among 15 candidates in his first  political bid, surprising many in the crowd watching the vote count Tuesday  night at Lancaster City Hall.  </P> <P> The minister and former chief environmental engineer at Edwards Air Force Base  appeared to strike a responsive chord with a campaign that emphasized his  planning and engineering experience, his educational background and his  religious vocation.  </P> <P> Hearns and his integrated campaign team said he will provide a new voice for  the growing minority population in the city of 90,000 residents, which  incorporated in 1977. About 5% of its population is black. But they said that  race was not an issue and that voters selected Hearns because of his  credentials.  </P> <P> "The voters saw a good, honest man and they voted for him," said Milt Huckaby  of the Lancaster Coalition of Neighborhood Organizations, a homeowner group  whose endorsement boosted the candidacies of Hearns and fellow victor George  Root over several better-financed candidates. "The man has got a tremendous  amount of ability."  </P> <P> Hearns, who retired in December after 32 years at the Air Force base, said at a  quiet victory party in Lancaster early Wednesday that he was gratified by the  response to his candidacy.  </P> <P> "I want to give thanks to the community for trusting me the first time around,"  Hearns said. "What this tells me is that the people who know me know that I do  my very best to be fair to everyone."  </P> <P> Root, a 59-year-old administrator at Edwards Air Force Base and mobile home  tenant activist, was the leading vote-getter with 3,938 votes, or 14.7% of the  vote, in his third council bid. Hearns received 3,261 votes, 12.2%. Incumbent  Arnie Rodio got 3,212 votes, 12.6%, to eke out a narrow reelection victory over  Frank Roberts, a dean at Antelope Valley College. Two other incumbents did not  seek reelection.  </P> <P> Hearns and Root both said they spent less than $10,000 each in a race where  some front-runners who were identified with real estate and developer interests  spent double and triple that amount. Hearns and Root were the only candidates  backed by vigorous grass-roots efforts of the homeowner coalition.  </P> <P> Huckaby hailed the election as a clear message of dissatisfaction with a  council that he said has been unresponsive to homeowners and overly influenced  by developers in decisions regarding Lancaster's rapid growth.  </P> <P> Root and Hearns said in separate interviews that they will emphasize careful  planning and environmental study of projects such as a recent council decision  to allow high-density housing development under the flight paths of Air Force  Plant 42. That move was approved despite opposition by Air Force officials and  community activists, and both Root and Hearns said they would have voted  against it.  </P> <P> "The message was clear," Root said of the election results. "People resented  the influence of developers. People felt they did not have a vehicle to be  fairly represented. . . . You can't have slow growth; that's a misnomer. But  you can plan for growth."  </P> <P> About 10,005 of Lancaster's 39,336 registered voters cast ballots, a turnout  that City Clerk Carla Johnson described as moderate.  </P> <P> LANCASTER  </P> <P> 31 of 31 Precincts  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> Three vacancies  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.98IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Candidate  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Vote  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> George L.

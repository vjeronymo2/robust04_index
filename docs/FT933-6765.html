			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Belgium defends monetary policy BELGIUM'S central bank yesterday leapt to the defence of its strict franc fort policy after a group of Flemish economists called for monetary policy to be relaxed. The 14 economists from the Catholic University of Leuven said that continuing to tie the Belgian franc to the D-Mark - a policy pursued since 1990 - would damage industry and employment prospects and was no longer an acceptable option. But the central bank said yesterday that Belgium was not following its strict monetary policy for the sake of principle but for 'purely rational motives, given the (economic) context in Belgium'. Belgium has stuck to the policy of shadowing the D-Mark, even though recent changes to the beleaguered European exchange rate mechanism allow currencies a much wider margin for fluctuation. In their 'manifesto', published on Tuesday, the economists argue that the policy is not tailored to the specific Belgian issues of high unemployment and low inflation. They also call for a freeze on wage indexation and for structural reforms in employment and social security. Mr Karel Van Miert, Belgian vice-president of the European Commission, said yesterday that the economists' manifesto was an indication of the way in which EC policy could begin to fragment if the drive for economic and monetary union was not renewed. He refused to comment on the substance of the text. The bank's statement supporting existing policy helped to support the Belgian franc yesterday at BFr21.125 to the D-Mark against Tuesday's close of BFr21.10.</p>

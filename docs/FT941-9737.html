			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Balancing the book - A publisher putting profit second A publisher producing just one book a year sounds a most unpromising proposition, but Shirley Jones of the Red Hen Press has seen her business expand from a housewife's hobby to a respected concern with good prospects for the rest of the 1990s. 'My products matter more than my profits,' says Jones who has combined an English degree with art school courses to become a writer, illustrator and printer of artists' books, working from a studio at her south London home. She may produce only one book a year, and print only 40 copies of it - but with each book retailing for an average of Pounds 500 (special designer bindings are sometimes added at extra cost), profits are appearing. The pace is slow, however, as the books can take years to sell: Jones supplements her income by selling prints from the books for an average of Pounds 40 to Pounds 60, and by lecturing at universities. Jones began producing artists' books at a loss during the mid-1970s, and it was not until 1983 that the Red Hen Press became a commercial concern and began to pay for itself. Before then, she spent Pounds 1,000 on printing equipment, and bought her materials - hand-made paper and inks costing about Pounds 400 a year - from family savings. Prints accounted for 66 per cent of turnover before 1983, and books the rest. Books sold for an average of Pounds 200, and only 12 to 25 copies of each were produced. Prices were calculated simply by looking at what Jones reckoned the market would stand and disregarding her own labour costs. 'Even now, I calculate that I pay myself only Pounds 3.50 an hour,' she said. In 1983, turnover reached a modest Pounds 5,000, of which the sale of books formed 90 per cent. This financial shift followed a decision to market the books personally around American universities and art libraries. 'I spent, and still spend, Pounds 1,500 per annum on that. Other overheads have been low in comparison - just Pounds 500 a year - as I work from home,' said Jones, who now employs a part-time assistant, usually an art student, during the hectic printing period. Since the 1980s, the Red Hen Press has published a wide range of titles, including translations of Welsh and Old English poetry, and original poems about Jones's Welsh homeland, cats, wildlife and other subjects. During this period she made a financial mistake which alarmed her so much she made a further change of strategy: 'I used to commission one-off designer bindings for a few books before trying to sell them,' she explained. 'But in 1989 I commissioned a design which turned out not at all like my brief, and was more expensive than I had expected - almost Pounds 1,000. I paid, but the book still hasn't sold, and since that time I've never commissioned designer bindings except on order.' By placing her product above commercial considerations, Jones has been building her reputation as a serious book artist. This is the prime selling point of her business, and can be regarded as a long-term investment which looks likely pay off during the rest of the 1990s. Turnover this year is still modest, at Pounds 10,200. Total outgoings come to Pounds 4,200, of which 66 per cent is spent on production, 23 per cent on marketing, and the remainder on overheads. But as Jones's name becomes better known, profits look likely to rise: second-hand copies of her books are already selling for more than their original retail price. Jones's buyers are predominantly universities, art libraries and museums, including the British Library, the Victoria and Albert, the Guttenberg Museum in Germany, and many American universities. 'I also sell a certain amount, around 5 per cent, to private collectors, usually through a dealer, who takes one third of the price in profit.' This year could prove a springboard year for the Red Hen Press for two reasons. First, Jones's husband Ken recently retired from his post as head of personnel at Reuters Europe. Now a personnel consultant, he is spending about a third of his time on marketing his wife's business. Second, the business is to move to Wales as Jones has been awarded a grant of Pounds 4,300 by the Development Board of Rural Wales towards the cost of converting part of her existing Welsh home into a studio and office, giving more space while reducing overheads. She plans to employ a part-time printing assistant, and a part-time office worker. Husband Ken explained: 'While never forgetting that future business plans are secondary to artistic development, we are planning to increase our income from the sale of cards and poetry books, as well as from a few more lecture tours.'

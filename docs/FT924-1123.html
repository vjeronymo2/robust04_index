			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie near peak on recovery hopes A WAVE of optimism swept through the London stock market yesterday, brushing aside all previous forecasts for the 1992 year-end and bringing about one of the busiest trading sessions since Britain quit the ERM in mid-September. The institutions jumped down off the fence and rushed to build 'recovery portfolios' of stocks thought likely to respond quickly if the UK economy achieves the expected recovery next year. The FT-SE Index opened steadily but then surged ahead after the expiry of the current stock index future contract was completed. At the close, the FT-SE Index was 49.4 points up at 2,789.7, virtually the day's peak and within three points of the all-time closing high achieved on December 2. The March contract on the Footsie, which has now become the lead futures security, moved above 2,800. But a bigger rise, in percentage terms, was achieved by the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which jumped by 2 per cent to 2,783.6, outpacing the FT-SE 100 Index for the second consecutive session. Confidence in economic recovery next year prompted the institutions to buy a range of capital goods stocks which feature in the FT-SE Mid Index list. Seaq volume increased to 940m shares from Thursday's 825m. Yesterday's gain in the stock market reversed the calmer trend seen earlier this month as the institutions reduced equity trading ahead of the Christmas break. Sentiment benefited yesterday from a favourable monthly report of business opinion from the Confederation of British Industry, and from money supply statistics regarded as supportive of interest rate optimism. Last night's final reading showed a gain on the Footsie of 73.5 points or 2.7 per cent over the week. Many strategists admitted to bewilderment at the sudden change of mood in the market, which appeared to overlook doubts about the pace of any economic recovery. The Footsie Index, having at present left far behind predictions that it would close around 2,700 on new year's eve this year, is now within a few points of many forecasts for new year's eve 1993. The stress on second tier stocks, largely neglected early this year when institutions feared being caught in stocks difficult to sell in bear markets, appears particularly encouraging. But small losses in government bonds yesterday reflected concerns over sterling and domestic inflation. Retail business has increased strongly as the emphasis has turned to the second tier stocks which feature in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Shenzhen share trading resumes CALM returned yesterday to the streets of Shenzhen, the southern Chinese city which earlier this week witnessed the worst civil unrest on the mainland since the June 1989 democracy protests in Beijing. An estimated 1m people went to the city on the Hong Kong border over the weekend to apply for forms letting them participate in a lottery for new shares to be issued on the local exchange. But allegations of official corruption in the distribution of the forms sparked a riot. Share trading resumed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, after Tuesday's suspension, and is reported to have been orderly. The index of locally owned 'A' shares fell 17 points to 294 while the index of 'B' shares, owned by foreigners, declined by a more subdued 2.98 to 178.51. China's other stock exchange, in Shanghai, saw the index of 'A' shares fall by 9.5 per cent, following an 11 per cent slide on Tuesday. Traders said the movement was not connected with Shenzhen, but resulted from expanded market listings. Foreign investors were sanguine about prospects for China's stock markets. One Hong Kong fund manager said yesterday the riot was 'an unfortunate event but not one that was particularly worrying'. It is too early to say what implications the riot holds for China's economic reform movement, but Beijing's response has so far been controlled. Hong Kong media reported that Lou Gan, secretary of the State Council, or cabinet, had arrived in Shenzhen to conduct an inquiry into the riot and the city's procedures for issuing new shares. It was also reported that Zou Jiahua, a vice-premier, had taken overall charge of co-ordinating the central government's response to the situation. Zheng Liangyu, mayor of Shenzhen, said on Tuesday: 'We won't deny there is imperfection in the current sales method, since we are in fact very inexperienced.' China plans to set up a nation-wide computer clearing network to link banks in leading cities, and a computer trading and clearing system for stocks, Reuter reports from Singapore. Li Ye, general director of the financial science and technology division of the People's Bank of China in Beijing, said the World Bank would provide a loan under its technical assistance programme. Computerisation is seen as a big step in China's financial reforms.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> COUPLE DECIDES THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME;  </P> <P> SMALL-TOWN FEELING, DIVERSE POPULATION INSPIRE THE REMODELING OF A VERY MODEST  HOUSE.  </P> <P> The 777-square-foot house in the hills of Altadena that was ideal for bachelor  Ken Davis in 1977 was bursting at the seams for him as a family man in the  mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Shortly after they were married in 1983, Ken and Jette Davis considered buying  a larger house before deciding to remodel their 40-year-old two-bedroom  ranch-style house in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.  </P> <P> They looked at houses from Glendora to Valencia, but kept coming back to  Altadena, an unincorporated area north of Pasadena with a diverse mix of  middle-class blacks and whites, yuppies and older couples.  </P> <P> "We decided to remodel when we found that none of the houses we looked at had  as good a location as the house for which I paid $35,000 in 1977," said Davis,  a news executive at television station KTLA, Channel 5.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small-Town Atmosphere  </P> <P> "After a pressure-packed day in the news business in the heart of Hollywood,  it's great to come home to Altadena. It's like a small town in the mountains.  Furthermore, I want our children to grow up in a community that has diversity."  </P> <P> Danish-born Jette Davis was pregnant with their youngest son, Philip, during  the six-month remodeling process. Their other son, Christopher, is 4. Philip is  now almost 3 months old.  </P> <P> Working with an architect friend from Palo Alto, Chris Tripoli, Davis came up  with a plan that would create a new master bath and closet, extend the living  room and add a third bedroom. Tripoli drew the basic drawings and Lon Cross, an  engineer at Lockheed in Burbank, drew the working blueprints.  </P> <P> "Originally, we wanted to have the new child's bedroom in the front and an  extension, with a bay window, to the living room," Davis said. "We changed our  plans, moving the bedroom to the rear of the house when we discovered that our  neighborhood has a 40-foot front-yard setback. We could go out only 12 feet  from the front facade of the house."  </P> <P> The setback requirement forced the Davises to keep the bay window projection of  the living room and the new master bathroom on the same plane: "We originally  wanted the bedroom to project farther out," he said. The bay window  incorporates a window seat with storage underneath.  </P> <P> Davis cites the setback as an example of pitfalls that face homeowners planning  a remodeling project:  </P> <P> "If something in the design looks wrong or out of character with the rest of  the neighborhood, let it be a warning to you," he said. "What finally tipped me  off was a walk through my neighborhood. I saw the houses set back uniformly  from the street."  </P> <P> Once the Davises were aware of the setback requirements, the project was back  on track. Thanks to a previous remodeling, which added 230 square feet to the  house, the kitchen was adequate for their needs and didn't need changing. The  master bath, relocated to the front of the house, has French doors leading to  the bedroom. There is a cathedral ceiling in the master bath, contributing to  the light and airy feeling both Ken and Jette wanted.  </P> <P> Also contributing to this feeling are the light, neutral colors throughout the  remodeled areas of the home. They make the relatively small structure look  larger, Davis said.  </P> <P> "We wanted sisal floor-covering, something Jette was familiar with from Europe,  but it would have been too rough on the children's feet," Davis said. "We  finally went with vinyl flooring in the bath and carpeting in the other areas."  </P> <P> Jeff Paul of J.P. Construction, Burbank, was not the lowest bidder of the four  contractors the Davises interviewed, but he was chosen because of  recommendations from friends whose houses Paul had remodeled, Ken Davis said.  </P> <P> "Choosing a contractor who is at once competent, reliable, honest and  compatible is critical, because the contractor becomes part of your family  during construction process," he added.  </P> <P> "We depended on Jeff to fix things that some of the subcontractors might have  missed and give us advice," he said. Perhaps the best advice Paul gave them was  to allow at least 20% over the estimate for extras and cost overruns, Davis  said.  </P> <P> "It turned out that Jeff was right," he said. "We decided to rebuild a wall  that had been damaged by too many earthquakes and we extended the back bedroom  wall a foot. We exceeded the original estimate by about 25%."  </P> <P> The house is now worth nearly 10 times what Davis paid for it a dozen years  ago. The latest expansion -- there was a small one in the early 1980s -- has  added 650 square feet to the house. The look is that of a contemporary New  England-style house, similar to many the Davises saw on their house-hunting  trips.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DAVIS HOUSE  </P> <P> Year Built: 1948.  </P> <P> Location: Reposa Lane, Altadena.  </P> <P> Approx. size: 1,650 sq. ft., three bedrooms.  </P> <P> Lot Size: 60 x 130 ft.  </P> <P> Approx. Remodeling Budget: $65,000.  </P></p>

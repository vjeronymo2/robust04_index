			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Fallout from 'WA Inc' damages Labor: An inquiry in Perth has heard allegations of a web of deals A JOKE is going round Australia's eastern states about a frog who asks a Western Australian girl for a kiss, claiming it will restore him to human shape and bring back his fortune. The girl is about to oblige, but her sister grabs the frog, puts it in a jar, and closes the lid. 'Why did you do that?' asks the girl. 'Don't be silly,' says the sister, 'everyone knows a talking frog is worth more than a Perth entrepreneur'. The story illustrates the disdain with which Western Australia (WA) is viewed among the eastern establishment following the collapse of high-profile entrepreneurs like Mr Alan Bond and Mr Laurie Connell. But if early indications from an inquiry now sitting in Perth are substantiated, it may turn out that self-respect is the least of WA's losses from a period when critics claim the state abandoned many of the standards which are essential for efficient government. The fallout will almost certainly lead to the ejection of the state Labor government after a decade in power, and will damage the re-election prospects of Mr Bob Hawke's federal Labor government, which will suffer by association. For much of the 1980s, Perth was the get-rich-quick capital of Australia, an easy-money town where entrepreneurs like Mr Bond and Mr Robert Holmes a Court built business empires which shook boardrooms on three continents. But as the entrepreneurs succumbed to their mountainous debts, details emerged of what is alleged to be a web of deals between government and local businessmen, known collectively as 'WA Inc', which the Liberal opposition claims has cost taxpayers more than ADollars 1bn (Pounds 833m). 'WA Inc' is being investigated by a Royal Commission, due to report in January, which has already heard evidence of alleged undeclared donations to Labor funds, illicit bank accounts used to finance propaganda, and envelopes stuffed with money kept in ministers' offices. One witness said dealing with Labor was like dealing with the Mafia. Later, the inquiry will investigate deals involving government share dealings, financial guarantees, and investments in companies and projects associated with well-known entrepreneurs. There are also allegations of illegal wire-tapping, improper land and property dealings, and less than enthusiastic investigation of complaints by the state police. Two deals carried out by Liberal governments in the early 1980s will also be investigated. The key figure in the inquiry is Mr Brian Burke, WA's Labor premier from 1983 to 1988, when he became Australian ambassador to Ireland and the Vatican - a post from which he resigned last month after beginning his evidence to the commission. Mr Burke denies any impropriety, and maintains that the commission will clear his name. However, it is clear that his government had a close relationship with local businessmen. Under Mr Burke's leadership, the state took an active role in promoting projects through direct investment or share dealing by government-owned institutions. Among the most costly were a ADollars 150m investment in Rothwells, Mr Connell's failed merchant bank, and losses of more than ADollars 300m on a series of deals relating to a proposed petrochemical complex which was never built. Mr Burke, a charismatic former television journalist, was easily able to overcome opposition within his own party - as the first Labor premier for a decade he was seen as a messiah who had led the party out of the wilderness. But evidence is growing that the implementation of government policies owed as much to the Australian phenomenon of 'mateship', or cronyism, as to political dynamism. Witnesses who have yet to give evidence before the inquiry allege several public service heads of department were removed or shifted to non-jobs to make way for 'mates' of Mr Burke who were politically sympathetic. 'It was not enough to be neutral; it was not enough to be an able public servant. They wanted people who were on their side,' one displaced official claimed. Mr Barry MacKinnon, the state Liberal leader, says many of the appointees were 'compliant but not qualified', and blames much of the subsequent disaster on their inability to manage or give dispassionate advice. Others, like Mr Lyndon Rowe, director of the WA Confederation of Industry, say the 'mateship' syndrome is an inevitable consequence of life in a small town of around 1m people, even if it is the capital of a state the size of western Europe. But it is a phenomenon from which Labor appears unwilling to distance itself. Dr Ian Alexander, a state MP who left Labor partly because of 'WA Inc', says his efforts to persuade the party to condemn the Burke government's activities were repeatedly rebuffed. 'It is not the done thing to dump on your mates. That is part of the Australian tradition, and that is fine, but when people have been found to have acted in this way, somebody at the top needs to make clear that they cannot do so with impunity,' he says. Dr Carmen Lawrence, the premier, refuses to condemn the Burke government, in spite of the judgment of most political analysts that only that step can save her government from a huge defeat at the polls. Dr Lawrence concedes that the steady drip of disclosures from the commission is damaging Labor, but says it is 'important to be loyal to the tenets of the party'. Her strategy seems to be to hang on to office in the hope that the commission will also damage the Liberal opposition, or that the voters' mood will have changed by polling day in two years' time. The danger is that whichever party wins the next election, the legitimacy of government in WA may have been damaged so deeply that it will take years to recover. As Mr Rowe puts it: 'The real cost of this whole exercise is not the money that has been lost, it is the added cynicism in the electorate about the political process, which in Australia does not have a high reputation at the best of times'.</p>

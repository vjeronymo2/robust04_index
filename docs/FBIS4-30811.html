			<p>BFN     [Text] The heaviest fighting in former Bosnia-Herzegovina  in the past 24 hours was on the Donji Vakuf [Srbobran] front  where Muslim forces are trying to break through the defense  lines of the Srpska republic. Slavisa Zabic reports:    [Zabic] The strongest offensive of the Bugojno Muslims so  far  has been going on for three days now. Hundreds of shells of all  calibers have hit villages around Srbobran and the city itself,  in which civilian targets came under fire today. Very strong  and exceptionally well armed Muslim forces, accompanied by -- as  Serb military sources report -- many foreign mercenaries  yesterday captured Serb villages on the Goles plateau on Mount  Komar and razed them to the ground. Today however, the Serb  fighters are repelling the assaults by Izetbegovic's extremists,  the most powerful so far on the Srbobran battlefield. Both  sides have many dead and wounded in the fighting which is  gaining impetus hour by hour.    In addition to Srbobran, the final aim of the Muslim  offensive on this part of the battlefield of the Srpska republic  is Jajce. This is why a fresh regrouping of the enemy forces  was observed today on roads west of Bugojno.</p>

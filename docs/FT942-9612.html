			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Big programme trade unsettles equity market - Market report UK share prices fell sharply in late trading, ignoring a solid opening on Wall Street and in US Treasury bonds after encouraging US inflation numbers for April. Dealers, at first perplexed by the sudden slide in the UK market, said that most of the pressure came from the futures market where one marketmaking firm unloaded the future before unwinding a substantial programme trade involving both FT-SE 100 and mid cap stocks. At the close of a busy trading session, the FT-SE 100 index closed 18.6 lower at 3,119.2, having been in positive territory at the start of the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 index was also badly hit, closing 20.6 off at 3,721.8. Gilt-edged stocks, on the other hand, were in good form throughout the session, opening around  1/4 higher and moving ahead strongly to show gains in the region of  3/4 before settling around a half-point higher on balance. The Bank of England said its next auction, on May 25, would involve the sale of a short-dated convertible. Details of the auction are expected next week. The equity market began the day in good heart, with marketmakers marking share prices higher in response to the strong performance by US bonds and Wall Street overnight and following the highly encouraging economic data on producer prices and the restated retail sales numbers for March. But the early strength of the market was gradually eroded by the effects of a disappointing first quarter performance by Unilever, one of the UK's leading companies, and the emergence of end-account profit-taking. The FT-SE 100 rose to the day's best level, 3,141.9, up 4.1 early in the session but then ran into small but persistent selling, triggered partly by the disappointing Unilever figures but also by selling ahead of the US inflation numbers. US Treasury bonds and the Dow Jones index moved ahead strongly, driving European bond and equity markets with them following the lower than expected inflation figures for April, before stalling. The big downwards pressure in London was exerted in mid-afternoon, when a big seller of the FT-SE future drove the index sharply lower and prompted a similar retreat in the cash market. At its worst the FT-SE 100 was down 21.6 at 3,116.2, before a late rally. Most marketmakers were unperturbed by the late slide in the market. 'It was looking tired and only needed a small push to go sharply lower,' said one senior trader. Others, however, remained extremely cautious, pointing out that although the FT-SE 100 had closed well above the 3,100 level there was no real confidence in the market that international bonds had seen the worst of the recent turbulence. Turnover in the market yesterday was 671.7m shares, surprisingly high given that it was the last session of the three-week account. The two oil sectors of the market gave another strong performance as crude oil prices moved towards the Dollars 17 a barrel mark. The majors attracted fresh support from the US while the Lasmo defence document, responding to the all-paper offer from Enterprise Oil, saw another big turnover in Lasmo shares. Over the week the FT-SE 100 index has risen 17.2 while the Mid Cap has fallen 49.2. Dealers said the outperformance of the leading stocks was a reflection of sharply increased institutional activity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Energy Minister Moshe Shahal has turned down an  offer from Russia to sell nuclear technology to Israel. The  minister has just returned from a visit to Russia, which  included a tour of a nuclear power plant. The minister  explained why he refused the offer:    [Begin Shahal recording] I am not in favor of entering or  buying existing technology for nuclear power plants. I think  that Israel and probably the world will have to wait many years  for a new technology, a safer technology. The Russians  mentioned that in the past, during the time when Professor Yuval  Ne'eman was the minister of energy and afterwards in a meeting  with Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, there were talks by the Israeli  Government to have a sort of a joint venture for a nuclear power  plant. I mentioned and I explained our policy that we are more  interested in the scientific question, in cooperation together  maybe with Russia and the United States, but for future  technologies, not the existing ones. Basically, I would say the  government is not involved in buying energy supply as it was  some years ago. I explained the new structure that we have  here. [end recording]</p>

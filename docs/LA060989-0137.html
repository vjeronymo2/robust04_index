			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Chicago Cubs traditionally have not minded their neighbors watching games  free from their rooftops adjacent to Wrigley Field, but they do object to a  private club charging for rooftop parties.  </P> <P> Club President Donald Grenesko says he has asked the Cubs' architect to design  a barrier to be erected behind an outfield bleacher section that will block the  view of the Lakeview Baseball Club, organized by ERTA Development, which owns  the building.  </P> <P> "It's not the money," Grenesko said. "It's the principle. They're stealing our  product, and that just grates on us."  </P></p>

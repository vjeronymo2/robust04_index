			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / India economy expected to see 5% growth The Indian economy is expected to grow by 5 per cent in the year to the end of March 1995, thanks to a good monsoon and a revival in industrial production, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, said yesterday. The RBI forecast, in its annual report was markedly more optimistic than at any time since the country embarked on economic liberalisation in mid-1991. It said that the flow of new issues in the capital markets and increases in lending by long-term development banks indicated a jump in private investment after three years of stagnation. The report forecast growth in real terms of 3 per cent in agriculture, 7 per cent in industrial output and 10 per cent in private investment. These figures point to a considerable gain over last year when the economy grew by just 3.8 per cent. But the forecast economic growth rate of 5 per cent is still short of the 5.5 per cent achieved in the pre-reform 1980s and even further behind the rates achieved by India's leading economic rivals, including Indonesia and China. The central bank warned that inflation, running at an annual rate of 9-10 per cent, had to be cut by 4 percentage points and urged the government to reduce public borrowing by reforming taxation, improving expenditure controls and phasing out subsidies, except for those aimed at the poor. In a strongly-worded passage, the bank insisted the government had to reduce its debts or else 'sharply rising interest payments could well crowd out vital expenditures'. It said interest payments would this year swallow 53.4 per cent of government revenues, up from 39 per cent in 1990-91. The bank urged the government to set 'a finite time horizon' on efforts to reduce borrowing. It praised the government for reductions in the first few months of 1994-95, due to a surge in tax revenues, but said more long-term efforts were needed. The bank estimated that the combined fiscal deficit for the central government and state governments together in 1993-94 was 8.9 per cent of GDP, up from 7 per cent the previous year. The figures compare with a figure of 7.4 per cent for the central government alone. The report also commented upon the recent increases in foreign exchange reserves, fuelled mainly by a rapid rise of foreign exchange inflows due principally to foreign portfolio investment. A strike called in support of lower caste demands for job quotas in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh yesterday passed off with sporadic incidents of violence in which three people were killed and 250 injured.</p>

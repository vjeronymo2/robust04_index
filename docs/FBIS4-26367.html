			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 21 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today urged U.S. business leaders to help win passage of  a health care reform program covering all Americans.    Speaking to the business roundtable, an influential group of  U.S. business executives, the U.S. president complained that  Washington is "too partisan, too negative, too obsessed with  process and conflict."    The atmosphere still has been more hostile to change than he  had imagined it would be, Clinton said, adding that the American  people desperately wanted change, but U.S. Congress and business  are often unwilling to listen to them.    Seventeen months in office, Clinton said that he was still  surprised by the opposition he has faced.    The business roundtable has endorsed a less ambitious health  care reform plan than the one Clinton has suggested. The  President's version is now stuck in U.S. Congress.    Facing predictions that Congress won't be able to enact  universal coverage this year, Clinton said, "I refuse to declare  defeat... let us not walk away."    Just before Clinton spoke, another Democrat on the pivotal  Senate Finance Committee, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, backed  away from the employer-mandate that is a central ingredient of  the President's plan and floated a proposal to substitute an  individual mandate instead.    Senate majority leader George Mitchell told the committee it  would be mid-July before a bill could come to the floor.    The U.S. president used his speech to the business  roundtable  to seek support also for his proposals to overhaul the welfare  system, job-training programs and to win passage of major trade  legislation.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PRINCE CHARLES VISITS PAN AM CRASH SITE  </P> <P> Prince Charles, visibly shocked by lingering signs of damage, received a warm  welcome Tuesday in this Scottish border town devastated by the Pan Am air  disaster in which 270 people died.  </P> <P> His visit followed widespread criticism of the Royal Family for not attending a  memorial service for victims of the crash of the New York-bound Boeing 747,  which was destroyed by a bomb on Dec. 21 in Britain's worst air crash. All 259  aboard the plane and 11 local people died as fire and wreckage rained on  Lockerbie.  </P> <P> In the town square on Tuesday 2,000 people, including 800 schoolchildren,  waited in the freezing wind to catch a glimpse of the 40-year-old prince.  </P> <P> He laid a wreath at a flower-filled shrine outside the red sandstone town hall.  </P></p>

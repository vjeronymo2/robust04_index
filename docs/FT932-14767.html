			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia 'cannot understand' rubber pact opposition MALAYSIA SAYS it cannot understand the refusal of the world's natural rubber consuming countries to renegotiate the International Natural Rubber Agreement. Mr Ahmad Farouk, chairman of the the Malaysian rubber research and development board and the country's spokesman at meetings of the International Natural Rubber Organisation, says that the consumer countries have been inflexible and have mistakenly linked a renegotiation of Inra with a revision of the Inro reference price mechanism. The present agreement expires at the end of this year. Last month the main natural rubber consumer countries - the European Community, the US and Japan  -voted against a renegotiation saying that such a move would only be considered if a dispute over a downward revision of Inro's reference price was resolved. Earlier this year producing countries - mainly Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia - opposed a 5 per cent cut in the reference price because prices were then in an uptrend. The reference price guides the organisation's buffer stock manager in his buying and selling of stockpiled rubber. 'I do not understand the consumers,' says Mr Ahmad. 'They insisted that the reference price be revised first. But they know that there will be new proposals on reference price if we go into a renegotiation of Inra.' The Malaysian cabinet has this week been discussing what measures to take if, as expected, the agreement collapses at the end of the year. Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the primary industries minister, has accused the consumer countries of not caring whether price levels are remunerative for producer countries. Mr Lim said the consumers wanted to keep the price locked in the present low range. 'We want Inra but not at any cost,' said Mr Lim. 'Producers must protect themselves. They should not allow themselves to be trampled on by the rich and powerful consuming nations.' A last attempt to save the pact will probably be made when the organisation's council meets here next month. Producers say if Inra collapses they will bring in their own supply curbs and alternative pricing mechanisms.</p>

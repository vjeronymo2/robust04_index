			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies Mr Pierre Beregovoy's verbal support for the franc yesterday was, curiously, not reinforced by any move on official lending rates. Perhaps the pressures in a thin pre-Christmas market are not great enough to warrant a more robust response. The success of any defensive move depends heavily on choosing a time when a squeeze on the speculators will inflict most pain. Then again, Germany is also under pressure. If France decided it could not take any more deflation, it would be more likely to suspend its ERM membership than just to devalue. The former course would be the only way to regain freedom over interest rate policy. But the French fundamentals are better than Germany's in so many ways - inflation, growth, current account and public finance - that, after a while, the franc could start to appreciate against the D-Mark. The cherished image of the D-Mark as the European currency which never depreciates would then be shattered. Even the Bundesbank might prefer to cut rates rather than be blamed for the collapse of the ERM, not to mention damage to the Franco-German relationship. The timing, though, remains delicate. It would take a significant Bundesbank relaxation to let France off the hook before its elections in March. The foreign exchange market may decide to have a go anyway.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASTY WEATHER AND ROUGH TERRAIN ADD TO DIFFICULTIES OF SEARCHERS IN ETHIOPIA  </P> <P> His eyes rimmed in red, a kit bag dropped wearily at his feet, Air Force Capt.  John E. Matwick was describing the rigors of searching for a twin-engine plane  in some of the roughest territory and most contrary weather conditions in the  world.  </P> <P> "With the weather so bad, the hard thing is just keeping track of where you  have searched," the 33-year-old Palos Verdes, Calif., native said at Addis  Ababa airport after a 10-hour day spent searching fruitlessly for the missing  plane carrying Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) and 15 others.  </P> <P> "The weather diverted us a lot today because the low visibility and high  terrain makes it very dangerous flying."  </P> <P> Matwick smiled wanly and said, "They've been long days."  </P> <P> The largest deployment so far of U.S. and Ethiopian aircraft failed Saturday to  turn up any trace of the missing plane, a two-engine Twin Otter, which vanished  Monday. Leland, 44, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, eight  other Americans and seven Ethiopians were en route from Addis Ababa to a camp  for Sudanese refugees at Fugnido, about 320 miles west of the capital near the  Sudanese border.  </P> <P> For the first time the search was joined by four American MH-60 Blackhawk  helicopters, which can better survey heavily forested areas than C-130  airplanes like Matwick's. The MH-60 helicopters can be refueled in midair; the  four craft were each refueled three times Saturday during their search.  </P> <P> The four copters and two C-130s are part of an armada of 18 aircraft, including  12 Ethiopian planes and helicopters, that in the last five days have scanned a  100,000-square-mile area, a region about the size of Wyoming.  </P> <P> Authorities said some of the Ethiopian aircraft concentrated on a triangular  area between the towns of Gambela and Dembi Dolo, west of Addis Ababa and near  the Sudanese border, because of reports that peasants had reported hearing a  plane Monday night.  </P> <P> An American plane also searched an area north of the capital where a U.S. U-2  spy plane sighted a plume of smoke during an overflight Thursday. But the smoke  appeared to have originated from a settlement bonfire.  </P> <P> As participants in the search were displaying increasing frustration and  pessimism at their inability to spot the Leland plane, signs emerged that the  joint U.S. and Ethiopian rescue mission might mark a watershed in what had been  deteriorating relations between the two countries for 10 years.  </P> <P> "I can't see how this close cooperation cannot but affect the attitudes of  people, both critics and supporters, toward closeness with Ethiopia," said  Robert Houdek, charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy. "I'm very heartened by  it."  </P> <P> The Ethiopian government, American sources said, has made available all  equipment, personnel and facilities requested by the United States, even to the  point of rearranging its own flight schedules and airport arrangements in Addis  Ababa to make room for the American air fleet.  </P> <P> There has been no formal arrangement so far, Houdek said, for the United States  to reimburse the Ethiopians for the considerable expense of their part of the  search or to provide badly needed spare parts or technical assistance to the  country's armed forces.  </P> <P> As it happens, the search mission comes at a time when Ethiopian President  Mengistu Haile Mariam is expressing a desire for closer relations with  Washington.  </P> <P> These relations soured during President Jimmy Carter's Administration, when  Mengistu was apparently irked at Washington's refusal to provide better  military assistance during his desert war with neighboring Somalia.  </P> <P> In the intervening years, Ethiopia became the closest thing in Africa to a  client state of the Soviet Union, whose willingness to provide the help that  the United States refused is reflected in a monumental statue of Lenin that  dominates one of Addis Ababa's most striking downtown boulevards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soviet Aid Dries Up  </P> <P> More recently, however, the Soviets have been resisting Mengistu's pleas for  more military aid, which has been drained away in the government's long and  inconclusive war with rebels in the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, American officials here Saturday again rejected earlier complaints  -- from Leland's Washington staff and two congressional colleagues who arrived  here Friday -- that the U.S. response to the congressman's disappearance had  been tardy and inadequate.  </P> <P> Col. Joseph De Minico, a commander of search operations who arrived here  Saturday to take over management of the mission, called the deployment of  American men and equipment "unprecedented."  </P> <P> "To move in this many military assets in this short a time is just  extraordinary," he said. "I think what we're doing here is just right."  </P></p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Anglia TV ahead as share of advertising revenue rises ANGLIA Television increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 14.55m for 1992 but held the dividend at 9.26p with an unchanged final of 6.4p. Profits for the previous 14 months were Pounds 8.38m. Turnover amounted to Pounds 140m (Pounds 153m) with advertising revenue at Pounds 113m (Pounds 127m) and programme sales at Pounds 23m (Pounds 22m). The results were reported under accounting standard FRS 3 with figures for the preceding 14 months restated. Anglia cut expenditure on acquiring programmes in 1992 to Pounds 37.24m (Pounds 40.87m). Operating profits were Pounds 12.41m (Pounds 4m). Sir Peter Gibbings, chairman, drew attention to Anglia's increased share of the commercial television network's net advertising revenue, which at 7 per cent in 1992 was 0.3 per cent improved on 1991, the ninth consecutive year of increased share. Anglia ended 1992 with a strong balance sheet, including Pounds 26.46m cash. However, the group was cautious as to the immediate outlook; cuts of 25 per cent in real terms have been made in operating costs since 1990 with staff levels now at 593 against 800 in 1990. In the light of its greater share of net advertising revenue, analysts are revising upwards their forecast pre-tax profits for 1993, to about Pounds 5.5m.</p>

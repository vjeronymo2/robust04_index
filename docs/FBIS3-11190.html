			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Febrerista Revolutionary Party [PRF], which  hosted the visit of North Korean Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin to the  country, has released a communique expressing its solidarity  with the North Korean desire for unity. The communique asks the  national government to maintain diplomatic or commercial  relations with this socialist country.    "Our party had the honor of hosting a delegation from the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The delegation was headed  by Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin and other North Korean Social  Democratic Party members. The visit's purpose was to seek the  opening of official relations with our government and counteract  the biased disinformation and slander campaign against the DPRK  that is disseminated by powers with world hegemonic interests in  the region and that does not allow Korean brothers to seek their  own solutions to their differences," the PRF communique says.    The communique adds that the delegation, accompanied by PRF  politicians, fulfilled an agenda that included meetings with  national government authorities and leaders of political  parties, social movements, entrepreneurs, and industry.    The communique says the DPRK has made a 10-point proposal  for  Korea's reunification leading to the creation of a federative  state encompassing north and south. The proposal says the new  state will be established on the basis of mutual recognition and  reciprocal tolerance of existing ideologies and regimes, with a  unified national government where both states would have equal  participation and similar prerogatives and obligations.    The communique says the Korean people are a homogeneous  nation whose people lived in the same territory sharing their  blood and cultural links for five millennia. The note says that  ideological and administrative differences cannot be obstacles  to peaceful coexistence.    "The PRF, as is well stated in its political ideology, is  loyal to the principle of internationalism, the brotherhood of  peoples, and their right to self-determination. This means that  from the PRF's viewpoint, the national government must build  links with all nations in the world within the framework of  mutual respect. Peaceful coexistence feeds on these principles  and relations between peoples must be funneled through cultural,  technical, and commercial relations with due respect for each  nation's idiosyncrasies," the PRF document stresses.    We must recall that the Korean vice president and his  entourage were not received by his Paraguayan counterpart, Angel  Roberto Seifart. Vice Presidential Secretary General Victor Hugo  Pena said the request for a meeting with Seifart was made in  Seifart's capacity as vice president at a time he was acting  president because of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's absence  from the country. Another source said, however, that the meeting  did not materialize because our country does not maintain  diplomatic relations with the DPRK.</p>

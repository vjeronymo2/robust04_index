			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Cigna stays in the black despite hurricane losses CIGNA, one of the biggest composite insurers in the US, yesterday unveiled a large drop in third-quarter earnings, but was profitable despite heavy losses from Hurricane Andrew which ravaged southern Florida and Louisiana in August. Cigna said after-tax profits for the three months to end-September totalled Dollars 55m, down from Dollars 123m a year ago, with realised investment gains contributing Dollars 52m (Dollars 10m). The third-quarter results reflected catastrophe losses of Dollars 139m, before tax, of which Dollars 131m came from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. In the same three months of 1991, Cigna's catastrophe losses were Dollars 17m. As a result of these losses, Cigna's property-casualty division produced a Dollars 270m deficit for the quarter, despite after-tax investment gains of Dollars 29m against a Dollars 5m profit, including after-tax investment gains of Dollars 7m, in the same period in 1991. However, the company added that its other three divisions had 'strong' earnings in the third quarter, and  - although some analysts had predicted that realised investment gains would keep the company in the black despite the hurricane losses  - the shares gained Dollars 1 1/8 yesterday at Dollars 52 1/2 . Cigna is now showing after-tax profits of Dollars 286m for the first nine months of the year, including realised investment gains of Dollars 122m. At the same stage in 1991, the figure was Dollars 341m, helped by realised investment gains of Dollars 51m.</p>

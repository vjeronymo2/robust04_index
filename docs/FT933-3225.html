			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Murdoch shelves shoppers' discounts MR RUPERT Murdoch's News International has suspended publication of its Shoppers' Friend newspaper insert after only one issue. Shoppers' Friend was a free-standing insert containing only discount coupons for supermarket products. It was paid for by advertising. Such coupon booklets are big business in the US, and News International decided 18 months ago to introduce the concept into the UK. The company yesterday blamed the recession and difficulties over redeeming the coupons. Meanwhile in the US, Mr Murdoch's News America publishing subsidiary is being sued by Sullivan Marketing, the coupon insert subsidiary of Sullivan Communications. The company alleges that News America and Valassis Communications, which is 49 per cent controlled by Consolidated Press Holdings of Australia, have indulged in 'improper and anti-competitive business practices'. Sullivan says News America and Valassis control more than 90 per cent of the Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 842m) US coupon-insert market. News America declined to comment yesterday on the anti-trust suit.</p>

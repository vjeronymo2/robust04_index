			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Treasury boost for privatised rail network: Government cuts its target rate of return to attract investment The UK government has cut the rate of return it wants from its investment in Railtrack, which will run the country's rail infrastructure from April. The move is intended to boost interest from potential private operators. After heavy lobbying from the Department of Transport, the Treasury has agreed to set Railtrack's initial rate of return at 5 per cent in 1994-95, rising by 1 percentage point a year until it reaches 8 per cent. Under the government's rail privatisation proposals franchises to operate parts of the network will be put out to tender. Successful franchise-holders will then be charged by Railtrack for using the track. Railtrack had argued that a lower rate of return would enable it to set lower charges. This would encourage more private operators and BR management buy-outs to bid. The Treasury previously insisted on an 8 per cent rate of return from its investment. Its decision to compromise on the issue is seen in Whitehall as a reflection of the government's determination to ensure that rail privatisation succeeds. Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, had argued strongly that he should have greater freedom from the financial limits that apply to nationalised industries. The Department of Transport, which has been keen for Railtrack to announce its pricing structure as soon as possible, is confident that the company will disclose details by the middle of this month. The Treasury, however, has refused to accept a downward revaluation of Railtrack's assets which would enable the company to set even lower prices for the use of its track. The Treasury believes that on a replacement cost basis the track is worth about Pounds 7bn. It also argues that higher prices for private operators to use rail lines would be offset by government subsidies. Possible private sector train operators have warned that if charges are too high they will be unable to offer a competitive service. Many fear subsidies could be clawed back in future by the Treasury. The transport department was also sympathetic to the view that some of Railtrack's lines are so dilapidated that they represent a liability rather than an asset. Nonetheless, the Treasury decision on Railtrack is worth hundreds of millions of pounds. On a Pounds 7bn asset base, Railtrack would only have to earn Pounds 350m on a 5 per cent rate of return compared with Pounds 560m on 8 per cent. Some potential private rail operators welcomed the Treasury move although they were concerned that an eventual 8 per cent rate of return could push up fares over the next four years. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Sport: Into the future on the cutting edge - Skiing WILL YOU still be skiing in the year 2010? We are all getting older, but demographic research indicates that by the first decade of the 21st century the majority of the skiing population will be 'over the hill'. Statistics compiled by the United Ski Industries Association indicate that while most skiers are currently between 25 and 34, by 2010 the largest group will be veterans between 45 and 55. No one knows whether the hordes of young snowboarders will make the transition to two skis, or give up winter sports altogether. These veteran skiers will be fitter, and better off financially. Furthermore, the end of the cold war will allow winter resort development to spread to huge areas previously untracked. Already, helicopter skiing in former Soviet republics is drawing rave reviews. Even so, growth in the ski industry is predicted to continue at its current glacial pace. Global warming, recession and even the ecological backlash have all helped slow the schuss which began in the 1960s, when the masses were introduced to package skiing. In the past few years ski and boot manufacturers have suffered enormous losses. Sales of skis in Britain are running at less than half their peak in the 1980s. The travel market has responded with unheard of bargains and price breakthroughs. Ski the American Dream recently advertised a full week of skiing in California, with non-stop flights and unlimited mileage car, for less than Pounds 400. Skis will continue to evolve in materials and design towards the perfect carved turn, initiated by the skiier simply pressing a foot down flat on to the ski. Bumps and bunions will be eased by foam and silicon injected ski boots as comfortable as carpet slippers. Skis and boots are already 'inter active' in the new Marker Selective Control binding, which can be adjusted for varying snow conditions. Electronic bindings are expected on the market within five years. Gizmos have always attracted skiers. Gadgets such as the Ortovox electronic 'mouse' which allow one to home in on a ski buried in powder snow should not distract attention from the single most important development in skiing, the parity between comfort and performance. Skiing gear, both hardware and clothing, is becoming so non-intrusive that you hardly knows it is there. Yet the ordinary skier is able to float through deep powder (on the new Atomic wide body skis) or carve rails through sheet ice (on a slalom ski such as the Volkl P10) with more authority and security than an Olympic champion of any previous generation. Once they have been let loose in thigh high powder snow, skiers are reluctant to return to the piste. Skiing is splitting into fringe disciplines. Surf and telemark are the most visible trends. The future is in adventure skiing: off piste excursions, ski safaris, snowcat and helicopter skiing. Good skiers are abandoning groomed and crowded pistes for transalpine ski safaris, which offer more varied and extensive skiing in a week than many resort skiers experience in a lifetime. Wilderness skiing by snowcat or helicopter allows the committed skier, for whom time is more scarce than money, into the kind of untracked, heady snow which is available in resorts only once or twice a season. Ecological awareness has encouraged more skiers to invade the wilderness, seeking the 'natural' experience of snow structures untouched by piste machines and far from the irritating crowds. But it has also brought moves to curtail unrestricted off piste skiing in the Alps. The future for such 'free' skiing is in Canada, where authorities still welcome development of resorts and helicopter operations, and in previously unexploited terrain from Kashmir to the Caucauses.</p>

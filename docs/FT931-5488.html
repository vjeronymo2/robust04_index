			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House opens Hong Kong office HONGKONG LAND'S growing influence over Trafalgar House has been underlined with the disclosure that the UK-based construction and engineering group is to open a corporate office in Hong Kong. It will be run by Mr John Fletcher, a senior director who has been involved in most of the group's projects over the past decade. He will continue as managing director of Trafalgar House Corporate Development, with worldwide responsibility for group deals. However, one of Trafalgar's financial advisers said the decision to send Mr Fletcher to Hong Kong showed that it had accepted the need to work 'much more closely' with Hongkong Land. Trafalgar's engineering and construction contracts in the Far East are valued at Pounds 1bn.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY SAYS HE'D LOVE TO BE IN L.A.  </P> <P> New York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry, who declared his free agency  earlier this week, told a Los Angeles sportscaster that the Dodgers are No. 1  on his shopping list for a new contract.  </P> <P> "If the Dodgers are really, really, really interested in me, I'll be here,"  Strawberry said Tuesday in an interview with KABC.  </P> <P> "That would be my No. 1 choice. I'm very determined to play here at home and if  things can work out between myself and my agent and the Los Angeles Dodgers, I  would love to be here at home and play. I mean, that's a dream that you always  think about."  </P> <P> Strawberry, a native of Los Angeles, is reportedly seeking a contract similar  to the five-year, $23.5-million deal that Jose Canseco signed with the Oakland  Athletics last summer.  </P> <P> Until Nov. 5, the Mets are the only team permitted to talk money with  Strawberry, who led New York with 37 home runs and 108 runs batted in last  season.  </P> <P> Fred Claire, vice president and general manager of the Dodgers, has said the  Dodgers would be interested in Strawberry.  </P></p>

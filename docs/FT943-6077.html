			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / South African inflation rate rises to 8.2% South Africa released worse-than-expected inflation figures yesterday, pushing bond yields past the psychological barrier of 17 per cent, and putting pressure on the government's ability to keep its annual deficit at the budgeted level of 6.4 per cent. The Consumer Price Index for July rose at an annualised rate of 8.2 per cent, up from 7.5 per cent in June and a full percentage point above the 21-year low reached in April of 7.1 per cent. In response, rates on the government's benchmark R150 bond rose to 17.05 per cent yesterday, before dropping back to finish the day at 16.76 per cent. Bond yields, which hit a low of 11.6 per cent in January, have been rising steadily since the April elections and have soared over the past few weeks, fuelled largely by fears of higher inflation and a lack of faith in government promises of fiscal restraint. Economists say the recent rise in the bond market could add between R1bn and R1.5bn (Dollars 280m-Dollars 420m) to the government's interest bill, which already accounts for some 17 per cent of the budget. Also contributing to the bear market is continuing uncertainty over the future of South Africa's two-tier currency. Government and monetary officials are committed to scrapping the financial rand investment currency, a move almost certain to send short-term interest rates rocketing, but have given no timetable for the move. Thus, the currency and bond markets are prey to continued activity by speculators trying to second-guess the financial authorities. In recent days, fears over the state of President Mandela's health and worries that South Africa's international credit rating, soon to be announced by the major agencies, will be lower than the anticipated BBB have also contributed to the run. An estimated 25,000 workers in the car-making industry, taking part in the longest and costliest stoppage since President Mandela came to power in May, rejected the employers' revised pay offer of 10.5 per cent, their union leader announced yesterday. By the end of last week, the strike by the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa had cost the industry more than R2.2bn in turnover, an official of the Automobile Manufacturers Employers' Organisation said.</p>

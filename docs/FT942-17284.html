			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / DTI closes chapter for ticket agents Theatre-goers will have no difficulty getting into the musical Phantom of the Opera in London's West End this Friday - provided they are prepared to pay between Pounds 50 and Pounds 85 for a ticket that might have cost Pounds 14 to Pounds 30 at the box office. The London shops that sell tickets for theatres and sporting events say they are simply helping to meet excessive demand for the capital's popular events at free-market prices. The Department of Trade and Industry disagrees, and yesterday published draft regulations that will require those ticket resellers to make clear to buyers not only what the original price was, but also whether they might end up sitting behind a pillar. Lord Strathclyde, consumer affairs minister, said: 'People are outraged when they pay high prices for what they think are good-quality tickets, only to discover later that their face value is much lower.' The proposed regulations will require agents to tell buyers all information printed on the ticket, including details on restricted viewing. When buyers make their purchases in the shop, agents must give them this information either in writing or by showing them the ticket. The department said this must be done 'in a manner which enables the buyer to read the details clearly; information given orally will have to be given in a manner that is comprehensible (as well as audible)'. Yesterday's draft regulations, which will be enforced by trading standards officers, are the department's second set. The first version was issued last July. The new draft includes tickets sold as part of travel packages. Mr Tony Anderson, managing director of All Tickets, a West End agency, said he was happy with the new regulations. 'No problem at all. We always tell people where they stand. It's understandable if people don't want to pay over the odds for a ticket. If people do, the reason they are paying a premium is the show is sold out. We're ticket brokers. It's a bit like the stock exchange.' A later call to All Tickets yielded an offer of a Pounds 50 Phantom ticket for Friday night. No mention was made of the face value. When this was requested, a figure of Pounds 14 was cheerfully provided. Ms Susan Whiddington, development officer of the Society of London Theatre, said her organisation received four or five complaints a week from disgruntled purchasers of agency tickets. Ms Whiddington said: 'We've been lobbying the government for years about the problems this has created for our industry. This will give us some legal clout for the first time.'

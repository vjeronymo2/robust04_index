			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Fed chief refuses to rule out US rate cuts THE Federal Reserve has not ruled out further cuts in interest rates before the US presidential election on November 3, according to Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. In a rare press conference, Mr Greenspan said election-year politics would not prevent another easing of rates if this were needed on economic grounds. 'Obviously, if further actions are needed, the Fed will do so,' he said. 'If not, not.' Mr Greenspan said it would be 'irresponsible' for the Fed to 'abstain from actions largely or solely because there is an election and campaign under way'. His remarks seemed intended to reassure financial markets, which ended last week in an apprehensive mood after a widely expected cut in short-term rates failed to materialise. On Friday the Dow Jones index fell almost 40 points to close at its lowest level this year. The yield on 30-year bonds rose above 7.5 per cent for the first time in several weeks. Markets had expected the Fed to act after a string of weak economic figures  -including fresh falls in employment - seemed to indicate the fragile US recovery was again losing momentum. On Friday markets were further unsettled by a Financial Times report indicating the Fed probably would not cut rates again before the election because evidence of a slowdown was, according to a senior Fed official, 'inconclusive'. After a weekend meeting of top US executives at Hot Springs, Virginia, Mr Greenspan said he was concerned by the sluggish economy. 'It's clear we still have growth but it's also clear it's not accelerating at this stage.' However, he left his interest rate options open by referring to an 'incredible degree of uncertainty' about the economic outlook. The Fed was watching closely to see whether consumers and businesses would spend more freely after a lengthy period paying off debts. Just-published minutes of an August 18 meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC), the top policy-making body, show that a majority of the committee favoured giving Mr Greenspan discretion to cut short-term rates by up to half a point. However, Mr John LeWare, a governor, and Mr Thomas Melzer, president of the St Louis Fed, both opposed a bias towards further easing of monetary policy. Mr Greenspan opted for a quarter point cut to 3 per cent on September 4. The minutes show that the Fed expected the economy to expand at a 'subdued rate'. Minutes from last Tuesday's FOMC meeting will not be released for six weeks. If the Fed does opt to cut interest rates again it is likely to lower the discount rate by half a point to 2.5 per cent. This would be accompanied by a quarter or half point cut in the federal funds rate - the cost of overnight money for banks.</p>

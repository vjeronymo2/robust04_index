			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYRACUSE RUNS OVER CAL STATE LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THIRD-RANKED ORANGEMEN MAKE AMENDS FOR UNIMPRESSIVE VICTORY  OVER CANISIUS BY PICKING ON THE 49ERS, 94-79.  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  </P> <P> Syracuse, out to make a good impression after a lackluster performance against  Canisius on Wednesday, dashed to a 19-6 lead and built a 32-point bulge in the  second half Saturday night before settling for a 94-79 victory.  </P> <P> "We came out a little lackadaisical against Canisius," said freshman Scott  McCorkle, who came off the bench to join five other players in double figures  for No. 3 Syracuse.  </P> <P> "In this game, we had a little more intensity. We wanted it a little more  tonight," he said.  </P> <P> "It's always a concern, to get out early," said junior forward Dave Johnson,  who had 12 points. "Tonight, we just came out with the right mental attitude  and we just got after them."  </P> <P> Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim noticed the difference in his team, which he  criticized after Wednesday's 92-83 victory.  </P> <P> "It was a good game for us coming off that last game," Boeheim said. "We were  active on defense, we got our hands on a lot of loose balls and moved the ball  offensively."  </P> <P> Syracuse (9-0), which built a 55-35 halftime lead, left no doubt about the  outcome as it held the 49ers to 14 points in the first 11 1/2 minutes of the  second half while pushing its lead to 81-49.  </P> <P> Long Beach (2-5), led by Lucious Harris' 24 points, made the final score closer  with a 22-6 run against reserves.  </P> <P> Billy Owens finished with 19 points for Syracuse, even though he did not play  in the final 9 1/2 minutes. Center LeRon Ellis had 17 and McCorkle a  career-high 14 points coming off the bench.  </P> <P> Syracuse, which outscored its opponents by 99 points in the opening half of its  first eight games, used an aggressive all-court defense to force the 49ers into  19 turnovers in the first 20 minutes.  </P> <P> The Orangemen led, 9-6, before scoring off 10 consecutive points, and Johnson's  breakaway reverse slam with 12:40 left gave Syracuse a 25-11 cushion.  </P> <P> Syracuse scored 13 of the next 16 points for a 34-14 lead midway through the  half, but the 49ers went on a 9-1 run to shave the deficit to 35-23 with 7:31  left.  </P> <P> Syracuse got only one point from three one-and-one free-throw situations during  a nearly four-minute cold spell from the field.  </P> <P> Troy Joseph's free throw with 4:47 to play made it 42-30, but the Orangemen  closed the half with a 13-5 burst for a 55-35 lead.  </P></p>

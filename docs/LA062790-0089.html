			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-JAPAN TRADE TALKS MAKE PROGRESS, GO INTO EXTRA DAY  </P> <P> U.S. and Japanese officials began an unscheduled third day of talks today in  hopes of completing a final report on the results of yearlong negotiations  aimed at removing trade barriers.  </P> <P> Officials on both sides could not say when they might finish with the so-called  Structural Impediments Initiative, which President Bush has made the  centerpiece of his economic policy toward Japan.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to say whether we will finish these talks" today, one U.S.  official said. "We could finish while we are here in Tokyo, or we could finish  later next week."  </P> <P> Only 24 hours earlier, a U.S. official had said the sides were "not far apart."  But on Sunday, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills was quoted as  saying in Washington that another round of negotiations might be needed.  </P> <P> A member of the U.S. delegation here appeared to discount this possibility. He  cited as areas of "good progress" Japan's promise to untangle its complicated  goods-distribution system -- a key U.S. demand -- and a U.S. promise to reduce  its budget deficit, something on which the Japanese have insisted.  </P> <P> Differences remain on a U.S. demand for more Japanese public works spending and  on how the sides will fulfill reform promises.  </P> <P> Discussions that began at 9 a.m. Tuesday and continued into the night focused  on Japan's call for a reduction in the U.S. budget deficit. The Americans  responded, one official said, by explaining that Bush plans to use a surplus in  Social Security funds to lower the deficit and will try to revise the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to require budget surpluses after 1993.  </P> <P> The United States, he said, will stand by a pledge that it made in an April  interim report to eliminate its budget deficit by 1993.  </P></p>

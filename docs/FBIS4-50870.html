			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Export orders received by  Taiwan manufacturers amounted to U.S.$7.8 billion in April, up  9.03 percent from the year-earlier level, the Ministry of  Economic Affairs reported Saturday [21 May].    But, compared with March, export orders declined by U.S.$11  million, the ministry said.    Orders for telecommunications and information processing  equipment, metal products and textiles increased in April, but  purchase contracts for plastic and rubber products, electric  appliances and transport equipment dropped.    Hong Kong remained the largest source of export orders, up  12.74 percent from March. Compared with last April, orders from  the British colony, a conduit for indirect Taiwan-Mainland China  trade rose 39.55 percent.    Export orders from the United States and Japan increased 7.5  percent and 3.67 percent, respectively, from the year-earlier  levels.    Aggregate export orders placed with local manufacturers  amounted to U.S.$29.09 billion in the first four months of this  year, up 4.43 percent from the year before.    Economics Ministry officials said Taiwan's exports will  gradually regain momentum in the coming months, judging from  steady growth in export orders.    Exports grew a modest 2.3 percent in the January-April  period, far lower than the originally targeted 7 percent growth.  The lackluster export growth has prompted the government to  adjust this year's economic growth target downward to 5.94  percent from the previously-set 6.17 percent.    The officials attributed the slow export growth mainly to a  rapid shrinking of labor-intensive industries here. For  example, furniture, textile and footwear exports registered  substantial declines during the four-month period.    The officials noted that as Taiwan has lost its competitive  edge in such labor-intensive industries, the country should  accelerate its development of capital and technology-intensive  industries in order to maintain its niches in the world market.</p>

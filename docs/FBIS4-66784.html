			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Talbott Visit"] </F>   [Text] Little or nothing has changed in the relations  between India and America as a result of the visit by the U.S.  deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott. Both sides seem to  have gone through a routine exchange of their respective  positions without conceding any ground. While Mr Talbott  reiterated the Clinton administration's view that the supply of  military equipment, including F-16 fighters, will assist the  verifiable capping of the production of highly-enriched uranium  for making nuclear weapons in Pakistan, India has refused to  endorse the deal and expressed concern over the move to supply  the weaponry. Given the history of distrust between India and  Pakistan and, for the matter, between India and the United  States it was difficult for India to accept what it sees as a  step that will boost Pakistan's military strength at a time when  the latter is in a particularly belligerent mood. The American  side argues, perhaps somewhat tendentiously, that the supply of  military equipment will not affect the India-Pakistan military  balance, but New Delhi obviously thinks otherwise. Indian and  Pakistani forces are currently evenly matched if there is a  short, sharp conflict. But the addition of 38 fourth generation  fighters along with 3C Orion maritime reconnaissance and strike  aircraft is liable to tilt the balance against India.    Contrary to expectations, the American visitor did not bring  any package of "suggestions" on the nuclear non-proliferation  issue for India. This may have been due to the awareness that  the issue just does not fit into the U.S.-Pakistan matrix and  requires to be addressed separately. It is possible that  Washington may have decided that the complex South Asian scene  has to be untangled gradually and has decided to devote the  first part of its efforts to Pakistan. It has to be remembered  in this context that it was American forbearance that resulted  in Islamabad not only acquiring the bomb but also the delivery  systems in the form of the first batch of F-16s. In any case  there are far too many imponderables relating to Washington's  new initiative in South Asia, the attitudes of Pakistan and  China being the most obvious, to come to any immediate  conclusion about future prospects. Mr Talbott cannot but be  aware that in its first year, the Clinton administration had not  only ignored South Asia, but through statements of the President  and some of his officials unnecessarily soured the relationship  between New Delhi and Washington to an extent not seen recently.  Insofar as it sought to make amends, the visit was useful, as  were the nuances suggesting that America might be willing to  deal with India as India, and not as a function of its  relationship with Pakistan. But he should not be surprised if he  detected a note of scepticism in Indian responses.</p>

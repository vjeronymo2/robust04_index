Kramer, Acting District Ranger, Superior Ranger District, Box 460, Superior, MT, 59872. He will decide on this proposal after considering comments and responses, environmental consequences discussed in the Final EIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and reasons for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Forest Service proposes to harvest about 24.3 million board feet of timber from about 2,600 acres (about 2,200 of those acres to be burned after harvest), prescribed-burn about 400 additional acres for ecosystem and big game habitat improvements, reconstruct about 19.4 miles of road (primarily to mitigate existing water quality/fish impacts), and add new yearlong road closures to about 21.3 miles of currently open roads. New road construction would be limited to 0.4 miles of temporary road plus 0.2 miles of permanent road for helicopter landings. The proposed action also includes some experimental treatment of areas containing small portions of larger populations of an orchid ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cypripedium fasciculatum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) listed as a sensitive species by the USDA Forest Service Northern Region. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lands affected are within the Two Mile Creek and Little Joe Creek drainages, tributary to the St. Regis River, immediately southwest of the town of St. Regis, Montana. The project area is bounded by the Montana-Idaho state line to the south and west, and Interstate 90 to the north. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this proposal is to carry out the goals and direction given in the Lolo National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan with ecosystem management principles. Key elements of the purpose and need are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _maintain or enhance ecosystem health and productivity by manipulating vegetation (timber cutting and underburning) to increase age, structure, and composition diversity of biotic communities, by maintaining ecological disturbance processes in this fire-dominated ecosystem, and by removing some insect-infested, diseased, or high-risk trees from sites allocated by the forest plan to timber management; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _reduce existing sediment impacts to water and fish resources caused by existing roads; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _improve and maintain big game winter range and elk security conditions which are declining with current plant succession trends and existing open road access; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _contribute to short-term output goals and long-term forest plan expectations for timber production; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _conduct some experimental treatments to learn about  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Cypripedium fasciculatum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 's habitat requirements and tolerance for environmental disturbance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The decision to be made is to what extent, if at all, the Forest Service should conduct timber harvest, prescribed burning, road construction or reconstruction, and road closures in the Two mile and Little Joe drainages, given the above purpose and need. This is a site-specific project decision,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a general management plan nor a programmatic analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public scoping has been conducted on most elements of this proposal under earlier proposals called Tujo-Recoyle and Sunset timber sales. This proposed action is a refinement of those proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While quite a number of issues have been identified for environmental effects analysis, the following issues are the ones which so far have been found significant enough to guide alternative development and provide focus for the EIS: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Timber harvest methods, primarily opposition to clearcutting and other forms of even-age management and concern over the size and extent of harvest openings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Road-related effects, including sediment production, fish habitat impacts, wildlife disturbance, and recreation opportunities (some people feel the area has too many roads or that too many roads are open during hunting season, while others are opposed to additional road closures because they limit some forms of recreation and forest use). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Water quality and fish habitat are affected by existing roads and the proposed actions may have both beneficial and adverse effects on these resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Elk security and big game winter range quality are declining due to existing open roads, harvest openings and plant succession trends, and the proposed actions could have both beneficial and adverse effects on these issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Cypripedium fasciculatum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  may be regionally rare but large numbers are found in this vicinity. Ecologists view this as an opportunity to begin learning more about this plant's habitat needs and response to disturbances as an aid in developing conservation guidelines for the plant while others believe that the plant should be protected from all management-caused disturbances. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the proposed action, a range of alternatives will be developed in response to issues identified during scoping. Other alternatives planned for detailed study are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _no action; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _no even-aged timber harvest and more road closures for increased elk security; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _the proposed action except no new road closures; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _watershed rehabilitation but no timber harvest in the Little Joe drainage and no experimental treatment of sensitive plants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public participation is important to the analysis. People may visit with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. No formal scoping meetings are planned. However, two periods are specifically designated for comments on the analysis: (1) during this scoping process and (2) during the draft EIS comment period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the scoping process, the Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. A scoping document will be prepared and mailed to parties known to be interested in the proposed action. The agency invites written comments and suggestions on this action, particularly in terms of issues and alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service will continue to involve the public and will inform interested and affected parties as to how they may participate and contribute to the final decision. Another formal opportunity for response will be provided following completion of a draft EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft EIS should be available for review in January, 1995. The final EIS is scheduled for completion in June, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the notice of availability in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Fashion: The up-and-coming get down-to-earth - A reputation for bags of talent - but an attitude problem. Avril Groom reports on the growing pains of Britain's young designers Young British designers have bags of talent and the whole fashion world acknowledges it. Some also have what is known as 'attitude'. The combination of creative over-confidence and a cavalier approach to production and deliveries, in an industry notoriously run on a shoestring, was for years the despair of backers and store buyers. One wealthy businessman who invested in British designers during the 1980s will no longer touch them, preferring to spend his money on established foreign names who deliver wearer-friendly clothes when they promise them. Perhaps it is time for him, and others of his ilk, to look again at British talent. Hard economic realities have created a new attitude of down-to-earth discipline among the up-and-coming. Some have set out with a rigorous, professional approach while others have learnt by bitter experience. All know that the days when a student designer could sell an outrageous graduate collection straight off the college catwalk and not worry about details such as production schedules are long gone. The best deserve an ovation for achieving a near-miracle. They are producing serious, well-made clothes with enough wit and originality to attract the sophisticated woman with a deep pocket, even when her eye is jaded by an overcrowded design market. And despite tight cash-flows, they deliver on time and up to quality. None of them finds it easy. Listening to their stories, one wonders what would possess anyone to start a fashion design business in Britain today. Presumably the creative drive and the lure of fame or distant fortune are strong. And there are interim rewards. Sonnentag Mulligan and Paul Frith have gone, in four seasons, from young unknowns to seeing their names in lights at top London stores - Liberty, Harvey Nichols and Way In at Harrods have been particularly supportive. Liberty sometimes helps designers offset the cost of a first collection by paying for the fabric. Owen Gaster's first full collection so caught the imagination of Japanese buyers that its proceeds have financed the next one. Other young designers, however, suffer from problems and prejudices. Provincial British shops are still made nervous by comments such as the one from a New York buyer who recently declared that she had twice ordered from a talented British designer, but had not received a single piece. Prejudices rub off on some designers who ill-deserve it. Often they are expected to be late and ill-organised because some of their contemporaries still believe that showing in a seedy, inaccessible corner of London in the middle of the night is a smart way to display their creative power. The only way designers can show that they are now grown up and have given up such follies is by cleaning up their acts. Sonnentag Mulligan and Paul Frith both had their autumn deliveries into stores by mid-August, well before they were needed. Nicholas Knightly's spring show of soft, perfectly-executed jersey dresses, fine wool Guernsey sweaters and pale striped cotton pyjamas was in a sensible central London location and started well on time - a statement of intent after several erratic seasons. Designers are rarely business brains as well, and finding the necessary adviser is difficult. Getting financial backing is even harder and cash-flow problems are endemic - the time-lag between investment and payment is often longer than the stores would countenance. Some new designers find ways to counteract this. Clinton Silver, chairman of the British Fashion Council is busy arranging 'marriages' between designers and companies. This is not, he says, to 'control the designer's business' but to 'help give them more exposure and also the benefits of experience. In return, the designer's consultancy input can raise the manufacturer's fashion profile and thus contribute to improving design standards in the high street.' Barbara Sonnentag and Tracey Mulligan's arrangement with the Stirling Group, a Marks and Spencer supplier, resulted in their recent first solo show, which, with vibrant colours, innovative fabric mixes and sharply glamorous shapes was one of the toasts of London Fashion week. 'We now feel confident in developing a bolder, slightly younger direction,' says Barbara. They are not forsaking the high-quality, wearable tailoring on which their reputation has been built, however, 'because we have to compete with a lot of better-known names'. The quality of their understated, slimly-cut autumn suits in mixes of matt and slightly shiny neutrals is remarkable considering they are their company's only full-time employees. Nicholas Knightly says he keeps the small factories he uses happy 'by trying to be a good customer' - unexpected for a young man who graduated in 1991 with prodigious talent and an ego to match. His first collection, of white shirts and denim, was bought by Harvey Nichols. But he had little business experience and false starts and broken contracts followed. His talent for feminine, flattering cutting has brought consultancies from commercial companies, one of which now keeps him and his full-time assistant 'on the straight and narrow'. A small autumn collection of favourite shirts  -the deceptively-simple one we show was designed three years ago - and private orders will be followed by full-scale deliveries for spring and he will also design a range for the Stirling Cooper group. Paul Frith has as yet to make such a commercial link but hopes his efficient system will attract an investor. 'My business manager and accountant both have other jobs so most of any investment would go into the company, not overheads,' he says. In a previous life he was a Royal Marine, and the discipline shows. He worked in bars to fund his first collection, he uses plain, classic fabrics  -wool crepe, silk satin and, for spring, cashmere and chiffon  - so supply is not a problem, and he tracks down small factories which can produce the quality finish he demands for his very simple, body-skimming, tastefully sexy shapes. Owen Gaster is a new boy on the block who has only shown two full collections but his attitude is promisingly serious. He sold his graduation collection to finance a tiny private-order business and perfected traditional hand-finished tailoring techniques by studying construction of vintage jackets. Earlier this year he held his first, self-financed, show. It resulted in a Japanese agent who found 15 stockists for his glamorous tailoring which is precision-cut on a dummy rather than sketched 'because bodies aren't flat'. He says he designs for 'mature, elegant women' and demands a suitably high quality from his small factory and out-workers. The lessons which these designers learn as they progress may prove instructive in the future. Gaster has leapt boldly into exporting after finding that 'you cannot survive on British sales because this is such a small market. Real business is done abroad.' Frith disagrees, having learnt that 'a well-run business starts small and takes time'. It will be interesting to review their respective positions in a year. Barbara Sonnentag has learnt the bitter lesson that 'it is very hard to make money in this business' but remains optimistic. Knightly's comments reveal most about the attitude with which young designers start out: 'I've learnt that designing is a job, not a hobby, and now I listen to what my customer wants.' He, it seems, has learnt humility, which in the world of fashion is the most important growing-up lesson.</p>

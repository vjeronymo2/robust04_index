			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Few crumbs of comfort in US corporate pie / Preview of the quarterly reporting season for American companies It will be bad, but the question is just how bad. Wall Street is bracing itself for some nasty shocks as it enters the corporate results season for the first quarter of this year - the period of maximum economic disruption caused by the Gulf crisis. Analysts have been cutting forecasts for sectoral profits since the start of the year as a succession of gloomy profits warnings have emerged from a range of companies. But in many cases they could still be over-optimistic. Certainly, International Business Machines, the world's leading computer manufacturer, took Wall Street completely by surprise last month when it warned its earnings would be about half the consensus forecast, and half the figure it reported in 1990. And last Friday IBM duly unveiled net earnings from operations for the three months of Dollars 500m, half the Dollars 1bn earned in the first quarter of 1990. Analysts say IBM's initial announcement drove home the message that the first quarter would be an exceptionally difficult one for corporate America. It also focused market attention on the negative impact on reported overseas earnings of a stronger dollar. Consensus forecasts by 'bottom up', or sectoral analysts, always tend to seem more optimistic than those of 'top down,' or broad strategic analysts, partly for technical reasons. But Mr Richard Pucci, who tracks forecasting trends for IBES, a research service of brokers Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan, says the gap between the two has been particularly wide for the past few months, although sectoral analysts have been moving down towards their strategic colleagues. But bad profits news from individual companies will not necessarily change overall equity market sentiment since the latest reporting period was distorted by the Gulf crisis and a great deal of bad news has already been discounted by Wall Street. Nevertheless, good or bad company news will clearly move individual stocks, or sectors. Mr Laszlo Birinyi, a Wall Street strategist, notes that the first trickle of better-than-expected results last week - for example from high technology groups Motorola and Intel - produced an enthusiastic response from investors. 'The market is very disposed towards being pleasantly surprised by corporate earnings,' he added. The securities industry is one sector Wall Street is relying upon to spread some sunshine amid the corporate gloom. The big increases in share values, the growth in equity and bond trading volume, and the revival of new stock and bond issuances during the first quarter will have boosted revenues at securities houses across the US. Last week the stock market had a taste of what to expect when J. P. Morgan, the blue-chip bank, reported strong quarterly earnings. To no one's surprise, impressive growth in J. P. Morgan's revenue from securities trading hogged the headlines. Analysts are hoping for more of the same from Wall Street's other big names. In commercial banking, the main focus of attention will be the large New York money centre banks, from a sharp rise in non-performing loans, mainly to the property sector and highly leveraged transactions. Analysts expect many of the banks to report a 10 to 20 per cent increase in non-performing loans during the quarter. Citicorp, the largest bank in the US, has already announced it expected its portfolio of doubtful loans to rise by about Dollars 1bn this quarter - roughly the same as in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Bank of New York, the first big bank to report its results, surprised the market last week when it reported a first-quarter loss because of soured commercial loans. But unlike its rivals, it did not make particularly heavy provisions last year, so its results are not expected to set a trend. The computer industry may show sharp divergences in performance. IBM's poor figures are expected to be mirrored by several fellow manufacturers of mainframe and mini computers. For example, NCR - on the receiving end of a bid from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph - and Amdahl have announced new mainframes but have yet to ship them. And corporate buyers may have been put off heavy investment in mainframes by the Gulf uncertainty and general recession. In contrast, many manufacturers of personal computers and workstations seem to be prospering, despite the economic downturn. For example, Sun Microsystems is expected to report strong earnings increases. The same cannot be said of the motor industry, which is suffering from a deep depression. Each of Detriot's Big Three is expected to report large losses due to lower sales volume and heavy price discounting. Nor are analysts hopeful of them returning to the black in the second quarter. The motor industry's woes will also have a knock-on effect on the steel industry, hit by plunging prices and weak demand. Virtually none of the big six manufacturers is expected to report a first-quarter operating profit, and the outlook for the rest of the year is not much better. For the travel industry, at the forefront of the Gulf crisis' repercussions, the picture is more mixed. Doubtlessly the first quarter will look horrid: two of the big hotel groups, Hilton and Marriott, have already reported profits more than halved, while large airlines like United and American have warned of losses for the first three months of 1991. The interest here, however, centres less on the historic data than on the speed and extent to which business is bouncing back. Any indicators on that front will be keenly noted. The pharmaceuticals sector is expected to be one of the few bright spots. Analysts predict a particularly strong first quarter from Merck. Bristol-Myers, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and Syntex are also expected to post sharp gains. However, results may be muddied by one-time items as companies start to comply with recent changes in accounting for retiree benefits. For the oil industry, strength in Europe and the Far East in refining and marketing should bolster first-quarter earnings. Mr Paul Mlotok, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects the oil majors to see a 15 per cent improvement in earnings on average, with particularly strong performances from Exxon, Chevron and Texaco. Higher crude oil prices in January because of the Gulf war should help production profits. Although the recession has reduced demand for refined products, the impact is not expected to be dramatic. The outlook for the chemical industry, where earnings dropped by about 30 per cent in 1990, remains bleak. Over-capacity at a time of falling demand is the main culprit. Those with the greatest exposure to commodity chemicals, such as Dow Chemical and Union Carbide, are expected to be the hardest hit. While the more diversified companies, such as Monsanto, should see only a modest deterioration in profits. Reporting by Martin Dickson, Patrick Harverson, Nikki Tait and Karen Zagor.</p>

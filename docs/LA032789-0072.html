			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> MUSIC CENTER REVIVES GLORY OF 'OTELLO'  </P> <P> "Otello" is back.  </P> <P> Two-and-a-half years ago, Music Center Opera put its first production on the  Dorothy Chandler Pavilion stage -- an "Otello" directed by Gotz Friedrich,  designed by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen and featuring the fledgling company's  artistic consultant, Placido Domingo, in the title role. Saturday, it revived  that effort.  </P> <P> There are repertory and economy subtexts here, besides a reprise of inaugural  glories, but having such a production in stock already -- and it is just one  among several -- says much for the high aims and accomplishment of the company.  Next month returns "Salome," the widely acclaimed and traveled production also  from Music Center Opera's first season.  </P> <P> "Otello" was not received with quite the same degree of enthusiasm and  admiration as "Salome," and it seems to have changed in ways large and small.  Most important, Jeannette Aster -- Friedrich's associate director for the  original -- has inherited the staging, and gone are any precursory hints of  hysteria in Otello's character.  </P> <P> The Moor, of course, remains susceptible to sudden, larger-than-life emotions.  But he begins as a bona-fide hero.  </P> <P> That suited Domingo well. From his clarion "Esultate!" entrance, he exerted the  easy authority of one used to command, and let the overwhelming feeling of the  Love Duet reveal tenderness and sincerity rather than weakness. He sang freely  and cleanly, supporting both legato lyricism and incoherent mania with  appropriate sound, and made the swift blossoming of Iago's seeds of suspicion  as dramatically credible as possible.  </P> <P> As Iago, Justino Diaz was an equally imposing presence, vocally and  theatrically. The erstwhile bass had little trouble with the range, and proved  as cynically menacing in pianissimo insinuation as in bold incitement or iron  triumph.  </P> <P> In her company debut, Ilona Tokody offered a sweet, sympathetic portrait of  Desdemona. Her warm soprano, though, was occasionally compromised with a slow,  wide vibrato that lent a rather matronly aspect to her vocal characterization.  </P> <P> Conductor John De Main, an early substitute for Lawrence Foster, let the  bolstered Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra participate fully in the drama. He kept  the action alertly paced, and accompanied sensitively while attending to  orchestral, psychological and narrative nuance.  </P> <P> A pity, then, that Aster did not trust Verdi's vivid orchestral Maelstrom to  launch the opera. The curtain rose on the dark and stormy Cyprus night, not to  Verdi's music but to the sounds of apparently a wind-machine and taped surf.  Only after these spuriously realistic cues could the music begin, and it must  be reinforced with more artificial nature.  </P> <P> In general, Aster seemed to emphasize the more realistic and overtly theatrical  elements of Friedrich's staging, rather than its intermittment bows to  stylization and symbolism. Certainly it was the stony realism of  Schneider-Siemssen's looming, ultimately claustrophobic set that was played to,  rather its quirky abstractions.  </P> <P> The chorus, supplied by the Los Angeles Master Chorale, contributed its own  heroics to the storm scene, and made its presence effective in the other massed  scenes with clear, resonant singing. The Los Angeles Children's Chorus sang  prettily, if not in complete coordination, in presenting Desdemona with  flowers.  </P> <P> From the 1986 cast, Jonathan Mack returned as a blandly befuddled, lyrically  ardent Cassio; Alice Baker as a forceful, supportive Emilia; Stephen Plummer as  a light-voiced, suitably ineffectual Roderigo; and Michael Gallup as a bluff  Montano. Louis Lebherz introduced a solid, dignified Lodovico.  </P></p>

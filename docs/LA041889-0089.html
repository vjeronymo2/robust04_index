			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> While celebrations around the world Sunday were noting the 100th anniversary of  the birth of film pioneer Charlie Chaplin, folks in Missouri were marking a  similar anniversary involving a native son. Thomas Hart Benton, the prolific  and provocative painter whose work brought him fame but not wide acceptance by  the art world's elite, received a spirited celebration in his home state. He  remained a Missouri resident until his death in 1975. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

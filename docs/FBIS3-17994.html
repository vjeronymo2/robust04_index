According to the staff of head of state's office, this action  is illegal and unlawful and is aimed at tearing away  Samachablo-Shida Kartli from the Republic of Georgia.    It has become known that the population of Samachablo's  Georgian villages --the territory that is being controlled by  the Ossetian side -- were forced to participate in the elections.</p>

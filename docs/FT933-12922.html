			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Three sides 'to attend Bosnia peace talks' LEADERS of Bosnia's three warring factions have agreed to meet in Geneva for a final round of peace talks that will begin tomorrow, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, said yesterday. A spokesman for the mediators said they had been given 'indications' that Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, would attend along with Serb and Croat leaders. However, Mr Willy Claes, the European Community peace envoy, said last night that Mr Izetbegovic stressed to him in Sarajevo yesterday that Croat forces must allow passage of emergency relief and the Bosnian Serb advance on Sarajevo must be halted before he could attend the talks. Mr Claes said Mr Izetbegovic said he was ready to go to Geneva 'very soon' but that he could not give a precise date. The mediators' spokesman said Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, had given an undertaking to 'order a pause' in the advance against Bosnian positions on Mount Igman on the outskirts of Sarajevo. He said Mr Izetbegovic was to call a similar halt in Moslem offensives in central Bosnia, while the Croats were to halt attacks around Mostar. Serb forces continued to press forward earlier yesterday on Mount Igman. 'The battle for Igman is the fight for all of Bosnia,' said Bosnian radio. Serb forces are using at least 40 tanks in their assault on Igman. The troops are understood to be under the personal command of General Ratko Mladic, head of Bosnian Serb forces. If they succeeded in taking Mount Igman, they could advance up to the River Miljacka, which runs through Sarajevo. Mr Karadzic has said the Serbs want to divide the city along the Miljacka, the so-called green line separating predominantly Serb districts from the rest. Serbian and Bosnian media yesterday reported heavy clashes around Brcko, north-eastern Bosnia. Serb forces had also sent 31 tanks and 40 armoured vehicles around Gorazde for their attack on the Moslem 'safe area', it said. The radio, in what it called proof of 'ethnic cleansing' by Croats, reported that Croat-held radio in Mostar, in the south, was broadcasting information every hour on how Moslems could travel abroad.

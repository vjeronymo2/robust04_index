			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLE RACING AT LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> ERMOLENKO NEEDS 4-LAP RUNOFF TO DEFEAT MORAN AND CORREY  </P> <P> Speedway motorcyclist Sam Ermolenko of Cypress won a four-lap runoff against  Shawn Moran and Ronnie Correy to take the Nissan American Final for the third  straight year Saturday night before 4,372 fans at Long Beach Veterans Stadium.  </P> <P> Ermolenko drew the outside starting position for the race, with Correy starting  on the pole and Moran sandwiched between them. Moran took an early lead going  into the first turn, but Ermolenko turned on the horsepower to pass Moran and  win the first qualifying round for American riders that leads to the world  championship.  </P> <P> Ermolenko, Moran and Correy finished tied with 19 points after five heat races,  each rider beating one of the others during the course of the evening. The  three will advance to the Overseas Final June 25 at Belle Vue, England, along  with Lance King, who finished fourth with 17 points.  </P> <P> Correy, 22, of Fullerton, stunned Ermolenko in their first race when he powered  past the country's best rider to win Event No. 5.  </P> <P> Ermolenko beat Moran in their first race in Event No. 10, but Moran defeated  Correy in Event No. 14, to force the runoff.  </P> <P> However, Moran's status in international competition is hinged on a pending  appeal of a suspension by the American Motorcyclist Assn. when he tested  positive for alcohol at a long track meeting in Denmark last month.  </P> <P> Ermolenko has qualified for four consecutive world championship races and once  again appears to be America's best bet to win the title on Sept. 9 in Munich,  West Germany. Ermolenko has finished third in the world championship twice in  the past four years.  </P></p>

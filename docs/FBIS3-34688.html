A number of top officials from both sides  attended.

He  explained the points on which the Palestinians and Israeli sides  have agreed as well as the points that are still pending and  need further discussion.    His Majesty King Husayn affirmed to the Palestinian  president  the importance of continued coordination and consultation  because this coordination enables Arabs, particularly  Palestinians, to restore their rights and reinforce their  negotiating stand.

It was also an opportunity for me to  affirm that our stand is constant in terms of fully supporting  our kinsfolk and brothers in Palestine -- as he is the leader of  their march -- to the best of our abilities during these  circumstances and in the long run, God willing. I have noticed  and I am pleased that our contacts are continuous and  coordination between us is being upgraded to the level required  to confront challenges and fully shoulder our responsibilities.

We feel proud and are grateful to his majesty the king  for shouldering this family's concerns in the face of all  changes and developments.    I am pleased to be here today to put his majesty the king in  the picture on developments and the talks I held with Peres, as  well as talks between the Israeli delegation and the Palestinian  delegation. I presented to his majesty the king the official  documents that were signed. Moreover, I listened to his good  views and ideas on confronting all future issues which we should  address through joint efforts and action. This  Jordanian-Palestinian family is a united family under his  majesty the king's continuous care, God willing. [end recording]</p>

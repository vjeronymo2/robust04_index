			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Slovak National Bank Renewed Refinancing"] </F>   [Text] In the 22d week, after a period of approximately  three months, the Slovak National Bank [NBS] again started to  refinance commercial banks by means of auction credits. Even  earlier, the NBS renewed the rediscount of exchange bills for  agriculture. According to information from the NBS, the above  measures can be regarded as an indication of good marcoeconomic  results, such as, for example, the favorable development of the  inflation rate, which reached only three percent in the first  four months of this year.</p>

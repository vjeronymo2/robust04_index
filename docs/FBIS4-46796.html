			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Pylypchuk, people's deputy of </F> Ukraine, by Serhiy Lavrenyuk; place and date not given: "We Have  Laws a Program and a Mechanism for Implementation' " -- first  paragraph is HOLOS UKRAYINY introduction]    [Text] Recently a group of economists, headed by People's  Deputy Volodymyr Pylypchuk, finished working on a program to  overcome the economic crisis. In addition to the program, the  group prepared nearly 50 legislative acts, 30 of which are  drafts of laws. Today, Volodymyr Pylypchuk discusses some  provisions of the program.    [Lavrenyuk] Volodymyr Mefodiyovych, a wise man once said  that  if a cripple knows the right route, he will reach his  destination faster than a rider on horseback jumping around  aimlessly. Applying this image to define how our economy has  been managed for the last few years, one is unfortunately forced  to assert that its progress has been that of a cripple wandering  aimlessly. Let me therefore ask you: do you and the team with  whom you drafted this program for overcoming the crisis think of  yourselves as horsemen who know the way?    [Pylypchuk] We are not proposing anything new, because all  postcommunist states have chosen to make the transition to the  market. How to go about making this transition, the various  elements in this process, and the sequence in which the  different steps are taken -- that is a different matter. For  example, this transition would have been much easier in 1990,  whereas the situation today requires the use of more complicated  methods. On the other hand, there are many more people today  than in 1990 who know how to go about making this transition. We  have more than just a program. To make it work, it is necessary  to make changes in our legislation, and we have worked these  out. The only thing left to do is to refine the implementation  mechanisms and the sanctions to be applied for failing to obey  the laws.    [Lavrenyuk] In your opinion, how soon will the Supreme  Council get through its organizational phase and get around to  the economy?    [Pylypchuk] I expect the new Supreme Council to complete its  internal organization in a week or two.    [Lavrenyuk] Then let me put the question another way.  Volodymyr Mefodiyovych, how soon will the Supreme Council begin  to discuss the state budget? We all recall that at one time  Finance Minister Pyatachenko vowed to eliminate the deficit.  Naturally, no one believed that this would be done, but the  deputies had to approve this budget because they had no way out.  To be sure, a separate provision in the decree provided for a  quarterly review. But we are approaching the middle of the  second quarter, and there is no indication that anyone is  planning to review the budget, just as everyone expected from  the beginning. Meanwhile, experts predict that the deficit will  reach 35-40 percent in the first half of 1994.    [Pylypchuk] The thing is that the promises of this  government  are not serious, and so it is not worth getting fixated on them.  Indeed, when the budget was being adopted, many deputies,  including myself, asked the finance minister if, given the  current program, the current budget, and the existing taxation  system, the government could halt inflation. He answered that it  could. And so we have a situation in which we collect only  200-250 billion of every trillion karbovantsi due in taxes.    [Lavrenyuk] Apropos of taxes. Tell me, do you still support  the idea of a sales tax?    [Pylypchuk] We have modified this somewhat. This will be a  tax on purchases (the person who buys will pay).    [Lavrenyuk] In that case, what do you think of the decree  that the Cabinet of Ministers has just passed, which stipulates  that in a month's time drafts of decisions are to be drawn up  regarding replacing the tax on income with a tax on profits,  establishing a property tax, and lowering the value-added tax to  20 percent?    [Pylypchuk] It is true that any reduction in taxes will  eventually produce an increase in revenues into the budget,  because the tax burden on the producer will be lessened. As to a  tax on profits, we've already had that. I think, therefore, that  in view of the inflation we have, it is absurd and senseless to  view profit as a target of taxation, because with each upward  spiral of inflation, profits are reduced to zero, which leads to  price increases and a greater budget deficit. It is impossible  to mend the budget if there is no solid compensatory tax base.  Only those aspects that are connected with the price can serve  as this base. All normal economists know this. Whereas it does  not take a great deal of intelligence to insist on imposing a  tax on profits, because this is a traditional tax in a stable  economy. To impose a property tax at this time means to halt  privatization, because only those who own property will pay it.  (Just imagine a tax on a privatized apartment.)    This, in turn, is linked to the problem of regional  unemployment. We will be able to solve this problem without cost  to the budget only if we have a full-fledged housing market. In  other words, it is possible to introduce such a tax, but only  when all citizens are private owners. This is but further proof  that there are many dilettantes in the current government, who  have heard something somewhere, but do not know when that  "something" should be implemented.    [Lavrenyuk] Now that you have mentioned privatization, can  you describe the changes that you propose in your program for  overcoming the crisis.    [Pylypchuk] We are proposing to broaden the opportunities  available to the public with respect to privatization. In  addition, in the course of privatization, it is possible to  solve the problem of paying back what the Ukrainian state owes  its citizens (for the devaluation of their savings, bonds,  special drawings). In conjunction with this, we propose indexing  personal savings: up to 1,500 -- 10,000-fold, up to 10,000 --  5,000-fold, from 10,000 to 20,000 -- 1,000-fold, and over 20,000  -- 500-fold. And to issue these funds to citizens in the form of  privatization vouchers. We also think that it is important to  step up privatization, which can be done by computerizing these  processes, because we will gain more from accelerating  privatization than from the fiscal function of privatization. In  addition, we have worked out a simplified mechanism for making  enterprises sound. This can be done in three stages: the first  involves changing the management, the second -- reorganizing the  enterprise, and the third -- changing the owner. If a monopoly  enterprise shuts down, the management is changed, and, if the  manufacturing process allows for this, production is broken up,  new enterprises are created, which are immediately corporated  and their stocks put on the market. If an enterprise with a  debit balance shuts down, its management is changed and the  enterprise is privatized without being corporated, for example.  In other words, we propose harsh measures.    [Lavrenyuk] Could we talk about the mechanism for overcoming  inflation?    [Pylypchuk] We have already mentioned the taxation system as  one element in liquidating the budget deficit, but we propose  another measure as well -- commercializing budget funds. On the  whole, to put it briefly, this mechanism provides for  eliminating the budget deficit, halting the decline in  production, liquidating the foreign trade deficit, balancing the  goods and money supplies, and liquidating the issuance of more  credit than there are resources. The point also needs to be made  when speaking of the drop in production, for example, that the  policy of the National Bank of Ukraine [NBU] "contributed" to  this in no small way. Of what use is simply prohibiting not to  issue credit? [as published] One could conclude from this that  the NBU's policy is based on a simplistic understanding of  regulating the economy by monetary means: first they issued too  much money, causing it to be devalued, then they suddenly "came  to their senses" and swung to the other extreme. Too little  money in circulation causes production volumes to drop. In this  respect, the NBU's actions remind me of a drunk weaving from  fence to fence as he makes his way home from the bar.    [Lavrenyuk] Then what about currency regulation and the  external trade activities of enterprises that are affected by  this?    [Pylypchuk] There are two points at which currency  regulation  has the same effect (I should state at the outset that currency  regulation as such is a necessary thing) -- when either zero  percent or one hundred percent of foreign currency has to be  sold. The least effective situation is when fifty percent of  the foreign currency has to be sold. Very harsh administrative  measures are required to ensure that one hundred percent of  foreign currency is sold. On the other hand, the second method  (zero sales of foreign currency) means abandoning any attempt to  manage and giving up the state's monopoly over exports.  Enterprises will then be interested in hard currency earnings,  but to ensure that these earnings benefit our state rather than  some foreign country, we need to provide incentives not only for  our own depositors but also foreigners by raising the interest  rate on deposits to 25 percent. In these conditions, our own  hard currency earnings will be recovered, and foreign investors  will try to invest their money where they will earn larger  profits.    [Lavrenyuk] In connection with this, what do you think of  the  current round in the epic tale of the commodities bonds, which  were blocked nearly a year ago thanks to your committee, and  which have now been resurrected following some osmetic changes?    [Pylypchuk] There is one thing I fail to understand in this  situation: why are we so unwilling to do things in the normal  way? Let me remind you of what happened: they issued commodities  bonds and placed them somewhere in the West at seven percent per  annum. But, first of all, there is no interest on commodities  bonds anywhere in the orld, and, second, if we do not repay the  money, in 10-20 years we have to settle the bill with property.  But whose property? The property of state enterprises? But in  ten years' time privatization should be completed. Will we then  pay with property belonging to our citizens? If so, we have to  ask our citizens if they are willing to be saddled with this  debt. But let us imagine that there is still state property ten  years from now. We hand it over, the investor introduces new  technologies, and begins production. What is the sense of all  this? Do we need investments right now? Yes! Then let us at  least sell our unfinished construction projects for hard  currency by international tender. We will have the money today  and, moreover, we will not be burdened by the need to pay  interest. And if an investor comes today, he will also set up  the manufacturing process and begin production today rather than  ten years from now.    That is what we proposed doing originally, and that is what  we are proposing again today. But we are witnessing another  attempt to get around this, which compels me to think that  behind this maneuver lie the personal economic interests of  those organizing and pushing this through.    [Lavrenyuk] In conclusion, Volodymyr Mefodiyovych, what  would  you like to wish the new Supreme Council? How do you envisage  its work?    [Pylypchuk] I believe that it will be more constructive than  that of the former council. I say this because while working  during the preparatory period with deputies who are economists  by profession, I saw that the position of the representatives of  the so-called left bloc is the same as that of the Polish  leftists -- that is, they support reforms. I like them. I do not  know whether all the leftists hold the same view, but we already  share a common fulcrum. Naturally, I would like the deputies to  the Supreme Council to take into account both the positive and  negative experience of their predecessors. For our part, we  worked out a new organizational structure for the Supreme  Council -- we changed the basis on which commissions are to be  formed. Previously, they were formed to correspond to the  branches of the national economy, while we propose creating  commissions that are based on the branches of the economy and  the law. In other words, there will be separate commissions on  budget issues, banking, property reforms, micro and  macroeconomics, and others, because the previous Supreme Council  had several economic commissions, but while ours drafted 160  laws, some of the others prepared only three or four each. This  may have been enjoyable [for our commission], but it was also  exhausting. The load has to be evenly distributed. As to the new  Supreme Council, I wish it to complete organizing its working  bodies as quickly as possible and get down to the real work that  needs to be done.    [Lavrenyuk] Thank you.</p>

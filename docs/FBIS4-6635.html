			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ukeru Magosaki, ambassador to Uzbekistan: </F> "Japanese Diplomacy Is To Be Tested in Uzbekistan"]    [Excerpts] I. Distinguishing Features of Central Asia  <H5>  Litmus Test for Japanese Diplomacy </H5>   With the collapse of the USSR, Central Asia is experiencing  changes in all political, social, and economic areas. Moreover,  the changes are qualitative changes which may be regarded as  revolutionary. Central Asia has shifted from being a "colony"  of the USSR to a glorious independent state. The incident  should be celebrated wholeheartedly. Besides, in the long run  the area has full potentiality for development with its rich  resources such as gold, raw cotton, petroleum, gas, and others  as background.    However, this area has to first undergo hardship. The  hardship is so serious it might be the most serious experienced  in the life of individual citizens.    Said an Uzbek citizen who holds a responsible position:  "Compared to this confusion, the USSR socialist structure is  considered better. People's hearts are growing wild with  economic difficulties. At least we used to enjoy visiting and  receiving friends. Today, it is even difficult to do that. I  cannot but feel anxious about the future of our children."    While attaining independence, why should they become so  anxious today? If such anxiety really does exist, what should  the Japanese do about it? Roughly speaking, there are two  courses for us to take.    Since the area is not closely related to us, one course is  to  assume the attitude of an onlooker. This by itself is a fully  justifiable choice. Over the past several decades, there have  been few exchanges between Central Asia, which was under USSR  control, and Japan. The only Japanese citizens who are  regularly stationed in Tashkent, which has a population of over  2 million, are our four staff members at the embassy, two  representatives from business firms, a Japanese language teacher  (there is a Japanese language course at a local university where  over 50 students are studying Japanese without Japan's aid; a  Japanese lady has been teaching at the university for a monthly  salary of only a bit more than $10), a student visiting the  country to study archaeology, and the representative (a  Japanese) of the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development. This shows how scarce the relationship between  Japan and this area is. Therefore, it can be justifiable to  flatly say: "It is not our concern no matter what may happen in  this area."    Another course is to seek ways to positively help the area.  It is true that, while under USSR control, there had been no  close relations between this area and Japan. However, with the  collapse of the USSR, 23 million people in Uzbekistan alone are  experiencing hardship. Should they fail to overcome the present  situation, it is possible that serious political and economic  confusion may occur.    Japan and other countries can help the situation by offering  economic and intellectual assistance to these areas. When Japan  is being criticized at home and abroad about "lacking its own  diplomacy," Japan can offer positive assistance and nip the  causes of future confusion in the bud one by one. When Japan's  attitude in making international contribution is at issue, we  should realize that to shed blood is not the only way to make  contributions. Japan should seek the most effective ways of  making contributions. Perhaps a most effective way for Japan is  to help the area stabilize its political, social, and economic  situation through economic contributions. Japan can best  contribute in the field where it is most superior. It seems  natural for Japan to do so, and in the long run Japan may be  appreciated for so doing. Besides, such a way of assisting is  most welcome to countries such as those in Central Asia and  others which are experiencing confusion following the end of the  Cold War.    Central Asia is an area unknown to us, for we do not have a  direct relationship with this area. Yet, the area is in need of  Japan's help. Japan's way of dealing with these areas may be  regarded as a litmus test for Japanese diplomacy in the future.  [passage omitted on historical background]    II. Political and Social Changes    [passage omitted on historical background]  <H5>  The Role of Parliamentary Democracy Is Limited </H5>   For the purpose of instituting religious activities, a large  amount of funds are flowing into this area from Iran and other  countries. Let me offer a concrete example. In October 1993, I  traveled the Fergana area by automobile. To my surprise,  mosques were being constructed on first-class lots in almost all  villages, including small villages. In larger towns and cities,  Islamic theological schools were under construction, with the  school abutting the main street for 150 meters. Mosques were  emerging throughout a land which was about to be totally  evacuated following the withdrawal of Russian culture. Except  for Tashkent, where reinforced concrete buildings were  constructed one after another under the USSR, mosques are being  constructed in every district of Uzbekistan. Presently,  buildings are under construction, and little noticeable  religious activity is being carried out. Therefore, voices of  anxiety are seldom heard. However, two or three years from now,  when construction comes to a halt, religious activities are  expected to begin full-scale.    It is highly possible that religious activities will bear a  strong Iranian color. Such a possibility derives from Iranian  history and the existing racial structure of the country.    We may say that, from the pre-Christian era until about the  eighth century, Central Asia was included in the Persian  cultural sphere. Uzbeks and other Turkish descendents came to  the region during this period. The strategy of the Turkish  descendents was not to attempt to conquer all areas, but to  gradually invade the area where Persian descendents were weak.  As a result, a local community was formed where Persian and  Turkish descendents were intermixed. The Persian descendents  are living in the urban areas of historically famous Samarkand  and Bukhara, and the Turkish descendents are living in the  surrounding areas.    Under the USSR, both the Persian and Turkish descendents  were  equally regarded as second-class citizens. However, with  Uzbekistan becoming an independent state, and by virtue of the  "National Language Law," Uzbeks of Turkish descent constitute  the leading stratum, with those of Persian descent forming a  subordinate class (though there are many Persian descendents who  speak Uzbek fluently).    Shi'a Muslims, which have strong influence over Iran, also  have strong infiltrating power among the oppressed. In  addition, the Tajikistan people who maintain a considerable  influence in Uzbekistan are of Persian ancestry. Moreover, they  have strong financial support from religious sectors. Though  today educational funds for Islam are also being offered mainly  by Saudi Arabia, their role is simply to contribute money no  matter how much funds are offered. The funds offered by Saudi  Arabia will bear fruit in the form of increased Iranian  influence in strengthening human, historical, and cultural ties.  (Note: There is an opinion that, since Sunni Muslims are  conducting Islamic education in Central Asia, it will be  difficult for Iranian Shi'a Muslims to infiltrate the area.  However, oppressed under the USSR, the teachings of Islam have  not infiltrated into the area that deeply, and its influence is  not strong enough to prevent a particular religious sector from  coming into the area.) As I mentioned earlier, restoration of  the mura [premodern] community will bring about the restoration  of Islam.    As we have seen so far, we can understand that this area is  experiencing a violently changing period. New political and  social orders are about to be created. The scale of change is  almost revolutionary. Naturally, there will emerge a group to  resist the changes. Racial and cultural tensions are being  created in this area, and tensions are expected to increase  further. There are confrontations between those of Russian  (European) descent and the local people; between those of  Turkish and Persian descent; between "unification of politics  and religion" and "separation of politics and religion"; and  between the modern and premodern community.    Under such circumstances, the government is exerting itself  to avoid confusion, and is trying to prevent the country from  returning to a primitive Islamic community. Different from  other areas of the former USSR where confusion has surfaced,  this area alone has been able to maintain its political  stability mostly owing to the leaders. How should the West deal  with this community?    One of the requirements which qualifies this country to  receive aid from the West is "to what extent has parliamentary  democracy been introduced?" An international financial group  came up with this idea. However, parliamentary democracy is  based on a generally accepted idea that "the minority group is  ready to accede to the majority group so long as the minority  group is given the opportunity to express its opinions."    However, while the great revolution is taking place, with  the USSR regime shifting to an Uzbek regime, the role of a  parliamentary democracy becomes very limited. The Russian  people who have become second-class citizens cannot resume their  reign no matter how much they may shout at parliament. It is  not parliament that decides the role of religion. In a  community where there is confrontation between "unity of  politics and religion" and "separation of politics and  religion," the role of a parliamentary democracy is narrow. The  confrontation cannot be settled within the parliamentary  framework. When we think about ways of appraising and assisting  such a community, it is not necessarily appropriate to place a  great burden on "to what degree has a parliamentary democracy  been introduced".  <H5>  III. Changes in the Economic Field </H5> <H5>  Favorable Economic Environment </H5>   During the Russian regime, which lasted 120 years, the  economic structure of this area was formed from the viewpoint of  colonial management. In order to prevent this area from  becoming politically independent, its economy had been totally  linked with the economy of Moscow and others so that the area  could never become economically independent. Though Uzbekistan  was a world-famous place for raw cotton production, raw cotton  was not processed here; raw cotton was sent to Russia to be made  into fiber. Though there were industries in Uzbekistan, parts  and raw material were mostly imported from other areas of  Russia. Just like meshes, the Uzbek economy was incorporated  into an inter-dependent framework involving all areas of Russia.    Moreover, the Uzbek economy had been influenced by the Cold  War. Afraid of U.S. attacks during the Cold War, the USSR  dispersed its munitions industries to various districts.  Unimaginably large factories are located in local districts.  Tashkent is no exception. On the outskirts of Tashkent there  are the only two assembly plants (with tens of thousands of  employees) in the USSR for transport aircraft (including  military aircraft). Reportedly, there is a uranium factory in  Uzbekistan which is one of the largest in the USSR.    What will become of this economy after the collapse of the  USSR? Transport aircraft can be assembled only when the  necessary parts are procured. A factory cannot be operated  without parts, even if it has excellent engineers and excellent  assembly lines and runways.    Under such circumstances, Uzbekistan employed a clear  strategy. Supposedly, the strategy was formed from the following  concepts:    1. The economy promises a long-range view.    The balance of international payments will be improved by  increasing the production of gold, by elevating the degree of  processing of raw cotton, and by providing petroleum products  for itself. The economic environment is favorable in a  long-range view. However, it will take at least four or five  years to realize these objectives.    2. For the time being, as a transitional measure an economic  structure dependent on the Russian economy may be maintained  until a self-supporting economic structure is established.    This strategy is considered reasonable.    So far, Uzbekistan has been producing gold in large volumes,  ranking between sixth and eighth in the world. Foreign  investments began to be introduced. Newmont [as published]  Company of the United States has established a joint venture,  and an English enterprise has also concluded a contract to  extend its business in this area. Japanese enterprises are also  waiting for a chance to do business here.    The country produces high-quality raw cotton in large  quantities. Japanese enterprises which have closed their  domestic spinning mills because of the high labor cost are also  studying the possibility of operating mills in this country.    The country is abundant in deposits of petroleum and gas,  and  has enough deposits to export after supplying its domestic  demand.    In these three fields alone, the country has good prospects  for success. Its potentiality is by far greater than many other  developing countries.    Why Did the Plan Fail?    However, their plan did not work. The plan described in  point 2 above failed. For the USSR, the colonies (republics)  were expensive propositions. Russia aims to cut off the  republics, proposing to them conditions to remain within the  Russian economic sphere. Judging that "these requests are too  severe compared with the former conditions," the newly  independent countries intend to become economically independent  by introducing their own currencies. However, for a country  which had been able to maintain its economy through its  connection with Russia, in the short-term it means economic  collapse in attempt to become economically independent. The bill  is to be totally shouldered by the citizens. The ruble which  citizens have saved will become as good as wastepaper. Inflation  will be accelerated. Citizens have lost their trust in the  currency and do not want to save money. They do not sell but  rather accumulate goods. Distrust prevents the economy from  functioning smoothly.    In Central Asia (and maybe in Russia), there are presently  two factors creating economic difficulties.    -- Problems created by the collapse of socialism, and by the  shifting to a market economy.    -- Problems created by the collapse of the USSR economic  sphere.    While many intellectuals point out the former as a cause of  difficulties, in the short-term serious confusion has been  caused mostly by the latter. There is no way of solving the  problems without taking the latter's influence into account.  Central Asia, including Uzbekistan, is seriously in need of  advice concerning economic operations. However, the advice  given by IMF and other institutions is: "It is necessary to  completely shift to a market economy." This advice may be  adequate if the present hardship was attributable to the  contradictions of socialism alone. However, the most serious  hardship was created by the collapse of the USSR economic  sphere. What is necessary is to deal with the problem, taking  the situation of Central Asia into account, and not to try to  apply textbook rules to economics. The other day I met one of  the advisory members of the IMF who said: "Honestly speaking,  we are at a loss. We are not sure if it is of any use to give  advice aimed at partial improvement of a structure totally  different from our own. It is like a mental specialist trying to  cure a fractured leg."  <H5>  IV. What Can Japan Do? </H5> <H5>  Japan Can Be the Best Model </H5>   First, what is the president of Uzbekistan expecting from  Japan? If I arbitrarily compose a statement based on his  speeches, what he wants is as follows:    "We do not want to receive charity from foreign countries.  However, we want foreign countries to help us out of our  economic difficulties following independence. If we  successfully operate the economy today, there will be a bright  future for us. We have resources such as gold, petroleum, and  raw cotton. Basically, we have diligent workers. These factors  will prove fully helpful to us in making rapid progress in the  future. Yet, just as I do not need Islamic fundamentalism, I do  not need either `democratic fundamentalism' or `market economy  fundamentalism'. It does not bring about any solutions to be  forced to accept principles without taking individual situations  into account. Under a different environment, we should engage  in different approaches. To restore the economy is a task of  the utmost priority for us. We want to shift to a market  economy step by step. Of course, in view of social security, we  should also place importance on welfare. It is impossible to  try to completely shift to a market economy all at once. We  want to carry out the project with the central government taking  control. Japan seems to be the best model for us in operating  our economy. Asians have their own approaches. When I talked  to West European leaders, I related my idea to that effect. We  want to learn from Japan. We also want Japan to help us in  laying the foundation for development. If Japan could assist us  now, in the long run we will also be able to help Japan.  However, to my regret, Japanese Government officials and the  private sector are late in taking action."    The president, who is accustomed to delivering speeches in  the USSR-style, will speak for hours fluently and with dignity.  Yet the essence of his speech will be as I described above.    The core of the problem is whether or "not" Japan can  judge that "from a broad point of view, it conforms with Japan's  interests to help those Central Asian countries which are  suffering hardship."    Does Japan consider it right to exert itself in solving  problems directly related to its interests? Or does Japan  consider it will benefit the country in the long run to exert  itself in solving problems, even though the problems are not  urgent ones for Japan? Or when its qualifications as a UN  Security Council member are being discussed, does Japan consider  it its responsibility to do so? Japan's way of dealing with the  problem will differ largely depending on what choice it makes.    If Japan's choice is the latter, we can form a number of  projects.    -- Offer advice: Japan can give advice in economic  operations based on its experience in overcoming the postwar  confusion.    -- Assist key industries, and assist the region in improving  the social infrastructure. (In order to improve the balance of  international payments, the assistance should focus on such  industrial fields as mining, oil development, textiles, and  tourism.)    -- Offer humanitarian assistance.    -- Offer cultural assistance. (With its rich tradition, the  Central Asian culture possesses a high quality beyond our  imagination. However, in the community where the people barely  make a living, some of the traditional cultures are in the  process of destruction.)    Western countries, including Germany but excluding the  United  States, are taking steady action in assisting the region.  Fortunately, the Japanese are gradually beginning to feel Japan  should help Central Asia. However, I am afraid that to feel  that way may be excessive wishful thinking by the writer who has  almost no point of contact with Japan.</p>

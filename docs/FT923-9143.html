			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Anti-Mafia laws pass THE Rome government pushed a package of anti-Mafia laws through parliament yesterday after measures to break the gangsters' ties with politicians were watered down, Reuter reports from Rome. Prime Minister Giuliano Amato drafted the bill to give police wider powers after bombs killed two leading judges in Sicily. The laws, passed by a large majority, allow police to use undercover 'sting' operations, wiretaps and infiltrators. The anti-Mafia La Rete group, based in Sicily, protested after the ruling parties watered down a clause aimed at politicians who trade votes for promises with the clans. Opposition from Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, cut the list of offences down to one - politicians caught paying for votes from gangsters face up to six years in jail.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: German banks German banks are preening themselves on their bumper profits in 1991 in spite of the steeply inverted D-Mark yield curve. Apparently they have learned from the early 1980s when Commerzbank in particular ran into trouble through mis-matching assets and liabilities. But the banks also received generous help last year through a combination of high loan demand and a supply of retail deposits at rates well below those that applied in the money market. Neither benefit is likely to last. Credit demand will fall away as the economy slows, while persistently high money rates will make depositors more demanding. Hardest hit will be savings banks, but even large commercial banks will be hard pushed to grow their lending profits. The race is on to cut costs and raise fee income, which helps explain why banks are taking a tough line with the unions. For all the machismo of its dividend increase, even Deutsche Bank will have to work hard. It has a large stock of retail deposits and has invested heavily in becoming the largest player in the former East Germany.</p>

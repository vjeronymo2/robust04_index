			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ABANDONED SNAKES POSE A MYSTERY  </P> <P> Describing the reptilian horde as a "scene out of an Indiana Jones movie," San  Diego Zoo officials Wednesday were trying to identify the 225 nonpoisonous  snakes impounded at a vacant Vista residence.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, county officials wondered why the owner apparently abandoned the  valuable creatures.  </P> <P> Officers from the San Diego County Department of Animal Control seized the  snakes Tuesday on Lado de Loma Drive after neighbors complained of a stench to  the county Sheriff's Department. Deputies entered the house, found several dead  snakes among the poorly tended live ones, and called in animal control  officers.  </P> <P> While neither the county nor the Sheriff's Department could identify the  snakes' owner as of late Wednesday, a former owner of the house said he sold  the residence in early December to James R. King of El Cajon, who reportedly  described himself to a real estate agent as a "reptile wholesaler."  </P> <P> Efforts to reach King at an El Cajon telephone listing were unsuccessful  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The haul included 225 live snakes, about a dozen dead ones, 20 exotic species  of frogs and a handful of lizards, said Sally Hazzard, county animal control  director. The animals, which apparently had not been given food or water for  some time, were turned over to the temporary custody of the zoo Wednesday  morning for veterinary care and identification.  </P> <P> Some of the snakes were found Tuesday night in plastic foam cups and plastic  containers, zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said. The reptiles "were all extremely  thirsty and went immediately to the water when it was put in their pens" at the  zoo, he said. Jouett described some of the baby snakes as dehydrated.  </P> <P> Notations were made on some of the snakes' pens that indicated to zoo officials  that the animals may have last been fed and watered Nov. 9, Jouett said.  </P> <P> The owner may face criminal charges if the county determines that the snakes  were mistreated, Vista Assistant City Manager Jeanette Farris said. The owner  may be in misdemeanor violation of a Vista law that prohibits homeowners from  keeping more than 25 snakes or from owning pythons or boa constrictors longer  than 3 1/2 feet or weighing more than 15 pounds, she said.  </P> <P> Jouett said the haul of snakes included a crate full of "20 or more" pythons  and boa constrictors that range from 5 to 12 feet in length.  </P> <P> Although the snakes "appeared to be abandoned," Deputy Sheriff Larry van Dusen  said law enforcement officials would not try to identify or locate the snakes'  owner unless the animal control department determines that there may have been  criminal neglect of the animals.  </P> <P> Hazzard said her department is awaiting the zoo's medical evaluation and  identification of the animals before fully assessing the case.  </P> <P> Zoning laws that govern what kinds of animals may be kept in given areas and  the required "methods of containment" must also be evaluated by the county, she  said.  </P> <P> "No one knows how long the animals have been abandoned," Hazzard said. "But  there is criminal liability, in general, if an owner does not provide adequate  food, water and shelter for their animals."  </P> <P> In the meantime, animal control officers posted a notice at the Vista house  saying that the reptiles' owner must come forward within five days to claim the  animals or forfeit ownership. After that, the county would be free to sell the  snakes at auction, or dispose of them to zoos or the state Department of Fish  and Game, Hazzard said.  </P> <P> Although the zoo has not yet finished identifying the reptiles, Jouett  described them as all nonpoisonous. The snakes identified include rare,  12-foot-long albino Burmese pythons and albino king snakes, as well as a  variety of king snakes, rat snakes, garter snakes and rosy boa constrictors.  </P> <P> Gary Sipperley, owner of San Diego Reptile Breeders, said adult albino Burmese  pythons could be worth up to $4,000 each. The albino pythons "are a fairly new  genetic strain that's become available in the last five years. That's why  they're so valuable. There aren't that many available at this point."  </P></p>

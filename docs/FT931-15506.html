			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Scotland wins Pounds 12m Mitsubishi factory MITSUBISHI Electric, the Japanese consumer products group, is to set up a Pounds 12m factory in Livingston, West Lothian, to make air conditioners. The 95,000 sq ft plant will employ 200 people. It will open early next year, bringing to 1,700 the number of people Mitsubishi Electric employs in Scotland. The Japanese company makes video recorders at Livingston and televisions at Haddington, East Lothian. Its Apricot Computers subsidiary manufactures personal computers at Glenrothes, Fife. Mitsubishi Electric's other European plants are in Dublin and Croydon, Surrey. The plant will manufacture air conditioners for the European market. As Britain is not a strong market for air conditioners the Scottish inward investment body, Locate in Scotland, regards Mitsubishi Electric's decision to choose Scotland as a coup. Sir Peter Parker, chairman of Mitsubishi Electric UK, said Scotland had been chosen 'because we feel at home here'.</p>

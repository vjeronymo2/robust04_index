			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Risk and Reward: A gravity-free stroll through the financial market revolution THESE days, in the financial markets, it can sometimes seem as though the laws of gravity have been rewritten. A whole generation of computer-assisted traders seems bent on disproving the old Newtonian law of investing, that to earn higher returns, you have to take on bigger risks. As a result, today's financial traders sometimes seem to be walking on air, buoyed by theories that to an average investor are unintelligible. Imagine, for instance, holding a portfolio of securities that made you money no matter which way the market moved. Impossible? Maybe not. Consider the prospectus for a hedge fund launched recently by Cresvale, a London-based asset management and securities company. It claims to follow hedging strategies, the result of which 'is to maximise the value of the underlying securities and warrants in rising, falling and sideways markets'. So where's the catch? 'At all times the fund is anticipated to be market neutral,' Cresvale says. Sounds too good to be true? Not if you listen to some of the claims coming from the derivatives markets. The modern armoury of interest rate, foreign currency and equity instruments should make it possible to hedge away any particular element of risk, leaving an investor or trader carrying only those risks they feel comfortable with. If you're holding Japanese equities, why not protect yourself against a falling yen and only carry the equity exposure? Or why not eliminate the equity risk by buying a few put options on the Nikkei stock market average? Better still, if linkages between the various financial markets are not working efficiently, why not hedge away the risks altogether and get left with a residual return? This selective approach to risk is now driving a large amount of trading in all financial markets. A barrage of new trading approaches and a lot of computer power has been brought to bear on areas which were once left to traders who had little more to guide them than their own gut-feelings plus the comforting words of an analyst or economist looking over their shoulder. Everyone from the fund manager who uses quantitative techniques to the equity trader who hedges his position by buying options is now relying on greater computer power and sophisticated modelling to develop an investment or trading approach. The growth of derivatives markets - and the growth of the derivatives industry, among the most profitable in the financial sector - are one result. Yet this revolution has had other, less obvious results. One has been the greater opaqueness of financial markets, and the institutions which deal in them. Over-the-counter markets are private places where it is sometimes difficult for an outsider to discover even what is being traded, let alone who is trading it or for how much. Also, not much of what goes on is reflected in banks' balance sheets. At the end of last year Bankers Trust, the US bank which has been at the forefront of the move into derivatives, recorded Dollars 59bn of credit risk on its off-balance sheet activities. This compared with Dollars 58bn on its traditional on-balance sheet business - the first time its off-balance sheet risks had been greater. If things are becoming opaque for outsiders, then more worrying is the fact that they are becoming equally opaque for regulators and senior managers in financial institutions. A report from the Bank for International Settlements pointed last week to the worrying lack of statistics on what is happening in some derivative markets, and the risks banks are taking on as a result. A second result has been a change in the way financial markets move. Volatility has increased as fewer, bigger traders, driven often by technical trading methods, seek to move ever-larger sums between markets. Closer linkages between markets - one result of the growth of derivatives - has meant that any shocks can be transmitted faster through the machine. In future weeks, this column will explore the revolution in the financial markets. It will look at the new financial instruments and markets that have developed, and the trading strategies of the people who use them - whether fund managers, bankers or corporate treasurers.</p>

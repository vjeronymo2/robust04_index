			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Union Square rights and reconstruction Union Square, the property investment and development group which suffered heavily in the commercial property slump of the early 1990s, yesterday announced a rights issue and capital reconstruction. In a statement issued after the market closed, the group said it hoped to raise Pounds 9.6m from a 1-for-1 rights issue at 5p per share. The shares closed unchanged at 9p. The move is designed to reduced the group's reliance on Thompson Investments, its ultimate holding company, which last year advanced loans of Pounds 10.8m to cover its debts. Mr Richard Thompson, chairman of Union Square and managing director of Thompson Investments, said the rights issue would increase shareholders' funds to about Pounds 10.5m and would clear the way for a capital reconstruction. 'Thompson Investments will swap their debt for equity, leaving it with a 79 per cent stake,' he added. In the year to March 31, the property company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 212,000 (Pounds 83,000) on turnover of Pounds 3.81m (Pounds 1.75m), including Pounds 2.36m from disposals. Although dividends have been unpaid since 1990, Mr Thompson - also a director of Queen's Park Rangers football club - forecast a resumption of payments 'in a year or two'.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO'S BLACK BOX;  </P> <P> 'UNDERGROUND' PRODUCT CIRCUMVENTS CODING ON PRERECORDED CASSETTES  </P> <P> Psssstttt. Wanna buy a black box?"  </P> <P> Don't be surprised if some huckster approaches you this way in or around your  local video store. The black box is a mechanism that erases Macrovision. That's  the anti-copying protection encoded on many prerecorded cassettes, which  produces a distorted picture if you try to copy a tape.  </P> <P> By hooking up the black box to two VCRs-inserting a blank tape in one and a  Macrovision-encoded cassette in the other-the box electronically strips the  Macrovision coding so that the picture on the copy is not distorted.  </P> <P> Most black boxes are sold for $50-$90 by mail order-many from ads in consumer  electronics magazines. But some black boxes are sold in the $25 range by  enterprising businessmen who hang around video stores, which are loaded with  potential buyers for these boxes.  </P> <P> Many home-video fans hate Macrovision. Before it was perfected and used  extensively, all that was needed to copy a rented movie were two VCRs, a set of  wires and a blank tape. But with Macrovision, encoded in the tape by the  manufacturer, the picture on the copy is jittery or spoiled by erratic  brightness or uneven color or various forms of visual noise. It's not easily  watchable.  </P> <P> According to recent industry surveys, 10% to 20% of VCR owners engage in  copying of prerecorded tapes, which is a violation of federal copyright laws.  That percentage would be much higher if so many tapes weren't protected by  Macrovision. Of the 190 million movie cassettes made in this country last year,  88 million (or 46%) were encoded with Macrovision.  </P> <P> Often when home-video customers find a rented tape has a distorted picture,  they assume that while Macrovision was being encoded at the factory, it warped  the picture in the original copy.  </P> <P> Vigorously defending his company's product, Macrovision's Bill Krepick, vice  president of sales and marketing, claims that last year only a handful of such  quality complaints were legitimately traceable to the Macrovision process.  </P> <P> It's not only the consumer who's interested in the black box. Retailers often  buy them to make rental copies that are Macrovision-free in order to build up  their inventory of hit films for the cost of blank tapes. What often happens,  Krepick explained, is that customers will get copies that the retailer made  imperfectly. "But that's not the fault of Macrovision," he said.  </P> <P> Macrovision was first introduced in late 1985, used on the movie "The Cotton  Club." But then the process wasn't perfected and instead it distorted the  picture in the original prerecorded tape or didn't successfully make the copy  unwatchable. For a while, Macrovision fell out of favor with home-video  companies that pay for the process, roughly one-half percent or less of the  retail price per copy. But the process has been improved, leading to its  extensive use.  </P> <P> Macrovision's primary enemy is now the manufacturers of these black boxes. Six  to eight companies make them, Krepick estimated. He declined to speculate on  how many black boxes are in use. "These are underground operations," he said.  "Nobody knows how many boxes are made or sold because it's hard to get  legitimate figures."  </P> <P> Efforts to reach any company reps for comment are futile. Anticipating  prosecution, these outfits operate rather covertly. Though reachable through  the 800 numbers used to place orders, the company reps aren't interested in  talking to the press.  </P> <P> The scales of justice are tipped in favor of these manufacturers. The products  protect themselves by including such notices as, "This object must not be used  for copying anti-copy encoded information carriers, except as permitted under  copyright law."  </P> <P> Macrovision's sole recourse is to sue for patent infringement, a slow process  that would be extremely expensive-for Macrovision. What Macrovision is pushing,  Krepick said, is an amendment to the federal copyright law that would outlaw  the sale and distribution of the black boxes and subject violators to stiff  penalties and jail terms.  </P></p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Sun Alliance fails in attempt to acquire Norwegian insurer SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest composite (life and general) insurer, has failed in its attempt to acquire Norway's fourth-largest life insurance company, Forenede. The bid, which was launched in January through Sun's Danish subsidiary Codan, was seen as an important step in the UK insurer's strategy of expanding in the Scandinavian insurance market. However, the Copenhagen-based Codan, which is 71.5 per cent owned by Sun Alliance, notified the Oslo stock exchange yesterday that it was withdrawing its bid to acquire Forenede. The announcement removed any lingering hopes that the bid, which had valued Forenede at Pounds 72m, could proceed, following last month's decision by the Norwegian finance ministry to award a permit to acquire the company to Gjensidige Skadeforsikring, a rival Norwegian insurer. Gjensidige must complete the purchase of two thirds of Forenede by August 1 and wholly own the company by August 1993. It is understood that Codan will retain both its 10 per cent stake in Forenede and an option to purchase a further 11 per cent in the Norwegian company. Sun Alliance made no formal announcement yesterday, arguing that the matter had been dealt with by Codan. It is understood, however, that although disappointed with the failure of the bid - which would have given Sun Alliance 10 per cent of the Norwegian market - the group is continuing to investigate opportunities for expansion in the Scandinavian market. Sun Alliance's interest was signalled by an unsuccessful attempt to bid for the Danish state-owned life insurer, Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring, which was privatised in 1990. The group is optimistic about prospects for future growth in the Scandinavian savings market, where state pensions schemes have come under increasing strain in recent years. Sun Alliance's overseas activities this year have mainly focused on the agreement of partnership deals. In May, the group signed an agreement with the Swiss company, Helvetia, to develop jointly international commercial lines business. In Scandinavia, Sun Alliance has less formal accords with Vesta Group in Norway and Atlantica in Sweden.</p>

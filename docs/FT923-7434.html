			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian officials set for coffee talks in Colombia BRAZILIAN AND Colombian officials will meet next Monday to prepare for the next round of talks on the International Coffee Agreement, which begin in London on September 21. Mr Celsius Lodder, director of the Brazilian Department of Supply and Prices, one of the leaders of the Brazilian delegation, said that the two countries commonly meet to exchange ideas prior to the London encounters. Producing countries are frustrated at the lack of progress in the talks, especially as prices now stand at 17-year lows. Mr Lodder said that Brazil and Colombia, the two biggest producers, would not be discussing a change in position at next week's meeting. 'We don't think that a unilateral producers' accord would be appropriate,' he added.</p>

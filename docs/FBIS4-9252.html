			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 20 (CTK) -- A fundamental disagreement  on foreign policy views was revealed by the absence of the Civic  Democratic Party (ODS) leaders from the recent Litomysl summit  of seven presidents, Liberal Social Union [LSU] foreign policy  secretary and former Czechoslovak Ambassador to Italy Jiri Holub  told journalists today. Presidents of Austria, the Czech  Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia met in  Litomysl, East Bohemia, on April 15-17.    The Czech Republic's image abroad is not helped when the  invitation to take part in a meeting like that is turned down by  Premier Vaclav Klaus and Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde, and the  Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec is not present, Holub said.  Klaus excused himself on account of preparations for his trip  to Latin America, Uhde said he was going to a meeting with  members of the public in Velka Bites, South Moravia, which he  said he had agreed on seven weeks before, and Zieleniec was  leaving for Vietnam. Holub said the Realistic Bloc (including  the Czech Social Democratic Party -- CSSD, the LSU, the  Christian Social Union -- KSU and the Czech Womens' Union)  expert group's criticism of the government foreign policy was  right.    "Without the presence of opposition representatives, the  Foreign Policy Council cannot play its role of coordinating  foreign policy," Holub said, adding that he was going to ask the  Presidential Office for an explanation regarding the Litomysl  meeting circumstances including the presence, or absence, of  political representatives.</p>

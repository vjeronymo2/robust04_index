			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> MALL CLINIC OFFERS FREE HEALTH TESTS  </P> <P> St. Joseph Hospital of Orange is offering a health-conscious option for  mall-goers who have shopped until they're ready to drop.  </P> <P> Free and low-cost eye exams, blood tests and skin cancer screenings are among  the services available to shoppers who stop by the hospital's new clinic at  MainPlace/Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "We've put ourselves in a place where in a sense people will trip over us,"  said Joan Trezek, the hospital's director of marketing. "This way we can offer  a quick look at possible health problems that someone may have."  </P> <P> St. Joseph personnel will administer tests for blood pressure and blood sugar  levels, cholesterol, glaucoma, cataracts and allergies. Screenings for skin  cancer and breast exams will also be offered at the Testing 1-2-3 clinic.  </P> <P> St. Joseph opened the clinic last month in partnership with E.N. Phillips Co.  of Woodland Hills as a community service and a marketing tool, Trezek said. The  clinic is between Robinson's and Spoons on the second floor of the mall.  </P> <P> Clinic visitors who may require further treatment will be referred to a  physician.  </P> <P> The MainPlace clinic is one of eight Testing 1-2-3 centers operated in  California by the E.N. Phillips Co., a preventive health marketing company.  </P> <P> Clinic hours are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Saturday. MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

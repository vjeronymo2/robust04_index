			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Badurkin report: "Army on Brink of Poverty"] </F>   [Text] At yesterday's briefing Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev described as critical the situation regarding  funding of the army. The amount the state owes to the military  department no longer increases by the year but by the month.  While it totaled 5 percent of the military budget at the end of  1992, it was 25 percent in December last year, and at the  beginning of this year the Defense Ministry received only 63  percent of planned appropriations. This money was scarcely  sufficient to pay half the amount owed to suppliers of  equipment, arms, and property.    For the first time the Russian defense minister declared  that  "If the funding situation does not change in the near future,  there can be no question not only of reforming the army,  providing it with modern weapons and equipment, and a  qualitative renewal, but also of ensuring Russia's security."    This -- let us say bluntly -- sensational statement by the  head of the military department was prompted by the fact that  the military budget being proposed by the Finance Ministry meets  only 46-47 percent of the army and navy's minimum requirements.  If it is adopted the Defense Ministry will have to sharply cut  (by three-fourths) military orders at defense enterprises, which  in turn will lead to the defense sector's final collapse, a fall  in industrial production as a whole, and increased unemployment.  In addition, what is inevitably the latest wholesale reduction  of the armed forces by 400,000 men, which will have a boomerang  effect on the army's combat readiness and the state budget  (discharging 70,000 servicemen now costs the treasury a trillion  rubles), will also lead to an explosion of social tension among  the troops.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Bids for Notts paper may top Pounds 80m A tense auction is developing for T. Bailey Forman, publisher of the Nottingham Evening Post, with a selling price that may exceed Pounds 80m. The contest for the most significant regional newspaper group still in family hands is developing into a three-way struggle between Northcliffe Newspapers, the regional arm of Associated Newspapers; the recently floated Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Evening Post; and Emap, the magazine and regional news-paper group. An auction for the group, which includes a number of free newspapers as well as the main Nottingham title, is being organised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the merchant bank. Final bids are due by May 16 but indicative bids based on a sales memorandum have already been submitted. One of the bids, possibly from Northcliffe, is believed to have been for more than Pounds 80m. Midland in its indicative bid, which is in no way binding, is understood to have put forward a figure of at least Pounds 70m. A number of potential bidders who suggested figures around Pounds 40m have been eliminated from the competition. Apart from Northcliffe, Midland and Emap, two other groups - Reed International and Thomson Regional Newspapers - are believed to be still in the contest. The apparently high price is a function of the rarity value of the privately owned titles and the fact that profitability of the regional press has gradually been improving in spite of generally declining circulations.</p>

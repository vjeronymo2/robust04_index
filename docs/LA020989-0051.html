			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: HOW THE GORBACHEVS STRETCH THEIR RUBLES  </P> <P> The big Soviet secret is out. The press has revealed that Mikhail Gorbachev  makes $30,000 a year -- not a princely sum by Donald Trump standards, but  certainly in the same ballpark as a United States congressman.  </P> <P> Many people are wondering how Mikhail and Raisa live on his pay. One person who  has the answer is Lem Newsom, a State Department expert on Soviet salaries.  </P> <P> "The reason the Gorbachevs can get by on $30,000 a year," he told me, "is that  they don't spend anything. And they don't spend anything because there is  nothing to buy in Moscow."  </P> <P> "It's hard to believe," I said.  </P> <P> "Let's say that Raisa wants codfish for dinner, which is selling for 20 rubles  a kilo. She goes to the store at 8 in the morning and stands in line with the  other shoppers. At 6 that evening the fish merchant yells, 'No more codfish'  and slams the door. Raisa goes home and tells Mikhail she just saved another 20  rubles from the household budget."  </P> <P> Lem continued, "The beauty of the Soviet economy is that everything you could  possibly spend money on doesn't exist. Therefore, at the end of the year most  of a Soviet citizen's salary is intact."  </P> <P> "Lenin wanted it that way," I agreed.  </P> <P> "In the State Department we have observed that while his salary is low by  American standards, Gorbachev has many friends in the Soviet Union just as  Ronald Reagan does in California. So, if the Gorbachevs need shoes, the head of  the shoe cooperative in Murmansk will provide them. And if they need mulch, it  will be delivered gratis within the hour by the mulch commissar of Smolensk  himself."  </P> <P> "But what about Raisa's clothes?" I asked.  </P> <P> "While there have been groups critical of Raisa for borrowing expensive clothes  from Soviet couturiers, her defenders insist that she has started a demand for  Russian creations that no other Communist first lady ever did before. Even Mrs.  Khrushchev didn't do as much for fashion as Mrs. Gorbachev has."  </P> <P> "What with the perks and the borrowing, it's hard to believe that any chief of  a superpower could not make ends meet on $30,000," I added.  </P> <P> Lem said, "I haven't told you the big surprise yet. The one thing that keeps  the Gorbachevs alive and well is their American Express card. How they got the  card is a story in itself."  </P> <P> "They agreed to pose for an ad?" I suggested.  </P> <P> "No. The CIA went to American Express and said it wanted the company to issue a  card to the supreme leader of the Soviet Union. American Express replied that  it had had very bad luck with Soviet credit. Brezhnev stuck them for three  airline tickets to Tashkent, and once they had to send a bill collector to  Moscow to find Kosygin when he stiffed them for 20 dinners in Bulgaria. The  collector disappeared and was never heard from again."  </P> <P> Newsom continued, "The CIA was adamant that the Gorbachevs receive a credit  card and told American Express that the agency would guarantee the unpaid  accounts. American Express put the CIA's name into the computer and it turned  out that its credit wasn't any better than the Kremlin's.  </P> <P> "Only after intervention from the White House was a card issued to the  Gorbachevs. Mikhail was surprised to receive it, but Raisa told him not ask any  questions. So Gorbachev decided to use the American Express card as a test of  sincere relations between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.  </P> <P> "He told Raisa, 'If we can charge and they don't ask us to pay that means the  Americans really want glasnost. If they keep demanding the money, we'll know  that when it comes to arms reduction that they are just faking it.'  </P> <P> "Well, the rest is history. All Gorbachev's American Express bills are paid for  by the CIA. The arrangement has worked out so well there is talk that if an  agreement is reached on long-range missiles, Mikhail and Raisa will be issued a  Gold American Express card -- the highest honor that any country in the Free  World can bestow on a foreign leader."  </P></p>

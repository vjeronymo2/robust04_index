			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: US folding cartons side boosts NMC to Pounds 7m NMC, the packaging group, lifted annual profits by 42 per cent, mainly reflecting another buoyant performance from UPC, its core US folding carton operation. The pre-tax increase for the 12 months to March 31, from Pounds 5.01m to Pounds 7.11m, was also helped by the strength of the dollar which contributed some 6 per cent to the improvement. The company expected further benefit during this year. Mr Norman Gordon, chief executive, attributed UPC's strong showing to 'substantial new long term contracts with customers which have been integrated into existing turnover without surrendering margins.' US packaging turnover amounted to Pounds 109.6m (Pounds 69.4m), while the smaller UK side produced sales of Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 24.2m). The group has recently completed a private placement of Dollars 60m (Pounds 40m) of fixed term debt repayable over 10 years, which together with a new revolving credit line will finance future growth. Plans for a public offering of UPC in the US have been 'shelved indefinitely' Mr Gordon said. Costs involved with the abortive offering amounted to Pounds 367,000 and were taken below the line. A further extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.88m related to the withdrawal from the low margin point of sale flexible packaging business at Bristol. Basic earnings per share were 6.15p (2.76p); a proposed final of 1.5p (nil) brings the total for the year to 2p (1.25p).</p>

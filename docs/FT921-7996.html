			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / AEG office equipment plant to shut DAIMLER BENZ, Germany's biggest industrial company, has managed to find new jobs for 1,400 of the 2,700 employees working at its AEG Olympia typewriter and office equipment plant in Wilhelmshaven. The factory is being shut after losing heavily for several years. Most of the new jobs are at other Daimler subsidiaries. The decision, finalised at a meeting of AEG's supervisory board in Frankfurt yesterday, has been taken after intense pressure from the port city of Wilhelmshaven to mitigate the effect of the closure on one of the most depressed regions of western Germany. Last October Wilhelmshaven predicted that closure of the factory, coupled with planned job losses in the navy, would drive local unemployment from 15 to nearly 30 per cent. The powerful IG Metall union has also set itself against the job cuts, and union members yesterday mounted a demonstration outside AEG's Frankfurt headquarters for the second day running.</p>

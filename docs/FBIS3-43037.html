Bubnov, Institute of Power </F> Engineering Problems, Belarusian Academy of Sciences; the  article's publication was approved by the Editorial Council of  the ``Energy Conservation'' Program for examination and  practical introduction into industry; UDC 338.911:66.046.9]    [Text] Growth of industrialization in the world was marked  over the last 100 years by extremely fast increase in power  consumption (by almost 25 times), which led to the use of 11.4  billion tonnes of equivalent fuel in the world annually.  However, in addition to the positive effect of  industrialization, there are also negative factors, and one of  the main ones is pollution of the atmosphere and planetary  climate change, evoked by disturbance of the atmosphere's gas  composition and the radiant heat balance as a result of  accumulation of the combustion products of fossil fuels in the  atmosphere.    The principal components of atmospheric pollution are oxides  of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon. The toxic effects of some  substances released by enterprises and forming as a result of  human economic activity are described in Table 1.    Power generating facilities are among the principal  polluters  of the atmosphere (approximately 30 percent) [2]. Power supply  sources of the Belarusian Republic currently consume around 65  million tonnes of equivalent fuel per year, with around 90  percent of the fuel and energy resources being supplied from  Russia. Extraction of fuel and energy resources locally in  Belarus in 1985 totaled: petroleum--2.0 million tonnes, gas--0.2  billion nm[.sup]3[/], peat--4.5 million tonnes. On the other  hand consumption just by power generating facilities, without  regard for municipal heat supply sources not within the  structure of the Belglavenergo TEO [not further identified], is  shown in Table 2 [3].    As follows from Table 2, the principal fuel of power  generating facilities is fuel oil--48.7 percent. Consequently  components released into the atmosphere as a result of its  combustion, namely ash, soot, nitric oxides, sulfur dioxides and  carbon monoxide, will be the environmental pollutants associated  with generation of electric power in the Belarusian Republic.

Most important are the maximum one-time and the  mean daily maximum permissible concentrations (PDKs) of toxins  in the atmosphere. Table 3 gives the PDKs for several  atmospheric pollutants adopted in the Belarusian Republic  (PDK[.sup]max o[/]--one-time, PDK[.sub]m[/]--mean daily).    In order to meet the PDKs indicated in Table 3, we need to  organize the fuel combustion process or provide the technology  of purifying the fuel or the smoke gases. As a rule, for  practical purposes the problems of purifying exhaust gases at  power supply sources planned in countries of the former USSR  were not addressed, and all of the attention was devoted to the  fuel combustion process. However, while we can reduce toxic  releases of N0[.sup]x[/] by improving the combustion process,  SO[.sup]2[/] practically remains at its initial  concentrations. Therefore to reduce toxic releases of  SO[.sup]2[/], we need to furnish power supply sources using  fossil fuel with purification systems. This of course makes the  supplied electric power more expensive, but it improves the  ecological situation at the locations of the power supply  sources, and consequently reduces the risk of illness in the  population.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

Some  characteristics of these methods are given in Table 4.    As follows from Table 4, the SO[.sup]2[/] removing systems  considered here are approximately identical in terms of their  relative indicators. However, the cathode-ray methods do not  require expendable materials, and moreover, they provide for  comprehensive removal of NO[.sup]x[/] and SO[.sub]2[/]  [5,6]. Furnishing power supply sources using fossil fuel with  systems for removing toxic gaseous exhausts makes the supplied  power 40-50 percent more expensive. It should be considered,  however, that in this case the amount of the fines for toxic  releases decreases.    Because many industrial enterprises, including those  generating electric and thermal power, are unable to reduce  releases below the PDV [maximum permissible release], on 11 May  1990 the Council of Ministers of the Belarusian Republic adopted  Decree No 119 ``On Standards of Charges for Releases  (Discharges) of Pollutants Into the Natural Environment.'' The  charges were introduced with the purpose of compensating for  releases at the level of the PDV, with a coefficient of 0.1 for  thermal power facilities, and a charge five times greater for  surpassing them, depending on the danger class of the toxic  substances. Table 5 gives the danger classes for toxic  substances released together with smoke gases by power supply  sources using high-sulfur fuel oil as fuel, and the cost per  tonne of released substance.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 5.

The damages caused by toxic releases from power supply  sources burning high-sulfur fuel (around 20,000) [sic] were  evaluated using procedures presented in [6-8]. The calculation  results are shown in Table 6.    Considering that a tendency for land prices to increase is  being observed, the amount of the damages will also grow.  Consequently when planning and building power supply sources, we  need to consider the damages inflicted both on the environment  and on human health. For practical purposes the latter factor is  not yet reflected in the procedural recommendations for  calculating damages.  Bibliography    1. Redzhinald E. Nyuell, Genri Dzh.

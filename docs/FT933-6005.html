			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (7): Youth in the driving seat - Profile: Mohamad Nadzmi, head of the Proton company MR Mohamad Nadzmi Mohamad Salleh has one of the most difficult jobs in Malaysia. At only 39, he is head of Proton, Malaysia's national car company. Proton is the pride of Malaysia and the project most dear to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister. 'It's tough now and it's going to get a lot tougher,' says Mr Nadzmi, who has been in his new post since mid July. 'Proton is the cornerstone of the country's industrialisation programme. It's daunting to take such a job on. If things go wrong then that's the end of my career. There's no turning back. We have to succeed.' Mr Nadzmi describes himself as a professional manager rather than a technician or engineer. He studied economics, chemistry and mathematics in the US, then returned to Malaysia to work for Petronas, the state oil company, and HICOM, the government controlled heavy industrial holding company. Mitsubishi, Proton's Japanese partner, has had its men at the head of the national car project for most of time since the first car rolled off the assembly line in the mid 1980s. But there has been talk of friction between the partners, with the Malaysian side dissatisfied about the slow rate of Japanese technology transfer, while Mitsubishi apparently disapproved of Proton's ambitious export plans - fearing competition overseas from the Malaysian car. Mr Nadzmi was catapulted into the managing director's seat on the insistence of Dr Mahathir. 'It was always realised that the Japanese could not go on running the company indefinitely. It was felt that now was the time for Malaysians themselves to take control,' says Mr Nadzmi. A Malaysian did head Proton for a time five years ago. But the Japanese reassumed control as various problems threatened the project's future. In Malaysia, questions of politics and race are part of almost every activity. Mr Nadzmi has to have the right political allies if his authority is to be maintained. Part of Mr Nadzmi's brief is to encourage more bumiputra or Malay participation in the industry. He has to do this while not offending other groups. 'I know people will be watching to see if I perform well. I think I have about five years to really prove myself. Proton has achieved so much but the next phase will be harder. We've got to find new markets so we can expand production and bring costs down. We've got to introduce more competition in our supply network. That means I'm going to make enemies and offend some politically well connected people. But it's got to be done.' Mr Nadzmi has already proved himself as a businessman. Before his present job he built up Edaran Otomobil Nasional (EON), Proton's distributing company, into one of Malaysia's most successful conglomerates, with a listing on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. 'I'm not going to disregard what the Japanese have done at Proton. We can't reinvent the wheel. The Japanese have introduced their proven production methods. But as a Malaysian I think I know how to motivate people better.' Mr Nadzmi feels Malaysians have a great flair for design, They are also good innovators. But making sure people stick to modern industrial working practices is not easy.</p>

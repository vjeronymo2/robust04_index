			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Battle for the soul: America's political landscape is changing President George Bush has paid the price for complacency. The stunning result in the New Hampshire primary election is first and foremost a protest vote against his handling of the US economy; but it also signals a deep misgiving about the direction of the country and Mr Bush's leadership. For Mr Patrick Buchanan, the rightwing television commentator who captured 40 per cent of the Republican vote, the New Hampshire result is more than a personal triumph: however controversial, his candidacy has been legitimised. 'And now on to the south,' he declared on Monday night in words which echoed all the way to the White House. Just six months ago, Mr Bush, the victor of the Gulf war, appeared invincible. The president now faces a battle on two fronts, with both Mr Buchanan and the Democratic candidates delivering the same message of discontent. Inevitably, these attacks will increase the impression that Mr Bush is vulnerable, if not beatable, in the November general election. Not since Mr Ronald Reagan ran within a percentage point of President Gerald Ford, an unelected president, in 1976, has an incumbent Republican fared so badly in New Hampshire, the first of the nation's primaries. Even if Mr Buchanan has no serious chance of winning the Republican nomination, he has the potential to split the Republican party in the run-up to November. Mr Bush professes to have grasped the threat. 'I understand the message of dissatisfaction,' he said hours after the polling booths closed. 'The message tonight is that Americans are concerned about the future.' If this is the case, it does not explain why Mr Bush fought such an inept campaign in the granite state, which only four years ago handed him the victory that launched his bid for the White House. Mr Bush surely knew how vulnerable he was in the conservative state, where the local economy has lurched from boom to bust during his three years in office. Unemployment has tripled, bankruptcies have soared, banks have stopped lending. New Hampshire is a metaphor for the 1980s, the decade of speculation and over-building; but Mr Bush appeared oblivious until January as the primary battle neared. In two trips, Mr Bush appeared tentative, drawing small crowds at discreet upper-class rallies. His desire to remain above the fray played into the hands of Mr Buchanan who mocked 'King George' as an absentee president, out of touch with ordinary voters. Soon, a small army of volunteers, students joining forces with unemployed hard-hats, mobilised in what became a genuine grass-roots campaign. It was an astonishing effort. Mr Buchanan had never run for public office. His television advertising was masterful. Mr Bush failed to respond to accurate charges that he broke his 'no new taxes' pledge in the 1988 campaign - in retrospect a serious tactical error. Such mishaps revived memories of the smugness which gripped Mr Bush's run for office in 1988, when he was beaten into third place in the Iowa caucuses. How then does the president intend to fight back? From the viewpoint of the White House, the alarming conclusion must be that Mr Bush has already delivered his best shots. These were unleashed in his State of the Union address to Congress last month when he unveiled a long-awaited growth package to revive the US economy. The package promised a good deal more than it has delivered so far. Designed primarily to insulate Mr Bush against charges of inaction, the proposals included Dollars 50bn of defence cuts, relief for the real estate industry, a reduction in the rate of capital gains tax to 15 per cent, a Dollars 500 tax allowance for families with children and a tax break for first-time home buyers. The sting came at the tail-end of the speech: unless Congress passed the measures by a March 15 deadline, the president would mount a partisan assault against the Democratic majority which would last until the November election - an echo of President Harry Truman's successful tactic of running against the 'do nothing Congress' in 1948. At the time, it seemed like a brilliant political manoeuvre. But what plays in Washington does not necessarily play in New Hampshire or elsewhere. Mr Bush's delay in unveiling his proposals left him open to the charge that he was a 'do nothing president'. Moreover, Mr Bush's tardiness revealed a profound political weakness: his inability, in the light of the Dollars 400bn budget deficit, to use a strong fiscal stimulus to revive the US economy. The president is a hostage of the ballooning deficit of the 1980s, in which he, as vice-president, played a significant role. The truth is that Mr Bush is saddled with policies dictated by the Federal Reserve, which was slow to ease interest rates last year. Like Mr Micawber, all he can do is to hope that something will turn up. He must hope that lower interest rates will generate a recovery by late spring or early summer which will cushion his re-election effort. Mr Buchanan's challenge in New Hampshire has exposed the dangers of the waiting game. It is bound to increase restiveness among congressional Republicans pushing for bolder tax-cutting measures to revive the economy. Mr Bush, who has made it clear he does not wish to amend the 1990 budget agreement, will doubtless stand firm; but he needs to demonstrate that he is not paralysed. The president's response is likely to fall into three categories, none of which is completely without risk. First, he will take off the gloves and attack his opponent's neo-isolationist, protectionist 'America First' message. The temptation may be to hedge on trade issues - shelving, for example, consideration of the Mexican free trade pact until after November; but the results in New Hampshire suggest this would be unwise. Although Mr Buchanan would disagree, the protest vote on the economy was more compelling than the protectionist message. This was confirmed by the performance of the two leading Democrats, former Senator Paul Tsongas, of Massachusetts, and Governor Bill Clinton, of Arkansas, both of whom refused to stoop to Japan-bashing. Second, Mr Bush, helped by press scrutiny, will confront the more troubling aspects of Mr Buchanan's past, notably his ambiguous remarks about Israel and his defence of alleged Nazi war criminals. Even his conservative supporters agree that Mr Buchanan has flirted with anti-Semitism. Third, Mr Bush will cast himself once again as the victorious commander-in-chief of Desert Storm. Mr Buchanan, like some Democrats, opposed the Gulf war. Yet Mr Buchanan has his own cards to play. He has already singled out five key primaries to contest against Mr Bush. In Florida and Texas, he will play up his opposition to immigration; in South Carolina and Georgia, he will single out Mr Bush's support of a civil rights bill with congressional Democratic majority, appealing, like Mr George Wallace in 1968, to disaffected whites; in Michigan, where the car industry is being crushed by Japanese competition, he will don the America First mantle. Mr Ed Rollins, President Reagan's campaign manager in 1984, says the battle has begun for the soul of the Republican party. Indeed, it is a battle to preserve the coalition of suburban voters and ethnic blue-collar Democrats who made up the Nixon-Reagan coalition which has triumphed in five of the past six presidential elections. This struggle may herald a realignment in the political landscape in the US. Already, similar tremors are taking place within the Democratic party. These were highlighted by the strong performance in New Hampshire by Governor Clinton and Mr Tsongas, whose free-trade, tax-cutting centrism marks a break with liberal orthodoxy which has dominated the party for the past 20 years. The current crop of Democratic candidates is no longer beholden to organised labour; nor to minorities or other liberal factions which have dominated the contemporary presidential selection process. These candidates - Mr Clinton, Mr Tsongas and Senator Robert Kerrey, of Nebraska - are wooing middle-class voters with detailed economic plans and pledging a higher standard of living for future generations. By contrast with the Republican party, which looks back wistfully at American greatness in the 1950s and the victory in the Cold War, the Democrats are looking to the future. But they still need a candidate who can bridge the stature-gap with Mr Bush, who has vowed to do everything necessary to win re-election.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Portugal's currency and the great escape: The escudo IF OLD prejudice ruled the currency markets, the Portuguese escudo should be having a terrible time, along with its southern neighbours in the exchange rate mechanism, the lira and the peseta. The Portuguese are, after all, much poorer than Spaniards or Italians. But no. While the lira has been catapulted from the system and the peseta has devalued 11 per cent since July, the tiny escudo has ridden out the European Monetary System's currency storm well within its 6 per cent ERM fluctuation band after hardening just one minor capital control. The Bank of Portugal now holds bigger foreign currency reserves than France. Speakers at a banking conference in Oporto yesterday estimated current holdings at at least Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14bn), the equivalent of about one year's imports. Happy government officials in Lisbon, from Prime MinAnibal Cavaco Silva down, insist this is simply market recognition of the sound state of Portugal's 'fundamentals' - almost full employment, falling inflation (9 per cent from 11.4 per cent in 1991), declining interest rates and public debt, and a current account surplus. Sceptics suggest that the escudo - which only joined the ERM in April - has escaped because speculators have not realised it is there to play with yet. They say the peseta's slide against the escudo makes a devaluation, soon, inevitable. Portugal does more than 20 per cent of its trade with Spain. In Lisbon, though, the government is brimming with purpose and policies. With the socialist opposition at war with itself, Mr Cavaco Silva's Social Democrats are slimming down the civil service and facing down opposition over introduction of university fees, military cuts and a new strike law. Underpinning this is the prime minister's consistent use of exchange rates to fight inflation. Appointed finance minister in 1979, after a string of devaluations, he quickly revalued the escudo by 6 per cent and has systematically boosted the currency since becoming prime minister in 1985. 'This is the first time since 1974,' says Mr Cavaco Silva, 'that a foreign economic crisis has not been magnified in Portugal. We have done tough things and every meeting of the Cabinet now is eliminating (public) services that we don't want. For its part, industry is now well aware that it cannot depend on the depreciation of the escudo to gain competitiveness.' The government is about to tighten the screws with a rigorous 1993 budget, which, the prime minister says, will be a 'negative increase' in monetary terms. The budget aims to cut the public sector deficit from above 5 per cent to less than 4 per cent of GDP, taking the country to within a whisker of one of the main targets of EC economic and monetary union (Emu). Spain's big and recent deficit problems have been a stark reminder to Lisbon of how quickly things can go bad. Spain has a more virtuous economic past than the Portuguese - opening its economy in the 60s, democratising smoothly in the 70s and savagely attacking industrial fat in the early 80s. Portugal, meanwhile, fought wars in Africa and overthrew its dictatorship in a left-wing revolution, which much of the 80s was spent reversing. Thus, Portugal is now steadying itself to deal with large-scale industrial restructuring and an inevitable rise in unemployment. Even the prime minister says jobs will go, and, in fact, that they probably should, if the country is to become competitive. 'Our rate of unemployment (below 4 per cent) is too low,' he says. 'We are prepared for higher unemployment if necessary.' That resolve is key to talks that begin soon between the government, unions and employers on 1993 wage increases. These talks can fix public service pay but set guidelines for the private sector. Lisbon will seek agreement around 6 per cent, with inflation targeted at between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist at Banco Comercial Portugues, thinks this is optimistic. 'The country is going through a very pronounced slowdown,' he says. The government has cut growth estimates for this year from 3.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent and investment is falling sharply. 'I think that when the currency markets stabilise we are going to see a dramatic devaluation,' says Mr Namorado Rosa. Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, until recently governor of the central bank, agrees. 'The escudo is perhaps too strong at the moment,' he says. 'It is not sustainable and will inevitably be reflected in a deterioration of the external accounts.' But as a 5 per cent devaluation would take the heat off labour intensive exporting industry and could lift inflation to 10 per cent next year, Lisbon is not keen to move before setting the private sector a tough wages target. Time, though, is very tight, if agreement is to be reached before Portugal becomes swept up in broad ERM realignment. For the moment there may be safety in obscurity. 'The escudo's life in the ERM has been so short that most market operators may not know it is there,' says Mr Namorado Rosa. Even if they do, Portugal's Dollars 25bn currency reserves may be worth more than all the tradeable escudos on the market even though central bank intervention has drawn down non-gold reserves because of recent turmoil in the foreign exchange markets. And while the government's decision to halve the overdrafts that foreign branches of Portuguese banks can hold with their parents damages the spirit of Lisbon's decision in the summer to lift all capital controls next year, it was a relatively serene decision. 'Portugal is run by economists,' notes Mr Joao Oliveira Rendeiro, who runs Gestifundo, a Lisbon fund manager, referring to the prime minister and his finance minister. Perhaps that makes a difference.</p>

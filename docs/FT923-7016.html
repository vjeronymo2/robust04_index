			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Output rises but fall in sales dims recovery hopes: Official figures point to economic inertia UK OUTPUT excluding oil and gas extraction rose in the second quarter for the first time in almost two years, but another fall in retail sales last month suggested that immediate prospects for economic recovery remain dim. Non-oil gross domestic product rose by 0.1 per cent in the three months to June 30, compared with the previous quarter, but weak oil production caused overall GDP to fall by 0.1 per cent. The year-on-year rate of decline was 0.7 per cent. Other figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday added to recent evidence of economic inertia. The volume of retail sales fell in July by 0.3 per cent from the previous month. The small rise in non-oil GDP in the second quarter ended seven successive quarters of falling output that began in the second quarter of 1990. Over that time, non-oil output fell by a total of 4.3 per cent. GDP including oil and gas production has not shown the same sustained fall because of a slight increase in output in the third quarter last year due to extra activity in the North Sea. Apart from that small upwards blip, overall GDP has fallen by 4.2 per cent since the second quarter of 1990. The cumulative fall in output is not yet as steep as the drop at the beginning of the 1980s when output fell by 5.5 per cent over five successive quarters. Mr Tony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the rise in non-oil output showed the economy was emerging from a 'long and serious' recession and that prospects for a recovery were looking brighter. For Labour, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday's figures revealed an economy 'tragically stuck' in the grip of recession. 'Even this government must recognise that action is urgently needed to restore confidence and deal with the unacceptable levels of unemployment, business collapses and personal bankruptcies,' he said. A breakdown of the provisional seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO showed that the small rise in non-oil GDP reflected an increase in manufacturing output in the second quarter. Manufacturing output, which accounts for just over one-fifth of total GDP, rose by 0.4 per cent in the three months to June 30, compared with the previous quarter. Service sector output was unchanged on the previous quarter, but was 0.6 per cent lower than for the same period of 1991. Output of the distribution, hotels and catering sector rose by 0.3 per cent on the previous quarter. The other significant components of GDP - including construction, transport and communication, and banking and business services - were estimated to have fallen slightly, or remained flat on the previous quarter. Oil and gas extraction fell by 4.3 per cent on the previous quarter but was 7.5 per cent higher than a year ago. UK INTEREST RATES Falling inflation has left Britain's economy facing higher real interest rates at this stage of the economic cycle than at any time since the 1930s.

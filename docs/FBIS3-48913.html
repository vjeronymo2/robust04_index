			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav </F> Daskalov by Major Spirdon Spirdonov; place and date not given:  "Government Received Important Support"]    [Text] [Spirdonov] What is your assessment of the  parliament's declaration on expanding cooperation with NATO?    [Daskalov] This represents support for the government's  present activity, because the government has always expressed  our interest in joining the European and Euro-Atlantic  structures. We will now work even more actively. A matter of  great importance is how the conference of NATO members on 10  January will end, what decisions they will adopt, whether NATO  will extend its influence on the East, and whether or not they  will adopt the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" initiative. Most  likely, we may expect a favorable outcome, but only then will it  become clear what rights and commitments the countries to which  the initiative is addressed will have. I cannot make any guess  now.    [Spirdonov] Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Avdeyev assured  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov that there is no danger of tension  in the two countries' relations. He made this assessment  immediately following the vote on the parliamentary declaration.  Do you admit the possibility of any problems arising in  bilateral relations, perhaps at a later date?    [Daskalov] The North Atlantic Alliance will do nothing that  disregards Russia's interests. Without Russia, we will find it  difficult to guarantee European security, and furthermore the  "Partnership for Peace" initiative is directed at Russia as  well. I think that our joining NATO cannot become a motive for  friction between our two states.    [Spirdonov] It is still too early to talk about what will  happen after 10 January, but nevertheless, if the results of the  NATO forum are to our advantage, what will be the first step  that our country will take?    [Daskalov] We will study how to react to the results of the  meeting, and I am duty bound to inform the National Assembly  deputies about it.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPENSIVE DRINK;  </P> <P> TWO HOUSTON WOMEN REPORTEDLY CHARGED WITH DRUGGING, ROBBING GUERRERO  </P> <P> Two women were charged Wednesday with drugging Pedro Guerrero's drink and  stealing $26,000 worth of items from the St. Louis Cardinals star in his hotel  room last month, according to a published report.  </P> <P> The Houston Chronicle reported in today's editions that Hall of Fame pitcher  Don Drysdale, now an announcer for the Dodgers, was victimized in a similar  scam Tuesday night at the Westin Galleria Hotel. No charges were filed in that  case, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> According to documents filed with the Harris County District Attorney's Office,  Guerrero had his World Series ring, a wedding band and a Rolex watch stolen  when the Cardinals were staying at the hotel Aug. 27.  </P> <P> Diane Jackson, 27, and Diana Cox, 26, were charged with felony theft Wednesday  after the theft was reported by Guerrero, the newspaper reported. Both women  are still at large.  </P> <P> Guerrero, 33, did not play Aug. 28 against the Astros, the only game he has  missed this season. He was treated at a hospital after suffering abdominal  pains, and team officials said at the time that he may have gotten food  poisoning.  </P> <P> Asked Wednesday night by The Associated Press about the situation, Guerrero  declined comment.  </P> <P> "Pedro's story is that he invited them to his room for drinks. They left and  then came back. The second time they were there he was groggy, but he saw them  going through his luggage, but he couldn't do anything about it," Harris County  assistant district attorney Alvin Nunnery was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> According to the newspaper, Guerrero identified the two women from police mug  shots sent to him in St. Louis.  </P> <P> Drysdale, 53, reported losing a Rolex watch and a ring.  </P> <P> "It was the wackiest thing," Drysdale said Wednesday. "One minute I was talking  to people in the bar. Then, I don't have the slightest idea what happened.  </P> <P> The former Dodger pitcher said he could not elaborate because he was  cooperating with a police investigation.  </P> <P> "There is a robbery ring around the mall (the Galleria), and the police are  close to cracking it," Drysdale said. "I just fell in with two of them. I was  drugged, and I can't say more than that."  </P></p>

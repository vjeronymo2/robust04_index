			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CASH REGISTERS DEAL ROBBER A RINGING DEFEAT  </P> <P> A well-dressed robber who couldn't figure out how to open the cash registers at  two fast-food outlets got smart on his third try Sunday morning and simply  ordered a North Hollywood doughnut shop owner to hand over the money, Los  Angeles police said.  </P> <P> In each instance, the robber pointed what seemed to be a gun held under his  light-blue suit and fled in a late-1970s gray or silver-blue Cadillac, police  said. His take from the third robbery was about $70.  </P> <P> The first attempt occurred shortly after 9 a.m. when the man walked into  California Donuts in the 13300 block of Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys with a  handgun partially hidden by his jacket, Police Sgt. Christopher Vasquez said.  </P> <P> Owner Sopphirrith Lor ran to the back room, either to hide or escape, Vasquez  said. The robber tried unsuccessfully to open the register and left, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'This Is a Holdup'  </P> <P> About an hour later, the man went to Perry's Mexican Food in the 12500 block of  Roscoe Boulevard in Sun Valley and said, "This is a holdup," according to owner  Oliver Nichols.  </P> <P> "I told him the money's in the register," Nichols, 61, said. "I walked back to  the cook and told him to push the button because I have an alarm system."  </P> <P> The robber looked confused when the computerized register wouldn't open, and he  left empty-handed, Nichols said.  </P> <P> Finally, at Fresh 'n Fancy Donuts in North Hollywood, the man walked in about  10:40 a.m. and yelled: "Get all your money for me! I'm going kill you if you  don't give me all your money," recalled the owner, who asked that his name not  be used.  </P> <P> The 47-year-old owner handed over the money in his register -- about $70.  </P> <P> He was able to jot down the license-plate number of the robber's car, which was  parked in front of the shop on Laurel Canyon Boulevard near Roscoe Boulevard.  </P> <P> The owner, whose first wife and two children were killed by the Khmer Rouge,  fled Cambodia in 1975. He repaired televisions and his second wife worked as a  waitress, saving money to buy the doughnut shop in 1982. He said the store has  been struck by thieves about four times a year since then.  </P> <P> "It's hard to stay in small business," he said quietly. "But I still believe  there are a lot of good people in this country."  </P> <P> Police described the robber as a white male, 35 to 40 years old, about 6 feet  tall and 180 pounds.  </P></p>

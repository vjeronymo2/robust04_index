			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Public is the beneficiary of local government review Sir, As leader of Macclesfield Borough Council, the 25th largest shire district in England, I know that the establishment of a unitary council in our area would be of great benefit to our residents and businesses. This view is shared not only by the council but also by our local business community, led by large employers such as Zeneca and Ciba, both of which have their headquarters in the Borough of Macclesfield. Macclesfield has a population of more than 151,000, as big as many metropolitan districts. Unlike them, though, we do not control the majority of decisions affecting our area as 90 per cent of our council tax goes straight into Cheshire County Council's coffers. The two-tier system is an anachronism which only serves to frustrate efficient and responsive local government. The proposal of the Local Government Commission to create five unitaries in Cheshire should be warmly welcomed as the opportunity to free us from the unnecessary and costly bureaucracy. Margaret Duddy, Town Hall, Macclesfield SK10 1DX</p>

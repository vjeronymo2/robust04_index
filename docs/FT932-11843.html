			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: France gets permission to restrict banana imports FRANCE IS to restrict direct imports of bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific producers until a new European Community-wide quota regime comes into force on July 1. The European Commission decided yesterday that France could peg direct imports of ACP-produced bananas in May and June at the average import volume for those months over the last three years. French officials said they were also seeking permission to block parallel imports of ACP bananas from other EC countries, principally Belgium and Italy. The commission is still considering that request, which, if granted, could lead to the reimposition of internal border controls lifted on January 1 when the single European market came into force. The French banana market has slumped this year, with prices dropping from FFr6 to FFr3.50 (42p) a kilogram this month. France has blamed a steep increase in cheap imports, particularly from the Dominican Republic, a charge certain to be denied by the Caribbean state. The influx of cheap bananas has hit France's traditional suppliers in the overseas territories of Martinique and Guadeloupe and in former colonies such as the Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Mr Dominique Perben, minister for French overseas territories, said yesterday that these were one-off measures which would start having an effect on the French market from the beginning of next week. However, ACP banana exporters will be free to compete in the EC from July 1 under the controversial quota regime agreed in February, which is intended to protect them from Latin American competition. 'There will of course be a drop in price on the French market from July 1, but the difference is that (traditional ACP producers) will be compensated for their losses,' said a French official yesterday. The French action has been taken under the safeguard clauses of the 1989 Lome Convention between the ACP countries and the EC. The commission had already given France and Britain temporary rights under the Treaty of Rome to limit parallel imports of Latin American bananas.</p>

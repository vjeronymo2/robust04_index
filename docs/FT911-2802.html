			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Motoring: What to do when feeling flat TYRES DO not go down often now but when they do, it is easy not to know about it until too late. In a modern car with power steering, gradual leakage of air because of a puncture is almost undetectable on a motorway. But the tyre is steadily getting hotter and eventually it may blow out. Or, when you leave the motorway on a curving slip road with a tyre grossly under-inflated, you might lose control. If drivers knew immediately a tyre was losing pressure, they could stop at the next service area, go to an off-motorway garage or at least find somewhere safer than the hard shoulder on which to change the wheel. Deflation warning systems do exist; Porsche has one on the 928. The company uses tiny, air pressure sensitive transmitters inside the tyre. When the pressure falls, they send a signal to a receiver in the car and a warning is flashed to the driver. However, these cost too much to be practical for all but the most expensive cars. At least, they have until now, but a bright idea by development engineers at Sumitomo Rubber Europe BV may change that. Sumitomo Rubber, which makes Dunlop tyres in Europe, has evolved a much simpler and potentially cheaper deflation warning system. Ingeniously, it uses hardware already in place on any car fitted with electronically controlled anti-lock brakes or a traction control system. Anti-lock (ABS) systems detect when a car's wheels are rotating at different speeds under braking. Any wheel that is about to lock up and skid has its brake released until the tyre grips again. Then the brake is reapplied. This brakes on, brakes off cycle takes place many times a second if need be. Traction control systems work in the same way, except they prevent wheelspin being caused by too much engine power overcoming tyre grip. Sumitomo uses the ABS brakes computer to detect a puncture by monitoring the rolling radius of all four tyres on a car. When a tyre's inflation pressure decreases, so does the rolling radius. As the tyre gets smaller, the wheel turns faster. The computer passes the information to the Sumitomo system which tells the driver he has a puncture. The method has been tried before but the problem is that a 10 per cent pressure loss reduces the tyre's radius by only 0.1 per cent, which can also be caused by the car accelerating or cornering. Sumitomo has found a way of making the computer understand when the tyre's shrinkage is caused by a puncture and prevent it from giving a warning when it is due to normal driving forces. Before Sumitomo took over its tyre making business, Dunlop had a lot of experience with its clever but commercially unsuccessful Denovo run-flat tyre. Motorists and car makers have made it clear that although they know all about the theoretical benefits of specialised run-flat tyres, they won't put up with their complication and expense. The Sumitomo deflation warning system (DWS) is essentially a software package that can be used either by its own computer or the one that operates the anti-lock brakes. Systems like Porsche's that use air pressure sensitive transmitters cost several hundred pounds. It is too early for Sumitomo to put a price on its own system, but it would clearly be much less. Low enough, in fact, for it to be a practical optional extra for any car with ABS brakes. Car makers in the US, Japan and Europe have the Sumitomo system under evaluation. Sumitomo will not say when the system is likely to appear on cars. But its safety potential seems so great it may not be long before DWS joins ABS and TCS (traction control system) on the list of standard equipment for up-market cars.</p>

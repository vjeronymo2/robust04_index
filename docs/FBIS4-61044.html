			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of </F> the Russian Federation Armed Forces Armaments, by correspondent  Valentin Rudenko under the "Russian Weapons" rubric, date and  place of interview not stated: "It Is Not Enough To Replace  Anger with Kindness or How Further Reduction of Volumes of  Financing for State Defense Order Could End"]    [Text] It is no secret that in recent years the defense  complex has been seen by public opinion as virtually a monster  growing fat on the people's money, which means our money.  Today, thank god, it seems everyone has worked out who is who.  Now calls of another kind are being heard -- calls to save the  defense industry which, as a result of the overwhelming  reduction in the defense order, unconsidered conversion, and  diversification, has been brought to a critical state. Many  enterprises have come to a halt, others are on the verge of  stoppage. Every third designer, engineer, and worker has left  the military-industrial complex. But despite that in the budget  for 1994 it is planned approximately to halve appropriations for  defense. And it is planned to reduce appropriations for  research and development 130 percent and appropriations for  purchases of weapons and military equipment 450 percent. What  threat does this entail for the army, design bureaus, scientific  research institutes, plants, and Russia as a whole? That was  the question which began our correspondent's talk with Colonel  General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of armaments of the Russian  Federation Armed Forces.    [Sitnov] If the defense budget is approved in precisely this  form the Defense Ministry will be obliged, having paid its debts  for 1993 and for deliveries which have already been made in  1994, to release the remaining appropriations to ensure nuclear  safety and the safety of the Navy's ships and vessels undergoing  construction and repair and nearly ready for delivery and to  finance work on guarantee supervision and the solution of  priority tasks in the operation of armaments and military  equipment.    Contracts for the delivery of the remainder (over 80  percent)  of the arms and military equipment envisaged by the state order  will have to be dissolved. But the Russian Federation  Government must make an official decision on the complete repeal  of the state order for 1994.    It is obvious that all this will entail catastrophic  consequences. The development and production of arms and  military equipment will be halted and all scientific and  technical programs of a defense nature will be curtailed at over  3,000 industrial enterprises and organizations and over 4  million people will be left without work.    In addition it will be necessary to channel additional funds  (about 6,000 billion rubles [R]) from the state budget to  maintain the fixed capital of enterprises (heating, water,  electricity, security, and so forth) and to pay unemployment  benefits.    [Rudenko] What are the armed forces' real requirements today  for new combat equipment and weapons systems and to what degree  are they being met by industry?    [Sitnov] To meet the armed forces' required level of combat  readiness and capability by the year 2006 the provision of  weapons and military equipment should be 80-100 percent. These  indicators can be achieved on condition that average annual  volumes of deliveries are increased 50-100 percent compared with  existing ones.    Here the proportion of modern models will be less than 50  percent. To achieve a level of 60 percent modern models for all  main types of weapons as is the case in the Western countries'  armed forces, we must increase average annual deliveries three  to five times.    Realizing that under the conditions of restricted financing  this is unlikely, the Defense Ministry's main efforts are aimed  today at ensuring priorities in the development of arms and  military equipment, modernizing existing arms, expanding their  standardization among the branches of the armed forces, and  reducing their range, increasing the reliability and quality of  repair and technical servicing with a view to extending  operational life.    [Rudenko] Which avenues for the development of arms and  military equipment are regarded as the priority ones and how are  they being financed?    [Sitnov] We rate as priorities in the armed forces'  armaments system the strategic forces and facilities,  intelligence and communications facilities, automated control  systems, the improvement of the efficiency of various classes of  conventional arms, means for the serviceman's combat and  technical equipping meeting the requirements of modern combat,  and the preparation of the necessary scientific and technical  groundwork for key elements of promising models of weapons.    Right now a special "list of models of arms and military  equipment whose production must be retained in any economic  situation" has been drawn up. Thus in 1993 about 80 percent of  appropriations envisaged for research and development was spent  on financing priority work. This year, in connection with the  uncertain nature of volumes of financing for the state defense  order, it is planned to earmark 60-70 percent of appropriations  for these purposes.    [Rudenko] A recent Defense Ministry conference showed arms  purchases graphs. They virtually all showed a downward curve.  Where is the critical level below which there is catastrophe?    [Sitnov] However painful it is to say this, already the  production of a number of types of arms and military equipment  is below the minimum permissible level. We regard as critical  the level below which the disintegration of manufacturing  processes and production cooperation begins.    In 1992-1993 arms production volumes were reduced by a  factor  of seven to eight. Therefore the Defense Ministry, the State  Committee for the Defense Industry, and the Ministry of the  Economy elaborated the state order for 1994, which basically  makes it possible to preserve the defense potential in the  country's interests. But its execution is now under threat of  disruption. Insufficient volumes of financing have in practice  already led to the nonfulfillment of the plan for the first half  of the year.    [Rudenko] Is the advance funding of the state defense order  being carried out, as prescribed by the relevant edict of the  Russian president?    [Sitnov] Ensuring advance funding for work on the  development and production of output (commodities, operations,  services) within the limits of up to 20 percent of the annual  volume of budget appropriations for the purchase of arms,  military equipment, and scientific and technical output for  military purposes is something that we are not yet able to do.  As of 1 April this year, for instance, only 4 percent of the  required volume of funds had been earmarked for advance funding  of the defense order.    As for research and development, there is virtually no  advance financing. All income funds (about 5 percent of those  requested) go to cover expenses on work which has already been  carried out or is being carried out.    [Rudenko] Many leaders of defense firms complain not so much  of the lack of the defense order as of the lack of certainty.  There is the long-standing question of hiving off so-called  public plants which would make up the nucleus of the defense  complex and have a guaranteed state order. Has the list of  these plants been approved?    [Sitnov] Such a list has been compiled. It is now being  coordinated in the ministries and departments concerned. But  even if a decision is made at government level to transform  these enterprises and organizations into public ones, the  question remains of the smooth financing, in the necessary  volumes, of the state defense order which they are fulfilling.    [Rudenko] What measures should be taken to stabilize the  state of affairs in the defense complex and to fulfill the state  defense order for 1994?    [Sitnov] Above all it is essential really to implement the  guaranteed budget financing (the even receipt of money over the  year with the funds' prompt and full indexing with inflation)  and material and technical provision of the state defense order.  The Russian Federation Defense Ministry must be allocated  appropriations for advance payment of those who carry out the  work. All benefits connected with the fulfillment of work on  the products list of the state defense order must be extended to  the fulfillment of work on the products list of the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry's direct order.    Banks of any form of ownership must be set a three-day  deadline for forwarding Defense Ministry payments to those who  have carried out the work and fines must be introduced for  violating this deadline. Special accounts must be opened for  those who carry out the work into which advances and current  payments from the Russian Federation Defense Ministry would be  paid. Money from these accounts should be used only for  expenses connected with the fulfillment of the state defense  order. The creation of a standard legal base for planning and  implementing the state defense order must be completed.    We realize that in the present economic and financial  situation it is difficult to fulfill all these conditions. But  it must be done. Otherwise Russia will not simply large behind  the leading Western countries but will lose the ability to  produce modern arms and military equipment systems.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Italy Voting Sunday. Italy's politicians have conducted a lack-lustre campaign with budgets and political energies exhausted by the March general elections. The parties on the left and in the centre which emerged as the opposition two months ago have based their campaigns on the calculation that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and its allies are in an unassailable position. Thus they have avoided polemics and raised few European issues, concentrating instead on rallying their faithful rather than gaining new voters. Mr Berlusconi, heading the Forza Italia list in all five electoral colleges, is using the elections as a personal referendum. LIKELY RESULT: Polls give Forza Italia 25 per cent, 5 points up from March. The PDS has around 23 per cent. The third largest party is the MSI at 13, with the Northern League around 7.</p>

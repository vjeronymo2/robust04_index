			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Western funds key to plutonium storage Sir, Disarmament of nuclear weapons is a very good thing, but it also poses its own dangers ('Russians deny arms plutonium was theirs', August 16). On average a nuclear warhead contains 3kg of plutonium and 15kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU). In total, disarmament is releasing an extra 12 tonnes of plutonium and 60 tonnes of HEU per year. Regulations governing the civil nuclear industry are rightly very strict. However, surprisingly, there is no international regulation governing the disposal and storage of plutonium or HEU retrieved from nuclear bombs. Given the almost insurmountable problem third world countries have in producing their own weapons grade material, there must be a strong desire to lay their hands on the ready made stuff. In Russia there is no proper long-term storage facility for plutonium. Stocks are being kept in interim storage facilities, many of which are totally inadequate from a security and safety perspective. Russia is designing a proper plutonium waste repository, but it has run into difficulty in funding the design costs. It is also very doubtful whether the Russian government will make available the many millions of dollars needed to see the repository built. International funding is, therefore, the key question. To their credit, the Russians have offered the US or the International Atomic Energy Agency the right to supervise and control how the plutonium is stored, in return for financial assistance. The latest reports of plutonium smuggling suggest this is worth pursuing. The good news relates to the HEU. The Russians have signed a deal, worth between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 9bn over 20 years, with the US to dilute HEU. The US plans to use the diluted material as fuel in its reactors, a real case of swords into ploughs. Roger Hayes, British Nuclear Industry Forum, London SW1E 6LB</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Isosceles finance director to go in board shuffle ISOSCELES, the heavily-indebted parent of the Gateway food retail chain, is to lose Mr Bob Nellist, its finance director. According to one of the group's advisers, it was decided that there was no need to have separate finance directors of Gateway and Isosceles. It is expected that Mr Geoff Cooper, Gateway's finance director, will fill Mr Nellist's position. Mr David Simons, who recently joined as chief executive, is a former finance director of Storehouse. Mr Simons replaced Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes who has returned to his non-executive role. The financial restructuring of Isosceles continues to be negotiated between the company, its lenders and its shareholders. The group hopes to complete the talks by the end of March. The company, which has debts of about Pounds 1.3bn, recently agreed the terms of a standstill arrangement with its lenders under which it will defer interest on its loans and its capital repayments until May 28. The banks have also provided additional working capital facilities. The restructuring is expected to involve a sizeable debt-for-equity-swap, with mezzanine lenders' and shareholders' interests diluted.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'RETHINKING SCHOOL CHOICE'  </P> <P> The solution to most of Hughes' concerns over open enrollment-school choice  proposals is one of LAUSD's success stories: magnet schools. Simply make all  LAUSD schools magnet schools.  </P> <P> Magnet schools are balanced racially by quota. Selection is by lottery within  those quotas. LAUSD already uses a simple brochure and application which is  circulated to all parents. No independent advertising should be necessary or  allowed.  </P> <P> DAVID M.

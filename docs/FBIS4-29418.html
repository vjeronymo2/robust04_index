			<p>CSO     [Text] North Korea announced a "decree" that, excluding  "war-reserve rice," there would be no further reduction of food  rations given residents for any reason whatsoever.    Published under the name of the Social Security Department  and entitled, "On the State Not Burdening the People in Rations  or Taxes [Kukkaeso Inmindurui Singnyangkwa Se Pudamul Haji Malde  taehayo]," the gist of this decree was the complete denial of  food-ration reductions at the central party level and the  promise that, in the future, rations would not be reduced for  any reason whatsoever.    According to the revelations of one diplomat of an Asian  nation who had been stationed in Pyongyang, this decree was  announced around May 1992 and its contents are as follows.    "The state has never reduced rations in an organized way.  The  state has only deducted 2 percent from rations. If there was  anything deducted beyond that, it was done by some cadre in  order to look good to the state. In the future, we will ensure  that, excluding the natural reduction of 2 percent occurring in  the process of transportation from farm to family, there will be  no deductions made from rations for any reason whatsoever."    The DPRK's announcement of this decree of an end to  food-ration deductions is understood to be a result of increased  public dissatisfaction due to the reduction of food rations and  of the public's occasional expression of resistance related to  this, critical of the system.    Since about 1973, the DPRK has deducted as "war-reserve  rice"  a two-day portion (four-day portion per month) from the public's  15-day food rations. Beginning in 1987, however, it has deducted  an additional 10 percent from monthly rations, under the name  "economization rice [Choryak Mi]." This lead to worsened food  conditions. Beginning in 1990, the DPRK has actually been  deducting 30 percent of food rations supplied, calling it  "Patriotic Rice" and other names.    Beginning in late 1992 in particular, the DPRK Government,  advocating a revival of self-sufficiency in each province, city,  and county, instructed them to provide for their own food  rations. Depending on the area, it cut off food rations three  months each year and even moved from a two-meals-a-day to a  one-meal-a-day campaign.    Because of this, saying "It's the same whether we starve to  death or are caught for robbery and killed," the residents have  been making group attacks on granaries, seizing rations.    One example of this was an occurrence reported to have taken  place in September of last year in Kanggye-si, Chagang Province.  Some workers unable to get their food rations secretly went  into a granary and stole grain. When rumor of this spread to the  whole city, its residents crowded into the granary as a group,  looting it of food rations.    Meanwhile, even amid this food shortage and the  dissatisfaction of its citizens, DPRK continues to store and  conceal three years worth of food rations as war-reserve rice.    War-reserve rice is generally stored in three forms:     -  war-reserve rice for soldiers working in the forward area  above the Demilitarized Zone is stored in underground tunnels in  Cholwon, Kangwon Province and other areas;    -  reserve rice for  other soldiers is stored in "No. 2 Warehouses" set up classified  according to food-administration center in each province,  municipality, and county; and    -  separate reserve rice is stored  and concealed in major strategic zones planned to be attack and  withdrawal areas.     War-reserve rice is replaced every year with new rice. Those  stealing reserve rice are punished as ideological criminals, so  there has been no loss due to this.</p>

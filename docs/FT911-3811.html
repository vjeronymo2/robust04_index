			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: San Miguel debt plan overturned A PLAN by San Miguel, the Philippine brewing conglomerate, to issue convertible debt has been voted down by shareholders after the company's former chairman had argued that the issue would prejudice his interests. The vote at the San Miguel annual meeting on Friday represents another winning round by former chairman, Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, in the fight to reassume a substantial role in the management of San Miguel. At stake, according to Mr Cojuangco's lawyer, was ultimate control of San Miguel, the Philippines' biggest industrial company. Under the management's debt plan, shares in San Miguel nominally owned by Mr Cojuangco, but held in trust by the government, would not have qualified for the convertible issue. Mr Cojuangco's 18 per cent equity stake in San Miguel was taken into guardianship by the Good Government Commission in 1986 because of allegations that the shares were acquired illegally. The shares remain in dispute and were thus unavailable for Friday's shareholder vote. Since the plan involved the eventual issue of 7.5 per cent of San Miguel's outstanding shares, it threatened to dilute seriously Mr Cojuangco's potential shareholding. Mr Andres Soriano, the chairman of San Miguel, said the company's management believed the 3bn pesos (Dollars 110m) convertible debt issue was 'in the best interests of the company', and that its rejection 'could hurt some of our plans'. The issue, together with 2bn pesos from internally generated sources, was earmarked for an expansion and modernisation programme. The Good Government Commission holds stakes in 300 Philippine companies pending a determination of whether they represent unlawful proceeds. Mr Estelito Mendoza, Mr Cojuangco's lawyer, said the decision was likely to have a knock-on effect for another Cojuangco case pending before the Supreme Court. This relates to shares seized by the commission in the United Coconut Planters Bank, which, if freed, would unlock the bank's indirectly-owned 30 per cent stake in San Miguel. Along with the 18 per cent stake and residual proxies, this would give Mr Cojuangco effective control of San Miguel together with eight of the 15 seats on its board of directors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono  granted an interview to SANKEI SHIMBUN at party headquarters on  14 June. In severely criticizing the proposal by Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and other  coalition members for forming the so-called  "conservative-conservative alliance" [with some LDP members],  Kono stated: "The minority coalition is calling for such an  alliance in a bid to prolong its life. Its attitude of seeking  a "conservative-conservative alliance" while urging the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to return to the coalition is  illogical. I cannot help thinking the proposal is intended to  induce a split within other parties. At present, I have no  intention of seriously studying it." Then, he indicated there  is no possibility of allying with Shinseito, saying: "No matter  what good policies [the coalition adopts], it is not good that a  democratic method has not been taken."    With regard to whether the LDP intends to hold  policy-coordination talks with the SDPJ and other parties, Kono  pointed out: "It depends on the nature of (the post-Hata)  administration." He stated: 1) If the [post-Hata]  administration intends to become an election-administrating  cabinet, it is not necessary for the LDP to closely reconcile  policy differences with other parties because each party  competes in an election with its own policies; in this case, it  is advisable to reach an accord on some points of policies; and,  2) if the administration intends to become a full-fledged  cabinet, it is necessary to thoroughly adjust policy differences  with other parties.    In commenting on some LDP members, including former Deputy  Prime Minister Michio Watanabe and Political Reform Headquarters  Chairman Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, showing a positive stance on the  so-called "conservative-conservative alliance," Kono stressed:  "I am sure that they will not act personally if [the coalition]  makes approaches to LDP individuals, not to the whole party."    Regarding the possibility of submitting a no-confidence  motion against the Hata Cabinet after Diet passage of the fiscal  1994 national budget bill, Kono said: "The Hata Cabinet is not  an orthodox administration under parliamentary democracy.  Through interpellation to the prime minister's policy speech,  we have already conveyed to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata our  demand that he make a grave decision after budget deliberations  end. There is no change in our intention. We and other  opposition parties share the view that (the cabinet) should be  changed after budget deliberations end." He thus reiterated a  strong determination to submit a no-confidence motion against  the Hata Cabinet. However, Kono hinted that at present, the LDP  has no prospects for cooperating with the SDPJ and other parties  in dealing with the no-confidence motion. He said: "Now is the  time to obtain consent from many people on the no-confidence  motion to overthrow the Hata Cabinet. After that, we would like  to have a free-hand."</p>

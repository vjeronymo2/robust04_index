			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Doubts about the Eurofighter MILITARY technology knows of all kinds of sights; the most awkward of these is hindsight. If one could go back now and plan from scratch for a fighter to meet European air forces' requirements, the result would doubtless be different from the current European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme. It might be a less ambitious aircraft, or a different partnership. Britain and France have every cause to rue the mutual hubris that made them take separate paths in 1985, leaving France to produce its own, smaller, high-performance fighter and Britain to continue EFA with Germany, Italy and (after some hesitation) Spain. This regret is all the more acute for Britain as Bonn is vacillating over the project. Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's new defence minister, says he is sceptical whether a 'super-bird' is needed in view of the 'changed political circumstances'. EFA was designed as a next-generation, highly agile fighter to fill a very specific gap - an aircraft to match the latest MiG and Sukhoi fighters which would escort any Soviet bomber attack. That threat has receded to the point of implausibility, and Russian aircraft no longer breathe down Nato's collar at forward bases in central Europe. Even when full development of EFA was launched four years ago, German politicians were questioning whether it was worth the cost. Since then EFA has evolved into a symbol for many Germans of wasteful Cold War spending. Recently, the climate appears to have become even more hostile to the project. A working group report to the governing coalition parties is due on June 1. It may not come out flatly against EFA, but is not expected to bring joy to EFA supporters, either. Final stages But EFA is by now almost ready to fly. With Pounds 8bn already spent on the prototype phase, it is unlikely at this stage that any aircraft of comparable performance would prove cheaper than proceeding with EFA production. None of the partners envisages the option of buying no fighters at all. The question is whether they need the performance. EFA's backers argue that the 'threat', in terms of the quality of potential adversaries, has not dwindled; the MiGs and Sukhois are still being produced, enhanced and widely marketed. They also claim EFA to be a thoroughly versatile aircraft. It had to be, since the partners had to reconcile different requirements, including the UK's that it should be able to double up as a ground-attack aircraft. Intriguing options Among the alternatives Bonn is considering - ranging from the French and Swedish contributions to the new agile generation, to a jazzed-up version of the 20-year-old Tornado - the safest would be current, well-proven US jets such as multi-purpose F/A-18 Hornets. But by the same token, these are not new aircraft, and have limited scope for further evolution. The most intriguing option is the MiG-29, undercutting all the competition on price. But Russia's reliability as a source of spares is so questionable as to make the idea still look eccentric. If Bonn does pull out, EFA could reach the borderline of viability. Reductions in Italian, Spanish and possibly UK requirements could bring the production run, not counting potential exports, to little more than half the original objective of 800. That, the manufacturing consortium reckons, would only just be enough to bring the basic production price per aircraft down to the target Pounds 20m-Pounds 25m. German withdrawal would at the very least deal a damaging blow, both to the aerospace industry which Bonn has been trying to nurture and to international collaboration. If it brought the project down with it, the repercussions on British Aerospace, GEC-Marconi and other UK defence contractors would be very grave. It would also raise doubts about the capacity of European industry ever to mount such a venture again. But to avoid that requires a blitz on costs. The expensive arrangement, derived from the Tornado programme, whereby work is meticulously allocated among the partners and each carries out its own final assembly and flight tests needs urgent rethinking. Having got this far, EFA is probably worth pursuing, but not at any price.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Management: Cadbury critique - In London last night Sir Owen Green, former BTR chairman, delivered the Pall Mall Lecture on UK corporate governance. The following are edited extracts It is important to recognise that the Cadbury Report (on UK corporate governance) of 1992 does not have the force of law but that it will have legal consequences. Our company law concepts and our bases of liability stem from the fundamental premise of a unitary board. The consequence of an endeavour to obtain a 'half-way house' between unitary and two-tier boards must create legal confusion. In the event that the courts are involved in any issues of governance they will take the (Cadbury) Code as representing the reasonable requirements of directors. One questions whether non-executive directors appreciate that their personal liability may have been substantially increased. Their basic duty of care and skill would formerly have been governed by the concept of subjective reasonableness as determined by their personal background and experience. Executive directors owe a more onerous duty to be judged by objective reasonableness, irrespective of their personal abilities. The strength of this distinction may have been diluted, perhaps extinguished, in the case of members of audit, remuneration and nomination committees whose personal liability may have been increased. * * * * * Cadbury further defines the role of auditors as that of providing the shareholders with an external and objective check on the directors' financial statements. It then adds that the framework in which auditors operate is not well designed to provide objectivity because: a) Accounting standards currently allow too much scope for presentation and auditors cannot stand firm against the client's choice of accounting treatment if that is within permitted standards. b) Auditors have to work closely with management and will wish to have a constructive relationship with their clients. Why might auditors wish to 'stand firm'? If their objection is strong enough why would they not seek to add a rider to their report? Why are there so many bodies currently engaged in producing new standards, often additional and usually controversial? Who are seeking these innovations? Is it the shareholders in whose interests, mainly if not exclusively, these standards exist? Have we not arrived at a point at which the average investor - even the average analyst - is bemused by a growing complex of figures accompanied by ever-lengthening notes couched in professional language, supported by a chairman's report, a chief executive's report, a finance director's statement, an environmental report and now a corporate governance statement? As for b), it is indeed sad to read words in which the barely concealed meaning implies that auditors are hired by managements whose wishes are to be taken as instructions, provided they do not breach the broad and versatile accounting standards. Another feature of the poor framework for objectivity expressed by Cadbury reads: 'To the extent however that audit firms compete on price and on meeting the needs of their clients (this must mean the management), this may be at the expense of meeting the needs of the shareholders.' These reflections offered by 12 good men and true indicate the level of general regard to which the auditing profession has fallen. Shareholders should expect their company's auditors (not the management's auditors) to challenge the management views where the auditors' principles are involved and to reject those views where they encourage or condone management bias against shareholder interests. An in-depth review of the auditing profession is well overdue. The risk of confusion of the role of auditor with that of management consultants et al must be eliminated. Secure the auditor's independence by requiring any change to be made by a special or extraordinary resolution of the company. Consider limitation of his liability in certain circumstances. Restore his role as professional watchdog (but not bloodhound), releasing non-executive directors to more constructive purposes. * * * * * * Many people might take the view that the spectacular corporate failures of recent years, rare as they have been, were more due to the neglect of requirements of commercial, corporate or common law or inadequacy of due diligence. The Cadbury recommendations will not eliminate those hazards or shortcomings. However, it should be recognised that the talent that can identify, achieve, or introduce wealth-creating innovation is rare. Fear of failure, which has often been a strong motivator, can also lead to reactionary behaviour which fosters regulatory inhibitions which are then presented as safeguards. There is danger in an over-emphasis on monitoring; on non-executive directors' independence from the business of the corporation; on controls over decision making activities of companies. When coupled with the clearly reduced status of executives on the governing boards, such requirements must blunt the competitive edge and deflect the entrepreneurial drive which characterises participation, let alone success, in a free market. The emphasis on the special role of the non-executive director has by definition to be on non-executive matters. In stressing his independent judgment, his appointment for a specific term, his requirement to review the performance of the board and the executive, Cadbury casts his role as chiefly that of a watchdog. One only has to read the media reaction to corporate failures of recent years and months to accept that the general expectation of these appointments is as watchdogs and it will be the most human of consequences that the watchdog role will be predominant. The fading reality of a unitary board will be further diluted by continuing emphasis on the distinctive roles of non-executives in governance. In that event the introduction, de facto, of the upper tier Teutonic shield of the great and the good will not be long delayed. What an irony it would be if the behaviour of non-executive directors under the influence of some of the Cadbury proposals succeeds in persuading executives of the advantage of such a change.</p>

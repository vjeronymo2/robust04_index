			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Fuel prices to come down Gas and electricity prices 'are coming down and will continue to come down,' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday. Mr Heseltine decided that as head of the department he, rather than Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, should take the lead role in trying to limit the political damage caused by the imposition of 8 per cent value added tax on domestic fuel which took effect yesterday. Mr Heseltine accused opposition parties of spreading 'scare stories' about energy prices. He said that since 1986, when the gas industry was privatised, domestic gas prices had fallen 23 per cent in real terms. In the last year alone they had fallen 4 per cent in cash terms and 6.5 per cent in real terms. Domestic electricity prices had fallen 6 per cent in real terms in the past two financial years.</p>

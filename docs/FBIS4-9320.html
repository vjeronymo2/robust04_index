			<p>BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 24 Apr (TANJUG) -- Biljana Plavsic, vice  president of the republic of Srpska, said today that by  withdrawing its forces from around Gorazde the republic of  Srpska showed the world that it is in favor of the peaceful  resolution of the crisis, even though its army did not carry out  any aggression there but was on the defensive. In a Jagodina  Radio program called "Weekend" she noted that "some people  regret not having seen bombardment last night, which forebodes  fresh provocations" and added that for this reason a summit  between Russia, America, the European Union, and the United  Nations should be held as soon as possible, in order to clarify  the issues completely and restore a permanent peace.</p>

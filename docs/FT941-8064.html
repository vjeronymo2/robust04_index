			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Enlargement talks snagged on fishing European Union foreign ministers were last night struggling to agree a common line on fish in the EU membership negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway, which restart today in the increasingly remote hope of concluding by March 1. Intractable opposition from Spain, France and Ireland to Norwegian ambitions on future fisheries arrangements could prevent agreement on entry terms with the four, EU negotiators predicted. Norway wants to retain control over its rich fisheries resources, but at the same time to have full access to the EU market for its fish products from the day it becomes a member, as well as access to Union waters. Spain, which joined the EU in 1986, will not get full access to the latter until 2003. Madrid persuaded its partners yesterday that Norway, and in lesser measure Sweden and Finland, could not be offered a deal which 'discriminates' against existing member states. The 12 foreign ministers also mandated the European Commission to seek the 'best possible access' for Union fishing fleets in Nordic waters - tacit acceptance of Spain's insistence that it has historic rights in Norwegian waters, from which its vessels were barred after 1981. Norway has repeatedly refused to countenance any further access for the EU. But the Twelve could not agree on market access for Norwegian fish. France and Ireland produced a joint paper yesterday calling for restrictions on Norwegian salmon, herring and mackerel entering the EU. The UK too has concerns about cheap Norwegian salmon imports but held back from supporting import quotas. Ministers were last night trying to agree on some form of safeguards regime against sudden import surges. Even before yesterday's talks began, the vexed negotiations to bring Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the EU had been complicated by other hardline Spanish demands, among them Madrid's insistence that money the rich new northerners put into the Brussels budget should be spent in the poorer south of the Union. But as what should have been the beginning of the last lap of the enlargement talks began in Brussels yesterday, tactically ill-timed requests by Sweden and Austria that their budget contributions should be phased in served only to prematurely sharpen the money issue. The Swedes in particular, who want exemption from three fifths of their EU payment for three years, appear to have made Spain's partners more receptive to the agenda Madrid is trying to set in the talks. If membership terms are not settled by the first week of next month, it will be virtually impossible for the four to enter the EU by January next year. Missing the deadline, says the senior EU negotiator, 'could decrease their interest (in joining), and increase our lust for a bigger cake' in terms of the Nordic and Alpine countries' money and resources. The UK and Germany, which contribute most to the EU's Ecu70bn (Pounds 53bn) budget, are already positioning themselves to demand that the newcomers' net contributions - worth Ecu1.7bn on the Commission's first serious estimates - should be used to reduce their own EU payments. Until the Swedish budget request, Spain's main concern, shared with the UK, was to preserve existing EU majority voting rules enabling relatively modest alliances within the Twelve to block measures affecting national interests. But wherever Spain's demands settle, yesterday's lunchtime talks between the EU foreign ministers left little doubt that the money and resources question is nagging away at several member states, rich and poor. Spain has German support in opposing Commission plans to make thinly populated and inhospitable parts of northern Sweden and Norway eligible for the same levels of EU regional aid as Andalucia and the eastern German Lander. Brussels yesterday backtracked and proposed an analogous, slightly less generous, and possibly time-limited aid regime the applicants at first sight are inclined to reject. But it is in the cost of aligning the farm subsidy regimes of the candidate countries with EU norms that blood could be spilt. Sweden's farm prices are now close to the EU's, but Austria's are about 25 per cent higher, Finland's 50 per cent more, and Norwegian prices are double those within the 12. The EU concedes that for a mix of socio-economic, cultural, environmental, and even security reasons, extra farm subsidies to keep the Alps and the Arctic populated are legitimate. But who is to pay?</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: C and W sharply depressed A REORGANISATION by Cable and Wireless, the telecoms group, sharply depressed the shares. The company is merging its Personal Communications Network (PCN) interests with those of Unitel, another PCN consortium, restructuring its premium services, and expects to make a Pounds 50m provision in its current year's results. The stock finished 28 weaker at 555p, after touching 548p, with turnover of 10m shares easily the heaviest in a single trading session since June 1989. The shares had already fallen sharply on Wednesday when Mr Peter Van Cuylenburg, formerly one of the leading lights at Mercury, C and W's telecoms division, announced his departure. Some telecoms specialists viewed the latest moves with dismay. There were also stories circulating in the market that C and W's stockbroker, Cazenove, had been a keen seller of the stock and that a series of profits downgrades were imminent. Other analysts said they liked the deal but not the way it emerged. Dealers said there had been a series of switching trades, out of C and W shares and into Vodafone, which settled 5 higher at 342p. Lasmo strong Another strong performance by Lasmo, which recently won control of Ultramar and is now among the UK's most important oil exploration stocks, left the shares 6 higher at 197p on good turnover. The market picked up hints that Lasmo has sold its interest in the Wilmington oil refinery, located on the West Coast of the US. The oil group inherited Wilmington when it acquired Ultramar last December. During the bid battle, Lasmo pledged to sell a number of Ultramar's business's, including Wilmington. Ultramar paid more than Pounds 250m for its stake in the refinery in 1988. Lasmo is scheduled to report preliminary figures next Wednesday, and is therefore in the statutory 'closed period' during which it is prevented from disclosing price sensitive information. Along with other oil exploration stocks, Lasmo shares have come under heavy selling pressure recently, reacting to the weakness of crude oil prices. Demand for Tarmac Tarmac, the building materials and construction group, attracted a welter of speculative buying as the market reacted to another wave of stories that Minorco, the international conglomerate associated with the South African mining magnate Mr Harry Oppenheimer, was about to launch a bid for the UK company. At the close, Tarmac shares were 14 higher at 138p, having reached 142p earlier. The market had been alerted to the bid rumours by the level of turnover; 10m shares was by far the heaviest activity during a single session since January 1991. Although sceptical about the bid stories, building sector specialists said Minorco had already shown its hand in seeking building materials assets in the past by launching its ultimately unsuccessful bid for Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold) around two years ago. Among ConsGold's most sought after assets was Amey Roadstone, the hugely successful aggregates business that ConsGold acquired during the 1970s. BAT pleases Delight over the dividend helped BAT Industries to climb 27 to 687p in active trading of 3.5m shares as analysts became increasingly positive on the stock. Securities house Hoare Govett issued a buy recommendation and a positive note on the company which is expected to reach clients today. Traders said other brokers were contemplating such a move following the release of BAT's strong 1991 results on Wednesday. Hoare analyst Mr Richard Workman said: 'We have raised our rating on the back of the results, which were every bit as good as one could hope.' The brokerage concern shifted BAT to a buy from undervalued, and lifted its 1992 profits estimate by Pounds 25m to Pounds 1.45bn. Smith New Court, the stockbroker, was said to have placed the majority of a line of 4.5m CE Heath shares at 395p, having purchased them for 388p. Guardian Royal Exchange shot up 13 1/2 to 128p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 14m shares after the group revealed increased losses slightly less than the market had expected, and a reduced dividend when many specialists had been looking for the dividend to be omitted. In recent months the market has responded to intermittent rumours that an overseas stakebuilder has been at work in GRE, although no hard evidence of stakebuilding has emerged to date. Midland Bank rose 10 more to 350p, with speculators still betting on a bid from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking in excess of 375p a share and possibly as much as 400p. It was pointed out by traders, however, that a number of institutions had been aggressive sellers at the 350p mark. Selling in the futures market was said to be behind a continuing slide in Glaxo Holdings, which lost 10 to 756p. Analysts added that wholesalers and chemists were concerned about Glaxo's UK distribution methods and this was hurting sentiment. An announcement by SmithKline Beecham that its Relafen arthritis drug is to be made available in the US helped the shares firm 5 to 885p. A large agency cross by Lehman Brothers provided backing for Fisons, which rose 4 to 368p on turnover of 7.3m shares. The investment bank crossed 3m shares with institutions at 365p. It was the final part of a large sell order which Lehman has been handling over the past few days. Specialty chemicals company Laporte fell 13 to 564p ahead of full-year results due next Tuesday. These are not expected to be bad but are likely to herald the placing of Solvay's 8 per cent stake in the company. Pharmaceutical retailer UniChem gained 4 to 212p after the company came out with raised profits, a bullish statement and the announcement that it had decided not to bid for retailer and pharmaceutical manufacturer Macarthy. A possible bid lifted Morland by 97 to 470p, amid suggestions that this could be the first sign of Whitbread complying with the wishes of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in offloading its holdings in regional brewers. Whitbread owns 43.6 per cent of Morland and would obviously play a key role in the disposal of the company. Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, down 7 at 604p, was mentioned as a possible bidder on the news that Morland is holding discussions which may lead to a takeover. However, analysts tended to be sceptical, with one arguing that JA Devenish, 3 higher at 233p, made more sense on a regional basis as a bidder. Whitbread 'A' shares were little moved by the news, moving in line with the market for a loss of 3 at 415p. Fears of broker downgrades weighed on the shares, with Robert Fleming reducing its estimate of 1992-93 profits to Pounds 240m from Pounds 285m. Fleming also said that compliance with MMC orders appears to be more difficult for Whitbread than for any other national brewer. Guinness slipped 14 to 556p in spite of producing profit figures in line with market forecasts. A rise in 1991 profits to Pounds 956m from Pounds 847m was up to expectations, but a cautiously worded statement led to fears that the future may not be as favourable as analysts had hoped. Arjo Wiggins Appleton gained 12 to 240p after reassuring comments in the statement accompanying the 1991 results. Profits fell by to Pounds 231.5m, below analysts' expectations of about Pounds 240m. Engine-maker Rolls-Royce put on a good performance on a number of considerations, not least an upbeat presentation on Wednesday evening to institutions at Hoare Govett, its broker. There was also talk of strong US buying of the shares, which closed 8 up at 157p, after a recent New York presentation. Smith New Court turned buyer of Johnson Matthey, the shares adding 3 at 365p. Mr Peter Deighton, a Smith analyst, said the move was prompted by increased demand for catalytic converters in Europe, and also the US.

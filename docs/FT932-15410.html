			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Aznar seeks to calm peseta fears: Spain's centre-right leader is well-placed in polls THE centre-right Spanish opposition leader Mr Jose Maria Aznar tried yesterday to calm investors' worries about conservative political and economic priorities by promising to maintain a strong peseta within the European monetary system. With some opinion polls putting his Partido Popular (PP) slightly ahead of the governing Socialists, following the calling of a snap general election for June 6, he has come under strong pressure from advisers to tone down attacks on the many orthodox elements of current economic policy. Mr Aznar has previously threatened the peseta's permanence in the EMS, largely in an attempt to capitalise on the problems which Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, has been having in controlling Spain's slide into recession. With both parties now fighting for the vital middle ground in Spanish politics, the polls indicate, however, that neither Mr Aznar nor Mr Gonzalez  -should he revitalise his badly divided party - will score an outright win in the election. Mr Aznar, 39, said he was confident of obtaining a 'sufficient majority', indicating his readiness to govern in coalition with the middle-of-the-road Catalan nationalist party. The Socialists make much the same kind of claims for themselves. Mr Aznar told a news conference that he ruled out a devaluation of the peseta and intended to keep the currency within the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. Acknowledging that it was markets and not governments that devalued currencies, Mr Aznar said that, if elected, he would boost confidence in the currency by implementing strict spending controls to reduce the budget deficit. The Partido Popular leader added that he would pursue an extensive privatisation policy and that he would amend Socialist legislation currently before parliament that has been sidelined by Mr Gonzalez's gamble on Monday to call a snap general election. A PP-led government, he said, would introduce changes to a controversial draft strike law which employers contend is weighted heavily towards the unions. Mr Aznar said he would maintain a blueprint Socialist law that establishes the autonomy of the Bank of Spain but that he reserved the right to name a new governor of the bank when the law appeared on the statute book. Mr Aznar's promises to 'make Spain fit again' and to 'turn a new page' recalled those of Mr Gonzalez, 51, more than a decade ago when the now embattled prime minister campaigned on the theme of 'change' and promised to 'make the country function'. Spain is now in recession, as it was in 1982, and figures released yesterday showed that last month a further 58,000 Spaniards registered at unemployment offices. This brought the official number of job-seekers to 2.5m, or 16.6 per cent of the working population. In March last year the number registered at unemployment offices dropped by nearly 11,000. Mr Gonzalez, aware that the PP could already be the front-runner in the polls, is preparing to stage a constant whistle-stop tour around the country when the campaign opens officially in six weeks' time. In the previous election in 1989 he held meetings only at weekends. The prime minister is also understood to be manoeuvring to maintain key ministers on the Socialists' electoral lists. At the heart of the party's division is a bitter confrontation between Mr Gonzalez's moderate cabinet and the left-leaning party machinery - led by Mr Alfonso Guerra, the deputy party leader - which blames government economic policy for declining public support. The divide between the government and the party came to a head last week when Mr Gonzalez, backed by several members of his cabinet, attempted to force the resignation of leading party executives allegedly connected with illicit campaign funding. The party machinery refused to allow the dismissals but under an apparent compromise agreement handed the reins of the electoral campaign over to the prime minister. Many Socialists, however, already regard the period just after the elections as almost as important to the party's future as the poll itself. If Mr Gonzalez, who remains the country's most formidable campaigner, is able to secure enough votes to enable the party to lead a coalition, it seems likely that an emergency party congress would then be used to clear it of many of Mr Guerra's supporters. In the event that the Socialists lose, and the PP forms a government, it seems unlikely that Mr Gonzalez would want to stay in politics and might leave the party in the hands of its current left-wing managers. Either way, analysts worry that whichever party forms a coalition with the Catalan or Basque nationalists, these junior partners would demand high prices - in terms of greater autonomy and more spending on their regions. That, the markets fear, could make it very difficult for any new government to control the country's growing budget deficits.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- SPAIN: WHERE THE PARTIES STAND  -------------------------------------------------------------------                        March 93*    Projected    Election      Seats                             poll        Seats        1989       Held  ------------------------------------------------------------------- PSOE (Socialist)            33.9          151        39.6       175 PP (Conservative)           33.3          150        25.8       107 IU (Communist)              11.5           29         9.1        17 CDS (Centrist/Liberal)       2.0            1         7.9        14 PNU (Basque Nats)            1.2            6         1.2         5 CIU (Catalan Nats)           5.0           20         5.0        18  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: * Demoscopia, for El Pais  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Kim Chang-ki and Pak Tu-sik: "ROK </F> Government's Reaction to Carter's Remarks--Government Relies on  Fragmentary Foreign News Reports and Keenly Feels a Lack of  Information"]    [Excerpts] On 17 June, ROK Government officials concerned  who had followed Former U.S. President Carter's visit to North  Korea paid close attention to foreign news reports on details of  his second-day talks in North Korea and the U.S. Government's  reaction to them. Particularly, when at around 1800 that day  they heard the news that the "sanctions process had stopped," a  statement Carter reportedly made, they looked perplexed and were  busy trying to confirm whether the report was true.    At 2000 that day the ROK Foreign Ministry released a  commentary that casts doubt on the remarks. Immediately after  that, the U.S. White House released a statement that says that  "what Carter said was not true." The Foreign Ministry, then,  said it had thought so in the first place. Chongwadae  [presidential offices] looked relieved later that night when the  White House notified it that the report was not true. The  government officials concerned complained about, among other  things, a lack of information throughout that day. It was  difficult for them to know, from foreign news reports, what  Carter told [DPRK] President Kim, what Kim told Carter, and what  Carter and Clinton discussed over the telephone. They looked  helpless. [passage omitted]    Some officials concerned said: "Our objective in pushing for  sanctions is to hasten the resolution of the nuclear issue  through dialogue. Therefore, resuming North Korea-U.S. dialogue  is nothing strange." They also pointed out: "Nevertheless,  North Korea's `true intention' must be verified." Foreign  Ministry officials concerned looked embarrassed all day long.  They said: "The West may not be being fooled by a few words of  Kim Il-song, which are nothing new." They also said: "We have  no choice but to see how the United States will change until  North Korea's intention is revealed at upcoming U.S.-North Korea  talks." [passage omitted]</p>

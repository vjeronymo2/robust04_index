			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Books: William Klein William Klein became a fashion photographer by accident. A poor American artist in Paris of the 1950s he was spotted by the art director of US Vogue who offered him patronage as a photographer in return for 'odd jobs' on the magazine. Klein summed up his approach to this new field when confronted by his first fashion model: 'How do I not make both of us look like fools?' The answer lay in his ability to stage a scene and see the woman, the clothes and her environment as a whole. In Rome (1960-1962) a black veiled hat on a beautiful woman is no longer an accessory when modelled against the tomb of Keats in the Protestant Cemetery in Via Caio Cestio. In and Out of Fashion (Jonathan Cape Pounds 50, 254 pages) meanders through the fashion capitals of Paris, New York and Rome to his latest work shot behind the catwalk shows in an array of images that transcend the fashions they portray.</p>

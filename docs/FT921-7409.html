			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions THE run-up to the UK general election, there has been continued selling by directors and a diminished amount of buying activity. Two of the largest sales of the week in fact signal strong performances. The Airtours share price has increased sevenfold over the past year and so the sale of a relatively small proportion of four directors' stock at 250p is seen as a measure to improve marketability and in order to realise profits. Seton Healthcare's share price has more than doubled over the past year and the sale by four directors at 302p is intended to release stock. Danka Business Systems, suppliers of office equipment in the US, has been performing strongly in an uncertain market. Directors' confidence is evident from their recent purchase of 410,000 shares at 161.5p Directors at Harland Simon, the electronics company, have sold significant quantities of stock over the course of last year at prices as high at 700p. Last week the company issued a profits warning, since when the shares have fallen sharply. Soon after the statement two directors purchased stock at 260p, but these purchases still only account for a small proportion of the sales made during 1991. The share price currently stands at 173p.

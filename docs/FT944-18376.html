			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No reason why options not valued Sir, We feel let down by the Accounting Standards Board. It allowed its sub-committee, the urgent issues taskforce, to judge whether companies are justified in not obeying the law when reporting total boardroom pay ('Guidelines on directors' option schemes issued', September 29). The taskforce has concluded that it is not practicable to include in estimated boardroom emoluments a 'meaningful' money value for directors' share options. Its published reasons appear to us contrived and one-sided. There is no reference to the fact that US companies are being required to value directors' share options. We are concerned that ASB should have let the taskforce look at this issue. It is a matter of integrity. The taskforce has 16 members. Each of the eight largest UK accounting firms has a representative. Four members, three finance directors and a chief executive, come from leading UK companies. So a majority will probably have been involved either in signing or in auditing company accounts which arguably did not comply with the Companies Act. Is it right to allow the law to be judged by those who may not be following it? Why should share options not be valued along the lines adopted by the US?

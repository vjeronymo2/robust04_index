			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Oumar Konare in Bamako on 12 </F> January by RTM reporter Brema Camara -- recorded]    [Text] [Begin recording] [Konare] Devaluation was at the  center of thorough and lengthy discussions for several months  and even several years. Now we know the results. What I can  say is that we must admit the failure of a certain policy that  has been adopted in our countries for several months. We must  also admit the failure of a certain cooperation policy. Our  scope of choosing alternatives was very limited for several  reasons. First, in monetary matters, we enjoy joint sovereignty  with France which guarantees the convertibility of our currency.  This sovereignty is also shared with other states. Second, we  have currency problems because we have a currency that is common  to 14 states. Third, each country is faced with economic  situations in our own states and Mali is no different.    We have made a lot of efforts and adopted many measures  aimed  at redressing the situation. But it is clear that we have  inherited a really bad situation. You have noticed that for  almost 15 years we have put in place an internal adjustment  program. But this program has not enabled us to solve the main  problems. It was suicidal to hold on to that with its  concomitant problems of layoffs, unemployment, lack of  competitiveness, and also the flight of capital and lack of  investment in the country. There are therefore no prospects.  In the face of all this, it became necessary to adopt such a  [word indistinct] measure. Of course, that will not be without  problems, we must admit. We must succeed in suppressing [word  indistinct]. We must also succeed in cushioning, in solidarity,  the social effects, especially on the most exposed classes in  the society.    But we think that it is possible for us to find the key to  tomorrow if we manage the situation well by creating the  conditions for greater competitiveness and a situation that  favors investment. Ours is a country of farmers, herdsmen, and  fishermen. Basically, it is a situation that can enable us to  develop our national production.    On the industrial level it is possible today to develop our  national production. You know our difficulties regarding fraud  and the closure of enterprises here and there. I think these  are real assets for our country. I expect all the democrats to  form the largest possible front -- above partisan quarrels -- in  order to face the new situation. It is this patriotic front  that can enable us to take up the current challenge.    [Unidentified reporter] The devaluation has taken effect. It  is a fact today. What can your government propose to Malians  today in order to make the cup less bitter, especially for the  civil servants?    [Konare] I think for several weeks, the government has asked  itself many questions. The government -- the prime minister and  the ministers -- will soon brief the public and all our economic  and social partners on the decisions that have been adopted.  The decisions that will be adopted at the national level will  also be thoroughly explained. These decisions will be aimed at  creating the conditions and giving answers to the daily concerns  of the people. They will also be aimed at creating more  solidarity and better remuneration of labor in rigor and  discipline. This will be indispensable for us. The decisions  will also be aimed at creating the conditions for  competitiveness for investments to be made and national  production developed, as I have said. Without doubt, they will  be aimed at -- and I think this is indispensable --  strengthening our ability to take care of ourselves, move toward  more regional integration, and basically reinforce solidarity  among Africans.

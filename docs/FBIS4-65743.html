			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis met British Deputy  Foreign Secretary Tom Richardson in the Presidential Palace this  morning. Speaking afterward, Richardson said the current  process in the Cyprus issue has reached a decisive point. He  expressed the hope that there would be an agreement on the  confidence-building measures before the UN secretary general  submits his report to the Security Council. After the report is  submitted, he said, we can evaluate the direction that should be  followed.    Richardson said that in a meeting he will have tomorrow with  [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas, he will discuss the need  to accept the confidence-building measures, which he described  as important. The British official also referred to the British  Government's continuing interest in reaching an agreement on the  confidence-building measures. But added, he is not in a  position to know whether Denktas is willing to change his stance  to facilitate moves toward an agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

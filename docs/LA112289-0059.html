Schacter set aside the  award to Andrea Nerpel, a 39-year-old accident victim who was raped in 1982  while a patient at the Laurelwood Convalescent Hospital in North Hollywood.  Nerpel became pregnant, had an abortion and was later sterilized.  </P> <P> Schacter said Nerpel's attorney, Alan J. Schultz, offered no evidence during  the trial to prove that Nerpel suffered damage from the incident.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE HOT PURSUITS AND LOSS OF LIVES  </P> <P> We were very saddened to read about the tragic deaths of Jessica Warren and  Dawn Hammond, victims of the police pursuit on Christmas morning.  </P> <P> We were saddened not only because we know of the sorrow of the family and  friends, but because the circumstances might have been prevented had a jury  voted to find the Costa Mesa police guilty in their pursuit of Ruben Valle on  Dec. 12, 1984. We believe that the "not guilty" decision gave a green light to  Orange County law enforcement that hot pursuits will be condoned or even  encouraged at the expense of an innocent public.  </P> <P> It was our son and brother, along with Billy Dearing, who lost their lives as  innocent victims Dec. 12, 1984. We were outraged then and are outraged now that  hot pursuits still claim the lives of the innocent. Although police departments  have "guidelines," guidelines are not law and don't have to be followed. We  tried to bring this macho law enforcement attitude to the public's attention  through our lawsuit, and it was an uphill battle for the better part of 3  years.  </P> <P> It is our hope and prayer that one day law enforcement will have to be  accountable for acts of irresponsibility in the line of duty.  </P> <P> KEITH WILLIAMSON  </P> <P> SHARON WILLIAMSON  </P> <P> MERRITT WILLIAMSON  </P> <P> DEIDRE WILLIAMSON  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

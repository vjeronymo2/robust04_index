REA will approve the proposed Modernization Plan if it conforms to the provisions of this subpart. Once obtained, REA's approval of a Modernization Plan cannot be rescinded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (c) The Modernization Plan shall not interfere with REA's authority to issue such other telecommunications standards, specifications, requirements, and procurement rules as may be promulgated from time to time by REA including, without limitation, those set forth in 7 CFR part 1755.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (d) The Modernization Plan must, at a minimum, apply to all REA borrowers. If a Modernization Plan is developed by the PUC or the State Legislature, REA encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization Plan's requirements apply to the rural service areas of all Telecommunications Providers. A State's decision not to include non-REA borrowers will not prejudice REA approval of their Plan. The PUC or the State Legislature may also, at its option, extend coverage of the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all Telecommunications Providers in the State. In addition, while requirements contained in &sect;1751.106 apply only to wireline services, the State Legislature or PUC, at its discretion, may extend coverage of Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications services in a State as it deems appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1751.102  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Modernization Plan developer_eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each State, either by statute or through its Public Utility Commission, is eligible until one year after publication of the final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to develop a proposed Modernization Plan and deliver it to REA. REA will review and consider for approval all PUC or State Legislature-developed Modernization Plans received by REA within this one year period. The review and approval, if any, may occur after the one year period ends even though the PUC or State Legislature is no longer eligible to submit a proposed Modernization Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (b) The PUC must notify all Telecommunications Providers in the State that are part of the Public Switched Network and other interested parties of its intent to develop a proposed Modernization Plan. The PUC is encouraged to consider all such Providers' and interested parties' views and incorporate these views in the Modernization Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (c) If the State Legislature or PUC is no longer eligible to develop a Modernization Plan, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, eligibility to develop the Modernization Plan passes to a numeric majority of the Borrowers within the State.

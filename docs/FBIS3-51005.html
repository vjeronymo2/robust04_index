The Armed Forces inspector general has reported that  the helicopter crashed in Colombian territory after being hit by  guerrillas.    Minister Sanin, you arrived in the country a few hours ago;  what information do you have about this incident?    [Sanin] I arrived in the country last night from my  vacation,  but I have been in contact with the president for the past  several days. The government is deeply concerned. The  president has ordered an investigation from the Defense Ministry  and Colombian Foreign Ministry. We are going to present to him  the findings this afternoon. The Prosecutor General's Office  has conducted a preliminary investigation, the results of which  will be presented to the Foreign Ministry this afternoon.    I will be going to Venezuela on 12 January to sign a  prisoners repatriation treaty, and I will be speaking with  President Ramon J. Velasquez, the president-elect, the defense  minister, the foreign minister, and the Venezuelan attorney  general to present to them the results of the Colombian  investigations to improve integration and cooperation efforts to  avoid a continuation of criminal activities outside the legal  framework of the two countries. I repeat: We are deeply  concerned, and this afternoon we will decide, jointly with the  president, what to do about this matter.    [Garzo] You have already spoken with President Gaviria. When  this type of incident occurs, what measures are adopted at the  Foreign Ministry level? What type of statement is issued?    [Sanin] Investigations are ordered, consuls must prepare a  report, and experts go to work on territorial sovereignty,  prisons, or whatever matter happens to be the issue. We are  then presented with a report from the consuls and experts  assigned by the Foreign Ministry. We have to receive reports  from both the Defense Ministry and Prosecutor General's Office  to then present all the conclusions to the president, with whom  we always decide what action must be taken.    [Garzo] Can this be seen as a criminal act?    [Sanin] This is a very grave action that could involve one  or  more criminal actions; this matter is also being investigated in  Venezuela, according to what Venezuelan authorities have told  me. We are on top of the situation and do not want to diminish  the seriousness of the incident, because national sovereignty,  citizens' lives, respect, personal injuries, and many other  factors are involved, and all of this is being investigated in  the two countries.    [Garzo] Considering the problems that have emerged during  recent months due to the guerrilla presence on the border with  Venezuela, do you believe the Venezuelan Government really wants  to resolve these problems?    [Sanin] Yes. We have tried to hold a meeting between the  defense, foreign minister, and justice ministers of both  countries in recent days, but considering that Venezuela will  have a new government on 3 February, we have agreed that the  meeting, which will also include the government and interior  ministers of Colombia and Venezuela, should take place once the  new Venezuelan Government is installed on 3 February.    [Garzo] That is, it is urgent that the defense ministers  hold  a meeting to clear up this situation and draft a common strategy  to fight the guerrillas in that zone.    [Sanin] Yes. Once there is a new government in Venezuela the  government, interior, defense, Foreign Ministry, and justice  ministers will hold a meeting to avoid, through cooperation and  integration, criminal activities on either side of the border.    [Garzo] I want to ask you about another matter before you  leave. How is President Gaviria's candidacy for the OAS post  progressing?    [Sanin] The truth is that all Colombians must feel very  proud  that several chiefs of state have established contact with our  president and asked him to allow them to present him as a  candidate for the post of secretary general of the OAS,  America's most important forum. The president is analyzing  this. We should all recall the golden era Colombia enjoyed with  former President Alberto Lleras Camargo in this organization.  We are happy about this situation and waiting for President  Gaviria's decision.</p>

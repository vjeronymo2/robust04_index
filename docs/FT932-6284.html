			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (16): A credit gain for bay scheme - Profile of NCM/Cardiff THOSE WHO TAKE great pleasure watching great holes being gouged out of the ground have been well-satisfied in Cardiff, especially the city's docklands, these past couple of years. New roads, new buildings, moved buildings, restored buildings have sprouted up all over the place. No sooner is one building completed than another takes its place. As the Welsh Health Common Services Authority's new home facing Cardiff Bay's inner harbour approaches completion, the hard-hat men have begun another hole. This one will, within the next 20 months, become the headquarters of NCM Credit Insurances, part of the Dutch concern, NCM, that claims to be the largest private credit insurer in the world. By this autumn bricks and mortar will begin to appear. It is a prestige site, owned by Grosvenor Waterside. By the turn of the century an opera house and centre for the performing arts, a base for the Welsh National Opera Company, is expected to be built next door. NCM will be in situ long before then. Its building should be completed by the end of next year and the first staff should be settling in soon after. For NCM the move to Cardiff Bay is its second relocation. NCM Credit Insurance may be Dutch-owned now, but until 16 months ago it was the short-term end of Export Credits Guarantee Department, the UK government organisation responsible for providing companies with insurance cover against losses on overseas sales. As a government department ECGD was a prime candidate, for a move, following the Hardman review during the 1970s of government office location. Its small computer department had already been transferred to Cardiff, and as many of ECGD's activities in the short-term market were scattered around the City of London it was considered sensible for the department to have a new home. The choice was eventually narrowed to three centres, Liverpool, Glasgow and Cardiff. Having decided on Cardiff space was found within the Welsh Office which had just extended its offices in the heart of the city. It was that choice that was to lead to the second relocation. Cardiff's civic centre is governed by a covenant from the Marquis of Bute's estate which restricts occupiers to non-profit-making bodies. The Welsh Office sits alongside the university college, city hall, county hall, Temple of Peace, law courts and national museum. Not a penny of profit among them. The decision at the end of 1991 to privatise the Cardiff part of ECGD meant it could no longer live cheek-by-jowl with the Welsh Office. 'From the moment privatisation came on the agenda in 1988 we knew another home would be necessary,' says Mr Colin Foxall, once under-secretary in ECGD responsible for the short-term business and now managing director of NCM Credit Insurance. 'Right from the start, we always intended, if at all possible, to maintain a commitment to Cardiff. That does not mean we did not look elsewhere, and, of course, we did. We would certainly have moved out of the city if we could not have found the right place.' Even within Cardiff NCM looked at several sites before settling on Grosvenor Waterside's prestige development in the Bay. One building in the heart of the shopping area, near the station, came under close scrutiny and others on the outskirts were reviewed. In the end, NCM decided not to go elsewhere, and to relocate to the bay area because it wanted to be part of the redevelopment of Cardiff's docklands. This is the largest urban regeneration in Britain outside London's docklands; perhaps the largest in Europe. The company found the prospect exciting, according to Mr Foxall. There were also hard commercial reasons. 'Since arriving in Cardiff in 1980 we have built a very fine staff, now numbering about 450,' Mr Foxall says. 'If we had moved well away from Cardiff then we should have undermined that great asset. Cardiff has a well-educated labour market, it is fairly young and there is a pool of the right sorts of skills which we could tap.' Over the years first as a government department, and now as a company, NCM has recruited, trained and developed its staff from the local labour market. 'We tend to recruit at a young age,' Mr Foxall says, 'with the result that many of the people who came to us soon after our arrival in Cardiff are now in fairly senior managerial positions. 'This is a very specialist industry and as staff turnover is low we don't lose too many people, an important consideration to us.' As the company's business has become increasingly sophisticated and geared to the latest information technology, staff numbers have not risen, so that around 400 people will eventually move out of the Welsh Office when the new headquarters is ready for occupation. Nine regional offices, as well as the computer centre elsewhere in Cardiff, also report to Mr. Foxall. This compares with about 700 when ECGD originally arrived in Cardiff almost 13 years ago. It is not numbers so much as quality that Mr Foxall stresses, though. Mr Foxall himself is a Londoner, who made the move to Wales after a lifetime in the department and secondments to the Department of Trade and Industry, and the European Commission in Brussels, so he views the area through the eyes of an incomer. 'There is a very good quality of life here,' he says. 'It's not just about theatres and museums but also about shopping and entertainment and restaurants. Commercially, it has very fast and good links with London'</p>

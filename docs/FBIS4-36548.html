			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 9 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  urged U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to support the  nonaligned foreign ministers's call for convening an  international conference on Bosnia to be sponsored by the United  Nations.    This came in a message from 'Amr Musa to Christopher on this  resolution.    Musa clarified that the objectives of this conference are to  immediately apply the cease-fire and to put an end to all  military activities under the supervision of the peace-keeping  forces. In addition, the other objectives are to turn  Bosnia-Herzegovina into a safe-haven and guarantee that the  regional borders and sovereignty are not harmed.    MENA has learned that Musa sent a similar message to French  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Douglas Hurd, British secretary  of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, about the  extensive efforts Egyptian diplomacy is exerting to support the  Bosnian cause.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: OLD MONEY THE MYTHOLOGY OF AMERICA'S UPPER CLASS BY NELSON  W. ALDRICH JR. (VINTAGE: $8.95)  </P> <P> A scion of the Aldrich and Rockefeller families, the author writes with  first-hand knowledge about the problems and popular images of people who  inherit large sums of money. The need to prove that they have some worth beyond  their unearned wealth often leads heirs into desperate self-indulgence or  charity work and politics. George Bush, who comes from a wealthy family, had to  overcome the stereotype of the rich boy as wimp in his presidential campaign.  </P> <P> Middle-class readers who have to struggle with monthly bills and the cost of  housing in Southern California may find it difficult to sympathize with people  whose lives have been cushioned by trust funds, estates and servants. But as  the gap between rich and poor widens in this country, "Old Money" offers  valuable insights into the group that threatens to monopolize wealth and power  in America.  </P></p>

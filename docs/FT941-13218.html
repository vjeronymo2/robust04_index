			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (5): Too soon to write off the cathode ray tube - Screen Technologies When the first 'luggable' portable computers began to appear a decade ago, many used miniature mono-cathode ray tubes for their displays - mimicking their early desktop counterparts. But CRTs, although cheap, were heavy and power-hungry. They were quickly replaced by the thin, flat liquid crystal displays which have helped define the clam-shell design of the notebook computer and are now appearing in the next generation of pen-based computers and personal digital assistants. From their discovery more than a century ago liquid crystals, which share the properties of both liquids and solids, remained a laboratory curiosity until 1963 when RCA, the US broadcasting company, found that by applying an electrical charge, the liquid crystal molecules could be made to realign so that they either passed, or blocked, polarised light. Another decade passed before Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics group, sold the first calculator with a liquid crystal display. Since then, LCDs have appeared in a wide range of consumer electronics including portable computers. The majority of portable PCs sold since the mid-1980s have come equipped with LCDs in various guises, first in mono form but increasingly in colour - driven by the success of software like Microsoft's Windows. The most basic early machines had relatively simple 'passive matrix' LCDs based on twisted nematic (TN) technology. That was fine for small screens, but as the display size increases, the contrast between dark and light areas declines. One solution to this problem has been to increase the twisting effect and thereby increase contrast. Thus manufactures have developed 'super twisted' nematic displays (STN), 'double super twisted' nematic (DSTN) displays in which two STN cells are used and even 'triple super twisted' nematic (TSTN) displays which use a refracting polymer film applied to the STN cell, allowing thinner displays with higher contrast. Another increasingly pop- ular option which improves the quality of lower-price passive colour screens is 'double scanning'. A double scan LCD updates the image twice as fast as the normal rate for passive LCDs, generating deeper colours and brighter images. But despite these improvements, 'passive' LCD technology still has some shortcomings. Among these, the contrast is still insufficient to reproduce the full range of colours available with a conventional CRT, and passive LCDs have relatively slow response times which mean that moving images tend to blur and leave shadows. These limitations are overcome in another form of LCD by using 'active matrix' thin film transistor (TFT) technology which boosts contrast and response time by adding a transistor 'switch' to each LCD cell or 'pixel'. Most of the colour notebook computers sold today feature active-matrix TFT displays produced in Japan by a small group of manufacturers. However, building 10-inch active-matrix TFT display is an extremely complex and costly process involving over 100 steps spread out over a period of four weeks. Active-matrix screen consists of 10 to 15 layers of material and involves etching around 4m components. A single dust particle can wreck a whole display and analysts suggest that, despite precautions, more than half the manufactured display panels have to be rejected because of flaws. But as manufacturing yields improve and more Japanese manuf- acturing plants come on stream, the price of active- matrix TFT screens is beginning to fall. Two other flat screen tech- nologies, gas plasma and electroluminescence, are also in use. Unlike LCDs, which need back or side lighting, gas plasma screens generate their own light. In addition, res- ponse times are fast and the price of gas plasma portables is lower than that of active mat- rix systems. Electrolumin- escence screens are also fast, can support very high resol- utions and are cheaper than TFT displays, but they tend to be power-hungry. Display manufacturers have therefore been investigating other new technologies including ferro-electric LCDs and metal-insulator-metal screens. In MIM displays, a layer of insulator is sand- wiched between two layers of metal. They provide high contrast and may eventually be cheaper than TFT machines. However, mass production techniques for MIM displays have yet to be devised. Some industry analysts and manufacturers believe that in the longer term ferro-electric LCDs, pioneered by CRL, part of the British Thorn-EMI group, and Canon in Japan, offer the most promise. FLCDs use a different type of liquid crystal which reacts more quickly and, most importantly, is bi-stable. This means that once a pixel is switched on (or off) it stays like that until it receives another signal. As a result, they do not need continuous power to maintain an image and, because only those parts of the screen that have changed need to be updated, battery life is increased by 20 times or more. FLCDs are also lighter, brighter, have a wider viewing angle and are cheaper than TFT screens. But they do have some disadvantages. In particular, today's ferro-electric displays do not produce as wide a range of grey tones as most active- matrix LCDs. Even more critic- ally, ferro-electric crystals are sensitive to shock which has made it difficult to develop a practical FLCD, although CRL and Canon claim to have overcome this problem. Despite all these new developments, it may be too soon to write off the old cathode ray tube. For example, last year Matsushita Electric Industrial announced that it had managed to do away with both the conventional guns and the magnetic coils that make current CRT tubes so deep. The result is a flat CRT screen less than four inches thick. Such technology could potentially lead to the re-introduction of the cathode ray tube into the portable computer market.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Spanish telecoms prospect Three months ago, the Spanish government brought forward to 1998 plans for the full liberalisation of the Spanish telecommunications market. Telefonica, the Spanish operator, has risen by 12 per cent relative to the Madrid general index over the June quarter. However, European equities have been weak over the past month, and Spain weaker, so on Monday Telefonica, at Pta1,730, was down Pta110 since the beginning of June. At this point Mr Bill Coleman, telecommunications analyst at James Capel in London, reiterated his buy recommendation for the stock, saying that it seems now that liberalisation may proceed even faster than expected in the spring, with the Spanish government poised to enact new legislation for mobile telephony and cable television networks this summer. The shares held at Pta1,770 against a weak market last night. Mr Coleman thinks that Telefonica is also set to form an alliance with Unisource, the Dutch/Swedish/Swiss joint venture, by taking an equity stake in the latter, which may take a reciprocal shareholding in Internacional. 'In turn,' he says, 'the Spanish government is likely to dispose of its 23.8 per cent stake in Telefonica Internacional by the end of the year, and pave the way for a possible spin-off of Telefonica's cellular radio activities.'</p>

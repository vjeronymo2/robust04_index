			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REDISTRICTING PANEL APPOINTED AFTER DISPUTE  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council on Tuesday appointed an advisory committee to help  redraw council district boundaries, but not before choices for the politically  sensitive posts sparked more arguing between the council's chief antagonists,  Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Councilman Bob Filner.  </P> <P> Despite Filner's claims that O'Connor had chosen his political enemies for  positions on the board, this round in the political grudge match went to the  mayor. With only Filner and Councilman Bruce Henderson dissenting, the council  approved O'Connor's recommendations for the 17-member panel.  </P> <P> The council was required to appoint a racially, ethnically and geographically  diverse advisory committee as part of its September settlement of a  voting-rights lawsuit by the Chicano Federation, a legal action that sought to  enhance the political power of Latinos and blacks.  </P> <P> But the final decision on the extremely sensitive issue of redrawing council  districts to reflect population changes remains in the hands of the council, a  task that must be completed by Oct. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> As part of the legal settlement, the council also agreed to place a measure on  the June ballot asking voters whether the council should be expanded from eight  seats to 10.  </P> <P> Filner, who opposed the settlement, has maintained that it is an attempt to add  Latinos to his district to oust him from office in 1991. Filner, an Anglo  representing a district with a sizable Latino population, defeated Latino  attorney Mike Aguirre to win election in 1987.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Filner questioned the number of panelists, O'Connor's right to  select the nine at-large members, and her choice of two members he said are  political enemies of his. The other eight panel members were nominated by the  eight council members.  </P> <P> Filner said he has "concerns about the numbers and concerns about some of the  individuals. We have to have a discussion about that, and then, if there are  concerns, we can go to the court." U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades has  retained jurisdiction over the case.  </P> <P> Specifically, Filner opposed the selection of attorney Patricia Meyer,  Aguirre's law partner and the lawyer who continues to represent the Chicano  Federation in the lawsuit, and longtime political consultant Dan Greenblatt,  who ran former Councilwoman Gloria McColl's victorious 1983 campaign over  Filner. Meyer was an at-large choice, and Greenblatt was nominated by  Henderson.  </P> <P> "If you saw on this list the person who chaired the campaign against you (and)  the law partner of the person who ran against you . . . . I think you would  have a different reaction to the committee," Filner told Councilman Ron  Roberts, who supported O'Connor's selections.  </P> <P> O'Connor also was aided by Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who said the council had  "tacitly" agreed in closed session to allow the mayor to largely shape the  committee, and by senior Chief Deputy City Atty. Jack Katz, who said that a  federal magistrate had approved Meyer's participation on the committee. Chicano  Federation Chairman Jess Haro also voiced approval.  </P></p>

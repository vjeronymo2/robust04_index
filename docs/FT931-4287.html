			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard volatile A turbulent session in Standard Chartered saw the bank's shares tumble on the revelation of much greater provisions than expected for losses in the Indian stock market. However, the shares staged a remarkable rally which left them at their best level since the market crash of October 1987. Activity was the second highest since turnover records were first logged, at the time of Big Bang in late 1986. Some 12m shares changed hands yesterday, second only to the 48m traded on June 19, 1989, when Cazenove placed Sir YK Pao's 10 per cent stake. However, the start of trading saw Standard shares drop to 659p following the figures which included a shocking Pounds 272m provision against losses in the Indian stock market, well above most analysts' estimates. But further examination of the results, revealing strong underlying profits, and also the opportunity to grill the directors at the post-figures meeting, brought a reassessment and subsequent flurry of profits upgradings by analysts. By the close the shares had jumped to finish a net 25 up at 716p. Mr Derek Chambers at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken lifted his current year forecast to Pounds 350m and told clients to 'buy on weakness'. He underlined the good underlying profits performance and the fact that Standard's record indicates that some release of loss provisions is more likely than further increases. Lehman Brothers moved their current year estimate up to Pounds 400m and highlighted the bank's dividend potential.</p>

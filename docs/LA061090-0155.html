			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIME-TIME FLICKS  </P> <P> Gremlins (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) turns Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life"  inside out with sweet-and-sour funny results involving cuddly stuffed animals  that turn into lethal monsters; not for the very young.  </P> <P> Richard Attenborough's 1987 Cry Freedom (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m., conclusion  Tuesday at 8 p.m.), derived from white South African journalist Donald Woods'  books, is clunky as a narrative but it does illuminate the racist conditions of  apartheid. Kevin Kline plays Woods and Denzel Washington is the martyrized  Steve Biko.  </P> <P> In Coal Miner's Daughter (KCOP Monday at 8 p.m.), Sissy Spacek is a luminous  Loretta Lynn; the heart of this 1980 movie about the country music star is her  relationship with her husband, played with strength and humor by Tommy Lee  Jones.  </P> <P> The 1980 Rough Cut (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) is unfortunately just that: a jewel  heist caper that seems to capture the spirit of "To Catch a Thief" only to go  awry before the end. Burt Reynolds and Lesley-Anne Down star.  </P> <P> The Night Stalker (KTTV Tuesday at 8:30 p.m.) is that terrific, popular 1971 TV  movie that finds Darren McGavin as a hard-driving reporter on the track of  vampires in Las Vegas; improbable-sounding but amusing and scary.  </P> <P> Jack Nicholson and Candice Bergen pair up in the 1971 landmark film Carnal  Knowledge (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.), directed by Mike Nichols to reveal the  emotional malaise of two men who come of age during World War II. Also starring  Art Garfunkel and Ann-Margret, who received acclaim for her portrayal of  Nicholson's pathetic see-pot mistress.  </P> <P> In his final film, Rich and Famous (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.), director George  Cukor got terrific performances from Jacqueline Bisset and Bergen. It's a  witty, occasionally uneven 1981 update of the Bette Davis-Miriam Hopkins film  "Old Acquaintance."  </P> <P> Robert Redford turned Judith Guest's Ordinary People (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.)  into an extraordinary film, a compassionate 1980 study of the WASP mentality in  which a wealthy suburban Chicago family attempts to smooth over its deep  fissures. With Timothy Hutton, Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore and Judd  Hirsch.  </P> <P> With the frequently hilarious Love at First Bite (KTTV Friday at 8 p.m.),  George Hamilton finally got a part he could sink his teeth into-Count Dracula.  The 1979 film is oddly marred, however, by gratuitous humor at the expense of  blacks and gays.  </P> <P> George C. Scott is an impressive Hemingway alter ego in Franklin Schaffner's  fine and affecting 1977 film of Hemingway's Islands in the Stream (KCOP Friday  at 8 p.m.), set in Bimini on the brink of WWII and involving a sculptor's  attempts to get to know his sons from various marriages.  </P> <P> With the 1982 Making Love (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.), director Arthur Hiller and  writer Barry Sandler sensitively explore the plight of a young husband (Michael  Ontkean), seemingly happily married (to Kate Jackson) but in love with another  man (Harry Hamlin); well-acted but marred by the feeling that these three  people exist in a social vacuum.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhao Haiyan (6392 3189 3601) from the "Two Sessions </F> Forum"]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Tong Zenyin,  deputy director of the Securities Commission of the State  Council and vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory  Committee, today denied there was a possibility of setting up a  third securities exchange this year. He said that in view of  the present situation in China's securities market, the time is  not right for setting up a third exchange.    Tong Zengyin, who is a member of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee and  is attending the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National  Committee here, said that the securities market in China is  still in an experimental stage and the recent situation in the  stock market is not quite satisfactory. This shows that  securities markets in China are not yet mature. Under such  circumstances, it would not be advisable to set up a new  securities exchange.    Tong Zengyin said that as far as the country as a whole is  concerned, all the securities exchanges are located in the south  and there is no such market in the hinterland. Their location  is irrational. He held that viewed from location, the number of  securities exchanges should be increased, and it is necessary to  site one in the north. The best way is to have securities  exchanges in the north, south, east, and west.    He said that at present many localities have applied to set  up a securities exchange, and where the new securities should be  located depends on timing. When it is the right time to set up  a new securities exchange, it will be necessary to look at  market developments and find out what locality has the more  developed market and needs a securities exchange. Besides, it  is also necessary to find out whether or not advanced technology  and telecommunications conditions are available for the  formation of a market.    Tong Zengyin holds that the situation of the two securities  exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen is not bad and the two  exchanges are growing very fast. The securities exchange in  Shanghai in particular has developed to a considerable size and  is ready to merge with the international market. It has a very  bright future.</p>

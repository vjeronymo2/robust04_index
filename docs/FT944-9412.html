			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Power struggle over EU policy stalls Austrian coalition talks A power struggle over who should be in charge of European policy is holding up Austrian government coalition talks more than a month after disenchanted voters returned the traditional conservative and socialist coalition partners with less than their usual overwhelming majority. At the same time, an ambitious austerity plan to cut government and social spending by ASch220bn (Pounds 12.8bn) over four years has run into strong opposition from the trade union forces within Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Social Democratic party (SPOe). The cuts are needed to bring Austria's budget deficit in line with the European Union's Maastricht convergence criteria for economic and monetary union. Observers still expect the SPOe and the conservative People's party (OeVP) will patch up their differences and continue the so-called grand coalition that has ruled Austria since 1986. But five weeks after the elections, in which SPOe and OeVP saw their majority shrink from 97 to 51, there is growing talk in Vienna of a breakdown of the coalition. Waiting in the wings is the right-wing Freedom party (FPOe) led by Mr Jorg Haider, which boosted its voting share to almost a quarter and has made the OeVP the tempting offer to back a minority government in parliament. Because of Mr Haider's extremist and xenophobic views, liberal forces in the OeVP, which holds only 52 seats in the 183-seat parliament, have ruled out any partnership with the FPOe. However, foreign minister Alois Mock, who represents the conservative wing of the OeVP, has shown few qualms about co-operation with Mr Haider. Even though he is seriously ill with Parkinson's disease, Mr Mock still hopes to become chancellor and has not forgiven Mr Vranitzky for denying him this post in a closely contested election in 1986. His demand to be put in charge of all aspects of European policy when Austria joins the EU on January 1 is seen as a ploy to break up the coalition talks and wrest control over the party from its liberal chairman Mr Erhard Busek. Mr Vranitzky, by contrast, wants the co-ordination of EU policy to rest in the chancellery. He argues that the issues decided in Brussels go well beyond traditional diplomacy and touch every aspect of government policy. He wants a strong state secretary for European affairs in his office to balance the foreign ministry's role. The dispute is hard to solve because the constitution does not clearly define the chancellor's responsibilities. He heads the weekly cabinet meeting, but is not officially charged with co-ordinating government policy. The outcome of the power struggle is certain to affect Austria's position on European security policy. While Mr Mock wants to abandon neutrality and join the Western European Union, Mr Vranitzky wants to preserve neutrality as long as a common defence policy does not yet exist. Mr Mock and Mr Vranitzky are also at odds over relations with eastern Europe and EU policy toward Bosnia. Mr Mock is much keener on integrating eastern Europe quickly and on supporting the Bosnian government, including ending the arms embargo. Even if the coalition continues, the current impasse could still spell trouble for the government in the coming months. Few observers expect it to last the full four years. While the right wing of the OeVP is pressing Mr Busek, the party chief, to play the Haider card, leftwingers in the SPOe are calling for a retreat into the opposition to recover strength after the disastrous election result. Meanwhile, the powerful trade unions are challenging Mr Vranitzky's pragmatic and pro-business policy and are demanding a better social balance in the current round of spending cuts. On Monday, the trade union representative in the SPOe's negotiating team, Mr Rudolf Nuernberger, walked out of the talks. The OeVP, however, insists on a brake on Austria's generous social programmes to bring the budget deficit below 3 per cent of gross domestic product until 1998 from 4.7 per cent this year.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Moose, salmon and fibre-optics New Brunswick is not the sort of place where one expects to find a Ministry of State for the Electronic Information Highway. With abundant forests and waterways, the eastern Canadian province is best known for salmon fishing, moose hunting, and high tides in the Bay of Fundy. But if New Brunswick Telephone Co (NBTel) and Northern Telecom, the Toronto-based telecoms equipment maker, have their way, New Brunswick will soon gain recognition as a pioneer in the unfolding world of multimedia. The aforesaid ministry of state, which was created last February, is set to play a significant supporting role. Northern and NBTel are partners in a CDollars 300m (Pounds 142m) project which aims to bring a range of video-on-demand services to 400 homes and to six schools in Saint John, the province's commercial centre, within the next 12 months, and to 60 per cent of all phone subscribers in the province by the end of 1998. 'Everything we learn here is going to be used worldwide,' predicts Clint Colpitts, Northern's manager for New Brunswick. The bulk of the funds will be used to build a broadband network based on the province's wholly-digital phone system and an existing fibre-optic network which connects the main centres. Northern is the overall project manager and systems integrator. It will also supply the fibre-optic transmission equipment and the high-capacity asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches required for broadband services. NBTel has gained a reputation as an unusually entrepreneurial utility. All its 300,000 customers have access to voice mailboxes as part of their basic phone service. BCE, the Montreal-based telecommunications group which controls Northern Telecom, also has a 41 per cent stake in NBTel. 'We're small enough to have ideas and big enough to execute them,' says John MacDonald, NBTel's chief executive, whose business card includes his electronic-mail and Internet addresses. Talks are under way to bring New Brunswick's two main cable-TV companies into the project. About 83 per cent of the province's homes are already wired with the coaxial cable required for cable-TV and broadband signals. Everyone would prefer to avoid the cost of overlapping infrastructures, and the inconvenience to consumers of two set-top controllers - one for cable-TV, and the other for multimedia services. MacDonald likens the ideal broadband system to a single highway or airport used by competing trucking companies and airlines. He says that 'we're open to any proposals to accelerate deployment of the network and bring down costs.' But he adds that 'if we can't come to an accommodation (with the cable companies), we have to secure our future, and they have to secure theirs.' The core of the new multimedia service will initially be a library of educational videos provided by Magic Lantern Communications, a Toronto-based distributor. An electronic shopping mall and a range of government services will also be available from the start. Viewers will be able to choose which advertisers' promotions they want to see, and to charge purchases to a credit card using the interactive service. Northern hopes later to add an 'intelligent agent' which can be programmed with the shopper's personal profile (size, colour preferences, and so on) and can search the database for competitive prices. The inclusion of government services stems from the strong support which information technology has received from the New Brunswick authorities. The province's premier, Frank McKenna, is widely regarded as one of Canada's most forward-looking and sensible politicians. McKenna, who often jokingly introduces himself as NBTel's vice-president for marketing, has latched on to the 'information highway' both as a means to attract investment to his province, and to improve government efficiency. A pilot project in two towns allows residents to sit at a single computer terminal to pay property taxes, renew car licences, buy fishing permits, or apply for a birth certificate. Entrants to the annual lottery for moose-hunting licences have in the past submitted their bids at a government office. But this year's 'Moose Draw' was conducted entirely by touch-tone telephone. Northern and NBTel are confident they have the technology to meet the deadlines for their video-on-demand service. They are less sure however, what services customers will want, and who will pay for them. The partners have already begun organising focus groups to help determine the content of their services. A market research or media consultancy may be brought in for advice. Services will be charged on a transaction basis, rather than at a flat rate, such as that used for cable-TV. Northern and NBTel recognise, however, that viewers may not be thrilled by the idea of paying to enter an electronic shopping mall or government office. Much of the financial burden is likely to fall on advertisers and other businesses, at least in the early stages. Among the ideas being floated is to refund the fee for opening an electronic shopping catalogue once a purchase is made. Consumer-oriented businesses, such as McDonald's, the hamburger chain, could hand out a 'smart card' with every purchase, to be used, say, for one hour of multimedia viewing. Content and financing issues raise more questions than answers just now. In the fast-evolving world of multimedia, there is no guarantee that the project will be a success. But Northern's Colpitts confidently predicts that 'when the capability is there, all the entrepreneurs and marketers are going to come out of the woodwork and make this thing hum.'

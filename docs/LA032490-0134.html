			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RENEWS CALL TO KEEP DRUG SUSPECT IN BAJA JAIL  </P> <P> Concerned that one of the most wanted men in Orange County's war on drugs is  being released illegally from a prison in La Paz, U.S. officials in Mexico said  Friday that they have renewed a protest to keep the suspect jailed until  attempts to extradite him have been exhausted.  </P> <P> U.S. Embassy officials said they have complained to Mexico's Foreign Ministry  that Daniel James Fowlie, 57, the accused patriarch of a vast drug-smuggling  operation, has been periodically released from Centro de Readaptacion Social to  go fishing and take care of personal business.  </P> <P> "We have reports that he has been let out of prison and we are very concerned  about those releases," said a U.S. Embassy officer in Mexico City, who  requested anonymity. "He is supposed to stay in jail."  </P> <P> The Times reported Thursday that Fowlie, who has been contesting his  extradition for three years, has been granted furloughs to go marlin fishing,  visit his beachfront house and work on real estate projects in Cabo San Lucas,  a burgeoning resort on the tip of Baja California. The popular spot for  American sportsmen is about 140 miles from La Paz, where Fowlie is imprisoned.  </P> <P> According to U.S. Embassy officials, American citizens detained in Mexican  prisons while contesting their extradition to the United States are not  supposed to be released until the proceedings have been concluded.  </P> <P> Fowlie, whose alleged drug-smuggling ring was headquartered on a secluded  ranch, has been fighting his extradition to Orange County on 49 drug charges  since his capture by Mexican agents south of Acapulco in April, 1987.  </P> <P> The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges that  Fowlie smuggled hundreds of thousands of pounds of marijuana and lesser amounts  of cocaine into the United States through Cabo San Lucas.  </P> <P> Once the drugs were in the United States, prosecutors charge that Fowlie and  others processed and packaged them at Rancho del Rio, a 213-acre Orange County  ranch with 12 structures built of imported logs, tile and river rock.  </P> <P> So far, five people, including Fowlie's two sons, have been convicted in  connection with the alleged scheme, and his rustic property on some of the  county's most valuable undeveloped land has been confiscated under federal  asset-seizure laws. The ranch was used by President Bush as a backdrop for a  national address on drugs last summer.  </P> <P> Federal investigators also say that Fowlie is important to them because he  might know about the reputed drug lords who are suspected in the  torture-slaying of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique Camarena  Salazar in 1985.  </P> <P> Despite repeated attempts over two days, the commandant of Centro de  Readaptacion Social could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> But a Mexican official familiar with the Fowlie extradition case said it would  be improper for prison officials to grant the suspect even a temporary release.  </P> <P> "The correct thing is for him to stay; the incorrect thing is for him to  leave," said Sergio Padilla, a judicial director of the Foreign Ministry's  political affairs department. Padilla added that he did not know the details of  Fowlie's incarceration and was not authorized to discuss any protests by U.S.  officials.  </P> <P> Fowlie, who told The Times in an interview that he has been released from  prison on several occasions, denied any impropriety and said his periodic  releases are legitimate work furloughs. He said he has never tried to escape  and is always escorted by an armed guard from the prison.  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City first lodged a formal complaint with the  Mexican government in November after a U.S. vice consul from Tijuana visited  the prison and demanded to see Fowlie.  </P> <P> Embassy officials said a prison guard told the vice consul that Fowlie was away  from the prison, but Mexican authorities later denied that he was absent.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said Friday that they renewed their complaint, using information  from The Times' article detailing Fowlie's releases from prison. In addition,  officials said, the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana has been instructed to again  attempt to determine whether Fowlie has been periodically released from  custody.  </P> <P> Usually granted four-day passes, Fowlie retires to a rock-and-tile house he  built on secluded beach property where his prized pit bulls stand guard and  passing gray whales blow clouds of mist into the air.  </P> <P> Fowlie is a man of several talents; his engineering skills and construction  equipment have been enlisted by a Mexican real estate company with plans for a  shopping center. And the bar association of Baja California commissioned him to  paint a long-eared horned owl for Carlos Salinas Gortari, the president of  Mexico.  </P> <P> In prison, Fowlie wears his own clothes, usually jeans and flannel shirts. He  is on a first-name basis with the staff, and the atmosphere in the prison yard  is more akin to a city park. To help him take care of businesses on the  outside, his Jeep Cherokee is parked on prison grounds and he has hired an  errand boy for $400 a month.  </P> <P> Fowlie said he was granted periodic passes from prison in 1988, but the  privileges were suspended until last December. Since then, his releases have  resumed because of a recent Mexican court decision opposing his extradition, he  said. It is not known how many times he has been released.  </P> <P> According to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, officials have never heard of any  court decision rejecting the United States' extradition request, but  information about court rulings is sometimes unreliable.  </P> <P> In 1987, officials said, a federal judge in La Paz ruled that it would be  possible to extradite Fowlie. Embassy status reports on Fowlie's case show that  he lost two other appeals of decisions approving his return and the issue is  now before the Mexican Supreme Court for a final ruling.  </P> <P> Experts in Mexican law and U.S. diplomats say that Fowlie's conditions of  confinement during his extradition proceedings are typical of people who have  money, prominence or the persuasiveness to convince authorities that they will  not escape if released for short periods of time.  </P> <P> "They are not supposed to leave the facility. They have everything they need  there. My reaction is that this is clearly irregular," said professor Jorge A.  Vargas, director of the Mexico-U.S. Law Institute at the University of San  Diego School of Law.  </P> <P> If Fowlie is being released improperly, Vargas said, it could trigger a "very  serious" investigation by Mexico's judicial authorities, including the attorney  general's office and Ministry of the Interior. Specifically, he said, there  might be violations of the country's Penitentiary Act, which spells out the  rights of inmates and the duties of prison authorities.  </P> <P> "I am not surprised," said Enrique Ramirez, a San Diego attorney who  specializes in Mexican law. "It sounds to me like he's got the kind of benefits  that money can bring you. And, if that is the case, he is going to have to keep  paying for them."  </P></p>

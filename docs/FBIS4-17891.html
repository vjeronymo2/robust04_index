			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Oleg Velichko and </F> Dmitriy Zelenin]    [Text] Damascus, April 27 (TASS) -- A Russian Government  delegation, led by First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets, is to  complete its three-day official visit to Syria on Wednesday. A  cooperation agreement is to be signed as a result of the talks.    Soskovets is also scheduled to meet with Syrian President  Hafez al-Asad later in the day. Everything seems to indicate  that Soskovets will leave for Moscow by air on Wednesday  afternoon.    When addressing members of the Syrian business community on  Tuesday, Soskovets pointed out that the Russian delegation "is  authorised to restore the partially lost economic and political  contacts".    The two sides admitted that the current state of  trade-and-economic cooperation does not meet the interests of  the two states. Oleg Davydov, Russian minister for foreign  economic relations, believes that in order to straighten out the  historically established relations between Russia and Syria, it  is essential to sign two agreements soon, namely, on the  protection of investments and on the prevention of double  taxation. Besides, Davydov suggested founding several  jointly-run Russo-Syrian banks.    As far as the rather delicate Syrian debt issue is  concerned,  the two sides consider that a political decision on it should be  made. For its part, Syria reaffirmed its readiness to repay the  current debt to Russia.    The work on agreements, which are being prepared for  signature, is proceding with difficulty, Yuriy Mikhaylov,  adviser to the first vice-premier, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.  He said the Russian side had expressed readiness to offset more  than 80 percent of the Syrian debt which is known to have  amounted to about 10,000 million U.S. dollars.    The Russian side suggested the following formula as regards  the remaining 20 percent of the debt: 60 percent of this amount  is to be repaid by Damascus in freely convertible currency and  the other 40 percent are to be redeemed with consumer goods on a  ten-year instalment plan. However, the formula proved  unacceptable to Syria. For its part, Damascus would like Russia  to offset 92 percent of the debt, Mikhaylov said.    At the close of the second round of the talks, the two sides  agreed to continue work on a debt agreement at expert groups'  level and voiced hope that it would be signed before the Russian  vice-premier meets President Al-Asad.</p>

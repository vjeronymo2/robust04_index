			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. COVERT OPERATIONS  </P> <P> In response to the article "U.S. OKs Covert Operations That May Kill  Foreigners" (by Robin Wright, Part A, Oct. 14), I was appalled at the  legislation that would permit the Bush Administration to perform "Clandestine  operations even if they threaten the lives of foreign figures." Despite the  fact that the Administration denies that it is a change of policy, it allows  the government to assassinate any foreign threat and blow it off as an accident  or just something that happened as a result of an attack. The entire idea is  ludicrous because it basically gives the Bush Administration the power to kill  any foreigner who poses a threat to the United States with total disregard to  the present or future effects that it will have on the country.  </P> <P> One reason for the redefining of this order, your article states, is because  "the Bush Administration has clearly felt cramped by the restrictions during  its first two foreign policy crisis this year -- the hostage crisis in Lebanon  and the effort to remove Noriega from power in Panama." I can't believe that  the government would feel so cramped that it would have to resort to legalizing  killing in order to make America look better.  </P> <P> Don't get the wrong idea, I am not anti-American by any stretch of the  imagination, but I am just questioning the morality of the Bush Administration  to justify something so severe as assassinations to be made legal. When is  America going to stop playing the role of "policeman of the world" to benefit  itself rather than looking at the global picture? With the approval of these  deadly operations, not only would it jeopardize the state of America and its  foreign policy, but it could cause irreversible damage to the world.  </P> <P> ERIK T.

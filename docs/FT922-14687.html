			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Minimum wage is unlikely to affect public-sector staff THE PUBLIC SECTOR would be virtually unaffected if a Labour government introduced a national minimum wage next year at the rate of Pounds 3.40 an hour. There is a widespread assumption that low pay is a serious handicap in the public sector but pay analysts say that recent pay rises and the restructuring of lower grades has taken all but a few thousand public-sector employees above the Pounds 3.40 rate. Local-government employers, who yesterday rejected a Pounds 1,000 flat-rate claim from unions representing 800,000 manual workers, say there are only 25,000 full-time workers and 200,000 part-timers below Pounds 3.40 an hour. Almost all of those will be earning more than Pounds 3.40 by next year. All white-collar staff, except for a few hundred 18-year-olds, are well above the minimum rate. The Low Pay Unit estimates that in the National Health Service there are about 130,000 ancillary staff below the minimum wage level. However, after the current pay round in which lower-paid staff have been offered a 6.8 per cent rise, there will be only a few hundred left below the level. Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services said there might be a handful of cleaners or canteen workers in the public sector who would benefit from a minimum wage. 'But the vast majority of those affected are in the private sector, usually covered by wages councils, in sectors like retailing, textiles, and private catering,' he said. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has estimated that if the minimum wage were introduced in April next year at Pounds 3.40 an hour it would affect about 2.3m people, almost exclusively in the private sector, and would add Pounds 2.2bn to the wages bill. Most of those affected are not covered by collective bargaining and some analysts conclude that there will be little pressure to maintain differentials further up the pay scale. That pressure is one of the main worries that employers have about a minimum wage. The TGWU general workers' union, the biggest union supporter of the Labour party, is suing Mr Paddy Ashdown and other senior Liberal Democrats for libel. The union says the party is claiming that the TGWU has advised members to vote for Liberal Democrats in some marginal seats.</p>

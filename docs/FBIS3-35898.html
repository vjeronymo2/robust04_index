According to Baburyan, Nagorno-Karabakh and  Armenia for many times showed their readiness to start the  negotiations without any preliminary conditions, including the  negotiations under the aegis of the intermediary missions.    Unfortunately, the official Baku took the opposite position.  Saying "no" to the latest schedule of the necessary measures  suggested by the Minsk group of the CSCE and the Russian peace-  making initiatives, Azerbaijan follows the only way to solve the  conflict -- by clashes. Baku also ignores all the attempts of  the international community to achieve peace in the region --  Azerbaijan didn't send his delegation to the session of the  European Council Parliamentary Assembly, Baburyan mentioned.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Observer: Word in your ear One of the perks for some newspaper proprietors is being able to dictate what goes in one's own newspapers. So no surprise then that Lord Stevens of Ludgate used yesterday's Sunday Express to issue a long personal statement correcting several 'highly misleading articles' in rival newspapers criticising his chairmanship of United Newspapers which is raising Pounds 190m via a rights issue. 'There has been no direct or indirect criticism' of his 12-year stewardship of United, only quotes from anonymous fund managers, says Lord Stevens. 'Neither our merchant banks, nor our other advisers, have received any complaints whatsoever.' Indeed, The Times and the Daily Mail both endorsed his cash raising exercise, notes Lord Stevens. That said, it would be surprising if there were not a few fund managers who had some doubts about the wisdom of keeping Lord Stevens as United's chairman given that the two other quoted companies he has been involved with, Invesco MIM and Alexander Proudfoot, have both cut their dividends over the last year. A dignified silence would have been more appropriate.</p>

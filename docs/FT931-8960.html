			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Jamaican campaign starts early: Indications that there may be a snap election JAMAICA'S political parties have started campaigning for a general election, even though the date of the poll has not yet been announced by Mr P J Patterson, the prime minister. The election is constitutionally due within a year, but Mr Patterson is widely expected to call an early vote in the next eight weeks. The prime minister, who took office a year ago after the resignation of Mr Michael Manley because of poor health, is thought to be keen to get his own popular mandate. However, pressure on him to call an early election is also being determined by developments which suggest that his People's National Party has a better than even chance of being returned for a second consecutive term. Opinion polls have shown that after a mid-term slump, the PNP's electoral support has again surpassed that of the opposition Jamaica Labour Party. Mr Patterson's decision is also being influenced by the internal problems of the JLP where Mr Edward Seaga, the party leader, has been at odds with some of his lieutenants over the past two years. The government's political stock has also been improved by an appearance of stability in the economy over the past ten months, after depreciation of the currency and billowing inflation which followed the deregulation of the foreign exchange market and the floating of the Jamaican dollar. Inflation for the first nine months of the current fiscal year was 17.9 per cent, against 73.1 per cent for the similar period of the last fiscal year. Although he has not confirmed the reports that he is planning an early election in the Caribbean island of 2.3m people, Mr Patterson has indicated his intentions in moves which are expected to lift the ruling party's popular support. The income tax rate was cut last month from 33 per cent to 25 per cent, and import duties on motor vehicles were significantly reduced. The government has also announced several road building projects costing millions of dollars, with work on many of these starting immediately. The signs have not been lost on the JLP which, like the ruling party, has been completing its slate of candidates. So convinced is Mr Seaga that Mr Patterson will call a snap election that the opposition leader has announced that his party's campaign will start next week. This has been proceeded by well publicised walkabouts by Mr Seaga and the dissidents who had rebelled against his leadership of the JLP, including Mr Pearnel Charles, a former deputy leader. The big issue in the campaign will be the government's handling of the economy, particularly its decision to deregulate extensively, giving greater play to market forces while divesting several state-owned economic enterprises. The JLP has raised questions about aspects of the government's economic policies, claiming that it has gone overboard in its enthusiasm for market forces, and has pointed to what it says is the absence of any significant new investments which the government said its economic policies would encourage. The expansion of the economy which the government had expected has been constrained by the poor performance of the bauxite mining and refining industry because of a weak international market for aluminium. Official figures on the performance of the economy last year are yet to be published, but government economists have said the growth in the economy was 'moderate'. Export agriculture - sugar and bananas - improved slightly, and the main contribution came from strong growth in tourism, now the main earner of foreign currency. There are already indications of party political violence, which has become a part of Jamaica's election campaigns. In the last election in 1989, both parties made much of a publicly signed compact against political violence, and the campaign was less violent than expected. Already, however, the parties have exchanged accusations over responsibility for a spate of shootings in one of the poorer sections of Kingston, the capital.</p>

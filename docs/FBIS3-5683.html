			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Details of a statement of demands on a competition  policy that the U.S. Government presented to the Japanese  Government at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks have  been disclosed. One major point is a demand for intensified  enforcement of the Antimonopoly Act to prevent bid-rigging.  Other demands include increases of at least 10 percent by fiscal  year 1995 in the personnel and budget for the Investigation  Department of the Fair Trade Commission [FTC], and the creation  of a system for paying rewards to those who have provided  information on cases of unfair trade practices. The intensified  enforcement of the competition policy is also one major point of  the measures for promoting market opening to be worked out by  the government in mid-March. However, with regard to the U.S.  demands, some Japanese Government officials have refuted the  statement, saying that "it includes proposals such as creating a  reward system which are unsuitable in the climate of Japanese  society" (as stated by an FTC source). Therefore, this issue  may possibly cause new friction between Japan and the United  States.    At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, this statement  of  demands was submitted to the working-level panel on  "transparency and circulation connected with the competition  policy and concerned procedures." The U.S. Government is  demanding that, to strengthen enforcement of the Antimonopoly  Law, the Investigation Department, which is responsible for  direct investigations of and prosecutions for Antimonopoly Law  violations, should be expanded. Approval has been given to the  FTC in its draft budget for fiscal year 1994 to add 17 staff  members to its inspection department -- a 9-percent increase  compared to that of the previous year. However, the U.S.  Government is demanding that a larger number of staff members be  added.    Aside from demanding that the structure of various  industries  -- such as the construction industry -- be strengthened to  prevent bid-rigging, the U.S. Government has also proposed  creation of a system of paying rewards to those who provide  information on unfair trade practices, and for taking stronger  administrative measures against those who have violated  regulations. Moreover, the U.S. Government is also demanding  that those companies involved in bid-rigging be prohibited from  participating in bidding on public works projects or on  government procurement contracts for at least 12 months, and  that a system be introduced for forcing these companies to pay  compensation to the government for the damage caused by  bid-rigging.    The U.S. Government also made requests concerning business  organizations. It requested that various agencies and  ministries issue administrative guidance so that foreign  companies will not be excluded from or discriminated against by  organizations of various business circles. Moreover, it should  be guaranteed that those foreign companies which are members of  business organizations be provided with the same information as  are their Japanese counterparts, and that the appropriate  information be provided to nonmember foreign companies.    At the same time, the United States is demanding that  regulations concerning the offering of premiums to customers be  eased. In many cases, U.S. companies promote sales by offering  premiums to customers. However, the U.S. Government is not  happy about the fact that strict Japanese regulations on  offering premiums constitute a barrier when a foreign company  intends to join Japanese business organizations. The U.S.  Government is now trying to urge the FTC to increase the ceiling  for lotteries or premiums to at least 10 million yen by the end  of June and to abolish all regulations concerning offering  premiums by the end of fiscal year 1995.</p>

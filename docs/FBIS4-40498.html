			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by the Russian Federation Embassy Press Service in </F> Armenia: "Declaration of the Russian Federation Embassy in  Armenia"]    [Text] Articles of anti-Russian orientation have  recently been published on the pages of certain local  newspapers. These articles are clearly written by a foreign  author.    We know that he who pays the piper calls the tune.    It would be possible not to pay attention to this were it  not  for the fact that hidden behind these published materials, which  in a number of instances bear the nature of personal attacks  against the Russian ambassador to Armenia, are the coordinated  actions of certain forces that are pursuing the objective of  slandering the foreign policy of Russia with respect to  countries of the near abroad.    Clearly it is no accident that the appearance of such  articles coincides time-wise with the shift beginning to be seen  in the Karabakh settlement, achieved to a great extent thanks to  the active peacemaking efforts of Russia and the  interparliamentary assembly of the CIS.    Russia does not dictate its will to the sovereign republics  of the former USSR, does not interfere in their internal  affairs, does not seek any advantage from the difficulties they  have to endure, and does not impose on its friends. Such policy  is alien to Russia.    Russia is interested in peace and stability along its  borders  and in the regions adjacent to it, so as to give its undivided  attention to accomplishing its own internal political, economic,  and other tasks.    There can be no doubt but that all the attempts of enemies  and those pretending to be Russia's friends to impede the  development of Russian-Armenian relations, which are on the  rise, and to sow seeds of mistrust between Armenia and Russia  are doomed to failure.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RTD FUELS UP FOR NEW HAPPY RIDER ADS  </P> <P> Lots of people like to gripe about the RTD. But if you happen to be a fan of  the Southern California Rapid Transit District, here's your chance to appear in  one of their advertisements.  </P> <P> For several months, RTD has been running an ad campaign, "Your Neighborhood  Bus," which features various riders who praise the city's public transportation  system. Now, the Los Angeles ad firm that created that campaign, Pool/Sarraille  Advertising, is about to begin hunting up people for yet another batch of  riders-who-love-RTD ads.  </P> <P> Where do they look for the stars of their ads? Many of the people who appear in  the current campaign were suggested by bus drivers or by RTD board members.  Also, some RTD staff members randomly interviewed RTD passengers for the  king-sized bus sideboards, billboards and print ads. And Anthony Fortuno,  marketing director at the RTD, said people can call to volunteer if they're  interested.  </P> <P> But aside from the publicity, there's not much in it for those featured in the  ads. "We didn't pay them any money," said Fortuno. But RTD did give each of  them several months' worth of bus passes. Those are worth about $42 apiece.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Senada Cumurovic] </F>   [Text] The aggressor forces have not yet fully withdrawn  to the distance of 3 km from Gorazde. This was confirmed this  morning by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic  after his talks with General Michael Rose, commander of the UN  forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Sergio De Mello, head of the  United Nations' civilian sector for the former Yugoslavia.  Senada Cumorovic reports:    [Cumorovic] General Michael Rose briefly said that he talked  to Prime Minister Silajdzic today about some details and the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] plans for Gorazde, not  specifying what actually these plans were. In a statement for  journalists, Dr. Haris Silajdzic was somewhat more specific  concerning the topics of and the reasons for today's meeting  with Rose and Sergio De Mello.    [Begin Silajdzic recording] We are discussing the situation  in Gorazde. The aggressor forces have not withdrawn yet from  Ljubcici and some other places inside 3 km. On the whole, they  have withdrawn but [words indistinct]. This is where the  problem is. We also have a report from our forces that some  heavy weapons are still inside the 20 km radius [words  indistinct] heavy weapons of the aggressor side. We want to be  completely clear as to what this means. General Rose has  therefore promised that he will today study the photographs  taken from the air in order to establish whether the Serbian  heavy artillery is still inside the 20 km radius. [end recording]    [Cumurovic] In addition to military issues, they also  discussed the normalization of life in Gorazde.    [Begin Silajdzic recording] We are currently discussing the  situation concerning water. The question of water is acute.  You know that the civilian population is now receiving water  from the springs that are not quite hygienic. We are afraid  that some disease does not break out. Therefore, we will work  toward the immediate repair of the water system, which, as you  know, was destroyed by the aggressor forces before they  withdrew. [end recording]    [Cumurovic] As regards journalists' question, we will single  out the one concerning the continuation of negotiations in this  phase of the peace process. Dr. Silajdzic takes the view that  restarting the peace process could make sense only if the Serbs  honor the ultimatum, because this is a matter of the credibility  of the international community. Without that credibility we  cannot talk about negotiations [words indistinct] sense, Dr.  Silajdzic told journalists. Following the statements for  journalists, and General rose's departure, Prime Minister  Silajdzic continued talks with Sergio De Mello, head of the  civilian sector of the United Nations for the former Yugoslavia.</p>

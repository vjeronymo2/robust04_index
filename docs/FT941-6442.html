			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / PLO demands pullout timetable be kept: Prisoners released as Israel seeks to lure Palestinians back to peace talks The Middle East peace process could collapse if Israel does not begin its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho by April 13, the original date for completing the pullout, one of the chief Palestinian architects of the PLO-Israeli declaration of principles said yesterday. But Mr Ahmad Quorieh, a senior member of the PLO executive committee, said in an interview he believed the PLO could not resume negotiations on implementing the declaration unless Israel agreed to discuss the future of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and made further guarantees for the protection of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Mr Quorieh's assessment came as Israel began freeing 500 Palestinian prisoners yesterday in a further attempt to win back the PLO to peace talks after last Friday's Hebron mosque massacre. The government also offered compensation to Palestinian victims and said up to 100 Jewish settlers would be disarmed. PLO leaders in the occupied territories said the gestures were insufficient. They added that Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, would have to stay away from direct peace talks with Israel for at least two to four weeks to assuage Palestinian outrage at the Hebron killings. The PLO demands for peace talks to resume include the disarmament of all 120,000 settlers and the dismantling of some of the more extremist ideological settlements such as Kiryat Arba, the 6,000-strong Jewish community just outside Hebron where Dr Baruch Goldstein, who carried out last Friday's massacre, lived. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Israel could meet demands such as disarming extremist settlers and preventing their movement into some sensitive areas, allowing an unarmed international force to be deployed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for a short period, and increasing the Palestinian police force for Gaza-Jericho from 8,000 to 10,000. However he added that the government rejected PLO demands for disarming all settlers and dismantling some settlements. One or more PLO leaders are expected to fly to Washington today to discuss with the US administration the PLO's demands before peace talks can resume. In the US capital, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a House appropriations subcommittee yesterday that Mr Arafat had assured him by telephone that he would send envoys to the Washington talks, but that he 'needed a little time'. A senior US official said a PLO emissary would arrive in Washington today and would meet the secretary of state tomorrow. Mr Christopher added that Mr Arafat was indispensable to peace efforts in the Middle East. The PLO is, meanwhile, hoping the UN Security Council will pass a resolution calling on Israel to accept an 'international presence' in the territories and to implement measures 'including the confiscation of arms' to prevent further settler violence. The US, Palestinians and Egypt were yesterday finalising the text of such a resolution, which would do no more than request Israel to accede to the UN call. In Tunis Mr Quorieh, who was central to the secret talks in Norway which led to the PLO-Israeli accord, said frustration over delays in implementing the declaration of principles and the Hebron massacre had combined to create 'the seeds of real conflict' in the occupied territories. 'If April 13 comes without an Israeli withdrawal, I have my doubts that this agreement will fly,' he said. He added that the PLO 'cannot deliver peace' under the present circumstances of tension in the occupied territories without much stronger Israeli action , and that the declaration of principles could survive only 'if the Israelis begin to take real measures that people can see'. As the release of Palestinian prisoners got under way yesterday, clashes erupted for a fourth day throughout the occupied territories. In Hebron and surrounding areas, a 24-hour curfew on Palestinians was relaxed, but black flags of mourning remained on many homes. Relatives of the victims of last Friday's massacre vowed to take revenge on Jewish settlers. And in a possible sign of reprisals spreading to the west, a man described as an Arab shot four ultra-orthodox Jewish youths in New York as their van approached Brooklyn Bridge. Although he was heard to shout 'Kill the Jews,' police said a traffic dispute may have sparked the incident. No fatalities were immediately confirmed. In Washington, US Attorney General Janet Reno and Mr Louis Freeh, FBI director, said they were monitoring the situation. AP adds: Soldiers accidentally shot an Israeli settler couple in the occupied West Bank yesterday. The man later died of his wounds, a spokesman for the settlers said. Israel radio and army radio initially said the shooting near the West Bank settlement of Ariel was an ambush. The army confirmed that two Israelis were wounded and that it was investigating the circumstances. It was the second shooting accident in the area since Sunday when soldiers mistakenly opened fire on an Israeli vehicle near the Arab town of Anabta, wounding two Israelis.

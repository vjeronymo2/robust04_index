			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts say West can do without Russian nickel Nickel production is rising so fast that new output from western producers will more that compensate for any fall in Russian exports, according to some analysts who have been looking into the recent very sharp rise in nickel prices. Much of the price rise has been accompanied by rumours about production problems at Norilsk in Russia, the world's biggest supplier. 'Traders who have pounced on every bullish rumour have been rewarded with ever-higher prices and bigger commissions just before the Christmas holiday,' one analyst pointed out. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, said that, even if problems at Norilsk had cost output of 30,000 tonnes, this equated to only two weeks consumption at the present rate. Two weeks off current stocks would still leave them equivalent to 13 weeks of consumption and six week above 'normal' levels. He said that during the winter months shipments from Norilsk were reduced to a trickle so there would be no impact from the shortfall for some months. In any case, the Siberian port of Dudinka and, it was thought, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, had substantial stocks of nickel that could be delivered to London Metal Exchange warehouses. Also, western nickel producers were very rapidly raising output - Mr Moore estimated production would increase next year by 70,000 tonnes. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton Metals, is forecasting a 65,000 tonnes rise - or 11 per cent - in western nickel production to 655,000 tonnes in 1995 followed by a further slight increase to 665,000 tonnes in 1996. Nickel consumption is also forecast by Billiton to grow strongly because of increasing demand from the stainless steel industry, the main user of nickel. But, says Mr MacMillan, 'the most extreme case imaginable - of zero Norilsk shipments next year - would still leave us with stocks at 16 weeks of consumption by the end of 1995 if our demand forecast is near the mark.' Billiton is forecasting that net imports of nickel to the west will slide from 135,000 tonnes this year to 120,000 tonnes in 1995 and to 115,000 tonnes in 1996. Nevertheless, this would still leave total western world supply up from 730,000 tonnes this year to 780,000 tonnes in 1995 and 785,000 tonnes in 1996. If these forecasts prove correct, there would be a nickel surplus of 10,000 tonnes this year, of 20,000 tonnes in 1995 and no supply deficit until 1996, when there would be one of 15,000 tonnes.</p>

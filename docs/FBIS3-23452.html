He was reported as warning  that no one should approach the plane, and reiterating his  demand to talk to the press.    Two members of the Carabinieri police and one of the Italian  police force were reported as being on the passenger list.    The plane was surrounded, at a safe distance, by large  numbers of Carabinieri and other police, as well as 50 or so  firemen.    Cizio was reported to be brandishing a package he said  contained a hand grenade; talking with police and Meridiana  officials on the plane radio, he is believed to have declared  his intention to publicise an "injustice" he received in a  recent judicial inquiry.    Cizio has a record of petty crime including burglary and  "verbally assaulting a public official".    Rome police chief Fernando Masone was reportedly on his way  to the airport.</p>

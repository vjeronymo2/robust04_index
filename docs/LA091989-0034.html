			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P> A federal court jury has awarded $4 million in compensatory damages to Nancy  Tash, daughter of the founder of Mail Boxes Etc. USA. The jury declined to  award punitive damages.  </P> <P> Tash had alleged that executives at the San Diego-based company fraudulently  induced her to sell 500,000 shares in the company at a below-market price in  1983, shortly before the company went public.  </P> <P> In her lawsuit, Tash, the daughter of the late Gerald Aul, alleged that Mail  Boxes President and Chief Executive Anthony W. DeSio defrauded her when he  convinced her to sell a 23% stake in the company for $50,000 and a $300,000  note.  </P> <P> According to court papers, DeSio schemed to defraud Tash, a St. Louis resident,  by telling her that Mail Boxes was not performing well. At the time, according  to court filings by Tash, "Mail Boxes Etc. USA was achieving a high rate of  growth, sales were up, its financial condition was improving and the prospects  for higher near- and long-term profits had never been as certain."  </P> <P> Tash alleged that DeSio told her the business "was not succeeding, and that it  was in jeopardy," according to the documents.  </P> <P> Tash's suit also alleged that she sold her shares only after DeSio promised her  that all "selling shareholders would be treated exactly alike." Tash's attorney  maintained in court that DeSio gave "special benefits" to Herbert Goffstein, a  shareholder who later founded a separate company called Mail Boxes Coast to  Coast.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes Etc. USA franchises postal and communications service centers. It  now has operations in most of the United States, along with Puerto Rico and  Canada. The company will open its 1,000th location Sept. 25. It recently  entered the Japanese market.  </P> <P> The company intends to appeal the U. S. District Court verdict, which was  reached Friday, Mail Boxes spokeswoman Sandra Greenberg said Monday.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Nechayev] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- The Duma faction of the Party  of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) headed by Sergey Shakhray  protested against attempts to depict Russia as an anti-Muslim  country, which is being done by certain mass media in connection  with its stand in the Bosnian crisis, and warned that such an  image threatens Russian national interests.    "They want to clash us with Muslim states of the CIS, with  traditional partners in the Arab world", according to a  statement of the PRES distributed on Monday and which also  called on the CIS countries to promote military-political  consolidation in order to "rule out suspicions of anti-Muslim  moods in Russia".    "There is an impression that somebody wants to transform the  local Bosnian conflict into a global contrapposition of the  Muslim and Orthodox civilisations", according to the document.    The PRES accused mass media of "deliberately ignoring" the  fact that 15 million people in Russia are Muslims and warned  that Muslim-Orthodox conflict in Bosnia "threatens to spread to  the Russian territory".    The faction said that the Russian Foreign Ministry is also  to  blame for the current situation in Bosnia as it "hastily  recognised the unitarian state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, supported  the unilateral sanctions against Yugoslavia and then actually  untied the hands of NATO for air strikes on Serbs".    Russia should initiate the lifting of UN sanctions against  Yugoslavia and at the same time insist on imposing sanctions  against Croats and Muslims if they sabotage peaceful talks,  according to the document.    The PRES supported the proposal of the Russian president to  convene a conference on Bosnia with the participation of Russia,  the United States, the UN and the EU [European Union], demanded  to stop recruiting mercenaries for the warring sides and called  on mass media to objectively cover the Bosnian conflict.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Iran presses on with campaign to rebuild its military might / A report on Tehran's re-armament, fuelled by a desire for regional power as well as suspicion of its neighbours TEHRAN Radio, in a rare announcement recently, gave some details of Iran's defence budget: the country's parliament had approved an allocation of IR413bn to the Ministry of Defence and Armed Force Logistics for training, technical research and arms purchase. This money would translate into Dollars 5.9bn at the artificially high official exchange rate of IR70 to the dollar or into Dollars 295m at the more realistic floating rate of IR1400 to the dollar. But, even though reliable estimates are hard to come by, it is highly unlikely that Iran is spending as little as Dollars 295m a year on rebuilding its defences since the end following its eight-year war with Iraq that ended four years ago. 'Military Balance,' the annual defence review of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, put the defence budget at just over Dollars 3bn for 1990 and Dollars 3.8bn for 1991. This would account for 17 per cent of the Dollars 17.3bn in foreign exchange earnings from oil in 1990 and just under 24 per cent for last year. If the latter is true, then 1990 defence expenditure higher would be greater than that spent on food imports. A report published in the Tehran daily newspaper Jomhuri Islami said that Iran spent just under Dollars 12bn during the 1980-88 war against Iraq, making an average of Dollars 1.5bn a year. This compares with an average of Dollars 8.4bn per annum during the last four years of the Shah's rule. However much Iran is spending on defence today, one thing is certain, according to Dr Nikola Schahgaldian of the US-based Rand Corporation: 'The rebuilding of the Iranian armed forces is a basic goal of the government in Tehran; there is no disagreement between the decision makers on this.' It would be surprising were it otherwise. Iran's capitulation to the Iraqis, in the form of accepting UN Security Council Resolution 598 calling for a ceasefire, was because it no longer had the weapons with which to fight. Mr Mohsen Rezai, commander of the Revolutionary Guards, said a few months after the ceasefire: 'They had armour and we did not . . . We were unarmed infantrymen against the enemy's cavalry.' With Saddam Hussein still in power in Iraq and continuing to make bellicose noises towards Iran, Tehran views the defence of its western border as vital. It does not want to be caught off guard as it was when Iraq took advantage of the internal Iranian turmoil caused by the 1979 revolution. Iraq was able to invade when the highest ranking military officer in Iran was a colonel. The break-up of the Soviet Union is another factor. Iran is anxious about the long-term potential for stability in the re-emerging Moslem republics along its northern border. Mr Ali Akbar Velayati went on a ten-day tour of six republics last November and has signed a series of co-operation agreements. But the potential for conflict remains, particularly with Azerbaijan, since there is a risk that Iran's own Azeri minority might attempt to break away and join their northern neighbour. Moreover, Iran's desire to rebuild its armed forces is not confined solely to defensive considerations. It also wants to become the major power in the Gulf, filling the vacuum caused by the recent defeat of rival Iraq by the US-led coalition. Tehran's security plan is to establish a common defence pact with the six nations of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) - an offer which has been extended a highly cautious welcome by the council members. Bruised by the experience of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, some GCC countries, notably Kuwait and Qatar, have decided, at least for the time being, to rely on the US for support through bilateral pacts. Iran is also keeping a wary eye on Saudi Arabia and would consider any build-up in US-Saudi security arrangements as a potential threat to its own security. Iran is therefore aiming to build its forces to match the far superior Saudi military. There is, however, little likelihood that Iran could quickly return to the formidable defensive capability it enjoyed under the Shah. As one of the US's closest allies, the Shah was allowed the cream of US and West European technology and weaponry. Tehran now has to resort to anything it can buy, and the result is a mishmash of armoury from East and West. Iran has bought two squadrons of Mig-29 fighter aircraft Sukhoi bombers and tanks from the Soviet Union. It has more than 100 aircraft from the Iraqi army which it has not returned, comprising mostly Soviet makes but also French Mirage aircraft. These are alongside US F-14s from the Shah's era, most of which lack spare parts and maintenance. Other military purchases have been made from China, North Korea, western Europe, Brazil, Argentina and Pakistan. Western criticism of Soviet arms sales to Iran may put a brake on military transfers; Marshal Yevgeni Shaposhnikov, chief of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said earlier this week that arms sales to Iran would be reduced. The Iranian army and navy are being streamlined with attempts to merge the forces of the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) with the more professional regular forces. The two navies operated under a unified command in exercises late last year. The Ministry for the Revolutionary Guards was subsumed under the Defence Ministry by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani soon after he took office in 1989. Meanwhile, speculation about Iran's seeking a nuclear weapons capability remains just that. Tehran is continuing the nuclear power programme started by the Shah but as yet has no completed nuclear reactors. Germany has pulled out of building the Bushehr nuclear power plant, but China has confirmed furnishing some equipment. However, Iran, which is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is obliged to allow visits from the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its facilities. The agency inspected Iran's nuclear facilities last November and it hopes to send inspectors again this month. 'We are satisfied with what Iran has declared to us,' the agency said yesterday. 'We are aware of rumours of activities beyond that, and are examining the possibility of clarifying the true situation with the Iranian authorities.' Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati this week denied western press reports that Iran was trying to lure nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union. 'That is a false, hostile propaganda against us,' he said.</p>

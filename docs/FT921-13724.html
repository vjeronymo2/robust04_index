			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: South Africa plans first Ecu Eurobond offering SOUTH Africa plans to follow up its return to the international capital markets last September with its first Ecu Eurobond, possibly later this week. The French bank, Paribas, is believed to have been awarded the mandate to arrange the offering of five-year bonds. Paribas was also involved in South Africa's DM400m (Dollars 250m) deal in September. Swiss Bank Corporation is said to be joint lead manager. Banks involved in the deal stand to lose the business of some Canadian state borrowers, which have a strict policy on the matter. Up to 80 per cent of South Africa's D-Mark issue was placed within Germany, mainly with retail investors. An Ecu offering would test South Africa's appeal to a wider investor base. South Africa's return to the international capital markets has met some opposition. A Dollars 200m Eurobond for the Independent Development Trust, a government-funded health, education and housing trust, had to be pulled last November, when the African National Congress refused to back the deal. The African National Congress's approval for this offering will not be sought, banking sources said. The African National Congress opposes new international borrowings by the present government and an African National Congress-led administration may not honour new loans.</p>

(These are not toll-free numbers.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD's regulation at 24 CFR 24.700 is being amended to eliminate the designation of authority to order Limited Denials of Participation (LDP) by specifically listed positions. The positions listed will not be accurate after HUD's Field Office restructuring because the positions and functions of certain Department officials will be changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In November 1993, the Secretary announced the reorganization of HUD's field structure to improve HUD's performance and provide HUD's customers_members of the public and program beneficiaries_more efficient service and less bureaucracy by empowering HUD employees to serve HUD's customers more effectively. In implementing this objective, the Secretary determined to remove the Regional organizational layer and provide officials at lower organizational levels full authority to carry out program functions, with these field office officials reporting directly to program officials. The ordering of LDP actions will assist in achieving the Secretary's objective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, &sect;24.700 designates authority to order LDPs to Regional Administrators, Office Managers, the Director of an Office of Indian Programs, or the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing. This amendment will give a broad designation of authority to unspecified Department officials, similar to the authority set forth in HUD's debarment regulations at &sect;24.105(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 11, 1993, the President issued Executive Order 12861, which requires each Executive department and agency to undertake to eliminate within three years of the effective date of the Order not less than 50 percent of its civilian internal management regulations that are not required by law. Section 24.700 is a civilian internal management regulation of the type referenced in the Executive Order. The Secretary of HUD has determined that listing specific position titles in 24 CFR 24.700 is not required by law and can be accomplished through published delegations of authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A notice of Delegation from the Secretary, delegating the Secretary's Authority to order LDPs to the Department's Assistant Secretaries, with authority to redelegate, was published on April 15, 1994 in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the word ``mortgages'' in &sect;24.700 is being corrected to read ``mortgagees.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Justification for Final Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, &sect;10.1 provides that notice and public procedure may be omitted with respect to rules governing the Department's organization or its own internal practices or procedures. The amendment being made in this document is such a rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures in this document relate only to internal administrative procedures whose content does not relate to the physical condition of project areas or building sites and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule eliminates unnecessary regulations. There are no anticompetitive discriminatory aspects of the rule with regard to small entities, and there are not any unusual procedures that would need to be complied with by small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612, Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. The rule is limited to eliminating unnecessary or duplicative regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

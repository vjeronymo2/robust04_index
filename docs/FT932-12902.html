			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Awaiting US GDP ALTHOUGH most of the price action in foreign exchange markets was in the peseta crosses last week, the main focus for dealers may now move back to the dollar, writes James Blitz. At the start of the year, the markets were bullish for the US currency in the first half of 1993. That optimism has now all but withered away, with the dollar failing to break through the DM1.67 level against the D-Mark. On Friday, the US currency fell to DM1.5770, a new low in the current cycle  -and some analysts believe it is going lower still. Economic indicators in the next few days will decide the dollar's near-term fate. The most important indicator is the first quarter GDP figure, due out on Thursday. There is little doubt that the economic upswing in the US in the first three months of this year was more shallow than the one which took place in the last quarter of 1992. But Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International in London is more pessimistic about the figure than other economists: he thinks it will be around 2 per cent, against market estimates of 2.6 per cent. The Conference Board's consumer confidence figures, due tomorrow, will also be keenly watched. The market expects only a slight rise in confidence, of around 63.4 per cent, compared to last month's Conference Board figure of 62.6 per cent. In Europe, there will be a strong focus on the peseta, although economists believe this is unlikely to have an effect on the structure of the ERM. One factor which may help the peseta would be another cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate on Wednesday. The sharp decline in German call money in recent days, down to 7.62 per cent on Friday night, has made a repo rate fall inevitable.</p>

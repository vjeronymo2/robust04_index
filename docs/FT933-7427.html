			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West doubles to Pounds 20.4m BRISTOL &amp; WEST, the 10th largest building society, which has been troubled by high levels of bad debt, yesterday disclosed doubled pre-tax profit at the half year and said it had reduced mortgage arrears significantly. The society, whose long and short-term debt ratings were downgraded last month by the European ratings agency, IBCA, because of high levels of arrears, disclosed a jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 9.5m). The percentage rise was increased by the adoption of the FRS 3 accounting standard, which meant a restatement of last year's first half profits from Pounds 13.1m. Mr Tony FitzSimons, the society's chief executive, said total mortgage arrears had fallen by 19 per cent on the end of 1992, while the value of mortgages more than 12 months in arrears had dropped by 15 per cent from Pounds 102m to Pounds 87m. The society was badly affected in the first half of last year by a fourfold rise in provisions for bad debts because of a fall in the value of repossessed homes. Mr FitzSimons said the society was now selling repossession actively. Provisions rose 11.4 per cent to Pounds 33.1m (Pounds 29.7m) because of suspended interest and the realising of losses on repossessed properties. Mr FitzSimons predicted that full-year provisions would be down on last year's total of Pounds 74.1m. Net interest income rose to Pounds 78.3m (Pounds 64.2m) and other operating income moved up to Pounds 35.2m (Pounds 30.6m). Expenses also grew to Pounds 60m (Pounds 55.6m) as the society wrote off goodwill on Channel Islands estate agency and a housing association acquisition. The society's capital ratios increased through the retention of Pounds 14.5m post-tax profit and the issue of Pounds 75m sub-ordinated debt. Gross capital was 7.3 per cent of share and deposit liabilities, against 6.2 per cent at the end of 1992.</p>

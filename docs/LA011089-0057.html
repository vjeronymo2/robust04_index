The musical's  longevity was second only to that of "A Chorus Line," which opened in 1975. The  scenery and other equipment are being kept for a possible revival in April with  an all-black cast. The hit London production of "42nd Street" closed the  previous day, having played 1,823 performances over 4 1/2 years.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

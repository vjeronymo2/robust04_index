			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Sprint's triple jump For the first time since the break-up of AT&amp;T, US consumers will be able to choose the same brand for local, long-distance and mobile phone calls. That, at any rate, is the objective of Sprint's alliance with three of the largest US cable television groups. Actually achieving this aspiration will not be easy. Massive investment and regulatory changes will be needed before the cable television companies' networks can provide local telephone services. Similarly, the partners have only a small role in mobile communications, though this could change if they are successful in winning licences in the US government's forthcoming auction. Sprint's alliance is a ground-breaking event in the fast-changing US communications landscape. The Baby Bells, the dominant forces in the local telephone market, are the most vulnerable. Not only could they lose local customers to Sprint's venture; their high margins for providing local access to long-distance operators will be under threat. The Bells are likely to respond by redoubling their efforts to be allowed to enter the television and long-distance markets, while building their own alliances in mobile communications. Sprint's long-distance rivals may be under pressure to respond too. Much depends on whether consumers would really prefer to buy packages of local, long-distance and mobile services from a single source. If Sprint is right, AT&amp;T will need to add a local offering to its existing long-distance and mobile services. MCI, whose attempts to knit together mobile alliances have so far floundered, will have even further to go.</p>

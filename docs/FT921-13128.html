			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: AIB US offshoot almost doubles to Dollars 110m PRE-TAX profits at First Maryland Bancorp, the US subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank Group, surged to Dollars 110.1m (Pounds 61.5m) in 1991, up from Dollars 57.9m in the previous 12 months. The result was helped by a strong performance in the last quarter when profits rose to Dollars 23.9m (Dollars 1.5m). Total assets were up 9.4 per cent to Dollars 8.95bn (Dollars 8.18bn), while total loans rose 13 per cent from Dollars 4.81bn to Dollars 5.43bn. Deposits were up 17 per cent to Dollars 6.99bn (Dollars 5.99bn). The results did not include figures for The York Bank of Pennsylvania, which has assets of Dollars 1.4bn, bought by AIB at the end of December. The performance rested on a strong increase in fee income, better funding costs, and investment securities gains, combined with much lower provisions against bad loans and tighter control of non-interest costs. 'Since we first acquired a stake in 1983, FMB's track record has been one of consistent profits through every quarter of every financial year, a truly remarkable performance for any bank in the United States,' said Mr Gerald Scanlan, AIB deputy chairman and group chief executive. At the end of 1991, the total capital ratio of the bank was 11 per cent.</p>

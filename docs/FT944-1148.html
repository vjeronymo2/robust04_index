			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Day belongs to Russians ..Night to Chechens: The breakaway republic may lose to superior arms but it has determined guerrillas A bayonet protruding from a breast pocket, grenades strapped around his middle and a rifle slung across a shoulder, Mr Musa Israilov, speaks earnestly: 'They want to bring us up like Russians,' he complains, the creases around his eyes deepening, 'but we are not Russian.' In the soupy fog surrounding the Chechen capital of Grozny, Mr Israilov's simple observation has a clarity of reasoning that is at the heart of the first war on Russian soil since 1945. It is a violent debate over the very roots of Russia's conquering traditions, and the widespread regional resentment challenging its right to rule. President Boris Yeltsin has highlighted that threat by ordering the army to pull the breakaway republic of Chechnya back into the Russian Federation. With its stark backdrop of black mountains and thick woods, Chechnya is among 20 ethnic regions conquered by Russians in the last three centuries. The region's mountain people have fiercely resisted Russian military might and customs since Muscovite forces first appeared there in the early 19th century. They now appear unlikely to succumb easily. In Moscow, there are colourful anecdotes slandering the Chechens; they are gangsters at heart; dark men in pinstripe suits and fedoras who aspire to be Godfather figures; they run drugs and terrorise innocents. But the Chechens' declaration of independence, made when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, has given the reputed image a sharp edge. You do find firearms in Chechnya, so many and in such variety that you quickly wonder what made Moscow believe its invasion would by any scope of the imagination be surgical and quick. There are no pinstripes or fedoras in sight, however. Instead, the hospitable Chechens appear genuinely grateful that someone is willing to investigate whether indeed they are the monsters of Russian literature and contemporary gossip. 'They think our president, who we elected, is a bandit just because he doesn't obey them,' says Mr Ruslan Bedsiev, 26, one of Mr Israilov's men. 'We are peaceful people. We don't want a war.' The Chechens, a Moslem Turkic people, deeply resent Moscow's 140 years of occupation. Indeed, among the most powerful images in Grozny is a small square that is obtrusive in its fresh modernity against the city's dour appearance. It is the site of a grim memorial to Stalin's 'Operation Mountain' - the 1944 deportation of the entire Chechen population to Kazakhstan, including the current president, Mr Dzhokar Dudayev. Stalin accused the Chechens of supporting the Nazi invasion, a claim most historians dispute. More likely, Stalin was upset that the Chechens exploited the invasion in their perennial quest for independence. A plaque claims that 380,000 Chechens died in the deportation - either murdered or through disease - and the memorial consists of 6,000 gravemarkers that the Soviets uprooted and used as paving stones. Hundreds of broken pieces of gravestones are piled like rubble in the centre, out of which protrudes a giant, sculpted fist. 'Lots of people were dying. It was crazy freezing cold,' said one survivor, a man identifying himself as Abdullah. He was, he says, nine when Soviet soldiers arrived to take the Chechens away. 'The Communists among us said Stalin didn't know, and that he would return us home.' You cannot visit the Chechen front lines, Grozny's bazaars or ordinary homes without hearing the tales of deportation. Mr Israilov, the front-line commander, his eyes narrowing, warns: 'We're not going to Siberia this time.' The Chechens are resisting. They no doubt will lose the capital against Moscow's superior arms, however, but appearances indicate that the conflict will lead to a protracted, Islamic-tinged guerrilla war resembling the Soviet debacle in Afghanistan. In one village near Grozny, a stocky, determined businessman named Ayub Khansultanov, 30, lives with four older brothers. Every night at about 11, Mr Khansultanov leaves his large brick home, armed with anti-tank weapons and grenades and Soviet-era versions of the American, ground-to-air stinger missile made famous during the Afghan war, and early every morning he returns, exhausted. He does not say where he is going or has been, only that about 150 Chechens make up his fighting force. 'The day belongs to the Russians, the night belongs to us.' If the scene in the Khansultanov house and the surrounding village is being mirrored elsewhere in Chechnya, the Russians indeed will face a long, bloody war. Mr Khansultanov says as much. 'Now the thing begins. In Chechnya, war can last a lifetime.' The Chechens have found unlikely partners among the invading Russian forces. Some of the Russian officers have found that the Chechen people are not the reprehensible people widely depicted back home. Others simply have not managed to summon up the motivation that former Russian armies found for such operations.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> South Korean riot police clashed with thousands of anti-government and  anti-American protesters during a march called by a day-old alliance of  dissident groups. A crowd of 5,000 to 10,000 massed in a Seoul street, then  headed toward the headquarters of President Roh Tae Woo's ruling party. Their  way was blocked by police, who responded with tear gas when the protesters  threw gasoline bombs and rocks. The protest was called by the Coalition for a  National Democratic Movement.  </P></p>

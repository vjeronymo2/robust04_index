			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Arts: Squaring a circle - Off the Wall TO THE South Bank (again), to hear about the bright new future (again). 'The world's largest arts complex' has gone through more retreads than Gary Glitter and, like Gary, still manages to look the same, like a rather down-at-heel dowager. For over a decade there has been talk of blowing up the ugly, dangerous concrete walkways to make the South Bank more appealing. Originally, property developers were to beautify the place in return for retail opportunities. Now chief executive Nicholas Snowman is looking, like everyone else, for Lottery money. He wants Pounds 15m for an external facelift. With this likely to prove a pipe-dream it is hardly worth mentioning his further plans to knock down the Hayward and build a new art gallery on the car park. It is just possible that the Government will make the South Bank a Millennium Fund priority because it hugs such a vital site. But any scheme is likely to be imposed on the current management rather than in response to it. This week Snowman published the Arts Council's five year appraisal of the South Bank. It is mildly complimentary, and the Council upped its annual grant by 2 per cent to Pounds 13m. But the Arts Council, like Snowman, fails to confront the basic issue: does it want the South Bank to put on challenging concerts of contemporary and unfamiliar music and lose money, or does it want large audiences? It wants both, and thinks that by asking the South Bank to market its programme better it can square the circle. In fact Snowman is now trying to boost audiences, which have fallen to a disastrous 60 per cent at the Festival Hall. He has moved the BBC Symphony to the smaller Elizabeth Hall, and he has tried to identify the Festival Hall as the home of top quality orchestras, like the newly resident LPO and regular guest visitors. Snowman admits there have been too many under-rehearsed, boring, symphony concerts at the Hall, 'events' rather than 'experiences'. They will still happen, but Snowman is looking for new clients. He has his eyes fixed on pop music. This is nothing new - I well remember seeing Jimi Hendrix play the guitar with his teeth at the Festival Hall - but in recent years the management has been elitist and out of sympathy with the populist. Three sell-out performances last autumn by Sandra Bernhard helped change its mind. Now up to 15 per cent of the performances will be pop, jazz or folk - if promoters can be sold on the South Bank ambience. To help persuade them Snowman is thinking of allowing drinks to be taken into the plush interiors (ice creams were consumed during the recent English National Ballet season with no great disasters). It might catch on. London is desperately short of good rock venues (the imminent closure of the Town and Country at Kentish Town has caused much heartache), and by a nice irony the Albert Hall is trying to cut down on its pop concerts in favour of more classical programmes. So here is one of those markets that the Arts Council report was so keen for Snowman to develop. Perhaps we are returning to the old GLC ideal of the South Bank as a 'People's Palace'. ***** The Royal Academy is going through an expansionist phase. Two good years have given it illusions of grandeur and it has its eyes on the contingent Museum of Mankind, which in the 18th century was the garden of Lord Burlington, whose house is the home of the RA. The RA wants to convert it into an independent centre for British architecture. And, guess what, it is looking for Lottery money to finance the development. The idea is that the Museum of Mankind can move all its Mayan masks and Melanesian totems back into its former premises, the British Museum, once the British Library has made the space available by transporting its books to the new Euston Road site. This plan is built on so many maybes that it seems pie-in-the-sky, apart from one factor. Mrs Henry J. Heinz II is believed to have promised the RA a seven figure sum towards an architectural gallery. There are certainly plans for the RA to share shows with the Heinz gallery in Pittsburgh, and its exhibition, Lord Burlington and Chiswick House, will make a symbolic trip to the RA in 1995. So it could have the seed corn money; architecture needs a public space. The RA will need to move fast: Dr Khalili has earmarked the Museum of Mankind as the home for his collection of Islamic art, valued at Pounds 1b, which he is keen to loan to the UK. Could this rekindled interest in architecture offer a clue to one of the most intriguing elections of 1993, the new President of the RA? Sir Roger de Grey is approaching 75, and a successor will be voted upon in December. Around a hundred RAs can vote. One of the names in the frame is that of the architect Richard Rodgers. Elisabeth Frink was a popular choice but her health probably rules her out. Among the artists, Tom Phillips, Allen Jones and Norman Ackroyd are likely contenders. ***** One man doing his bit to save Venice is Peter Boizot of the Pizza Express chain. If you order a Veneziana pizza, 25p goes to Venice in Perilcampaign. To date this has raised over Pounds 300,000, making Mr Boizot the largest individual patron of the appeal. At a more modest level 10 per cent of the sale of paintings of Venice on display at the WH Patterson gallery,Albemarle Street also goes to the Fund. Last year's exhibition raised Pounds 4,000.</p>

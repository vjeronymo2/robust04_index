			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Jitters over election result depress Canadian dollar NERVOUSNESS about the outcome of Canada's general election on October 25 has helped push the Canadian dollar down to its lowest level in six years. The currency closed at 74.71 US cents on Friday, more than a cent below its level a week earlier and about 10 per cent below its peak of 83 US cents in November 1991. In another sign of pre-election jitters, the gap between US and Canadian long-term bonds has widened in recent weeks from 1.35 percentage points to about 1.7 percentage points. Markets have been especially unsettled by the strength of the separatist Bloc Quebecois. Recent opinion polls show the bloc could hold the balance of power in the next parliament, with 40-50 seats in the 295-seat House of Commons. Mr Lucien Bouchard, bloc leader, has pledged not to be a disruptive force in parliament, but the BQ platform is based on the premise that Quebec gets less than its fair share from the federal system. The two main parties, the ruling Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals, are still optimistic that the bloc's popularity will wane as election day draws closer. They hope to persuade Quebec voters that they do better to support a party with a chance of controlling the purse-strings and patronage of the federal government. The fall in the Canadian dollar has also been linked to concerns about the creditworthiness of the country's provinces, which are heavy borrowers on international capital markets. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, warned last week that it may downgrade Ontario's debt for the third time in three years. The Bank of Canada has done little so far to brake the slide in the currency. The economy remains weak and the central bank appears to be giving higher priority, for the time being, to holding down interest rates.</p>

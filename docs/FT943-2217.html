			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible advances 8% - Speciality materials division hit by decline in defence markets Morgan Crucible, the speciality materials manufacturer, is increasing its dividend for the first time since 1991 after reporting an 8 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 32.3m to Pounds 35m. Mr Bruce Farmer, managing director, said the 3.5 per cent increase in the dividend to 5.95p reflected confidence in the future. Earnings per share for the six months to July 4 rose by 8 per cent to 10.3p (9.5p). 'We are now seeing some upturn in demand, particularly in Germany and France, and price increases are sticking.' He added that the company was not suffering from the squeeze on margins reported by many other manufacturers. Operating margins were steady at 10.2 per cent and Mr Farmer predicted they would improve in the second half. The figures include profits of Pounds 3.6m and sales of Pounds 49.3m from Holt Lloyd, the car care business sold to management for Pounds 63.5m last month. Mr Farmer said the deal would not dilute earnings because much of the cash would be recycled into bolt-on acquisitions. However, he stressed that year-end gearing would be below 50 per cent, compared with almost 70 per cent at the start of the year. There was unchanged net cash inflow of Pounds 5.2m after capital investment of Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 17.7m) and acquisition and deferred consideration costs of Pounds 5.1m. Mr Farmer said the main areas of continued weakness were defence, now accounting for less than 3 per cent of turnover, and Japan. Australasia was patchy but continental Europe had recovered more quickly than expected. Group order intake was up 6 per cent compared with a 2.6 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 412m (Pounds 401.6m). Morgan is seeing good growth from new products such as components for safety air bags in cars which should generate sales of about Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) this year. Operating profits rose 3 per cent to Pounds 42.1m with the carbon, technical ceramics and thermal ceramics divisions all ahead. Profits from speciality materials slipped to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 8.1m), hit by declining defence and nuclear power markets. The shares closed 4 1/2 p higher at 332p. COMMENT Morgan Crucible has responded to institutional shareholders' concerns by generating cash and selling Holt Lloyd so the recent weakness in the shares might appear churlish. The truth is that the shares had got a bit ahead of themselves after a strong run. While profits growth is steady rather than sparkling the drag from defence cannot last for ever, if only because it is now so small. While other manufacturers complain of intense pressure on margins Mr Farmer is confident Morgan's margins will swell from just over 10 per cent to more than 14 per cent over the next two to three years. The pace should pick up in the second half driving profits to about Pounds 74m, before the gain on the Holt Lloyd sale. On a multiple of only 15 the shares are starting to look attractive again.</p>

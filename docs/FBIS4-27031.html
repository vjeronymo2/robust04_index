			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese Vice  Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today met with his  Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev on questions of common  concern and bilateral ties.    Qian said the stable and long-standing good-neighborly and  friendly ties between the two neighbors not only are important  to the two peoples but also have influences over peace,  stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region and even  the whole world.    Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two  countries, their relations in all aspects have gained a  sustained development and the exchange of visits by their senior  officials has increased, he said.    China is satisfied with the development of bilateral  relations in recent years, said Qian, whose current visit to  Moscow is mainly aimed at making preparations for Chinese  President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia in September.    Kozyrev said the Russian side attaches great importance to  the upcoming visit by Jiang and believes his visit to Russia  will be of profound significance to the development of friendly  and cooperative relations between the two countries.    On Russia's "Partnership for Peace" relations with the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Chinese foreign  minister said it is understandable that European nations are  concerned about the security of their own as there have been  great changes in the continent in recent years.    He expressed the hope that every arrangement for security in  Europe should be in accord with not only the interests of  nations concerned, but also security, peace and stability in the  world.    Kozyrev said Russia also holds the view that NATO should be  transformed into a new international organization after the Cold  War.    He said Russia will not join any military or political  organization, whether in the West or the East, directed against  a particular nation.    Russia attaches equal importance to its relations with China  and NATO, Kozyrev added.    The two sides also exchanged views on the situation on the  Korean peninsula.</p>

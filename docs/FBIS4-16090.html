			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alyaksandr Pawlavich Hretski, deputy </F> chairman of the Department of Prices, by unidentified reporter;  place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Now I will speak about the issue which  concerns us all. This key issue is prices for products. We  would like them to drop, especially at the time when [words  indistinct] the minimum wage grew twice, including some other  payments from the state budget. However, prices for  agricultural products do not even compensate for production  costs. This is the subject of our talk with Alyaksandr  Pawlavich Hretski, deputy chairman of the Department of Prices.    [Hretski] Since January 1992, all industrial output, public  works and services have been issued to the agricultural sector  free of charge. These prices are constantly growing. First and  foremost, this is connected with our Republic using enormous  amounts of gas, electricity, oil, metal, grain, and other raw  materials which are being chiefly imported from Russia and other  states. Naturally, (?we) cannot set the prices for these  products. For example, in 1993, the price for one tonne of oil  increased from 27,500 rubles [R] to R450,000; of 1,000 cubic  meters of natural gas -- from R16,600 to R116,700; and of one  tonne of grain -- from R96,000 to some R2 million. As a result,  the 1993 index of price increases for material and technical  resources consumed by the agricultural sector stood at 3,776  percent. Prices for mineral fertilizers increased by 3,928  percent, electricity -- by 9,211 percent, fuel --by 3,554  percent, and wheeled tractors -- by 3,381 percent. As for  agricultural produce being sold at prices set by the Ministry of  Agriculture and Foodstuffs, their level increased by only 1,229  percent in 1993, representing 178 percent of the nonparity of  prices [nieparitet tsen] or R964.6 billion.    [Reporter] The government is doing everything to protect the  population.    [Hretski] The government adopted a range of measures aimed  at  improving this situation in 1993. These steps include lowering  prices for material and technical resources delivered to the  agricultural sector. In addition, the agricultural sector was  supplied with electricity and oil at lower prices than the  industrial sector. Purchase prices were regularly increased.  Nevertheless, the results of 1993 show that our agricultural  sector did not receive almost R400 billion in compensation. Due  to this, the profitability of agricultural production in 1993  stood at only 3.3 percent. The profitability of meat production  stood at 4.8 percent, in particular, production of pork at 13.6  percent, beef at 0.7 percent, and poultry at 6.7 percent. Milk  profitability was reduced by 6.2 percent. To my regret, this  tendency has remained the same this year. As of 1 April 1994,  the total sum of price increases for resources that are  delivered to the agricultural sector stood at R4.3 trillion.  Prices for oil products increased by R1.374 billion. Oil  products, mineral fertilizers, and the increase in wages for  workers of the agricultural sector account for the biggest  proportion of these increases. In this regard, the increase in  purchase prices for agricultural products became inevitable.  For example, on 6 April, purchase prices for all kinds of meat  were increased by 30 percent, for milk -- by 40 percent.  However, this permitted only R2 trillion in compensation, or  46.3 percent of costs in the agricultural sector. The remaining  sum was transferred to crop production and [word indistinct].    [Reporter] This cannot help but affect retail prices.    [Hretski] Of course. Such increases in purchase prices for  meat and milk cannot but affect retail prices for products  traded at free prices. For example, prices for meat -- poultry,  beef, pork, sausages -- have already increased. Retail prices  for dairy products are still untouched. To do this, prices for  vodka were raised by R2,000 per bottle. Indeed, we receive  complaints from our citizens that it is impossible to buy dairy  products because they are being smuggled abroad. In my opinion,  the increase in prices for these products with corresponding  social protection measures would have been justified.    Summarizing my report, I would like to urge the working  collectives of our industrial enterprises to decrease prices for  produce, which is being delivered to the agricultural sector.  This will return a hundredfold when we have cheaper  agricultural products on our table.</p>

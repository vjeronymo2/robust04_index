			<p>BFN     [Text] Labor and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun  Kaeothong, who is leading a 15-member delegation of the  government sector comprised of representatives of employees and  employers, left Bangkok last night to participate in the 81st  International Labor Organization [ILO] Conference in Geneva,  Switzerland, scheduled to be held 6 to 23 June.    The 81st ILO meeting also coincides with the celebration of  the 75th founding anniversary of the ILO and the 50th  anniversary of the Declaration of Philadelphia. More  importantly, the Thai tripartite committee will introduce  Thailand's Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare to some 175  participating countries at the meeting so they will know that  Thailand now has an official government agency to take direct  responsibility for the care of its laborers.    Regarding the main agenda, apart from consideration of  various organization budgets and projects, there also will be a  report presented by the ILO director general. The main contents  of the report will be about the role of the organization in  creating social justice and the organization's activities.    The discussion also will touch upon the issues of part-time  jobs, safety and health of workers in the mining industry, role  of the private sector in market promotion, as well as a review  of the Declaration on measures against racial discrimination in  South Africa.    The ASEAN group will submit to the ILO its consensus on  international work standards and the linkage of the issues of  social role with the international trading system. The ASEAN  group feels that the linking of work standards to the trading  system will adversely affect the economies of the developing  countries rather than benefit them. In addition, ASEAN also  feels that the ILO should improve international standards to  make it suitable for modern times.</p>

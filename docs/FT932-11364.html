			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Clinton plans to shake up White House PRESIDENT Bill Clinton admitted yesterday that he was thinking of shaking up his White House staff 'to get our priorities straight'. Responding to a new round of speculation, he said he expected to name new deputies to his chief of staff, Mr Thomas 'Mack' McLarty, the president's kindergarten friend and former Arkansas utilities executive. 'We think there needs to be a little tighter co-ordination to make sure we've got our priorities straight and that those priorities are communicated all the way down to the staff,' he said, noting that Mr McLarty currently has only one deputy. His administration has come under fire for having lost its focus, a criticism Mr Clinton conceded when he spoke of the difficulties of 'trying to get a lot of things going in a hurry and having people work very, very hard but maybe getting a little out of focus'. Of particular concern has been a series of leaks about the likely scope and cost of the health care package expected to be unveiled this month. In general the young White House staff, while bubbling with ideas, has rarely presented a consistent, co-ordinated front. Mr McLarty is new to Washington and seems to conceive his job mostly as an adviser to the president, especially on appointments to senior positions, rather than as a political strategist or internal disciplinarian. Mr Clinton's implication is that he is thinking of naming an experienced political operative to assist his White House chief. A clear prime need is to improve relations with Congress now that the vital budget bill has begun its legislative passage. Mr Clinton can ill afford further setbacks such as that which befell his stimulus package last month. Other changes in view could include Mr George Stephanopoulos, the communications director, becoming more involved in policy and less in his frequently confrontational daily press briefings. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the press secretary, is generally conceded to have a lighter touch, though she is known to have much less direct access to the president and to other leading policy makers. However, the first Reagan White House, widely considered effective, was notable for its strong chief of staff (Mr James Baker, later secretary of treasury and state) and for the doling out by the press secretaries of a minimalist but artfully presented diet of information to the media.</p>

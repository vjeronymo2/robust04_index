			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Juan Manuel Diaz C.] </F>   [Excerpt] The government is studying a U.S. request to  permit the arrival of Haitian refugees into national territory,  even though no official position has been adopted on this issue,  according to President Guillermo Endara.    Endara said that, traditionally, Panama has received  refugees  of various nationalities and that it is even common to see  people jump into Panama Canal waters to ask for asylum.    The president said there is no official position yet, but  the  request made by the U.S. Government will be properly considered.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tokyo tries to revive stock market JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday announced rule changes for initial public offering procedures for stocks, in an attempt to revive faltering investor interest in the country's stock market. The changes are part of the government's emergency economic package announced last August and are intended to reduce the risks of investors and brokers during share offerings, and to ease restrictions for companies which want to go public. Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, outlining the changes, said he hoped the new rules would reinvigorate the slumping Japanese stock market. The revision, due to be implemented in January, will allow underwriting brokers to decide the offering price from the average bidding price of the prior share auction. Until now, the public offering price of 50 per cent of a new listing has been fixed at the weighted average of the 10 highest bids in a share auction of the remaining 50 per cent of the newly offered shares. This led to excessive competition and unrealisticly high bidding prices, often leaving investors and underwriters with over-priced shares. While the current method functioned smoothly during the bull market of the late 1980s, the sluggishness of the Tokyo stock market increases the risk for buying newly offered shares. By allowing underwriters to discount from the average bidding price, brokers will be able to offer realistic prices which reflect investor sentiment. Nomura Securities said the changes would allow brokers and investors to quantify risks. Last year's listing of Sony Music Entertainment, the music arm of the consumer electronics group, provoked criticism from investors, as on the first day of trading, its share price plunged below the initial listing price. Other measures include: To nullify an auction if the number of bids falls short of 25 per cent of the total shares offered. Under current rules, an auction would be valid even if bids did not cover the total 50 per cent of the offering. To lengthen the period for new offerings, now concentrated during November to March, to a nine-month period between August and April. To shorten the period between the auction and listing dates from 14 to 12 days. To increase the period before the auction at which information is provided for investors from 15 to 30 days.

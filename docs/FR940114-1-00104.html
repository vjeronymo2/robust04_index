For this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose, the term ``disposable pay'' means that part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower's compensation from an employer remaining after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction of any amounts required by law to be withheld.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceedings, the guaranty agency shall mail to the borrower's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last known address, a written notice of the nature and amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt, the intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collect the debt through deductions from pay, and an explanation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the borrower's rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to enter into a written repayment agreement with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency under terms agreeable to the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(10)(i)(J) of this section concerning the existence or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the debt and, in the case of a borrower whose repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule is established other than by a written agreement under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(10)(i)(D) of this section, the terms of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) The guaranty agency shall sue any employer (including a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower who is self-employed) for any amount that the employer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after receipt of the garnishment notice provided by the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section, fails to withhold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal pay and disbursement cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for at least 12 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (H) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withholding order, it shall send a withholding order to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer within 20 days after the borrower fails to make a timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request for a hearing, or, if a timely request for a hearing is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made by the borrower, within 20 days after a final decision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made by the agency to proceed with garnishment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) The notice given to the employer under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section must contain only the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withholding order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (J) The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing, which, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the borrower's option, may be oral or written, if the borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submits a written request for a hearing on the existence or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oral hearing may, at the borrower's option, be conducted either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-person or by telephone conference.

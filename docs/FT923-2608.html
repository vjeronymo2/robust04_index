			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (4): The first signs of progress - Venezuela GOVERNMENTS in Venezuela have been talking for years about the country's mining potential but have achieved few concrete results. However, the administration of President Carlos Andres Perez, elected for a five-year term in early 1989, is now making tangible progress. In 1990, the Perez government broadly liberalised rules on foreign investment. Last year it reduced the maximum corporate tax rate to 30 per cent, an important advance for potential investors, since most mining activities previously were taxed at around 60 per cent of operating profits. These measures, with other reforms that are turning Venezuela into a more open and competitive economy, have helped to make mining more attractive to private investors. In spite of these advances, the overall figures on Venezuelan mining in 1991 were not very encouraging. The Central Bank reported that mining, which grew by 5.3 per cent in 1990, declined by 3.6 per cent last year even as the economy expanded vigorously. The 1991 results were due principally to a sharp decline in gold and diamond production. A closer look, however, shows that some important advances are being made, especially in coal and bauxite, while new gold investments are under way. COAL: Output at Venezuela's largest coal mine, located in the Guasare coal fields of the western state of Zulia, reached 1.2m tonnes during the first half of 1992, close to the total of approximately 1.5m tonnes for full-year 1991. Carbones del Guasare, the joint venture company that operates the open pit mine in Guasare, plans to reach total production of 3m tonnes this year. Its two partners, Carbozulia (wholly owned by the Venezuelan national oil company, PDVSA, and Agipcoal), are expected to decide later this year on whether they will invest in a rail and port infrastructure to help raise production to 20m tonnes per year by the end of the decade. Cavoven, a joint venture of Venezolana de Cementos, a private company, and Mitsubishi, produced more than 241,000 tonnes of coal in 1991 from its Fila Maestra mine in eastern Venezuela. It plans to reach 300,000 tonnes this year. Other coal production, totalling less than 500,000 tonnes last year, came from mines - some of which produce coking coal - in the western state of Tachira. Coal exports in 1991 were 1.85m tonnes, up 122,000 tonnes - or 7 per cent - from 1990. Exports came from Guasare and Cavoven. Most of Venezuela's coal is exported. The largest markets, in descending order, are the EC, Scandinavia, the US and the Caribbean. Apart from Agipcoal, which is considering a large investment to expand output at the Paso Diablo mine, other international companies are studying new investments at other sites in the Guasare fields, which have proven reserves of 353m tonnes and identified reserves of over 2bn tonnes. These companies include Shell Coal and Veba Oel, which last year completed geotechnical and hydrological studies at the Socuy mine site; AT Massey Coal and Cavoven, which explored the Mina Norte site; and Cyprus Coal which is exploring the Cachiri site with Carbozulia. BAUXITE: After years of delays, the government is also making progress in increasing production at its bauxite mine in Los Pijiguaos, among the jungles of southeastern Venezuela. Bauxiven, which runs the mine, produced 1.94m tonnes of bauxite in 1991, up sharply from 1990's total of 771,000 tonnes. The company made a slow start this year, producing only 270,000 tonnes between January and June. But officials say that production was down due to the installation of new equipment designed to raise the mine's capacity to 3.5m tonnes a year and higher. Bauxiven is still shooting for a production target of 3-3.5m tonnes for full-year 1992. GOLD: Production of gold and diamonds (the latter are often found in deposits of alluvial gold) declined sharply last year due mainly to a contraction in the number of individual miners working sites in the southeast state of Bolivar. The rich alluvial and underground gold deposits in Bolivar are worked chiefly by thousands of free-lance miners, many of them - like the 'garimpeiros' from Brazil - working in Venezuela illegally. Gold is also mined by a variety of companies, including government-owned Minerven, which produced two tonnes of gold in 1991 and 784 kilograms during the first half of this year. Accurate production figures are not available due to the large number of illegal miners. Private sector sources estimate last year's total gold output at 11-12 tonnes, down from estimates in previous years of around 20 tonnes. (The government said that production in 1988 may have reached 27 tonnes, but other sources consider this quite high.) Monarch Resources, a Bermuda-based company, is currently developing the largest gold mining project in Venezuela. Monarch, which has been operating in Venezuela since 1987, is investing Dollars 23m to develop a new mine - La Camorra - in Bolivar state. It began developing the mine in June of this year. Monarch also has 10 geologists and a support staff of 75 exploring additional prospects, and is investing Dollars 3m on exploration this year alone. The company also operates a tailings mill (Revemin) which last year produced 800 kg of gold. Monarch, with a total payroll of 300 in Venezuela, has invested around Dollars 40m in the country thus far. It reported a loss of Dollars 2.9m in 1991. In addition, Canada's Placer Dome is exploring in Bolivar state and is studying the possibility of a plant to process tailings. Greenwich Resources also has a small gold operation in Bolivar. IRON ORE: Iron ore, which is mined and marketed by the state-owned Ferrominera del Orinoco, has been a staple export product for Venezuela for decades. Ferrominera in 1975 took over mining operations formerly owned by US Steel and Bethlehem Steel when the government decided to nationalise the iron ore sector. However, the present government is studying the privatisation of an iron ore pellet plant it owns and wants international investors to build plants to produce pre-reduced iron-ore briquettes for export.  ---------------------------------------------     VENEZUELA MINERAL OUTPUT ('000t)  ---------------------------------------------                       1990       1991  --------------------------------------------- Bauxite                702      2,100 Alumina              1,405      1,500 Aluminium              595        605 Iron ore            20,120     19,959 Coal                 1,572      2,500 (est) Gold (kg)            7,700        na  --------------------------------------------- Source: Mining Annual Review 1992  ---------------------------------------------</p>

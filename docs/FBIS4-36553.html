			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States has voiced great concern over the  fighting in Yemen. A statement issued yesterday by the U.S.  State Department speaks of mounting concern over the grave  consequences of continued fighting in that country. The State  Department's statement indicates that the United States is  trying to involve itself in the situation in Yemen and dictate  certain policies on that country. Instead of getting alarmed  over Yemen, the United States would do well to stop interfering  in its affairs and hatching plots against its unity.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (5): Persistence may pay off - Foreign investment WITH its cocktail bars, shops full of expensive goods and luxury cars, Sofia has acquired some of the gloss of a western city. But looks are deceptive. While western companies have been quick to set up shop in Bulgaria, far fewer have ventured beyond trade or committed themselves to large investments, writes Virginia Marsh. Official figures put direct foreign investment in 1991 and 1992 at Dollars 100m, a fraction of the over Dollars 7bn in equity capital which has poured into central Europe since 1990. Foreign investors have been deterred by Bulgaria's comparatively slow and faltering steps towards a market economy. These have led to many political and legislative upheavals in the past three years and been accompanied by a moratorium on debt payment since mid-1990 which has cut the country off from normal bank credit. 'We've had to deal with five governments and many changes in the legal framework, including significant amendments to the first (post-communist) foreign investment and privatisation laws,' says Mr Philip Burley of Rover, the British car manufacturer, which has been negotiating to set up an assembly plant in Bulgaria for three years. With much confusion over responsibility for reform and delays in privatising state firms, often the biggest challenge for a foreign investor is finding a Bulgarian party prepared to take business decisions, says Mr Andrew Kenningham, director of the Bulgarian International Business Association, which represents western investors including British Gas, Rank Xerox and the Bulgarian-American Enterprise Fund. 'Foreign companies are frequently passed like a ball between the privatisation agency, the ministries and the enterprise they are interested in, with no one prepared to execute a deal,' he says. The recession in western Europe and the business climate in central European ex-communist countries have kept investors away, says Mr Konstantinos Livadas, a consultant who represents Delta, a Greek food manufacturer which has invested Dollars 3.5m in a distribution network and ice cream factory at Varna. In spite of his disappointment at Bulgaria's slow pace of change, Mr Livadas remains optimistic. 'The market is empty. Companies persistent enough to do business here will find many opportunities.' Infrastructure projects have encouraged western companies to form local partnerships so as to carry out some of the work. Siemens, one of four western firms which recently won a Dollars 230m contract to upgrade the country's telecommunications network, has invested DM2m in a joint venture with Incoms, the Bulgarian state communications company. 'It will produce some of the digital switchboards for the modernisation project,' says Mr Vladimir Bogdanov, head of Siemens' Sofia office. But many believe foreign investment will pick up only if Bulgaria can reach agreement over its Dollars 8.5bn debt to 300 London Club commercial banks. 'There are few large investments because foreign firms have difficulty in raising capital for deals in Bulgaria. A resolution of the debt problem is vital if banks are to open new credit lines,' says Mr Kenningham. The government also needs to do more to attract investors, says Mr Livadas. 'Restrictions on land ownership by foreigners should be lifted. Tax holidays for those involved in production would also help.' Mr Kenningham agrees: 'Bulgaria can be very frustrating. There are many opportunities here especially in agro-industries, electronics and light industries. But many in positions of authority seem more interested in their own business deals than in facilitating foreign investment.'</p>

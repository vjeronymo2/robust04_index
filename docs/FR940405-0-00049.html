			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 60 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 7 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It would take an average of 15 work hours per airplane to accomplish the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed inspection actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection action of this AD on U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators is estimated to be $5,775, or $825 per airplane, per inspection cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It would take an average of 240 work hours per airplane to accomplish the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed bolt replacement action, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Required parts would cost approximately $11,000 per airplane. Based on these figures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total cost impact of the proposed replacement action of this AD on U.S. operators is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to be $169,400, or $24,200 per airplane. (This estimate assumes that H&hyph;11 steel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bolts are found at all affected locations.) Accomplishment of this replacement action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminates the repetitive inspection requirement; therefore the accomplishment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement will result in a reduction in costs to affected operators of $275 per airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per inspection cycle that will no longer be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of the actions proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions. However, in actual practice, these actions for the most part would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary additional work hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of the Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH WILTS UNDER TOUGH QUESTIONS ON LIES TO CONGRESS  </P> <P> The starched military bearing of witness Oliver L. North wilted for a telling  moment under relentless questioning Wednesday as he acknowledged his lies to  Congress and stated he had already demonstrated his remorse to the world.  </P> <P> On his fourth and final day as a reluctant witness in the Iran-Contra trial of  former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, North faced a barrage of  sharp and unfriendly questions from both special prosecutor Dan K. Webb and  defense attorney Richard W. Beckler.  </P> <P> The prosecution clearly wanted to closely link Poindexter with North, who was  convicted last year of destroying documents and lying to Congress. The defense  obviously wanted to separate the two in the minds of the jury. Both strategies  ensured rough questioning for North.  </P> <P> The most dramatic confrontation centered on North's meeting with 11 members of  the House Intelligence Committee in the White House Situation Room on Aug. 6,  1986. In that meeting, North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel on the staff of  the National Security Council, falsely denied that he was involved in arming  and aiding the Contras fighting in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, had dealt softly with North on earlier  days in the trial. But his manner changed when he demanded to know whether  North knew he had committed a crime by lying to the congressmen.  </P> <P> "No," North replied, "I was not under oath. I have never lied under oath. It  was an informal, off-the-record session."  </P> <P> "Did you think it was a tea party in the White House Situation Room?"  </P> <P> "No, counsel, I knew that it was not a tea party."  </P> <P> "I don't want to be flippant," Webb persisted, "but did you not know that it  was an important and solemn occasion?"  </P> <P> "I did not attach any particular solemnity to the occasion."  </P> <P> Webb asked if Poindexter had reassured North that he could "handle" talking to  Congress.  </P> <P> "Or take care of it," North corrected.  </P> <P> "And you did?"  </P> <P> "Yes, sir."  </P> <P> "And you lied?"  </P> <P> "Yes, I have admitted that."  </P> <P> "Did you expect him to be happy?" asked Webb in scathing tones. "You carried  the admiral's water and lied to Congress. Did you feel good about that?"  </P> <P> North, who had sat stiffly tall in the witness chair for most of the four days,  replying with a touch of contempt to unfriendly questions and often insisting  he could not remember anything that had happened, tried to speak but could not  be heard. The judge asked him to speak louder.  </P> <P> North leaned forward, then after many seconds moved back, then said softly: "I  have told the whole world I did not feel good about that."  </P> <P> Poindexter is charged with five counts involving a conspiracy to destroy  documents, obstruct investigations and lie to Congress. Defense attorney  Beckler, in his cross-examination of the witness, asked North if he had ever  conspired with Poindexter to withhold information from Congress.  </P> <P> "If conspire means to violate the law," North replied, "I didn't do it." He  then elaborated, "I have never considered, nor do I now consider, anything I  have done as a crime."  </P> <P> Beckler interrupted him. "Col. North, you're not on trial here," he said. "You  don't have to give me a whole justification."  </P> <P> But some of Beckler's questioning, like that of prosecutor Webb, made it seem  as if North really were on trial. At one point, North said that he could not  recall whether he had sent a message to Poindexter informing him that he had  destroyed embarrassing documents. Beckler turned on him sarcastically:  </P> <P> "I'm just asking if you ever sat down at your machine and sent him a note,  saying, 'I'm sitting down in my office, it's 3:30 in the morning, and I'm  busily destroying documents.' You did not send that, did you?"  </P> <P> "No, sir," North said.  </P> <P> Repeatedly, North said he could not reply to questions because he could no  longer recall details and events of the Iran-Contra affair. His failure to  remember what happened during his final weekend at the White House exasperated  U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene.  </P> <P> "Didn't that weekend stick out in your mind since it resulted in your firing?"  asked the judge. "Wasn't that an unusual weekend in your career?"  </P> <P> "I'm sure it was, your honor, but I don't recall it in any degree of clarity,"  North replied.  </P> <P> After North stepped down from the witness box, his former secretary, Fawn Hall,  repeated well-known stories of how she helped her boss alter, shred and carry  away embarrassing government documents from their office in the Executive  Office Building. But she testified she did not know whether Poindexter knew  anything about what she and North were doing with the documents.  </P> <P> Trying to explain why she took some documents and hid them in her boots and the  back side of her clothing after North was fired on Nov. 25, she said: "I'm  extremely emotional. I couldn't understand why a man who had worked for his  country for so long was fired.  </P> <P> "I was crying at my desk. . . . My intention was to protect national security  secrets, which was completely useless at that point, as we can now see."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 10 (TANJUG) -- A representative of  the U.N. Protection Force for former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) on  Sunday denied claims by the Moslem leadership in Sarajevo that  Serb forces had used poison gases and killed thousands of  civilians in an attack on Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Spokesman Rob Annink told reporters in Sarajevo that Serb  forces had possibly only used smoke mortars in the region of  Gorazde, the French news agency AFP said.    The Moslem presidency in Sarajevo said on Saturday evening  that thousands of people had been killed in the Serb attack on  Gorazde when poison gases were used. The statement was  immediately carried by leading news agencies from all over the  world.    Moslem Radio Sarajevo even said that the Gorazde suburbs of  Bace and Mlinarice were pounded with chemical shells, with  1,000-10,000 casualties as a result.    Moslem Presidency Vice-President Ejup Ganic said that he  would leave for New York already on Sunday to ask for an  emergency session of the Security Council because of this  incident.    Deputy commander of the general staff of the Bosnian Serb  army, General Milan Gvero on Sunday told TANJUG that the Serb  side had never used chemical weapons in the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serb side does not manufacture, possess  or use such weapons, he was adamant.    Gen. Gvero said that the Moslem side was using poison gases  in order to accuse the Serbs and provoke a military intervention  against them.</p>

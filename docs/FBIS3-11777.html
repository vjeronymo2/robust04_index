This was the  conclusion of the sugarcane harvest assessment meeting held on  25 March in Santiago de Cuba in the presence of Sugar Industry  Minister Nelson Torres; Jose A. Naranjo, head of the commander  in chief's Coordination and Support Staff; and Esteban Lazo and  Juan Carlos Robinson, respectively first secretaries of the  Communist Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo  Provinces.    At this meeting, it was proposed that the easternmost  provinces exchange moral and material support to ensure that the  current goals are met -- particularly supporting Granma, which  will be reporting to the National Assembly of the People's  Government in July and therefore has to meet all its goals.    The eastern region was proclaimed the best in Cuba in the  last 20 days; and within this area, Guantanamo is in first  place, for fulfilling seven of the 14 emulation parameters. At  this meeting at the Heredia Theater, the Salvador Rosales Mill  from Songo-La Maya Municipality received the Union of Young  Communists' Setting the Pace banner for surpassing its grinding  potential for the past 40 days.</p>

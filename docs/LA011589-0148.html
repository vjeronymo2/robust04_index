			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FROM BEACHES TO BIRCHES  </P> <P> Your recent series on the future of the San Dieguito River Valley (Dec. 25-27)  gave your readers an in-depth look at the very complex issues confronting this  sensitive part of San Diego's landscape. The evolving effort to establish a  linear, natural park along the river valley is a laudable goal, which property  owners, other environmentalists and all San Diegans should strive to achieve.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the Los Angeles Times has failed to explore seriously the  opportunities to accomplish the goal of creating the San Dieguito River Park in  the foreseeable future. Your coverage on the complex issues involved, in  particular the story on the San Dieguito Trust ownership in the valley, focused  on past controversies, accusations and personalities rather than exploring the  numerous opportunities for realistic solutions to the problems facing park  plans. The promise of the park would have been better served by an examination  of future alternatives for the valley.  </P> <P> The San Dieguito Trust owns 368 acres, just east of Interstate 5, at the  entrance to the San Dieguito River Valley. The trust, composed of seven  separate families plus Scripps College and the National Academy of Sciences,  has owned this property for more than 30 years.  </P> <P> All of the San Dieguito Trust owners share a commitment to work cooperatively  with the city and county of San Diego to help realize the goal of creating a  linear park. Over the years, we have chosen not to develop our property in  anticipation that someday we could achieve a reasonable economic return through  a sensitive development plan.  </P> <P> Rather than posing a roadblock to park planning, as your article suggests, the  San Dieguito Trust ownership offers perhaps the greatest opportunity to realize  the creation of the river park. The city and county have limited financial  resources and can never expect to acquire all of the land needed for a viable  park with tax dollars alone. Only through cooperative efforts with landowners  and other agencies can these limited resources be maximized.  </P> <P> It is disappointing that your article failed to examine the exciting  alternative of public agency and landowner cooperation in greater depth. Only  with a new commitment toward such cooperation can park planning proceed  successfully. I can only hope that San Diego City Councilwoman Abbe  Wolfsheimer, other interested groups and individuals can come to recognize this  before it's too late.  </P> <P> Name-calling and false accusations will get us nowhere. Cooperation alone can  preserve the San Dieguito River Valley and give San Diego an impressive new  park.  </P> <P> ROGER REVELLE  </P> <P> San Dieguito Trust  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Japan eases broking and banking restrictions JAPAN'S ministry of finance yesterday announced specific rules on easing of the barrier between the country's banks and securities industries. The Japanese government last year decided the broad outline of rule changes in the financial markets, which come into effect in April. The banks and brokerages will then be able to enter some areas of each other's businesses through subsidiaries. The details, which are expected to be approved by the cabinet today, lays out the conditions such as costs and rules concerning 'firewall' restrictions between the parent company and subsidiary. Banking subsidiaries of brokerages will need minimum capital of Y2bn, while Y10bn will be required to set up an underwriting brokerage. Last year's package allows banks' affiliates to issue but not to market convertible and warrant bonds and to deal in straight bonds. Banks will be kept out of stock trading for the indefinite future. The new rules will allow banks to deal in commercial paper, certificates of deposit placed overseas, housing loan trust certificates and card loan trusts. Rule changes which place such products as 'securities' under the Securities and Exchange Law, and are expected to bolster secondary markets especially that of asset backed securities. Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest commercial bank, said yesterday its board had approved a doubling of the company's registered capital to Bt20bn (Dollars 788m )from Bt10bn, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. 'Whether we're going to call up the Bt10bn depends entirely on the bank's lending position,' said Mr Piti Sithi-Amnuai, executive vice-chairman. Bangkok Bank also predicted net profits would rise to Bt12.3bn in 1993, to Bt14.9bn in 1994 and Bt16.5bn in 1995. Last year, its net profits rose 45.3 per cent to Bt10.54bn.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Massey Ferguson may be sold for Dollars 330m to US buyer Massey Ferguson, one of the most famous names in the world tractor industry, is close to being sold by Varity, its US parent, for about Dollars 330m (Pounds 223m). The buyer, in a deal that could be announced in the next few days, is believed to be Agco, a company based in Atlanta, Georgia, that over the past three years has been expanding fast in the US through acquisitions of farm equipment companies. The expected deal would thwart a rival Dollars 350m offer from a European-led group to acquire Massey Ferguson, which employs more than 3,500 people and has factories at Coventry in the UK and Beauvais in France. According to an article this week in Stark's News Service, a Chicago newsletter, Varity has obtained a cash offer of Dollars 350m from the European group, in which Mr John Sword, former chief executive of Massey, is said to be a leading participant. The article says Agco's Dollars 330m offer is a mixture of cash and notes - stocks. It is understood Agco's offer may be accepted because of its strong relationship with Varity. Mr Sword, who left Massey last summer, would not comment yesterday. In November 1992, Agco paid Varity Dollars 110m for Massey's North American distribution business and 50 per cent of its Agricredit financing business, and early this year paid another Dollars 23m for the remainder of Agricredit. No comment was available from Agco, and Varity said: 'Typically we do not comment on these types of stories.' It added that Mr Victor Rice, Varity's chairman and chief executive, had made it no secret that a sale of the rest of Massey would be considered if an opportunity arose. The sale of Massey would start a new chapter in the story of a company that in the early 1980s was synonymous with financial crisis and industrial blight. In 1984, after heavy rationalisation and two financial reconstructions, it emerged from five years of losses. In 1991, with all its North American factories closed, Massey plunged to an operating loss of Dollars 60.8m because of the global recession in farm equipment, but has subsequently returned strongly to profit. It claims its tractors were the best-selling make in western markets in 1992, for the 30th year running. The sale of Massey would end Varity's involvement in heavy off-road equipment and underline its concentration on Kelsey-Hayes automotive products and Perkins diesel engines. For Agco, the purchase of the rest of Massey would be its most ambitious move yet. The company is the successor to the agricultural business of the old Allis-Chalmers group, which in 1987 filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. In 1990 Agco bought Deutz-Allis from KHD of Germany, since when it has grown substantially through acquisitions. Its sales jumped to Dollars 595.7m last year from Dollars 314.5m in 1992, due mainly to the North American Massey deal.</p>

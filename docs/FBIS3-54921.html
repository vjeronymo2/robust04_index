Although the election campaign is over, the Central  Electoral  Commission is going ahead with its work, election officials  stressed at their meeting on Tuesday. The Commission is now  preparing a report on the election financing and the use of  funds by candidates and election blocs. Arrangements are being  made for elections in Russia's six constituencies where the  December 12 poll was declared invalid.    But the main task to be tackled by the Central Electoral  Commission is related to the presidential decree on measures to  improve Russia's electoral system, Commission Chairman Nikolay  Ryabov stressed in an interview with TASS. This document  providing for transformation of the commission for the 1993  elections to the Federal Assembly into a standing Central  Electoral Commission of the Russian Federation "does not allow  us to relax", Ryabov noted.    While drafting a law on elections in coordination with the  Justice Ministry, the Central Electoral Commission will take  into consideration all remarks made by individual candidates and  parties. It will also head a system of commissions to be set up  for holding elections tol power bodies of all levels in Russia's  regions.</p>

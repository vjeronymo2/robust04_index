			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> First Flight for X-31 Fighter: The highly maneuverable experimental jet fighter  completed its first flight, Rockwell International Corp. said. In a 38-minute  flight, Rockwell Chief Test Pilot Ken Dyson traveled a top speed of 340 m.p.h.  and flew to 10,000 feet, a spokesman said. The X-31 uses unusual flight and  engine-thrust controls to enable it to turn and point at targets more quickly  than conventional military aircraft.  </P></p>

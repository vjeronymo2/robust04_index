			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW PLUNGES 59.41 TO NEW LOW FOR YEAR;  </P> <P> INDEX FALLS TO 2,452.97; ACTIVITY MARKED BY HEAVY SELLING IN BANK ISSUES  </P> <P> The stock market sank to new lows for the year today in activity marked by  heavy selling of the battered bank issues.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 59.41 to 2,452.97, its lowest  close since it stood at 2,452.77 on July 3, 1989.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 1 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 236 up, 1,418 down and 329 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 162.21 million shares, against 201.05 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index dropped 3.52 to 167.51.  </P> <P> Analysts said investors were bracing for more bad tidings from the banking  industry after Chase Manhattan Corp.'s announcement Friday of a dividend cut,  new reserves for loan losses and a staff reduction of 5,000 jobs.  </P> <P> The news by itself did not come as any great surprise to Wall Street, which was  well aware of widespread credit problems facing the banks.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, it evidently served to intensify the recession worries that have  been depressing stock prices since midsummer.  </P> <P> Brokers noted that the market also had to contend with another big jump in  world oil prices. Crude oil futures for November delivery surpassed $38 a  barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Bond prices fell in early trading.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000 face  amount. Its yield, which rises when the price falls, climbed to 9.17% from  9.11% late Friday.  </P> <P> The continued rise in oil prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has  intensified the bond market's concern that inflation is worsening.  </P> <P> Inflation hurts bonds because it erodes their value and makes it less likely  that the Federal Reserve will ease interest rates. Lower rates benefit  fixed-return securities such as bonds.  </P> <P> In early trading, short-term Treasuries fell between 1/8 point and 9/32 point,  intermediate maturities ranged from 9/32 point to 3/8 point lower, and  long-term issues lost as much as 1/2 point.  </P></p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Compass lifted by acquisitions Compass Group, the healthcare and catering group, yesterday announced a sharp rise in both profits and turnover for the year to September 26 on the back of recent acquisitions. Pre-tax profits rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 41.5m, compared with Pounds 31.8m. Turnover was ahead 44 per cent at Pounds 497m, including a contribution of Pounds 156.2m from acquisitions, mainly reflecting the purchase in July of SAS Service Partner's airport catering business via a rights issue, and last November's acquisitions of Travellers Fare, the station caterers, and Letheby &amp; Christopher, the sports and events caterer. Turnover from continuing operations fell from Pounds 345.1m to Pounds 340.8m. The group attributed the decline to continued 'demanning' in the UK because of recession. Operating profit from continuing operations rose from Pounds 36.9m to Pounds 39.4m. A contribution of Pounds 7.4m from acquisitions took total operating profit to Pounds 46.8m. Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said the full benefits of the acquisitions had yet to be seen as purchasing and other affinities were sorted out over the next year or so. 'All the acquisitions have performed well. There are no skeletons or black holes and we have not lost a single contract in all the business we have brought on board.' Last December Compass reorganised its catering activities into seven divisions which target core markets from schools to boardrooms. The New Famous Foods division, which has agreements with Burger King and Pizza Hut, is designed to offer clients branded catering outlets. Earlier this month Compass paid Pounds 900,000 for the 11 catering contracts managed by the Roux brothers. Mr Mackay described the deal as the 'final piece of the jigsaw' in the group's new strategy. 'We have created a unique catering company with enormous potential in all market sectors. We are capable of expanding the business and we have the wherewithal to do it,' he said yesterday. UK catering profits were up from Pounds 24.5m to Pounds 30.6m, overseas catering profits from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 3.1m, and healthcare profits from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 13.1m. Interest payable edged ahead from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 5.3m. Adjusted earnings per share rose from 33.1p to 35.9p; a final dividend of 8.56p is proposed, giving a total for the year of 13p (12.3p). COMMENT These results were very much in line with expectations. Next year will depend on how well the group digests its acquisitions, and on the rate the contract catering market expands in the UK. The group has a toehold in Europe through the airport catering business and the City will be watching to see how well it tackles expanding its business outside the UK. Growth in the healthcare sector is likely to be slow for the next couple of years. Profits of Pounds 53m next year give a prospective multiple of 14.8, making the stock an undemanding hold.</p>

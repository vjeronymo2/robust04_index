			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Zdenko Vranjes from Citluk] </F>   [Text] The Croat people have secured their freedom. For  the first time since the ancient time of the Croatian kingdom,  we have created a free, independent, and sovereign state, which  already has allies in the world. These were the words Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman spoke in reply to a warm welcome and  applause at the beginning of his address to several thousand  people outside a hotel in Citluk. By creating a federation of  Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we have managed to  enable Bosnia-Herzegovina to team up--or we could even say  unite--with Croatia through a confederation, President Tudjman  said. He added:    [Begin recording] Mostar will be a mixed canton, as they  say.  In Croatian, we will call it a grand county [velezupa]. Still,  this is precisely because of you, who are the guarantee for the  Croatian state as a whole that this federation must be a new  state in which the Croat people will be a sovereign people, in  which it will secure not only all its civil and national rights,  but also will ensure its full unity with the parent state of  Croatia.    This is why you can trust the Croatian state leadership who  paved the way to a sovereign and independent Croatia. Trust  yourselves. Create the kind of authorities here that will be in  the interest of Citluk, in the interest of every Croat place, in  the interest of Herzegovina--that Herzegovina which was and  remains together with other Croatian regions on the front line  of the struggle for Croatia's freedom, independence, and  sovereignty.    Your contribution to the establishment of Croatian freedom  and democracy is a large one. The Croatian people as a whole  will never forget this. You will always find jobs in Croatia.  You must create conditions so that people will no longer  emigrate from this beautiful part of Croatian soil to distant  countries--to Canada or Australia, America or South America.  [words indistinct] are already returning.    Particularly here, in the Croat-Muslim federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, we need every Croat man. We need Croat  returnees from abroad so that we can consolidate, over a long  period of time, what we have secured. Dear friends, some people  from your area have asked me: Why do we have to be in this or  that canton, as they are called? I reply: We are going to call  them by their Croatian names, grand counties.    Precisely because of your presence, all of these  cantons--this entire federation--will have Croatian  characteristics. We can demonstrate something that the world is  also demanding of us. This democratic Western world--without  which we cannot make do--is demanding that we create here a  democratic society, that we make sure that this place is part of  western civilization. If we have curbed Serbian terrorism and  [word indistinct] aggression, it means that our present alliance  with the Muslims under the Washington agreement must be a  guarantee that there will be no fundamentalism, since  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a federation and in a confederation with  Croatia will develop as a western democratic country. This is  why you here are--and you must be--a lasting guarantee of this.  Long live Herzegovina. Long live our only and eternal Croatia.  Thank you. [end recording]    Following his visit to Citluk, President Tudjman and his  aides have left for Capljina, where he will also address the  people of this town on the Neretva and a large number of Croat  refugees living in Capljina and its neighborhood.</p>

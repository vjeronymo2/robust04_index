			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSINESS INVENTORIES RISE .7%; SALES FLAT  </P> <P> Business inventories rose 0.7% in May while sales were virtually flat, the  government said today in further signs of slackening economic growth.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and back lots climbed  to a seasonally adjusted $776.9 billion in May following a 0.8% rise in April.  </P> <P> Business sales, meanwhile, increased a minuscule 0.02% to a seasonally adjusted  $517.9 billion after rising 2.0% in April. Sales had held steady in March after  falling 0.9% in February, the steepest decline since January, 1987.  </P> <P> When not accompanied by increases in sales, rising inventories could threaten a  recession by prompting manufacturers to cut back production until stockpiled  goods are sold.  </P> <P> The May figures were further signs of a slowing economy, prompted by Federal  Reserve credit-tightening measures designed to halt inflation. Business  inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as production  outpaces demand.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department's retail sales figures for June, released Friday,  showed a 0.4% decline as consumer spending remained sluggish, particularly for  cars and other more costly durable goods. Sales also dropped 0.1% in May,  producing the first monthly back-to-back drop since the September-October  period of 1987.  </P> <P> The automobile industry has seen a recent buildup of unsold vehicles, and the  Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.9% in May. It said sales were off  1.8% from April.  </P> <P> Wholesalers registered the only sales increase in May, up 0.5%.  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Next boosted by buoyant high street sales Next, the UK fashion chain, demonstrated its continuing rapid recovery yesterday with the announcement of a near doubling of full-year pre-tax profits, from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 73.5m. The group, which was one of the most successful retailers of the 1980s but ran into difficulties when it over-expanded, has now seen profits recover from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 73.5m in two years. Mr David Jones, chief executive, said sales in the high street stores increased 17.8 per cent in the year to January 31, from selling space 1.6 per cent higher. The strong sales performance had continued so far this year, with year-on-year growth running at nearly 18 per cent. He said the upturn was the result of improvements in product range and customer service, as well as better presentation in the stores and the mail order business, Next Directory. The Next brand had been strengthened by a move to selling the same range through both the high street and the mail order division. Lord Wolfson, chairman, said Next had returned to its roots selling 'good quality, good taste and fashion, but not high fashion'. The fact that the group had run into difficulties as early as 1989 had made recovery easier as it had been able to dispose of many lossmaking outlets before the property market slumped in the 1990s. Group sales increased from Pounds 484.7m to Pounds 544.2m. High street sales were up from Pounds 332.9m to Pounds 392.3m, with operating profits rising from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 44.1m. Sales in Next Directory increased from Pounds 90.8m to Pounds 98.8m, and operating profits from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 8.5m. Turnover at Club 24, Next's credit management business, fell from Pounds 41.8m to Pounds 33.3m, but profits increased from Pounds 3m to Pounds 9.1m. Next USA, the US joint venture of which Next owns 78 per cent, made sales of Pounds 600,000 since the first store opened in Boston in September, but a loss of Pounds 1.8m including start-up costs. The group is opening another store in Washington DC in April and would like to open a second Boston store. 'The US experiment will be very slow, very considered, and we will decide over the next 12 to 18 months whether it is something we can roll out,' Mr Jones said. Earnings per share increased from 9.9p to 17.3p, and the proposed final dividend is 4p, lifting the total from 2.5p to 5.5p. Lex, Page 22</p>

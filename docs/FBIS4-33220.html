			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo -- The developed countries are expected to  promote a debate on the social question, which ranges from  salary policy and labor conditions to the treatment of needy  children, within the new World Trade Organization (WTO).  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim believes that if this happens,  and if new rules are imposed on countries having cheap labor, a  new form of protectionism would have been created.    Speaking at the seminar entitled "New World Trade Map"  sponsored by this newspaper, Amorim said: "Instead of  contributing to improving social conditions in developing  countries, this would result in rich countries exporting  unemployment to poor countries; that is, in the former  transferring to the latter an untenable social burden."    This new method of pressure known as social "dumping" is one  of the new issues raised at the end of the Uruguay Round of GATT  negotiations. Trade issues concerning the environment, and  policies on competition (rules governing competition among  countries) are other topics that are emerging on the new agenda  through the pressure exerted by the developed countries.    Ambassador Luiz Felipe Lampreia, the Brazilian  representative  to GATT, has contended that the WTO is not the appropriate forum  to discuss either the social "dumping" issue or the connections  between trade and labor standards. He said: "The International  Labor Organization (ILO) has already concluded 200 conventions  regarding this issue." Lampreia conveyed the Brazilian  Government's concern over the possibility that the WTO might  become a politicized organization "for reasons other than  trade." He noted that the WTO could become politicized "if it  carelessly introduces the social clause."    Lampreia chairs a GATT committee charged with studying the  links between trade and the environment. The committee is due  to propose to the WTO two years from now "the course of action  to take" regarding this matter. The Brazilian Government is  concerned about our exports of paper, cellulose, and shrimp,  which have been threatened by ecological measures with  underlying trade motives.    In the case of shrimp, Brazil had to sign an accord with the  United States whereby Brazilian shrimp boats will be equipped  with devices to avoid catching sea turtles.    Brazil signed the accord without reservations. It should  have made the above requirement applicable only to fishermen  operating in the northern part of the country, who are the main  exporters of shrimp to the United States, thus exempting  fishermen operating in southern areas, who are now complaining  about this restriction.    Mexico, a major exporter of this product to the U.S. market,  has had to conform to U.S. legal requirements designed to  prevent the catching of dolphins.    Another controversial issue at this time of transition from  GATT to the WTO deals with restrictive trade practices used by  some companies in their international transactions.    Amorim said: "This is an old claim by developing countries  that has now been compounded by the growing attention developed  countries are devoting to competition policies. In a globalized  economy, this type of practice could annul the liberalization  efforts made by some governments. This possibility has in fact  been recognized in the Uruguay Round accord on services and  intellectual property rights."    Jesus Seade, deputy director general of GATT, who also  attended the seminar, said: "The challenges are enormous. The  Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) is  working in this. The GATT member countries have no modern laws  on competition. Many practices do not encourage competition."    According to the foreign minister, it is a mistake to  believe  that governments and unions are united on the social "dumping"  issue because unions are inclined to favor higher salaries.    Ambassador Julio Antonio Lacarte, "chairman" of the Group of  Negotiations and Settlement of Disputes of the Uruguay Round,  said that operating under the WTO umbrella will be an  organization charged with settling controversies ("Dispute  Settlement Body" -- DSB), which will deal with disputes  concerning each accord of the final Uruguay Round agreement.  The DSB will be empowered to set up "panels" (arbitration  committees), will monitor the implementation of rules and  recommendations, and will authorize retaliatory measures if the  recommendations are not observed. This is a step forward in  relation to GATT, because the mechanisms for settling  controversies there is spread out among the GATT Council and  several committees created by the Tokyo Round.    For the first time GATT has also adopted the notion of  processing and production methods. Imports will now have to go  through a process designed to determine how the imported product  has been manufactured.</p>

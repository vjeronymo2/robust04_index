Shumeyko's Salary Will Equal  Chernomyrdin's"]    [Text] A deputy who is to sign up to work for any  committee of the parliament's upper chamber will now be paid the  same monthly salary as a minister -- this is today a little more  than 300,000 rubles [R]. This was decided yesterday by the  Federation Council, which got down to tackling the unpopular  question of providing sustenance for itself and made a serious  attempt to put its needs within more or less modest limits.  Following this principle, the salaries of committee chairmen  will be the same as those of vice premiers, and those of vice  speakers will be the same as those of first vice premiers. The  pay of Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko will become level with that of  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin.    Until then, according to the "Temporary Rules," each senator  will receive five minimum monthly salaries (that is, R70,000) a  month for "deputy expenses," or mailing, printing, and so on.

The bulk of expenses will naturally fall on the senate's  staff. Its final structure has not been determined yet. At any  rate, it has been decided that at first each of the Federation  Council committees will employ 12 persons.    The main supporting force will be the chamber's general  staff: the staff head and three of his deputies will be in  charge of an analytical center, three legal departments,  departments for information technologies, relations with  Federation components, international departments, and a press  center, plus the inevitable personnel department, general  affairs, logistics, and other departments. According to  Vladimir Shumeyko, nearly 400 persons will thus get jobs.  Importantly, the number is primarily limited by the lack of  space in the Federation Council building, the former State  Committee of Construction building. The staff can be increased  of course, "if we take over the lean-to, a little building...."</p>

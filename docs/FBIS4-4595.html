			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports, a U.S. daily, THE WASHINGTON  POST, reported on 31 March that U.S. Defense Secretary Perry let  loose a war outburst [chonjaeng pogon] opposing us.    Babbling [todulda] about North Korea's fictitious nuclear  development, the warmonger let loose a bellicose, reckless  remark [mangbal] that the United States is prepared to stop  nuclear development even at the risk of unleashing a war on the  Korean peninsula. He cried [koadoeda] that the United States  made a series of military preparations for it.    The warmonger clearly revealed a plot to isolate [korip],  crush [apsal] us, and openly threatened [nogolchoguro wihyop] us  by saying that the U.S. strategy is to take step-by-step  pressures by isolating North Korea and that more serious  measures will be taken in the future.    Perry frankly confessed that the spare parts for U.S. combat  planes and ground crews were taken to military bases in South  Korea and Japan, that the South Korean puppets are preparing  some kind of weapons, and that preparations for deploying  launching pads for Patriot missiles in South Korea are  proceeding. He even let loose an open war outburst [nogolchogin  chonjaeng pogon] without hesitation that the United States will  strike an overwhelming aerial blow within 24 hours against  someone's provocation. Perry raved [todulda] that he will have  in-depth talks with the South Korean puppets during his planned  junket [haenggak] to South Korea on not only simple military  countermeasures but also on when, how, and why the military  measures should be taken. In this way, he himself revealed that  his junket is an out-and-out war junket aimed at giving a new  order after examining war preparing troops in South Korea.    The warmonger's bellicose remark, which coincides with the  U.S. bellicose class' commotions [sodong] aimed at pressuring  the Republic, vividly shows that it is none other than the  United States that leads the situation on the Korean peninsula  to confrontation and war.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by G. Rogers] </F>   [Text] Pretoria Feb 22 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini on Tuesday told President F W de Klerk he was not  dependent on multiparty approval for the recognition of a  sovereign Zulu kingdom. He was "simply claiming it". He said  he and his people would resist the election, which was being  forced on them.    Addressing Mr de Klerk at the start of their meeting in  Pretoria, the king said the impasse between the government and  kwaZulu had begun when Mr de Klerk had pandered to the African  National Congress and had ignored the call for a delegation from  the Zulu monarchy to be included in the multiparty talks.    In a copy of his remarks sent to SAPA, King Zwelethini said  furthermore that the Zulu people would not be satisfied with the  area north of the Tugela River, as had been suggested by some  analysts. The Tugela boundary between what was Natal and the old  Zululand was established by colonialism and not by history.  Great Zulu generals of the past and some of the larger Zulu  clans had come from south of the river. "In fact...our great  founding king, King Shaka...lies buried south of the Tugela.  Most of my subjects live in the area south of the Tugela."    King Goodwill said any constitutional clauses, "any interim  authority and any legislation which denies the reality of the  Zulu kingdom is for me not worth the paper it is written on".  The interim constitution did not even allow even for "a kind of  homeguard" to protect the Zulu kingdom's integrity, and the  "vaunted powers of provinces" were "glorified municipal powers".    "This we will not accept."    The king said he was not waiting until after the elections  to  clarify issues that were impeding the emergence of a sovereign  Zulu kingdom. "The only thing we can talk about, Mr. President,  is how the Zulu kingdom will be relating to the new South Africa  which will emerge from the politics of people elsewhere."    He said their talks should be about how the administrative  structures of the Zulu kingdom and South Africa could be  mutually beneficial, how to rationalise them and how to remould  them into what they should be. "My father's people will resist  the election which you and political South Africa are attempting  to force on us.    "It will be folly in the extreme to think that the election  tank and the constitutional tank of the World Trade Centre  and...parliament can roll over and flatten opposition to  constitutional developments now taking place.    "I am not dependent on any multiparty approval for the  recognition of the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom. I am simply  claiming it."    An earlier statement by a government spokesman said the  necessity of assuring the proper recognition and constitutional  accommodation of King Goodwill and the kwaZulu kingdom had been  discussed at the meeting. The spokesman said after the  three-hour meeting the two sides had agreed to extend the  mandate of their joint working group to give urgent  consideration to all aspects of this question and to report back  as soon as possible.    Mr de Klerk was accompanied by ministers and senior  officials. King Goodwill was accompanied by Inkatha Freedom  Party President and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi  and members of the kwaZulu royal family.</p>

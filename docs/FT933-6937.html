			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Charter urged for utility regulators THE GOVERNMENT should set up a charter to give regulators of the privatised utilities clear directions on their role, says a report published today by the European Policy Forum. Mr Cento Veljanovski, a commentator on regulation, says a charter would end the sometimes acrimonious relationships between the regulators and the companies they watch over. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission said last week it hoped that the bitter relations between British Gas and Sir James McKinnon, head of the regulator Ofgas, would ease as Ofgas concentrated on more technical issues. The commission noted that a change of personnel at the gas regulator was imminent - Sir James is due to retire in October - and said this, with the fact that Ofgas would be concentrating on more technical issues, could allow it to build a more constructive relationship with the company. But Mr Veljanovski says that relying on a change of personnel is simply postponing the real issue. 'The danger is if the regulator changes so does the law,' he says. A charter would set down some rules for regulators to follow, circumscribing their discretion. The monopolies commission said it could not comment on the regulatory system in its reports on the gas industry as it would need a specific request from the government to do so. Mr Veljanovski calls on the government to set up such an inquiry to be chaired by a figure with legal and regulatory expertise. He believes this inquiry should draw up the regulatory charter setting out the principles of good regulation. Under the charter a regulator would have to call formal hearings before the monopolies commission if he or she wanted to change a utility's terms of operation. These hearings would be open to public scrutiny and third-party representation. Increased regulation would have to be cost-effective, Mr Veljanovski says. Regulators should also have to consult more widely and give reasons for their decisions. The Need for a Regulatory Charter, European Policy Forum, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA. Pounds 5.</p>

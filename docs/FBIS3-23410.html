			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Citing one of the top three leaders [president,  Chamber speaker, prime minister], the newspaper AL-HAYAH reports  today that the network involved in the bombing of the Sayyidat  al-Najat Church has direct links to Israel, noting that the  network leaders are linked to a local militia. The paper says  that the network leaders had often visited the security strip  and a European capital.    According to the top leader, AL-HAYAH says that the  investigations into the incident will inevitably confirm whether  party and militia leaders are involved in the bombing,  particularly since the group leader, who probably has escaped to  the Jazzin area in the security strip, was in charge of security  affairs in a local influential militia in the Kasrawan region.  The group leader, according to AL-HAYAH, is a relative of a  prominent party leader.    AL-HAYAH also cites official sources as saying that the  initial stage of the preparation of the explosives was conducted  in Sinn al-Fil before the culprits moved to the Zuq area. The  culprits then used a party center, which has often been raided,  to assemble the explosive devices before planting them in the  church.</p>

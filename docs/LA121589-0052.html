			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REASONS FOR GLUCOSE TEST  </P> <P> Question: An uncle of mine was referred for a glucose test because his doctor  thought that he had diabetes. It turned out that his glucose level was not  normal, but that he doesn't have diabetes. I thought that diabetes meant that  you did not have a normal glucose level. What else could it be?  </P> <P> Answer: Diabetes is usually the cause of an abnormal blood glucose measurement.  However, blood glucose also may be affected by severe stress, an overactive  thyroid, pancreatic tumors and use of diuretics.  </P></p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Marine Midland shows 82% advance MARINE Midland Bank, the US subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, yesterday reported an 82 per cent increase, from Dollars 43.6m to Dollars 79.3m (Pounds 52.8m), in net profits for the first half of 1993. The New York-based regional bank, which has Dollars 17bn in assets, said that second quarter net profits grew by a more modest 10 per cent to Dollars 45.3m (Dollars 41m). Net interest income in the second quarter was Dollars 186.6m (Dollars 178.9m) with the increase partly due to the improved quality of Marine's loan portfolio. However, the bank incurred a Dollars 56.1m loss in non-interest income reflecting an extraordinary Dollars 127.7m net write-down of mortgage servicing rights to reflect high refinancing levels. This loss was more than offset by the release of Dollars 115m in provisions for loan losses. The release of the provisions, and the resulting drop in the allowance for loan losses to Dollars 391.2m, reflected the continuing decline in non accruing loans and net commercial charge offs. The allowance represented 79.2 per cent of non-accruing loans at the end of the first half, compared to 65.6 per cent a year earlier. The bank ended the first half with an increased Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio of 9.61 per cent, compared to 8.67 per cent a year earlier.</p>

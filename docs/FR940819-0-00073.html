			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Role of escort vessels. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four comments suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the guidelines concerning the role of the escort must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be clearly specified and defined. One comment stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the principal purpose of the escort should be to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanker accidents by steering or retarding disabled tankers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that an escort should be able to safely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist a tanker moving near its maneuvering speed, alter the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanker's speed or course, apply lateral force, and overtake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tanker within confined waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard generally agrees with these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The role of the escort vessels is to assist a tanker that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiencing a loss of propulsion or steering control and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore at risk of collision or grounding. However, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be pointed out that escort vessels may not always be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to prevent all tanker accidents. This rule requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that reasonably capable escort vessels be immediately on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand to assist a tanker as circumstances permit. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision to respond, however, must be left to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional judgement of the escort vessel's master, who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must always first consider the risk to the escort vessel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its crew.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Benefit of escort vessels. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four comments stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they did not believe that the presence of escort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels improves the safety of the transit; two comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further stated that safety is actually reduced because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased vessel traffic (due to the escort vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> themselves) which increases opportunities for collisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, another comment asserted that tug escorts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would increase the risk of collision in Puget Sound.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, one comment points out that there are significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety benefits gained by providing escorts for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although escort vessels may not always be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent a tanker accident, the Coast Guard believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escort vessels can successfully control a tanker under many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. Having reasonably capable escort vessels on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand, coupled with the tanker master's duty to operate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanker within the performance capabilities of the escort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels, will provide the maximum feasible assurance that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transit can be safely made. The Coast Guard disagrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that vessel traffic would be substantially increased: in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prince William Sound the increased traffic would be two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escort vessels once every two months; in Puget Sound the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased traffic would average four escort vessels per day,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is not a significant increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3. Definitions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thirteen comments related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various definitions proposed in the NPRM, or proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional definitions. Accordingly, &sect;168.5 of this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adds, revises, and deletes certain terms that were proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Definitions of ``disabled tanker'' and ``escort transit''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

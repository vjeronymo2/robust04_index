It is not a long time, but it is  enough time for many things to happen which may determine, or at  least greatly influence, the voting inclination. Thus, even if  the opinion polls give a clue, it is not very wise to advance  any predictions.    The weekly DOMINGO/Gestinform barometer of December notes an  interesting aspect: the rise of almost all political leaders,  with the exception of only three out of 11.    The spectacular rise was that of Joaquim Chissano, chairman  of Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front], by more than one  point. Chissano rose from 5.8 points in November to 7.1 last  December, a rise of 1.3. Why did Chissano rise from five  immediately to seven? It is difficult to discover the reasons of  those interviewed, but one is led to believe, as it has always  been said, people forget very easily. The residents of Maputo  -- where all the counting was carried out -- may have already  forgotten about the fuel price increases decreed by the  government, which led to the rise in the transport fares. This  may be the case, since the Maputo residents won the battle, and  the prices of the private taxi fares remain the same.    This rise should also be viewed, however, as a reward in  view  of the measure taken by the government, recommending an annual  bonus...    Afonso Dhlakama's countrywide tour may probably have  produced  the desired effects, judging by the 0.9 point increase.    The person who is getting more and more popular of late  despite his silence is Dr. Maximo Dias, leader of the Monamo  [Mozambican Nationalist Movement]. The people are little by  little discovering the consistence of his speeches and political  positions. Some observers of the Mozambican process describe him  as a new Sergio Vieira, who is emerging in the national  parliament. The 0.4 rise explains it.    The person who is always active, flexible, and "champion" of  press releases is Wehia Monakacho Ripua, the leader of Pademo  [Mozambique Democratic Party]. The rise from 4.6 in November to  5.5 in December only proves that despite the fact that he is  considered "comic," the Maputo residents are getting to know him  better.    The trip of Dr. Domingos Arouca, chairman of the Mozambique  United Front-Democratic Convergence and National Reconstruction  Party [Fumo-PCDRN], to Europe may have increased his credibility  and seriousness among the public. With his 4.8 points in  December, Domingos Arouca is still far from his most direct  rivals in the presidential elections, Joaquim Chissano and  Afonso Dhlakama, but his 0.3 point rise should certainly  encourage him.    Lutero Simango, secretary for foreign affairs and member of  the PCN [National Convention Party], acts quietly and subtly and  is little by little scoring points, so that in December he rose  by 0.1. It is difficult to understand how this politician acts  and the reason for his acceptance among the public. Perhaps his  recent statements on the death of his father may have influenced  this.    Carlos Reis, who is a businessman and chairman of the  Mozambican National Union [Unamo], is also rising in the grace  of those interviewed, with an increase from 2.7 in November to  2.9 in December.    A list of political leaders who have lost points follows:  Padimbi Kamati (1.0), Casimiro Nhamitambo (1.5) and Martins  Bilal (0.8).    Neves Pinto Serrano appears for the first in the opinion  poll. For a person who dreams of residing in the "Ponta  Vermelha" Palace in October, the points he received, 1.9, are  not encouraging.    After a fall of 2.2 points from October to November, Foreign  Affairs Minister Pascoal Mocumbi rose considerably from 4.0 to  5.6 in December. This is probably due to the calm and  thoughtfulness which characterize his activities in the current  "hot potato" of the Mozambican diplomacy: the "Young pioneers"  case.    In turn, Armando Guebuza, head of the government delegation  in the CSC [Supervision and Control Commission], is still seeing  his efforts in the tiresome exchange of words with Raul Domingos  recognized by those interviewed in this opinion poll. His 0.1  point justifies this.    The one who seems to be navigating in bad waters is Prime  Minister Mario Machungo. Since October he has been continually  losing popularity. In that month he had 3.2 points, in November  2.8 and in December 2.0. However, it is easy to guess that  Machungo's decrease in popularity is well justified by those  complicated sums which only ended up increasing the Mozambican  people's cost of living...    All of the opposition figures decreased! Ululu decreased by  0.3 points, a decrease for the party of Jose Castro, whose trips  through the country have not been assisting him to be popular.  Raul Domingos, Afonso Dhlakama's "loud speaker" [preceding two  words in English], neither rose nor decreased.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bata brings in outsider as its chief executive Bata, the family-owned footwear group, has brought in an outsider as chief executive for the first time in its 100-year history. Mr Stanley Heath, executive vice-president of Nabisco International, the international food arm of RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and consumer products group, will move to Toronto next month as Bata's president and chief executive. Mr Heath's appointment coincides with the retirement of Mr Thomas Bata Sr as chairman. Mr Bata, who rebuilt the family shoe empire in Canada after leaving his native Czechoslovakia in the early 1930s, ahead of the Nazi occupation, will be 80 in September. Mr Bata will be succeeded as chairman by his son Tom. The younger Bata has been chief executive for the past nine years, but is considered a less forceful and effective manager than his father. Bata owns about 40 shoe factories and more than 6,000 shops around the world, selling 300m pairs of shoes a year. The company has never disclosed revenues, profits or market share, and members of the Bata family have generally confined their public profile to philanthropic and other non-business interests. Mr Bata Sr has played a prominent role in recent years in the reconstruction of the Czech and Slovak economies. The family business was one of the biggest in pre-war Czechoslovakia, but was taken over by the communists in the late 1940s. Mr Heath, aged 56, is an Englishman who is fluent in French and Spanish and has a reputation as a bright and easy-going manager. His biggest challenges are to revive morale among Bata's senior management, and strengthen the company's presence in fast-growing markets, especially eastern Europe and south-east Asia. Bata has faced increasing competition in recent years from low-cost shoe factories in countries where it has had little presence, such as China and Taiwan. It has also sought to break into the countries of the former Soviet Union, which are viewed by Mr Bata Sr as one of the few remaining vacuums in the international shoe business.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mexican Government Secretary Jorge </F> Carpizo by Jacobo Zabludovsky; from the "24 Hours" newscast --  live or recorded]    [Text] [Zabludovsky] Jorge Carpizo, government secretary.  Dr. Carpizo, good evening.    [Carpizo] Good evening.    [Zabludovsky] We have a question about the 21 August  elections. You have asked the United Nations to send observers  to the elections, to see how the elections are held. Yesterday,  you said you will not permit any foreign institution or  government to interfere. Would you explain this? It seems  contradictory.    [Carpizo] I am delighted to be with you again. Your question  is very pertinent. Many people have asked me the same thing,  which means that it is necessary to explain the situation. This  is a great medium for doing so.    There is no contradiction. We wrote the United Nations,  establishing for the record -- I have the text here -- that our  Constitution and our laws only authorize Mexicans to organize  and assess the elections. This is by virtue of the principle of  sovereignty, which means that only Mexicans can make decisions  on Mexico.    After establishing this principle in the note to the United  Nations, we told them that Mexico, as a member organization,  Mexico as a sovereign state has made a decision and this  requests two things:    First, that a mission of electoral experts be sent to study  our electoral system and draft a technical report. This is very  important. It would be a technical report. They are not going  to judge or evaluate us.    Second, that the United Nations provide technical assistance  -- the phrase is technical assistance -- to the various national  observers so that they can really act impartially,  independently, and objectively. The United Nations is not going  to send any observer, absolutely no one. What it will do is  send a UN group to our country before the elections, long before  the elections, to speak to nongovernment organizations and  render this technical assistance, provided these organizations  accept that assistance.    In other words, Mexican nongovernmental organizations have  every right to say either we accept or we don't. Fortunately,  right now the Civic Alliance, which includes many nongovernment  organizations, has accepted. It has accepted because this is  good for all of us.    We do want observers, but we want national observers. We  want only national observers. It is important that they know  how to conduct this observation for the good of Mexico,  independently but with complete objectivity and impartiality.  This is all that is contained in the note to the United  Nations, nothing more.    It is something quite different, totally different, when a  foreigner or foreign government wants to intervene and tell us  how to run our elections or give us advice. We do not need it.  This would affect Mexico's sovereignty. That would be  tantamount to meddling. Mexico cannot tolerate this for any  reason. Many changes are being made in Mexico to improve our  electoral laws, to improve all technical aspects of the 21  August elections, but through decisions by Mexicans. The  Mexicans are doing this out of their own convictions because  society and the Government of Mexico want to take steps forward  in democracy. Mexican society is asking, really demanding, as  we all are, clean and crystal-clear elections.    If you will allow me, there is a third issue. This week the  honorable Congress of the Union -- pardon me it was last week --  but yesterday, the official gazette of the federation published  the reforms of our electoral laws. They are very important.  These address the third issue, that of foreign visitors. Mind  you, they would not be observers, by any standard. They are  people coming to Mexico because Mexico does not prohibit anyone  from coming. There is freedom to come and go.    What are we going to do, then, if they want to be here on  election day? They will be given a document explaining Mexico's  electoral system and what they cannot do. One of the things  they cannot do is dare to evaluate the elections or judge  Mexicans. These, Mr. Zabludovsky, are the three extraordinarily  different issues, which differ from the other issue.    [Zabludosvky] It is very clear, Dr. Carpizo. I would like  to ask a question on a totally different topic.    [Carpizo] Of course.    [Zabludovsky] A few moments ago this program reported that  the Spanish justice minister, Juan Alberto Belloch, suspects  that there are ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] people in  Mexico. A deputy of the opposition Spanish Popular Party, who  says he has clues regarding the presence of ETA members in  Mexico, also has this suspicion. Would you tell us about that?    [Carpizo] Of course, several Spanish media have reported  this  for several months, and some Mexican media have echoed the  story. Undoubtedly there are people in our country who come from  Spain, who come from that part of the Basque region, but we do  not have any evidence that there are any guerrillas. If we had  proof -- this is being investigated and we will continue to  investigate it -- Mexico would act according to the law.    [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much, Dr. Carpizo.    [Carpizo] Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity  to be with you again.</p>

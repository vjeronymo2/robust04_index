[Istanbuli] When we discuss relations between Iran and  Jordan, we imply long, historic, and continuing bilateral  relations.    Two years ago, it was decided that relations should be  improved. There are various issues and circumstances  necessitating better and broader relations. The issue of  normalizing, establishing, and continuing relations with Iran is  an important one, which is being seriously pursued in Jordan in  word and deed. Recently, King Husayn told a news conference  that Iran has no role in fomenting tension in Arab countries and  this indicates Jordan's stance on the importance of the Islamic  Republic of Iran. Prince Hasan also stresses the role and  importance of Iran in the Middle East.    In letters to Iranian officials, King Husayn has stressed  Jordan's wish for better and improved relations with Iran. The  visits by various political, economic, and cultural delegations  to the Islamic Republic of Iran indicate Jordan's desire to  broaden ties with Iran. [passage omitted]    [KEYHAN] To what do you attribute the problems that cropped  up in Iranian-Jordanian relations?    [Istanbuli] The current relations between Iran and Jordan  are  based on the two countries and peoples being Muslim, having a  fundamental role in the Islamic world, and being part of the  great Islamic ummah. You should not ignore the role of the mass  media. The West has adopted two policies with regard to the  Islamic world: One concerns principled leanings  [osul-gera'i--euphemism for fundamentalism] and the dangers and  the second is the issue of human rights regarding which the  Western countries have concentrated their propaganda on  particular Islamic countries. In this manner, they claim that  these countries do not adhere to democratic principles and  violate human rights. They cover up human rights violations in  other countries. The victims in both cases are Muslims.    The mass media in Islamic countries should defend the  Islamic  culture and civilization more than ever so that they can combat  the Western media's propaganda. You should strive to eliminate  obstacles and replace them with common denominators and muster  every resource against such onslaughts. This should be a common  strategy for all Muslim countries.    On the effective role played by the mass media in raising  the  level of bilateral relations, he said: Much material is  published in Jordanian newspapers regarding the Islamic Republic  of Iran. A few weeks ago, the Iranian ambassador in Jordan was  interviewed in the press. Similarly, articles and reports on  elections and other important issues in Iran are published in  Jordanian newspapers, all of which are geared toward broadening  bilateral relations.    The Jordanian ambassador then referred to the publication of  articles in Iranian newspapers that tend to project Jordan's  stance as servile to the United States, opposed to the Islamic  Republic of Iran, and anti-Islamic and added: This is not true.  Jordan wants to have cordial relations with the Islamic  Republic of Iran.    Referring to the past record of historic, cultural, and  Islamic relations between Iran and Jordan, the ambassador called  for greater contacts between the two countries and the two  nations and said that despite the problems, bilateral relations  are on a favorable level. He added: We are living in a region  in which we should bring our stances and ideas closer together  and eschew discord.    [KEYHAN] The Islamic al-Tahrir party was formed many years  ago in Jordan but why has it never participated in the political  process with other factions and adopted the path of opposition?    [Istanbuli] This is linked with the thinking and leanings  of the party. You can ask them this question. The newspaper  AL-LULWA recently published the party's manifesto, its stance,  and its strategies, to which you can refer. There is no law in  Jordan that bans any party on the basis of its thinking. Every  party is free to state its beliefs and the law on parties  clarifies that the Islamic al-Tahrir party can carry out its  activities on the basis of the Constitution. [passage omitted]    [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of the Gaza-Jericho Accord as  a  peace agreement?    [Istanbuli] Naturally, if the objective of the Palestinian  leadership is to create a Palestinian government by means of  this accord, we cannot say that the Palestinians are wrong. If  it does not culminate in the establishment of a Palestinian  government, we can say that they should not do such things.    [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of Jordan's West Bank? Will  you set up a confederation to administer these Palestinian  territories?    [Istanbuli] The West Bank is part of Jordan and this has  been  clarified in the Constitution. If the Palestinian leadership  talks of a confederation, we believe that we are one nation,  that Jordan is one big nation. We don't even mention the  Syrians or Lebanese, with whom we have very deep relations,  which surpass all talk of a confederation.    [KEYHAN] How do you view the future of the Middle East,  especially after the Gaza-Jericho Accord?    [Istanbuli] The interests of the Arab and Islamic countries  are the main basis, the principles that should be incorporated  in such accords. And there should be provision for the  conditions of unity of Islamic countries. Jordan stresses the  need for an Islamic common market that should include every Arab  and Islamic country.    Jordanian Prime Minister Amir Hasan also stressed the role  of  the Islamic Republic of Iran in an Islamic common market. These  are the countries that should resist the enemies' economic and  cultural onslaughts. We are the first country to stress these  Islamic-Arab slogans. [passage omitted]    [KEYHAN] How do you view Jordan's relations with the Persian  Gulf countries with regard to the oil war, now that some years  have passed since then?    [Istanbuli] Jordan has always attached much importance to  its  relations with the Persian Gulf countries and it does not  benefit Jordan on principle to adopt a stance against these  countries. Jordan's policy was to amicably settle the issue of  the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. In this regard, Jordan  concurs with the Islamic Republic of Iran and believes that  foreign forces should not be present in the region. We do not  want to be opposed to an Arab country and we have cordial  relations with the Persian Gulf countries.    [KEYHAN] In view of the current international conditions and  the changes in the international structure, how do you view the  future world order and Jordan's place therein?    [Istanbuli] You know that Jordan is a small country in terms  of its area but has the longest border with Israel. Therefore,  it has the greatest responsibility of all the Arab and Islamic  countries. The issue is that Jordan has always tried to have a  strong army in terms of its resources and capability. It is  Jordan's strategy to be a country strong in its unity and  solidarity with its friends.    Jordan does not favor differences between Arab and Islamic  countries, as differences in the Arab and Islamic world will be  detrimental and harmful. You can see this in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iraq, and Libya and the Islamic and Arab  world are cooperating on this. We see that two Arab and Islamic  countries are under an economic embargo. As an Arab and a  Muslim, I believe there are children, women, and aged people who  are affected by it and we have a duty to them as Muslims. As  for Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is the same. In Somalia and  Afghanistan, the real victims are Muslims again and this  indicates foreign intervention and losses to Muslims.    The potential resources of Islamic countries are a strong  cultural force against Western civilization, indicating a strong  and basic international culture. Jordan's strategy right from  the outset has been that this culture and civilization should  remain strong and firmly in place and that that requires the  cooperation of Arab and Islamic countries.</p>

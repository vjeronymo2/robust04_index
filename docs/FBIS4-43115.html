			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F> political staff]    [Text] Labour swept into the Tory heartlands with dramatic  victories right across the country in the European election  results declared overnight.    But the Tory vote -- pitiful though it was -- held up just  sufficiently to earn John Major a reprieve from a leadership  challenge in the autumn -- or at least he hopes so.    Even so voters deserted the Tory cause in droves, and  citadel  after citadel fell to Labour in what was the worst Conservative  performance in a nation-wide poll this century.    The Liberal Democrats won a breakthrough by securing their  first two Euro-seats ever, but their overall performance  nation-wide was unimpressive compared with the triumphant march  of Labour.    Now John Major, who edges back from the brink of possible  personal disaster, will face massive demands for a wholesale  Cabinet reshuffle in which John Patten, the Eduction Secretary,  would almost certainly be one of the casualties.    Conservative Party managers gained little comfort today from  their claim throughout that they had won the argument during the  campaign.    The stark fact is that the Tories have lost 13 seats so far  in the 73 results declared overnight, one of the casualties  being Sir Christopher Prout, the party's leader in the European  Parliament.    And Tory MP Hugh Dykes, chairman of the European Movement,  pronounced the result a "monumental disaster," accusing  Conservative Central Office of letting Tory candidates down and  blaming them fair and square for the "debacle."    Meanwhile, a jubilant Margaret Beckett, the Opposition  leader, said the Tories had been overtaken by a "political  earthquake" which would have put Labour into power in the House  of Commons with a massive three-figure overall majority.    However, it seems as if John Major lives to fight another  day, even though maverick Tory Tony Marlow renewed his demand  that he should quit office and make way for a stronger leader.</p>

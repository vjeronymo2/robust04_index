"That office could be opened in the spring," Bela Csepe,  leader of the parliamentary faction of the Christian Democratic  People's Party (CDPP), told a CNA reporter in Budapest.    Csepe and a CDPP Vice President Miklos Hasznos will travel  to  Taiwan Monday [10 January] for a week-long visit to promote the  trade office. During their stay, the two will also meet with  Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Hsiu- jih and Vice  President of the China External Trade Development Council K.H.  Wu.    "Our main goal is to promote the opening of the hungarian  trade office in Taipei," Csepe said, adding that further delay  in opening the Taipei office will hold back development of  bilateral economic cooperation.    Taipei opened a trade representative office in Budapest in  1990, marking a new era of cooperation between the two countries  which maintain no diplomatic relations.    In a recent interview with UJ MAGYARORSZAG, a daily with  close ties to the government, Gabriella Farkas, vice president  of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF), said she realizes that  a Hungarian trade office in Taipei would help Hungary sell  foodstuffs and beverages to Taiwan.    The HDF is the leading force of a three-party coalition  government in Hungary, which also includes the CDPP.    Budapest has, however, been very cautious about the opening  of the Taipei office.    Farkas, who recently visited Taiwan, agreed that the office  would give an impetus to the development of bilateral economic  ties but stressed that it should not jeopardize national foreign  policy.    She said diplomatic links with Taiwan are not likely at the  moment as Budapest recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate  Government of China, and Taiwan is considered a Chinese province.</p>

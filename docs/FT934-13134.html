			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): Your capital may look safer - but is it? - Distribution bonds / The point is that nervous investors are reassured, because income does not reduce the number of units THE PRECIPITATE fall in base rates, from 15 to 6 per cent, has caused many British investors to search frantically for new sources of income. The current fashion for distribution bonds is accordingly no surprise. Distribution bonds are single-premium, unit-linked investment bonds issued by insurance companies. The manager can invest in a mix of shares, bonds and property in order to generate income and capital growth. The 'trick' of a distribution bond is the clear distinction between capital and income. On a normal unit-linked managed investment bond, investors generally take a 5 per cent income (usually described as tax-free although that may not eventually be the case for top rate taxpayers). This income is achieved by cashing in the requisite number of units. But if the bond has not grown sufficiently (either through earning income, or through capital gains), the investor could be eating into his capital. In a prolonged bear market, this could become a serious problem. appears to be eliminated. The income is distributed as a dividend, rather like a unit trust, and is kept separate from the capital. 'We like distribution bonds, because income can lose its identity within a conventional managed bond,' says Clive Scott Hopkins, marketing director of financial advisers Towry Law. 'In a distribution bond, the distinction between capital and income is clear.' But the benefit could be more psychological than actual. If you start the year with 1,000 units at 100p each, and your fund grows at 5 per cent, it makes no difference to your wealth, whether you have at the end of the year: 1,000 units at 100p, plus a Pounds 50 distribution cheque; or 952 units at 105p each, plus a cheque for Pounds 50 from selling 47.62 units for 105p each. Nevertheless, many investors get worried when they see their number of units diminish, even if the value of their fund has gone up. The distribution bond allows them to keep the same number of units, and, if they reinvest their income, the number of units could actually rise. Those who buy distribution bonds should not be deceived into thinking their capital cannot fall. There will naturally be pressure on a distribution fund manager to pay and maintain a high income. In order to do so, he might invest in the kind of high-yielding investments which are, by their nature, more risky, thus increasing the danger of capital loss. However, Clive Scott Hopkins argues that distribution bonds are likely to be a more stable form of investment. 'The success of Sun Life is due to its fund's high fixed interest content, which has made it a more secure investment than the average managed fund.' Sun Life is generally accepted to be the leader in the distribution bond market. The Sun Life bond was ranked second out of all managed insurance funds over both the seven- and 10-year periods to September 1. Over the latter period, it had produced a return of 292.5 per cent (offer-to-offer with income reinvested: source Hardwick Stafford Wright). That record means the distribution bond has built up nearly Pounds 1.4bn under management, making it the second largest managed bond on the market (behind Allied Dunbar with nearly Pounds 1.9bn). Richard Needham, of Sun Life, says: 'The bond's success has been that it has managed to deliver what it set out to achieve  - consistent and increasing income, with capital appreciation.' The fund's annual distribution has been cut only once, in 1981. The minimum investment in the distribution bond is Pounds 5,000; the initial charge is 5 per cent. Extra units are allocated for those who invest over Pounds 15,000, effectively reducing the initial charge by 1 per cent. Sun Life has now launched companion bonds  - deferred distribution (where income is automatically reinvested) and retired distribution (designed for pension contributions). Other managers have followed Sun Life into the market. Skandia, which offers a bond run by Schroder, says the unit price on its bond has risen by 16 per cent since the launch on June 1. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. There is no initial charge on the fund, but there are early encashment charges which start at 6 per cent in year one and dwindle to nothing in year six. Allied Dunbar's distribution bond pays income monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly. Investors can take withdrawals as a fixed percentage each year, as a fixed amount of cash each year, or simply the amount (as with other bonds) distributed. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000 and the initial charge is 5 per cent. The Prudential's distribution bond, launched in August, also requires a minimum investment of Pounds 5,000. The initial charge is 5 per cent and there are extra allocations of units for investments of Pounds 10,0000 and above.</p>

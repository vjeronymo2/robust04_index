			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM UPGRADED  </P> <P> Ventura County has begun replacing its 15-year-old communications system with  one expected to meet the needs of its fast-growing agencies until the year  2000, and which can be expanded after that.  </P> <P> A new 100-foot tower at the county government center in Ventura will be the  backbone of the $950,000 system, which will link the sheriff's, fire and public  works departments with the county's telephone network.  </P> <P> The current system carries 300 channels, and the county needs 550, said Charles  Taylor, chief of radio communications. The new system, scheduled to begin  operating in October, will have 672 channels, he said.  </P> <P> "The county owns its own telephone system and it all runs through this  microwave," Taylor said of the new tower.

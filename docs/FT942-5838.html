			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Czech brewer seeks to raise up to Kc3bn Prazske Pivovary, the fourth- largest Czech brewer, is to raise up to Kc3bn (Dollars 107m) to fund a five-year modernisation of its three brewing divisions and expand overseas sales of its leading brand. Mr Alfie Vaughan, a director of Prazske Pivovary, said that the aim was to improve efficiency and modernise brewing methods. Prazske Pivovary, in which Bass of the UK has a 34 per cent stake, expects to tap the Czech capital markets for the funds. However, the technical problems of raising long-term capital in the Czech Republic will have to be overcome. 'Our debt profile is very short-term, which must change,' Mr Vaughan said. The main beneficiary of new investment will be the company's Smichov brewery, which makes Staropramen, its leading brand with an estimated 10 per cent of the Czech market. Staropramen is to be marketed abroad as a premium lager. It will be launched in some UK pubs owned by Bass from October, backed up by 'a very substantial marketing budget', Mr Vaughan said. Bass paid Pounds 9m (Dollars 13.6m) for its stake in Prazske Pivovary late last year.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up 2.2% as region remains cautious The easing of the yen against the dollar and the parliamentary approval of this year's budget encouraged sentiment. The Nikkei 225 average jumped 2.2 per cent, topping the 21,000 level for the first time in three days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index gained 458.89 at 21,040.21 after a day's low of 20,637.43 and high of 21,068.01, recouping part of a 4.2 per cent fall seen during the previous three days. Arbitrage buying and purchases by financial institutions pushed shares higher, absorbing a steady flow of selling by arbitrageurs closing their positions. Investors welcomed the decline in the yen from its record high against the dollar, and comments from US and Japanese authorities aiming to halt the volatility. The long-awaited passage of the budget for the current year also boosted investor confidence. Construction shares gained support on expectations of new public works spending. Meanwhile, comments by the Socialist party, which had split from the coalition last April, hinting that it might rejoin the government, also heightened hopes that a general election this summer could be averted. The opposition Liberal Democratic party proposed a vote of no confidence yesterday against the current administration, but this cannot be passed unless the Socialist party co-operates. The Topix index of all first section stocks climbed 32.27 to 1,681.24 and the Nikkei 300 rose 6.79 to 306.07. Gains outscored declines by 991 to 107, with 101 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.28 to 1,369.44. Volume totalled 390.8m shares, against 495m. Newly established investment funds were also buyers, but some investors remained inactive due to continued nervousness in the currency market. Domestic investors were buying blue chip manufacturers, including steels and shipbuilders. Mitsubishi Heavy was the most active issue of the day, rising Y18 to Y792, and Kawasaki Steel put on Y11 at Y411. Mitsubishi Oil, which rose earlier in the week on reports that the company had discovered oil in Vietnam, eased Y10 to Y1,040 on profit-taking. High-technology issues, which have been battered by the recent surge in the yen, rebounded. Hitachi rallied Y20 to Y1,040 and Sony Y50 to Y6,120. Automobile companies were also higher, with Mitsubishi Motors up Y11 to Y972. In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 362.38 to 23,321.57 in volume of 37.4m shares. Roundup Activity was thin in all major Asian markets, concern on the US interest rates making investors cautious. HONG KONG closed higher on the firmer US dollar, the Hang Seng index improving 89.95 to 8,966.79. Turnover was light at HKDollars 2.81bn. Hopes of agreement in Sino-British negotiations on financing of the new Hong Kong airport helped the market; overseas investors were cautious, awaiting direction on US interest rates. Asia Securities soared 14.3 per cent to HKDollars 2.40 on speculation that the stock exchange might grant the company a waiver from the rules demanding that at least 25 per cent of its shares be held by the public. KUALA LUMPUR closed lower as election rumours died. The KLSE composite index slid 11.93 to 1,003.50 in volume of 160m shares. SYDNEY was volatile on a nervous bond market and a weak Australian dollar, the All Ordinaries index finishing 11.6 better at 2,022.5 but off the day's high of 2,034.2. Turnover was ADollars 579.0m. WELLINGTON saw signs of recovery in good volume. Turnover was quite high at NZDollars 55m, and forestry stocks were the main beneficiaries as the NZSE-40 index moved forward 30.49, or 1.5 per cent, to 2,060.1. JAKARTA drifted lower in thin volume which shrank to only 7.4m shares worth Rp38.6bn. The official index was finally 2.17 down at 470.96. BOMBAY's 30-Share index fell 66.42 to 4,257.2. The market leader, Associated Cement, reported a 12 per cent drop in profits and the shares receded Rs140 to Rs4,100. MANILA closed firmer for the second day in succession after a nine-day fall, the composite index gaining 6.20 at 2,822.15. PLDT continued to rise, closing five pesos better at 1,700, but overall volume fell sharply to 654.3m shares, from 1.15bn on the day before. KARACHI stocks ended easier in trade thinned by a threatened 'strike' by business and industry this week against higher taxes in the budget. The KSE 100-share index dipped 8.0 to 2,342.69.</p>

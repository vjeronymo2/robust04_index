			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALENDAR'S SUMMER SPLASH;  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CHOICES;  </P> <P> ART  </P> <P> Art buffs learn to live, like oriental sages, without hope or anticipation. If  one is so rash as to hope that this or that exhibition will be marvelous the  fates contrive to make it a turkey. If one is so unkind as to anticipate that  this other show will be a dud the resulting bad karma turns it into the Taj  Mahal just to prove we're not so smart. Better to wait in blissful neutrality.  </P> <P> On the other hand it is delicious to dream and what's the harm? It's just a  game.  </P> <P> I can't exactly anticipate the Frank Stella exhibition at the County Museum  since I saw it already at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Stella's recent  paintings are as big as baby elephants and almost as thick. They look like  massive metal French curves dressed up to go dancing in sequins, glitter and  popsicle colors. In New York they appeared the very embodiment of Manhattan's  frenetic energy and pizzaz. I'm betting they are chameleons which L.A. will  transform into exotic tribal objects.  </P> <P> By now "A Forest of Signs" at the Museum of Contemporary Art has been open long  enough to be seen by any interested citizen. It is all about how present  artists use words or images that imply words. The presence of that show tempts  one to anticipate "The Dada and Surrealist Word Image" coming to the County  Museum of Art. It will be about how now-classic modern artists like Marcel  Duchamp and Rene Magritte used words in their art decades before the young  whippersnappers over at MOCA. Taken together the shows are liable to prove  there is really nothing new under the inverted bowl we call the sky. But then  we already knew that.  </P> <P> Nothing seduces one to the sin of anticipation more than the promise of a  really hard look at an artist who has been interesting in isolated glimpses.  The Belgian Marcel Broodthaers turned up for years in European extravaganzas  with one big absorbing piece per show. I remember one at a Documenta in Germany  made up of old wheeled cannon and Victorian furniture. It had the literary  density of a 19th century novel. Broodthaers inherited the Surrealist tradition  then expanded it into the realm of environmental and conceptual art. One cannot  resist hoping that the first survey of his work coming to MOCA is going to  change one's life.  </P> <P> you look at your cereal box like an artwork. But its the encounter that counts.  </P></p>

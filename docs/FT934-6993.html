			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Schindler rejigs Jardine venture Schindler, the world's second largest elevator group, is taking control of its Asian sales and servicing businesses after renegotiating a series of joint ventures with Jardine Pacific. A new venture, Jardine-Schindler Holdings, owned equally by the two partners, with Schindler having a call option to raise its holding to majority status, will take over from January 1. Since 1974, Jardine has had a 60 per cent stake in its ventures with Schindler. Early last year, Schindler publicised its frustration with this arrangement, which it felt was inhibiting its development in the world's fastest growing markets. 'We cannot afford to invest a lot if we do not have a real joint venture where we can manage our own business,' Mr Alfred Schindler, chairman, said in an interview. Mr Schindler said the group paid a cash sum to Jardine and expected to exercise its option to take control of the new venture in two to five years. As part of the new arrangements, the Jardine-Schindler venture loses its exclusive rights to represent Schindler in China, where the Swiss group has two joint ventures with local partners.</p>

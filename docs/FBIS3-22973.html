He ordered him to halt but the  latter fired a shot and fled. The warrant officer gave chase;  exchanged fire with the suspect, hitting him in his left arm;  arrested him, and seized his weapon.    The security source said that after the suspect was put  through an identification process, it was discovered that he is  'Atif 'Ali Farghali Ahmad, recently released from custody and  formerly indicted in connection with several terrorist  operations. He was transferred to the hospital for treatment  and placed under armed guard.    Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi ordered a &pound;500 reward  for  the warrant officer for his prompt use of his personal weapon to  arrest the terrorist.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROST REFUSES TO RACE BUT STILL WINS GRAND PRIX WORLD TITLE  </P> <P> Thierry Boutsen of Belgium won the rain-soaked Australian Grand Prix Sunday,  but Alain Prost of France clinched the 1989 world drivers' championship while  sitting in the pits after refusing to race in the treacherous conditions.  </P> <P> "They should have waited longer to start the race," Prost said. "I simply  thought the conditions were too dangerous. You've only got one life."  </P> <P> Prost's McLaren-Honda teammate, defending world champion Ayrton Senna of  Brazil, lost his final chance of winning the crown when he crashed into the  rear of a Brabham-Judd driven by Briton Martin Brundle.  </P> <P> The accident occurred on the 14th lap after pole sitter Senna had driven  sensationally to lead the field by about 25 seconds. Senna's left front wheel  was completely ripped from the car in the collision.  </P> <P> Senna needed to win at Adelaide, and to win a court appeal against his  disqualification after winning the Oct. 22 Japanese Grand Prix, in order to  prevent Prost adding to the world titles he won in 1985 and 1986.  </P> <P> His court appeal now is academic.  </P> <P> Boutsen, driving a Williams-Renault, scored his second Formula One victory of  the year in the final race of the season. The race was scheduled for 81 laps,  but stopped after 70 when the two-hour time limit was exceeded.  </P> <P> Italian Alessandro Nannini finished second in a Benetton-Ford, 28.658 seconds  behind Boutsen, with Riccardo Patrese of Italy third in the second  Williams-Renault.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY LEADS 1-HOUR STRIKE  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of bus drivers, shipbuilders, dockhands and factory workers  in Gdansk province stopped work for an hour today to demand higher pay and a  halt to Communist Party influence on factory management.  </P> <P> It was Solidarity's first general strike since it regained legal status in  April and was hailed as "exceptionally successful" by veteran organizer Bogdan  Borusewicz.  </P> <P> Solidarity estimated that more than 200,000 workers took part, many of them  signing up as members in the independent union whose slow growth since its  legalization has disappointed activists. "Even those enterprises where  Solidarity is weak went on strike," Borusewicz said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Ardayev: "New Kazakhstani Parliament: </F> Drama or Farce?"]    [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- It may be that the current  process of reform of the legislature in Kazakhstan will go down  in history as something of an enigmatic phenomenon. Let me  remind readers that, unlike Russia, Kazakhstan has done without  tanks and rallying crowds, but immediately after the October  events in Moscow an "epidemic" of self-disbandment suddenly  broke out in Kazakhstan, affecting soviets at all levels -- from  village soviets right up to the Supreme Soviet -- and witnessed  the sudden demise of the latter. The president and government  categorically rejected suspicions that they were somehow  involved in this process, even though its organized character  left no room for any such doubt. So then, to use the well-known  aphorism of Red Army man Sukhov, "the East is a subtle thing...."    In mid-December the Supreme Soviet ceased to exist, having  transferred its legislative powers to the president and  scheduled elections for a new supreme legislative organ of power  for the beginning of March; this new body was conceived as a  compact parliament (177 deputies, two fewer than in the former  Supreme Soviet) working on a professional basis. President N.  Nazarbayev himself described the significance and purpose of  what had happened in the clearest terms: The Supreme Soviet,  which had basically been elected during a different historical  period and which contained all the old party nomenklatura, from  the head shepherd to the rayon committee secretary, had outlived  its usefulness, just like Soviet power itself with its arcane  system of soviets at all levels. What was needed was a united  and integrated legislative organ capable of single-mindedly and  competently providing a legal base for the reforms policy in  Kazakhstan.    It is hardly worth describing in detail all the ups and  downs  of the elections which have just taken place. Alternative  political forces contested seats in parliament on a legal basis  for the first time, but realistically the opposition's  opportunities during the elections were extremely limited.  Consequently the parliamentary majority was made up of deputies  from the so-called "state list," i.e. deputies nominated by the  president and the government in conjunction with representatives  of the National Unity Alliance, the political organization  supporting the president. Generally speaking, practically the  entire new parliament is yet again made up of people from the  nomenklatura. Some 90 percent of the deputies are leaders of  various kinds of government, state, and quasi-state structures:  Ministries and departments, local administrations, state  enterprises, kolkhozes and sovkhozes, law-enforcement organs,  and so forth. The president has gotten what he knows to be a  loyal parliament, whose objective qualities, however, mean that  it is able to act as a kind of hidden opposition, if not to the  president himself then at least to the reforms policy he is  pursuing.    Meanwhile, the "open" political opposition which finds  itself  in a definite minority is making its presence felt in vocal  fashion. Some 15 parties and social organizations of various  stripes -- communists and socialists, social democrats, national  patriots and the Slav movement "Harmony," which opposes them --  have joined forces and established the "Republic" coordinating  council headed by S. Abdildin, former speaker of the  self-disbanded Supreme Soviet. "Republic" has proclaimed a  course of establishing a "constructive opposition" in parliament  and has declared its objective to be the formulation and  protection of a program to ensure Kazakhstan's survival -- in  the opinion of coordinating council members, the state is going  to rack and ruin: Its economy is collapsing, the population has  been brought to the brink of penury, and the political reforms  are leading to the establishment of a dictatorship.    [Text] Although familiar communist terminology  predominates in the opposition's statements and their panicky  tone clearly betrays the desire of political failures to have  their revenge, as is so often the case there is no smoke without  fire -- the socioeconomic and domestic political situation in  Kazakhstan is indeed becoming more and more worrying. Since the  second half of last year, when illusions about the possibility  of preserving the ruble area came crashing down and Kazakhstan  set about introducing its own national currency, its economy has  gone into a steep dive. The decline in production has  accelerated and the number of enterprises that have either  stopped working or are working on minimum capacity is nearing  the critical mark -- according to official statistical data, by  the start of this year alone 732 enterprises and organizations  with a total workforce of over 350,000 people had stopped work  either partially or completely. And the situation is steadily  worsening. The payments deficit is growing, and this year there  are plans to cover it exclusively by means of loans from  international organizations.    The commodity production crisis is in turn whipping up  inflation in the young Kazakhstani currency. The speed of  inflationary processes is growing -- during the six months it  has been in existence, the tenge has seen its value fall six  times, i.e. average monthly inflation has reached the  100-percent mark. In this respect the new currency has already  outdone the old. Even the old-style ruble, which was withdrawn  from circulation in Russia last August and which Kazakhstan  continued to use until mid-November, did not plunge so rapidly  at first.    The government has not only failed to take any measures to  achieve monetary stabilization, it has even taken extremely some  illogical steps which have actually exacerbated the inflationary  situation. It has no choice in the matter, however: Its  budgetary resources for keeping prices in check are exhausted.  At the same time the increase in prices has not only become  evidence but also a cause of the devaluation of the national  currency, and the process has acquired an avalanche-like and  uncontrollable character. It is a vicious circle: Each new  fall in the tenge's exchange rate provokes a price hike,  including an increase in the price of energy sources, which in  turn jacks up the price of goods and services even more, which  in turn fuels the next inflationary spiral....    The president's staff and the government are not shouldering  the budget expenditure cuts themselves. A decision made  recently by N. Nazarbayev to separate the presidential and the  Cabinet of Ministers staffs demonstrates on the one hand that  the head of state is as it were dissociating himself from the  activity of the government he heads, which is likely to result  in the rapid replacement of its leadership -- this was also  confirmed by N. Nazarbayev's speech at the first session of  parliament in which he was sharply critical of the Cabinet of  Ministers, saddling it with the blame for exacerbating the  crisis processes. On the other hand, however, the separation of  the two staffs means their duplication, and consequently the  duplication of expenditure on officials' pay, which is already  fairly substantial.    Attempts are being made to cut expenditure, but squarely at  the population's expense. The decision of the president and the  government at the start of the year to abolish all previously  established social benefits and replace them with monetary  compensation caused a furor -- within the space of a month in  inflationary conditions these compensatory amounts had turned  into something like alms. When thousands of elderly people  organized a noisy rally outside the parliament building on the  opening day of the first session of parliament, N. Nazarbayev  issued an edict reinstating the benefits -- but only for the  disabled ex-servicemen and war veterans. Invalid children and  workers and similarity disabled people continued to be deprived  of their benefits. For example, a blind person is currently  obliged to buy a streetcar ticket, and someone without the use  of his legs must pay his phone bill in full and fill up his car  with gasoline at the standard, very expensive price. Another  example: Under the president's edict, the new arrangements,  which have only just been adopted regarding taxation of  individuals' income even envisage levying income tax  on...unemployment benefit.    As far as income itself is concerned, by the time the  session  started its work the president's edict had stipulated that the  minimum wage and old-age pension in the Republic should be  increased by 150 percent to 100 tenge a month -- even according  to official exchange rates when the edict was published this  does not even amount to $5 or 9,000 Russian rubles. This is the  minimum. Accordance to the government codes, the maximum cannot  exceed 10 minimums.... Despite price levels that are no lower  than in Russia.    Basically, ever since the Republic's Executive Branch has  subsumed the Legislative Branch, the situation has significantly  worsened. A whole tangle of problems does in fact require  competent and major intervention. Of course, it is laughable to  hope that the advent of a new parliament -- however strong it  might be -- would in itself be able to change anything right  away, but at any rate there is a chance that skilled collegial  revision by the deputies of the situation that has developed and  the activity of the government and president, and their  corrections to that activity, could inspire hope of finding a  way out of the crisis. On one condition, of course -- provided  parliament turns out as it was intended: A competent and  professional legislative organ.    The start of the first session's work exceeded all  expectations. First of all, the parliamentary leadership is  mainly composed of representatives of the president's "team."  The 55-year-old journalist, writer, and experienced ideological  worker Abish Kekilbayev was elected speaker; in the Kazakhstan  Communist Party Central Committee he was head of the Interethnic  Relations Department, and recently he has worked as a state  counselor in charge of the same issues in the government.    Second, as is normally the case, parliament began with  organizational questions. The work was thorough -- 10 days of  work were required to elect leaders, to form commissions and  committees, and also to examine issues regarding backup for the  deputies' activities.    Following heated debates, the deputies awarded themselves  ministers' salaries with a 50-percent additional amount to cover  expenses connected with performing their deputies' duties,  despite having ensured that many communal services such as  transportation and communications are provided for them free of  charge. In addition, they enjoy official apartments, personal  cars, free removal expenses enabling 120 deputies to relocate to  accommodations in the capital, health benefit in the form of a  lump sum equivalent to two months' salary, and individual  offices.... And when the initial stage of the first session of  the new parliament had finished, the deputies dispersed for six  weeks' vacation.    The second round of the session opens 13 May. It is hard to  make any precise predictions as to what it will be like, but  judging by the results of the first round, the president and  government's hopes of forming a loyal parliament in Kazakhstan  composed of state functionaries who are experienced in their  work have been completely realized: They have gotten what they  wanted, so to speak.    If everything subsequently follows the same scenario, it is  not hard to predict how events will develop. In conditions of  virtual one-man rule by the president (and hence one-man  responsibility), when the domestic political and socioeconomic  situation deteriorates further it will not be an effective  solution simply to replace the government cabinet. Taking new  and unpopular measures at a time when living standards are  steadily worsening and problems of an irreversible nature are  cropping up (stoppages by more and more enterprises and  increased unemployment owing to the fact that practically no new  jobs are being created) could provoke a negative reaction among  more and more sections of the population. And this could fuel  an increase in the prestige of opposition structures -- as has  already happened in Russia, where V. Zhirinovskiy's fascist  party "unexpectedly" achieved a majority at the polls. Another  danger faces Kazakhstan in this respect: Either political  forces of a pro-communist stripe will come to power, or, more  likely, the present executive branch will strengthen its  position little by little until it establishes a real  dictatorship. Both alternatives are equally unpalatable.</p>

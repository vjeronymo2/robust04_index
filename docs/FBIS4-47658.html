			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] asks Rwandan  refugees currently fleeing to Tanzania to return voluntarily to  their country. At a time when there is little security, mainly  due to the massacres being carried out by certain government  forces, with the assistance of the Interahamwe, [Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development militia] able  survivors are fleeing. There are also around 6,000 others who  are threatened by the Interahamwe and government forces in [word  indistinct] and churches in Kigali.    It is the same in foreign countries. A large number of  Rwandan refugees are fleeing. Among them are those attempting  to flee to Tanzania. Since 27 April, around 500,000 refugees  have arrived in Tanzania's Ngara region. Reports say that some  of the refugees are faced with disease, while others have wounds  caused by the Interahamwe and government forces. The refugees  arriving in Tanzania are made up of various groups. The first  group is made up of Rwandans who fled their homes because of the  killings and insecurity caused by the Interahamwe in Kibungo.  Another group is made up of the Interahamwe, including the  Murambi burgomaster, [words indistinct] who carried out the plan  for the massacres which failed later on. When the RPF troops  arrived in the area, the Interahamwe and other killers,  including government forces, due to the wicked things they had  done to the innocent, decided to flee. They realized they could  not fight RPF troops who were prepared to rescue innocent people  in the area. The third group of refugees in Tanzania is made up  of those who fled the fighting between the RPF troops and the  government forces elsewhere in the country, before fleeing the  area around Kibungo. The fourth category is that of Rwandans  who were staying in Kibungo, who felt insecure following the  deterioration of security caused by the divisionistic propaganda  of RTLM [Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines] and Radio  Kigali [words indistinct].    The RPF, once again, informs the international community and  Rwandans that it is the fundamental right of those refugees  currently in Tanzania to return to their country. There is no  problem at all between the RPF and the refugees. The best  indication of this is that there are people who are still in  their homes and who are living in harmony with the RPF troops in  Kibungo. Those who are sick following injuries caused by the  Interahamwe are being treated and are improving. Foreign  journalists are in the area to witness it. The RPF denies  unfounded reports to the effect that it might be stopping people  from fleeing and has closed the border with Tanzania. The UNHCR  [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] itself earlier announced  that about 500,000 refugees from Rwanda had fled to Tanzania  since 27 April. Then, how can those who claim the RPF is closing  borders justify that? As you heard, people are still crossing  the border to Tanzania. Currently, instead of being a real  facilitator, Tanzania has started to (?assist) the enemy of  Rwanda. After Habyarimana's death, Tanzania closed its border  to stop people from fleeing from the Interahamwe. Among the  people that country allowed in are many of the killers who fled.  When they fled, Tanzania opened the border.    The other sad thing for Rwandans and the international  community who were involved in the Arusha talks is that Tanzania  [words indistinct] Mwanza, Tanzania, seriously mistreated  Rwandan refugees in the area, claiming that they had celebrated  Habyarimana's death. Every person has the right to show  happiness or sorrow. There is always a reason for that.  Tanzania, which acted against the Rwandan refugees in Mwanza,  did not say anything when, in October 1990, the late  Habyarimana's government declared a 30-day celebration over the  death of the late RPF leader Rwigyema. One should ask the  Tanzanian officials whether those who celebrated in Mwanza acted  against any of the country's laws. This is yet another  injustice against Rwandans.    Tanzania should be a truly neutral facilitator and should  openly declare that it supports Rwandans and the international  community to [word indistinct] the killers, instead of  protecting them and turning a blind eye to the wrongdoings of  the clique. The RPF committed itself to joining hands with  Rwandans [words indistinct] those outside Rwanda, such as those  in Tanzania and other countries, to return home soon so as to  act together for the liberation of Rwanda.</p>

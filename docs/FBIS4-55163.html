			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- The Slovak  Constitutional Court today rejected a request, made by ex-Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar's government in the middle of January,  that it start work on the allegedly major discrepancies between  the screening (lustration) law and the Slovak Constitution.    During its term of office, Meciar's government was  frequently  criticized by the then opposition for being dilatory in applying  the screening law and for using it expediently for political  ends. As premier, Vladimir Meciar said on several occasions  that there were 235 Slovaks occupying important posts who had  received certificates showing them to be former agents or  collaborators of the Communist secret police. In the 1992  election campaign, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)  promised to abolish the screening law, but it never took this  step in parliament and in the end the government decided to deal  take the issue to the Constitutional Court.    Meciar's cabinet said the screening law was, to its full  extent, at odds with the Slovak Constitution because it  discriminated against certain categories of persons, did not  respect the presumption of innocence and the need for cases to  be judged by an independent court.    At its session today in Kosice, east Slovakia, the  Constitutional Court's board declined to deal with the proposal  of the since fallen government, since it said the court had  already made a decision on the matter once.    The present prime minister, Jozef Moravcik, announced  recently that after appointing the new government he had asked  for its members to be screened. The results are to be made  known in several weeks' time. The Slovak press is already  saying that Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi may be having  problems with screening positive. Magvasi, however, insists  that his conscience is clear and connects the whole "affair"  with his disputes with government colleagues over privatization.    Deputy Premier Roman Kovac told CTK today that the governing  coalition was considering amending the screening law, but was  waiting for the Constitutional Court's verdict before making a  decision. "It has started to be asked how long the validity of  the screening law should last, and some are of the opinion that  this time should be shortened," Kovac said.</p>

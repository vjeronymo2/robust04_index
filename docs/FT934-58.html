			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Unlucky dollar While the equity markets have been getting glowing end-of-year reports, the same cannot be said of the dollar. The consensus at the start of the year was that it would rise above DM1.80. Instead it still has not recovered its July peak of DM1.74 despite this week's spurt on the back of relatively strong US economic statistics. The question is whether it will fulfil in 1994 the expectations that were invested in it for 1993. Now, as then, the US economy looks stronger than that of Germany and the transatlantic interest differential is expected to narrow. One reason why this failed to provide much support for the dollar in 1993 may be that the US recovery was not strong enough to require tighter Federal Reserve policy. The D-Mark was also supported, at least until September, by strains in the ERM and subsequently by the relative caution of the Bundesbank in cutting interest rates. Yet the past year has seen a substantial narrowing of the interest differential as German rates came down. Three-month D-Marks cost nearly 6 percentage points more than US dollar deposits in January. Now the difference is less than 3 points. Ten-year German government bonds are actually trading at a yield 30 basis points lower than their US equivalent, which should make for a much stronger dollar. Its upward progress may remain anaemic unless the US recovery reaches the point where the market believes more than one round of Fed tightening will be needed.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMISSION ACCEPTS REVISED MURAL PLAN IN LITTLE TOKYO;  </P> <P> ART: THE PROJECT THAT SPARKED COMMUNITY PROTEST STILL REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE  CITY REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY.  </P> <P> Los Angeles' Cultural Affairs Commission voted Thursday to accept a revised  plan for a politically charged mural by artist Barbara Kruger on a 250-foot  exterior wall of the Museum of Contemporary Art's Temporary Contemporary in  downtown.  </P> <P> The commission also voted to issue a letter supporting the project to the board  of the Community Redevelopment Agency, which must also approve the plan before  Kruger and a crew of painters can begin to install it -- perhaps as soon as  early next year.  </P> <P> But the 5-to-1 approval did not diminish the mural project's continuing ability  to be provocative -- not just on political grounds, but in the context of  process issues by which public art is coming to be planned and executed in the  United States.  </P> <P> The Kruger project is to be a red, white and blue flag-like mural, 29 feet high  and 218 feet long. It will nearly cover the entire south-facing wall of the  Temporary Contemporary -- the building's most public exposure along First  Street in the heart of Little Tokyo.  </P> <P> MOCA's and the Temporary Contemporary's names will be the focus of the  blue-and-white section at the mural's top left corner -- suggesting the area of  the American flag occupied by the stars. The stripes will be made up of red and  white representations of nine politically charged questions, including "Who is  beyond the law?" and "Who is free to choose?"  </P> <P> The mural will remain on view for as long as two years after it is completed.  Since it will face a vacant piece of property that is scheduled for  development, a new building next to the Temporary Contemporary may obscure the  wall earlier than two years after completion -- in which case, MOCA officials  said, the mural will be painted over,  </P> <P> Thursday's vote by the Cultural Affairs Commission was the second time the city  board had formally approved the work. But the earlier vote was voided after a  Little Tokyo community group objected to the graphic design originally proposed  by Kruger in which the Pledge of Allegiance would have dominated the middle of  the flag design, with the questions surrounding the Pledge.  </P> <P> Some Japanese-Americans objected to being confronted by the Pledge of  Allegiance -- in letters 6 feet high -- because of massive civil rights  violations committed by the federal government against people of Japanese  descent who were placed in World War II internment camps. Alan Sieroty, a  Cultural Affairs Commission member, noted that the board failed to anticipate  the emotional reaction.  </P> <P> "We were caught without adequate sensitivity to the lingering pain," Sieroty  said. "We should not have been so insensitive . . . so ignorant. But we were."  </P> <P> Objections by Little Tokyo residents and leaders precipitated a series of  community meetings involving Kruger and local residents in which delicate  negotiations were held over the wording. The process, which Kruger has  emphasized is representative of an important, evolving component of some public  art, resulted in elimination of the Pledge of Allegiance wording entirely, but  retention of the questions.  </P> <P> "These questions should not be whispered," said Kruger of the scale of the  final version of the piece. The issue, she said, "was how to intervene in a  public space and this was my resolution."  </P> <P> Adolfo Nodal, general manager of the Cultural Affairs Department, noted that  the project focuses attention to an evolving perception of public art as  something that "is ultimately a consensus between two visions" -- that of the  artist and the community that will be called upon to live with and adjacent to  the work.  </P> <P> Nodal said the playing off of these two elements may sometimes force public  officials to become involved in what, in a pure sense, is an artistic decision.  "It is hard for us -- and potentially dangerous -- to get involved in the  artistic content," Nodal told the commission before he recommended approval and  support of the project to the redevelopment agency.  </P> <P> The redevelopment agency's board must approve the work because it may  technically conflict with some restrictions on billboards and regulations of  the percentage of space in a billboard or sign that may be occupied by the  actual wording. Sherri Geldin, the museum's assistant director, said content of  the Kruger mural had developed added significance as the Little Tokyo debate  proceeded because of national and international political developments. She  said importance of the artistic and political freedom of expression implicit in  the work was emphasized by the summerlong debate in Congress over the  appropriateness of federal support of controversial artworks.  </P></p>

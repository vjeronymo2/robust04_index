			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / NBC nears Super Channel purchase NBC, the US television network, is close to clinching the purchase of Super Channel, the pan-European satellite television channel which claims it is available in around 50m homes. The deal is expected to value Super Channel, 64 per cent owned by the Marcucci family of Italy and 36 per cent per cent by Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group, at around Dollars 70m. It is a further sign of the growing competition in the European satellite television market. BSkyB, parent company of Sky Television, recently launched a series of new channels, as part of its drive to increase revenues. Super Channel is broadcast via the Eutelsat satellite, the rival to Astra, which carries Sky Television's channels. NBC, which is owned by the US conglomerate, General Electric, already broadcasts programmes on Super Channel through its cable channel, CNBC. Super Channel, which says that the number of its viewers has increased from 8m to 150m over the past five years, resisted a takeover attempt from United Artists Entertainment, the US cable television and cinema company, in 1990. But it recently decided that it should be part of a media conglomerate. The deal with NBC will enable it to pay off its debts, believed to be more than Pounds 15m. According to a financier close to General Electric, NBC has been in talks with Super Channel for some months and hopes to announce completion of the deal within 10 days. The Marcucci family, which runs a family business with annual turnover of Pounds 250m, is expected to use the proceeds from the deal to boost its other telecommunication interests. It has television interests in Greece and Italy and has long harboured ambitions to set up a pan European television production company producing quality programmes. Three years ago it bought a series of European satellite and cable television rights for Super Channel from MGM/UA, the Hollywood studio that was bought by Mr Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications and is now controlled by the French bank, Credit Lyonnais.</p>

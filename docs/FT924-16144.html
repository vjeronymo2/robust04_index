			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Du Pont deal with ICI to go ahead THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday approved the planned swap of chemical assets by Du Pont of the US and Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK, but imposed strict and detailed conditions on the deal. The compromise was put together by Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, and the two companies. Under the original deal, ICI would have swapped its nylon interests for Du Pont's acrylic business and Dollars 431m (Pounds 246m) cash. The EC's merger task force said the deal should be blocked as it would give Du Pont 43 per cent of the market by value in nylon carpet fibre. Sir Leon's solution - which avoids the political repercussions of blocking the swap - will force Du Pont to transfer 12,000 tonnes of ICI's nylon carpet fibre capacity to a competitor. The British group's annual capacity is 45,000 tonnes and the sale will bring the combined group's share of the market down to 38 per cent. Du Pont had insisted the deal would give the company only 14 per cent of the overall carpet fibre market. The proposal was approved by commissioners without a vote, but competition experts outside the commission said they were concerned by the implications that competitors would have to co-operate closely. Sir Leon and his advisers argued that the nature of the fibres business allowed capacity transfers without jeopardising competition. The swap of assets has to be cleared by the US Federal Trade Commission. ICI is acquiring Du Pont's Dollars 300m acrylic business and will be the US's second largest acrylics manufacturer. The conditions are among the most complex Brussels has imposed. Du Pont will also have to: Sell an entire research and development facility, including technical personnel, to the same competitor; Manufacture under contract to the competitor for at least five years; Give the competitor exclusive rights to ICI's 'Timbrelle' trade mark, which is carried on about 80 per cent of the British company's carpet fibre production. Competition officials said the capacity and related facilities must be sold to a single competitor, which would have to be a fibres manufacturer. Market report, Page 48</p>

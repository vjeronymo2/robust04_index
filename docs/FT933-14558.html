			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Cash sought for Danube bridges BULGARIA is looking for foreign investors and partners to build its share of two new bridges across the River Danube, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Sofia. Bulgaria and Romania plan to build the bridges across their Danube frontier to ease a heavily congested route that links central Europe, several former Soviet republics and the Middle East. 'We are inviting foreign bids for the construction of the bridges,' said Mr Matey Donchev, technical director of Bulgaria's Danube bridges directorate. Neither country had the money to construct the bridges and would have to rely on investment from abroad. Officials have estimated the cost of each bridge at Dollars 120m (Pounds 81m). They would be built over the next four years and customs posts will be combined to save time. Mr Donchev said Mitsubishi from Japan had shown interest in the project, as had other companies from South Africa, Turkey and Austria. Only one bridge links Bulgaria and Romania at present and it is severely congested because of diverted traffic from the former Yugoslavia, wracked by civil war. It is planned that one road and rail bridge will link the Bulgarian river port of Vidin with the Romanian town of Calafat, and the other will connect Oryahovo on the Bulgarian side with and the Romanian town of Beket.</p>

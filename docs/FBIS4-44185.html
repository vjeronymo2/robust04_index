			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer </F> of the Greens by Hans-Ulrich Joerges and Klaus Lange in Bonn;  date not given: "Getting the Emperor Off the Horse"]    [Text] [DIE WOCHE] After the disaster of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in the European and local  elections, are you still seriously dealing with Rudolf Scharping  or are you already thinking about his successor for the 1998  elections?    [Fischer] There is no reason to be resigned. Kohl must go.  If we analyze the situation soberly, we must say: Kohl does not  have a majority any more....    [DIE WOCHE] He is just in the process of getting it back.    [Fischer] I do not see this at all. His Achilles heel is  Kinkel. The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] will need every  vote, and the risk is high that it will lose the votes that it  lends to Kinkel in a grand coalition in the end. The Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is in a fine state, now that a  professional civil servant has finally taken over this party of  free thinkers and independent people. The party is being guided  out of the chancellor's back pocket.    [DIE WOCHE] Should the SPD have taken Johannes Rau out of  the presidential elections after the second ballot for the  benefit of Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher to give a signal for a change in  power?    [Fischer] The presidential election was the strategic point,  because the question of power was at issue. If the SPD had done  that, it would not be Mr. Scharping who has a problem now, but  Mr. Kohl or Mr. Kinkel, and probably the two gentlemen together.    [DIE WOCHE] Why is the SPD now giving in so much?    [Fischer] The policy of the undeclared grand coalition, of  the maximum approach to Kohl, the policy of keeping the question  of a change in power open, meaning the question of "How do I  want to oust Kohl," is basically wrong. The statement that we  want to become the strongest party has a charm that is similar  to an announcement of the opening of a restaurant: Here you can  get something to eat. They have neglected to tell the people  most emphatically that it will be a misfortune if this coalition  remains in power. I believe Gerhard Schroeder is right in this  respect: Red-green would have a mobilizing and exacerbating  effect.    [DIE WOCHE] But Scharping would probably lose credibility if  he were to be changed into a red-green candidate.    [Fischer] I do not think so. I am sure: If red-green gets  a majority in the elections, Scharping will do that.    [DIE WOCHE] But Scharping has announced that he wants to  fight the election campaign against the Greens.    [Fischer] Oh, I am looking forward to that. I would be very  happy if he finally were to fight the election campaign against  someone. If he does not dare to do it against Kohl, then at  least against us!    [DIE WOCHE] How would you react to that? With an election  campaign against the SPD?    [Fischer] We are fighting the election campaign against  Kohl. After 11 years of Helmut Kohl we have the highest number  of unemployed, the highest state debts, the highest number of  bankruptcies, the highest number of social welfare recipients,  the greatest lack of housing, and the highest crime rate since  the founding of the republic. In addition, there is the  completely botched unification -- do you want to hear any more  reasons why we are conducting the election campaign against Kohl  and not against Scharping? Kohl must go, because he will ruin  the country's future!    [DIE WOCHE] But you must help the SPD to get onto its horse.    [Fischer] Only those who are not afraid of being quartered  can drag the emperor off the horse, the late Chairman Mao said.  I am not interested in how someone gets onto the horse but only  that the other one is taken off it. Our constitution then pulls  up the next one automatically.    [DIE WOCHE] Your friend Tom Koenigs said that he does not  understand at all what the SPD wants. Do you understand?    [Fischer] I see what it wants. But it cannot get into the  chancellor's office through the back door. If one wants to get  in, one must get in through the front door with the election  campaign crowbar and with the toughest possible opposition. The  challenger has not been able to make it clear that Kohl is a man  of the 1980's and that he cannot lead this republic in the  1990's any more. After the climax of his career, German  unification, he has failed disastrously. Kohl's team is  completely exhausted. Compared with this coalition, the Gobi  desert is a green, flourishing landscape. Around Kohl you only  find a couple of parched camels.    [DIE WOCHE] What is your model for Germany going to be like?    [Fischer] I do not want a model for Germany. I hated model  building as a child. The battle will not be fought for models,  it will be decided by the mood. Models bore people. The  decisive thing is the desire for change. The challenger must  create this mood for a new start; otherwise Kohl will stay until  the principle of collapse has an effect, and this is very  dangerous. Even if Kohl still rules from the Kyffhaeuser [a  mountain where it is said sleeps Emperor Barbarossa, who will  wake up one day and restore the German empire], he will never be  Barbarossa for me, or Bismarck, or Adenauer, but he will always  remain Kohl. If he is reelected, this republic will be very  angry with itself four weeks after the Bundestag elections.  Just as the British were after Major's reelection.    [DIE WOCHE] Would Gerhard Schroeder have been a better  challenger?    [Fischer] I do not interfere with the SPD's personnel  issues.    [DIE WOCHE] We would not have thought that you are so  discreet.    [Fischer] I permit myself to note one thing: I find what  the almost-candidate is publicly doing to the candidate in bad  taste.    [DIE WOCHE] If the SPD is not able to pull itself up by its  boot straps and grand coalitions are concluded all over the  country, the Greens would have to think seriously about  black-green [CDU-Greens] alliances.    [Fischer] Let me first say something about the traffic-light  [SPD-FDP-Greens] coalition: May God spare us that!    [DIE WOCHE] That would be a completely unstable alliance.    [Fischer] Certainly, this would be a great problem with the  current FDP. But perhaps Count Lambsdorff is still going to  turn from Saul into Paul in terms of ecology.    [DIE WOCHE] You are quoted as saying that a red-green  alliance would need a majority of 30 seats.    [Fischer] Oh, yes, yes....    [DIE WOCHE] How many more mandates would a stable  traffic-light coalition have to have?    [Fischer] The problem would not be so much the number of  mandates but whether there would be more than just formulaic  compromises.    [DIE WOCHE] And what about black-green?    [Fischer] There is no point in evading the subject: The CDU  and we are simply too far apart in terms of contents. However,  if the CDU were to undergo a development, leading to more  agreement on basic issues, this debate would certainly gain  momentum one day. As long as this is not the case, it would be  suicidal for both sides. Any kind of adventurism would be  punished by our voters.    [DIE WOCHE] Is it not time to test black-green in a city for  a change?    [Fischer] Take Frankfurt. You could say: With a CDU in a  large city -- why not? But when I look for this city CDU, I  find the group chairman, who is accurately an old Franconian,  and a CDU of the past. What should I do with that? Subject to  the punishment of our party's extinction, we must stick to one  basic rule: We are conducting an ecological and social reform  policy, either in the government or in the opposition. However,  reform policy must always be the priority for us, and not  participation in government. We must certainly not do the same  as the FDP -- doing everything just to stay in government.    [DIE WOCHE] In eastern Germany the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS] has grown very strong. What should one do with  it?    [Fischer] The PDS is eastern Germany's answer to Helmut  Kohl. I am the last one to be filled with sympathetic feelings  for the PDS. I still think it was a historical mistake that the  party did not break with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany  [SED]. Therefore, the toughest possible conflict exists in this  respect. However, I have never understood why the achievements  of the SED reformers are not recognized just like those of the  other reformers in the former East Bloc. I do not want to know  how many elections Mr. Gorbachev rigged. Nor do I want to know  how many elections Mr. Yeltsin rigged -- I suppose, as CPSU  district secretary he rigged quite a few. I have never  understood why Gyula Horn gets the Charlemagne Prize while Mr.  Modrow is put on trial, why Mr. Gorbachev was virtually declared  an honorary citizen of the FRG while Mr. Modrow has been  declared a pariah. The Gysis, the Modrows, and also the Wolfs  in the security apparatus were part of the peaceful change in  1989, which was brought about by the citizens' movements with  great courage.    [DIE WOCHE] What does this mean for the PDS's ability to be  part of a coalition?    [Fischer] Compared with the chutzpah of the CDU and the FDP  to take in the former bloc parties and, at the same time, beat  the successors of the SED, the SPD and we, too, are restrained.  Kohl would not have any false fears of getting into contact.  In the long run, one will not be able to ignore the fact that  the PDS will have to prove its worth in holding responsibility  in eastern Germany.    [DIE WOCHE] Reportedly, you want to become some kind of  superminister for industry, transportation, and science after  the elections.    [Fischer] Nonsense. I only say that you will not find me in  Mr. Toepfer's doll house.    [DIE WOCHE] It is surprising that your liking for red-green  has survived in Hesse.    [Fischer] It has! Just look at our joint political  achievements: nuclear policy, groundwater protection, drugs  policy, housing construction, foreigners, etc. I am often angry  about the SPD, its secret ways, its fear of the conservatives,  its shying away from the question of power. But there is a hell  of a lot that we can do together. If you ask me about my  experiences in Hesse, I am emphatically in favor of red-green.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Viewpoint" article by Karen Brutents, doctor of historical </F> sciences and adviser to the president of the Political Studies  Foundation: "Russia and the East"]    [Text] Russia is in transition in almost every respect.  This also goes for the crystallisation of its identity as  regards both its rightful role in the world community and its  concept of its own distinctiveness and essence. I take the view  that in this respect as in some others Russia still keeps in  large measure to the past, to disconnected fragments of it, and  may be said to apply the formula of its legal succession to this  sphere as well.    Yet Russia will have to "predetermine itself," with its  vision of the problems of "Russia and the East," of relations  with the East, as a most important part of the process.    What is the issue today, when the substance of a problem  that  seems so very traditional or rather historical for the country  is undergoing a serious transformation as a result of 70 years  of membership in the Soviet Union and, above all, drastic  geostrategic, social, and economic changes in Russia?    It is primarily our relations with Eastern (in fact Asian)  countries as well as their projection into our relations with  the West. Until recently this part of the globe received little  attention from Russian policy and diplomacy for both objective  and subjective reasons. But Boris Yeltsin's visit to South  Korea, China, India and Japan, his remarks in Peking about  "breakthroughs" to Asia and in Delhi about a "period of  pro-Eastern policy" give hope for serious reassessment, for a  continuation of the process of revision, with tangible deeds  following important statements.    The attitude to the East and relations with it are a key  aspect of Russia's identity, of its self-determination as a  civilised spiritual, psychological and even political  phenomenon. Whether Russia belongs to or sees itself as part of  the West or the East was the object of a controversy that ran  through Russian social thought for a long time, being slightly  diluted in the 1920s by emigres who advanced the concept of  Eurasianism. Nor is this surprising, for the controversy has  always involved diametrically opposed political notions of the  road along which Russia should move.    It seems to me, however, that this aspect of the controversy  has lost meaning (assuming that it ever had any), and the  present flare-up of Eurasianism is rather indicative of the  opposition's search for ideological equipment and its reaction  to immoderate (and occasionally indecent) Westernisation on the  part of a section of the intelligentsia and some spokesman for  the government. Be that as it may, the formula of Westernisers  versus Eurasianists and those who consider themselves  inseparable from Russia's "native soil" provides no answer to  the question of the relationship between Russia and the East.    The issue today is obviously Russia's fundamental attitude  to  the East, the need to recall certain distinguishing  characteristics of our country, not a reproduction of theses of  Eurasianism, which argues that Russia is following a road of its  own and that regular global developments do not apply to it. The  experience gained to date leaves no room for doubt that they  involve the East, West, North and South. Hence Russia cannot  stay off the road of democracy and a social market economy,  whose various forms are winning ever wider recognition.    This, however, presupposes realising that the long-standing  notion of the "ownership" of the phenomenon of democracy is  outdated and that to embark on democracy is not the same as  accepting the Western model.    The vitality of democracy depends on its ability to make  further progress. Currently, many in the West are pondering on  how to improve the democratic procedure in use. More and more  people there consider that these procedures are by no means  ideal and that it is indispensable to devise effective ways of  combating increasing corruption, overcoming the population's  political indifference due to the crisis of the party system in  its present form and to the disregard of pressing needs of the  electorate by leaders, to their selfishness and demagoguery of  defending the interests and rights of minorities from the  democratic diktat of the majority. In this situation the search  for consensus which is typical of Eastern countries seems to be  coming to the fore in various sections and structures of society.    The 21st century is likely to become an era of  democratisation in the East. But this will hardly come down to a  mere transplantation of the Western model and hence to  Westernisation. Incidentally, all talk about grafting Western  ideals is indefensible also tactically. It may complicate the  democratisation process, causing this "extraneous" phenomenon to  be rejected, a prospect exploited by nationalist and oligarchic  forces in the East. Formerly, in the period of confrontation  between two world systems, there certainly was a point in  stressing the "Western" character of democracy. Today, however,  the situation is entirely different.    Russia largely owes its originality (but not exclusiveness)  and its legitimate role and potential as a member of the world  community to the fact that it combines, if not always  harmoniously, the features of Western (European) and Asian  (Eastern) civilisations. While the poet Alexander Blok used  those famous words "Yes, we are Scythians, yes, we are Asians"  in the heat of debate, they were not accidental but reflected a  historic intertwining.    Traditionally drawn primarily to the West, Russia has always  been a Eurasian country nonetheless, and this not only  territorially. Its history, polyethnic environment, culture and  very interests induced it to play the role of a link or even  mediator between the two countries. Of course, how far it coped  with this role is open to question. But there is no doubt that  over the centuries diverse civilisational streams converged in  the expanses of Russia, where a polyphonic socio-cultural area,  a fabric of intercivilisational bonds and a culture of mutually  enriching interchanges came into being and an atmosphere of  psychological tolerance and openness to beneficial influences  was created.    Everything relating to Russian nationals--their way of life,  individual and social psychology, arts and letters, character  and mentality--bear the imprint of this intercivilisational and  supranational phenomenon influencing also the political  evolution of the country, if not decisively. The  "non-Westernness" of many spiritual and moral qualities of  ethnic Russians and other inhabitants of Russia is obvious.    Directly deducing the specifics of Russia and its people  from  contacts with the foreign and internal parts of the East or from  the "Eastern" component of their "soul" is out of the question,  for they are a product of more complex interaction.    Still, the influence of these contacts, of Russia's Eastern  environment, seems indisputable. Traces of it can be found in  the language, the humanities (meaning their scope and the range  of their interests), literature, noblemen's names and much else.  This is as it should be, for, apart from two and a half  centuries of the Mongol domination, Russia continuously and  intensively extended its contact with the East through conquest  and cultural interpenetration. It grew into Asia, forming its  own East, an Asia of its own, where hundreds of thousands of  ethnic Russians and other Russian nationals closely interacted  psychologically, intellectually, and emotionally with the  Eastern way of life and Eastern culture.    No non-Asian country has anything like this, and the  spiritual reverberations of this interaction were bound to make  themselves felt in one way or another throughout Russia. How  very tangible the results of this mutual receptiveness can be is  illustrated by the problem of adaptation of today's wave of  emigration from some southern republics. It appears that there  is a substantial distinction in psychology and way of life  between these emigrants and their compatriots in, say, Central  Russia, which creates difficulties in this respect as well.    A high degree of tolerance for a polytechnic environment is  a  further reflection of Russia's historic identity, of the blend  of Western and Eastern components that its genetic type  represents. To be sure, Russian chronicles have also recorded  other things. Chauvinism, too, has had and still has influential  adherents. By and large, however, Russia as a country and  society is more resistant--as the dramatic experience of recent  years shows--to anti-emigration trends like those that are now  rife in, for example, Western Europe.    Russia's attitude to the East is an attitude to itself, too,  for Russia is also home to Tatars, Bashkirs, Yakuts, Caucasian,  and dozens of other "Eastern" nationalities. Their place in our  country, in its life and fortunes, is entirely different from  that of, say, Arabs or Africans in France, Indians or Pakistanis  in Britain. Russia is not just a habitat of diverse ethnic  groups but a polytechnic country where the Russians as its  backbone and other peoples have for centuries lived not only  side by side but together, intermingling, fusing culturally and  spiritually, jointly weathering social cataclysms and repulsing  foreign invasions. They have a common history and common destiny.    Add to this that for 70 years we lived in one state, leading  a common life with millions of Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kirghiz,  Turkmens, Tajiks, Azerbaijanians, and that today we belong with  them to the Commonwealth of Independent States. All this was  bound to and did have its effect, drawing and linking us  together.    In other words, whereas Western Europe and the United States  may look on the East as something different or even alien, it  would be unnatural of Russia to do so. This is what geography  and history, cultural and civilisational factors have willed.    Some Russian leaders today repudiate Russia's "Asian  heritage," seeing nothing in it but negative, ignominious  things, a burden pulling us back. Yet this heritage is as  contradictory as any other legacy of history. Along with  elements of medieval stagnation and even slavery, it includes  what is a natural part of the historic strength and potential of  Russia and its civilisation.    Russia belongs to neither the West nor the East alone. It is  at once a Western and Eastern country. This does not mean that  Russia is a mix or mechanical combination of cultural  continents. Our country is the product of a synthesis that has  given rise to a new, distinctive civilisation, a whole  civilisational mainland, an original organism whose thinking and  sentiments set it apart from others. And so all attempts to  "rid" us of things Eastern and fully Westernise us are futile.  What is more, they are absurd.    Today the multicivilisational, Western and Eastern sources  and nature of Russian distinctiveness are acquiring special  value. "Integration" is a word you now hear almost everywhere.  It is a trend paving the way to the future for humanity. A  universal civilisation is dawning all over the world, and its  components are taking shape and spreading, especially to the  economic sphere but also to politics and culture.    Much less is said, however, about the circumstances that the  result will by no means be a unified world, the effacement of  distinctions, the abolition of cultural diversity. If this were  to happen, humanity would become faceless, for it would lose one  of the most powerful driving forces of its progress.    I am sure the 21st century will give existing civilisations  a  second wind as they develop and adapt to new conditions without  losing their identity. It will usher in an increasingly  polycentric world. We will arrive at it after abolishing a  bipolar system, as we have already done, and completing the  present transitional stage of unbalanced concentration of  political influence, military power, and information potential  at one pole.    Unlike the past, however, the evolution of diverse  civilisations will probably take place in unprecedentedly close  mutual contact. The era of isolated civilisations shutting out  all others is over. They are being drawn together by the  transnationalisation of economic life and information, the  feverish development of communications, mass migrations. This  creates tensions at "junctions" and other difficulties.  Experience shows that even the achievement of a high, roughly  equal level of economic growth does not eliminate problems  arising from civilisational and cultural heterogeneity.    We live at a time when not only close contacts and a  rapprochement between countries and nations but a convergence of  civilisations and cultures are gaining in importance and  urgency. This is all the more essential now that the greatest  ideological conflict of the 20th century is over. Against this  background Russia with its mixed civilisation, a country which  has gone through a social experiment, is a particularly  noteworthy phenomenon. Its intercivilisational essence, the  experience of the coexistence of and contacts between diverse  nations, may prove very valuable for humanity at this stage if  preserved and fostered.    The East always held a prominent place in the foreign policy  and overall potential of the Russian state and the Soviet Union.  Basically, this also applies to the present period even though a  number of important circumstances and vectors have changed,  which means that many earlier approaches will have to be  revised. What is different now is primarily Russia's real status.    Russia used to identify itself with a superpower, the Soviet  Union, and actually embodied it. The Soviet Union was chiefly a  Russian state. Most foreigners called it "Russia" and its  citizens "Russians," doing so not only by mistake or force of  habit.    Today Russia is striving to act as a full-fledged legal  successor of the Soviet Union, and Russian diplomacy is doing as  much in the main sectors. Yet the changes that set in with the  disappearance of the Soviet Union as a superpower strongly  affected Russia even though it may still not quite realise its  new situation because the aura of the recent past and reflexes  of a state that has gone out of existence linger on. Russia has  joined the ranks of great powers (with a population half the  size of the Soviet Union's and an area that is smaller by a  third) and will yet have to back up this new status by providing  itself with an appropriate economic and political basis.    The priorities and main tasks of Russian policy and  diplomacy  are not quite clear as yet. They are certain to depend for some  time to come on personal predilections, reflexes of attraction  and rejection, automatic reactions evolved over the past few  years. But however pro-American and pro-European a section of  the intelligentsia and some leaders of the country may be (they  understandably want Russia to be regarded as inseparable from  Europe and the West and to have a say in European affairs),  there is no disregarding realities.    The disintegration of the Soviet Union has objectively  shifted the geostrategic and geopolitical epicentre of Russia to  the East, towards Asia, although nominally this is not the case  and, more importantly, is somewhat contrary to our current  requirements. A belt of new independent states has emerged to  the west of Russia (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, the Baltia  republics) drawn mainly to Western Europe, not Russia. These  states are virtually moving Russia away from Europe, being a  partition that may become a barrier where the position on Russia  is unfriendly. On its southern periphery Russia is now faced  with independent Transcaucasian and Central Asian states plus  Kazakhstan. Furthermore, some of them are becoming a serious  security problem.    Today Asia accounts for nearly 80 percent of Russia's  territory, 70 percent of its frontiers and the lion's share of  its natural resources. What the country can expect to help it  end the present economic deadlock and make progress are  primarily its eastern areas. Siberia and the Far East (12  million square kilometres of territory and the longest Pacific  coastline), their economic cooperation with and integration into  the fast-developing Asia-Pacific region.    As matters stand, the Asian part of Russia is thus bound to  play a bigger role in the destiny of the country, its economic  growth and foreign policy. This is also true of its Far Eastern  coast at a time when most of the country's Baltic and Black Sea  ports are gone.    A welcome change is the fact that Russia is no longer  shackled by a superpower policy involving overarmament and  ideological messianism and demanding that the country approach  the world as the arena of an all-out rivalry for leadership.  Russia no longer sees the East as an area of confrontation  between two systems. It has withdrawn from an unacceptable and  unwinnable game.    I believe all this means that Russia must resist the  temptation of a duumvirate approach that, while possibly  tickling its self-esteem, is useless. Besides, the United States  remembers Russia in this context mostly when it is a question of  certain survivals of the Cold War, an attitude which is only  natural from the point of view of that country's national  interests.    Russia's most powerful neighbours are in the East--in Asia.  Its relations with the East include relations with China. These  are already of fundamental importance and their importance for  Russia's destiny will grow further in the first decade of the  next century, when China will have a real chance to become an  economic (and possibly also a military) superpower, according to  many forecasts.</p>

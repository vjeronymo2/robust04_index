			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Daniel Santoro; copyright CLARIN] </F>   [Text] The United States has reiterated its "subtle"  request that the Argentine Government make antinarcotics action  "more efficient" by opening two battle fronts. On the one hand,  Washington wants more legal weaponry to be given to judges and  to the police "this year," incorporating -- for example -- the  case of "repented" persons in Argentine law, in reducing the  penalty of detainees who provide information on drug trafficking.    The U.S. Administration also pointed to the need for the  military to provide logistical support (without engaging in  combat with drug traffickers) to security forces. Foreign  diplomatic sources, however, have told CLARIN that the powerful  DEA (the U.S. antinarcotics agency) believes that "for the time  being" this step is not necessary.    These precise and clear signals of what Washington wants  were  conveyed by DEA head Robert Gelbard [title as published] to  officials at the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and  the Antinarcotics Secretariat during his stay in Buenos Aires  last week.    The sole reference to the Argentine military becoming  indirectly engaged in the fight prompted a debate within the  government, causing its anticipated rejection by the military.    However, according to the same sources -- who preferred to  remain anonymous -- the DEA has another priority that comes  before this one: incorporating, among others, the following  provisions in the antinarcotics legislation:    Informers: Depenalize the actions of persons who, while not  being criminals, provide information about drug traffickers.    The repented: Judges should be allowed to reduce penalties  in return for information. This case is regulated by law in  other countries. In Spain, for example, it was applied to the  case of "repented" Andy Cruz Iglesias, who reported to Spanish  judges the Argentine connection of an international  dollar-laundering gang, which originated the so-called Yoma  affair in Argentina.    Undercover agents: Policemen should be allowed to infiltrate  traffickers' organizations, under judicial branch control.    Judicial branch controlled shipping: International  drug-trafficking operations should be allowed to continue in  order to arrest the gang in the receiving country.    The objective of these measures, which are added to the  reiterated claim for increasing control over the "laundering" of  narco-dollars, is to prevent the crimes linked with drug  trafficking and to try to catch the heads of the organizations.    DEA priorities for Argentina are consistent with the U.S.  concern about the releasing of Colombian John Arrayave Arias,  one of the men involved in the "Prawn Operation."    However, and despite the fact that Secretary for the  Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto Lestelle has submitted a bill  with several of these measures, Peronist deputies and senators  are not too enthusiastic about "adjusting" the legislation in  this regard. Opposition sources in Congress maintain that the  first two provisions in particular will, in addition to  contributing to fighting drugs, facilitate investigations into  reports on corruption.    During a stay in Buenos Aires on his way back to Washington,  Gelbard was seen in Recoleta on Friday, in an informal lunch  with Foreign Ministry Secretary General Andres Cisneros.    The statements by the U.S. principal deputy assistant  secretary of state for inter-American affairs, Michael Skol,  that the Latin American military should engage in logistical  support actions in the antinarcotics fight has revealed that the  Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry disagree on this  controversial proposal. (Skol proposed that the Armed Forces  cooperate in intelligence, transportation, logistics, and river,  coast, and airspace control activities).    "The Armed Forces should not have any type of engagement  whatsoever, because antinarcotics action is a police task," said  a high-ranking Defense Ministry source consulted by CLARIN.  This opinion is shared by the Radical Civic Union.    Before adopting that position, Defense Minister Oscar  Camilion consulted with the four chiefs of staff about the  proposal. According to military sources, the answer was  unanimous: It is not a central or a secondary mission of the  Armed Forces.    However, considering that drug trafficking is a growing  problem, Camilion is advocating the idea of "giving more  infrastructure" to the Border Police, to the National  Prefecture, and to the Police, instead of engaging the Argentine  military in the fight against this scourge.    Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, however, adopted a  legalistic position: Argentina "has already fulfilled" the  request by Skol by including in the National Defense Law a  provision under the terms of which the Armed Forces will be  allowed to intervene in the hypothetical cases in which drug  traffickers overwhelm security forces, high-ranking Foreign  Ministry sources told CLARIN.</p>

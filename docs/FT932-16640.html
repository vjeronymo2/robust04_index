			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Lilley hints at 65 pension age for all MR PETER LILLEY, the social security secretary, yesterday reinforced expectations that the government will move to equalise the state pension age for both men and women at 65. Quoting the costs of equalising at 60, he emphasised that other countries were moving to higher pension ages, with Scandinavian countries and the US on the way to setting the retirement age at 67. Mr Lilley said during BBC television's Breakfast with Frost that reducing the state pension age for men to 60 would cost an extra Pounds 4bn, while raising it to 65 would save about Pounds 4bn. He pointed out that the number of people in work, relative to the number of pensioners was declining and was likely to decline further in the next century. The raising of the retirement age would be very controversial, although equalisation would not take effect immediately. There are already clear signs that the timing of the government's plans has slipped and that legislation is most unlikely until the 1994-95 parliamentary session.</p>

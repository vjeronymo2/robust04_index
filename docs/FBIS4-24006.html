			<p>BFN     [Text] If the Mozambique United Front [Fumo] wins the  coming elections it will propose to the Assembly of the Republic  a new constitution which will guarantee "citizens and legal  national entities the right to own land."    Fumo, which will continue to unveil its government program  during the election campaign, says its constitution proposal  contains the principle of decentralizing public administration  -- the introduction of local governments at "district and  locality levels," elected by direct and secret universal  suffrage.    Fumo says it will reserve the right to hold a referendum "on  federalism or other systems" in case there is "considerable"  support for it from "political forces".    Fumo says its constitution will contain, among other things,  the principle of the "right to resist any illegal order or  command" as well as the right "to use force to repel any act of  aggression when it is impossible to resort to [words  indistinct], and the "right of the consumer."    At the request of the president of the Republic, there will  be a "Council of State," which will include the chairman of the  Assembly of the Republic, the prime minister, the president of  the Constitutional Court, the attorney general, leaders of  political parties with seats in Parliament, and the "(?whip)."  This council will have the task of advising the president of  the Republic.    In Fumo's constitution, the prime minister is appointed by  the president of the Republic "with advice from the most voted  for party," while the remaining members of the government are  also appointed by the president of the Republic "with advice  from the prime minister."</p>

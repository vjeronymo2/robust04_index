The rule also increased the administrative assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year. Authorization of this budget enables the Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) to incur operating expenses, collect funds to pay those expenses, and settle indemnification claims during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. Authorization of the increase in the administrative assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year enables the Committee to collect sufficient funds to pay expenses projected for the remainder of that year. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers who have signed the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 998.407 is effective July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995.

This agreement is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the agreement now in effect, peanut handlers signatory to the agreement are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the peanut agreement program are derived from such assessments, and a deductible type insurance for 1994&hyph;95 indemnification expenses. This rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate for the Committee for the crop year which began July 1, 1994, and ends June 30, 1995, and increases the administrative assessment rate for the crop year which began July 1, 1993, and ended June 30, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 47,000 producers of peanuts in the 16 States covered under the agreement, and approximately 76 handlers regulated under the agreement. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of the producers may be classified as small entities, and some of the handlers covered under the agreement are small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

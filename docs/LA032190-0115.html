			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIGURE IN JUDGE CASE SOUGHT IN MOLESTATION CONVICTION  </P> <P> Authorities are searching for Richard J. McLane, a convicted child molester who  failed to turn himself in to begin a prison term. McLane's 1987 case drew  attention when he became a key figure in a corruption investigation of two  Municipal Court judges.  </P> <P> McLane, 58, was supposed to report to Superior Court in January to begin  serving a five-year sentence for his 1987 conviction on two counts of child  molestation, four counts of furnishing cocaine to minors and another drug  count.  </P> <P> McLane had been free on $10,000 bail, pending an appeal of his conviction,  which was denied in November by the 4th District State Court of Appeal. His  attorney, Alex J. Forgette, told the court that he has no idea where McLane is  and that he last talked to his client after the appellate court refused to  overturn the conviction. McLane was living in Arizona at that time, he said.  </P> <P> "I hope I am able to reach him," Forgette said. "I think he's making a big  mistake. He's only complicating things for himself."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth O. Chinn expressed confidence that McLane will be  found: "If he's stopped for a traffic problem anywhere, and the police run a  computer check, they'll see he is wanted on a nationwide warrant."  </P> <P> Several prostitutes told Newport Beach and Fullerton police that McLane had  promised that he could arrange lenient treatment in Harbor Municipal Court in  Newport Beach if they would perform sexual favors for Municipal Judge Calvin P.  Schmidt.  </P> <P> Another Harbor Court judge, Brian R. Carter, allegedly called a prostitute and  said he was collecting a sexual favor owed to Schmidt, the prostitute told  police.  </P> <P> Carter said he is innocent, but he resigned from the bench -- in part, he said,  to avoid a review from the state Commission on Judicial Performance.  </P> <P> Schmidt was reprimanded by the commission for using his authority to help the  daughter of a close friend. But Schmidt was cleared of the allegations by the  prostitutes.  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office conducted an intermittent,  four-year inquiry into allegations against both judges. The probe concluded in  1988 with no charges being filed.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Agareva: "Russia Introduces a Civilized </F> Form of Mineral Resource Use: Production Sharing Agreements"]    [Text] Despite the Christmas holidays, the president  of Russia's edict "Issues of Production Sharing Agreements in  the Utilization of Natural Resources," signed on 24 December,  did not escape the attention of Western companies. Their  interaction with Russian authorities on production sharing terms  now gets a legal base. At the same time, the Ministry of Fuels  and Power Generation, in whose bowels the edict had been  drafted, was swamped with inquiries. The ministry's first  reaction to this avalanche of questions were clarifications made  yesterday by the leaders of the group that drafted the  edict--Gennadiy Shalmanov, chief of the main combined  administration for legislative and legal-normative support, and  Professor Aleksandr Perchik.    Until now, in the environment of legal uncertainty Western  companies by necessity practiced the method of "sequential  approximation," signing protocols of intentions and reaching  agreements with the authorities of the federal and regional  level. When it came to concrete decisions of project  implementation, however, it would turn out that they either were  in conflict with various instructions or were not envisaged by  legislation.    The decree liquidates many blank spots and, according to  Aleksandr Perchik, "is worth a law." First, the notion of  "production sharing" becomes legitimized. Second, the parties  that have a right to participate in an agreement are clearly  defined. Investors are not limited to legal entities--a group of  subjects without setting up a legal entity now falls under the  definition. The point in question is legalization of consortiums  that have already de facto emerged in Russia--in particular,  when Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 tenders were conducted--but in  legal terms lived a precarious existence. Third, it is specified  that the state may participate in the agreement either as itself  or as represented by a state company that is carrying out  appropriate instructions--such a company may participate  directly in the project implementation.    Of keenest interest to foreign investors are the issues of  taxation and regulation of export of the share of the output due  them. The decree substantially reduces the number of taxes the  investors will have to pay. There are only two now: the tax on  profit and a fee for mineral resource use, which, in the opinion  of the authors, will permit the circumstances of every deposit's  development to be treated in a flexible manner. In the event  that the deposit is rather difficult, the production sharing  agreement may specify terms that will ensure that a foreign  investor will get an adequate return, which will remove the need  to beg for additional preferences. In addition, the imported  equipment brought in for the project implementation is exempted  from the value-added tax and customs duties.    Raw materials that constitute a foreign investor's share by  the terms of agreement may be exported "in keeping with  procedures set for export of home-produced output." This means  that exporting them does not require quotas and licenses. At the  same time, these procedures do not relieve exporters of  strategic materials (a joint enterprise or a foreign company) of  the requirement to register with the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations, which undoubtedly reduces the attractiveness  of production sharing agreements for foreign investors.    The future of the edict is not entirely clear. In any event,  it will be submitted to the Federal Assembly for approval and  most likely will indeed be approved. It is possible, however,  that the deputies will then decide to revive the consideration  of the draft law "On Concessions and Other Agreements Entered  With Foreign Investors," which also includes regulation of  production sharing relations--especially considering that this  draft law had been adopted by the Supreme Soviet in the second  reading but was not signed by the president because of the  exacerbation of the political situation in the country.    The edict's weak point is that it bypasses the issue of the  regions' powers in attracting foreign investors into cooperative  ventures on production sharing terms. The edict assumes that the  current process of property division between the Federation and  its components will be completed without conflicts. Meanwhile,  the draft law contained a rather precisely defined mechanism for  division of powers, which the lawmakers can easily resurrect.  Besides, it envisaged the possibility of exempting foreign  investors who are parties to production sharing agreements from  the requirement to register as special exporters. It is quite  possible, however, that this norm may be dropped from the final  version of the law.    [Box, p 2]  <H3>  The Edict `Issues of Production Sharing Agreements in the  Utilization of Natural Resources' </H3>   --retains the requirement to obtain a mineral resource use  license    --legalizes consortiums as a form for a group of investors  to  join together without forming a legal entity    --permits exports of mineral raw materials that become the  property of the investor as home-produced by the investor    --exempts imports of producer goods within the boundaries of  the implementation of a production sharing agreement from import  duties and the value-added tax    --leaves capital assets newly created in the course of  project implementation in the ownership of the investor unless  specified otherwise in the agreement    --keeps the provisions of a production sharing agreement in  effect for the entire term of the agreement regardless of  whether Russia adopts legislative norms that may have a  detrimental effect on the commercial results of the investor's  activities under the production sharing agreement</p>

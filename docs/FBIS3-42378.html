			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences Major-General V. </F> Menshikov under the rubric "Cosmodromes: Rockets and People":  "Baykonur"]    [Text] Taking into account reader interest in the  previously closed topic of the locations, layout of the  facilities and activity of the Military-Space Forces of the  Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, we are beginning  the publication of materials on the cosmodromes.    The Baykonur cosmodrome is an enormous scientific and  technical complex. It is located on desert terrain in the  central portion of Kyzyl-Orda Oblast. About 40 rockets for space  purposes and up to 10 intercontinental ballistic missiles are  launched from it every year.    The grounds of the cosmodrome (which extend 85 km from north  to south and 125 km from west to east) have launch pads and  engineering positions, receiving and transmission centers,  wireline communications centers, storage areas for rocket and  space hardware, fuel components, systems for electric-power,  heat and water supply, an oxygen-nitrogen plant--one of the  largest in the world for the production of cryogenic  products--and other facilities. Baykonur is comparable in the  scale of production and consumption of electric power to a  sovereign state such as Moldova. The cosmodrome has five  telemetry stations and a computer center, as well as nine  telemetry stations along the flight paths of the launch vehicles  for 1,500 km along the territory of Kazakhstan and Russia, as  well as areas for the spent stages to fall.    The population of the city of Leninsk and the residential  compounds of the centers for the preparation of launch vehicles  and spacecraft for launch fluctuates, depending on the tasks  being performed, from 120,000 to 150,000 people.       All of the facilities are traditionally divided by the  residents of Baykonur into "ten," the "left" and "right" flanks  and the "center."    "Ten." The city has a quite well-developed  infrastructure-- the Krayniy airfield, a TETs [heat and  electric-power plant] (12 power boilers and eight turbines),  branches of the MAI [Moscow Aviation Institute] imeni S.  Ordzhonikidze and the Progress Plant (city of Samara), a  bread-baking plant, movie theaters, a swimming pool, a  television station, communications and domestic-services  enterprises and various sights, as well as parks and squares  that are artificially irrigated in the summertime.    "Left flank." The launch and engineering complexes  for the Tsiklon and Proton launch vehicles and the spacecraft  that they put into orbit is located about 70 km northwest of the  city of Leninsk.    Elements of the former are located in compact fashion at a  single site. The rocket itself is exceptionally reliable.  Created by the KB [design bureau] under the supervision of  Academician M. Yangel in the middle of the 1960s, it has not  suffered a single accident right up to the present day. The  launch complex is convenient to operate and highly automated.  Satellites with nuclear power plants were launched from here in  the 1970s, which caused great unpleasantness when they failed in  orbit. They are no longer employed today.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-07A>           Map </FIG>    The principal rocket and space complex for which the "left"  flank is renowned is the Proton. It includes two launch areas  with four launch pads, a refueling and neutralization station  and an engineering position with two installation and testing  wings. The residential compound is designed for 10,000 people.    "Center." The launch and engineering structures  for the Soyuz and Energiya launch vehicles, the spacecraft they  put into orbit and the Buran orbital vessel are all located here.    The famous "two," with the Gagarin launch pad, two  installation and testing wings, a hotel, guest cottages, a  museum of cosmonautics and the cabins of S. Korolev and Yu.  Gagarin, is located 30 km from Leninsk. The daring assault on  the universe began here. Soviet and many international crews  that brought honor to our state "left" for orbit from this  launch pad.    The ground elements of the Energiya/Buran reusable space  system are located alongside "two," where the structures of the  king of rockets-- the N-1--run along the main road for a  distance of more than 15 km. The launching set-up, a service  tower shortened by 60 meters and the moving portion of the  rocket erectors have been partially utilized from the N-1  equipment. All the rest had to be created anew. This most  complicated ground complex occupies an area of more than 10  km[.sup]2[/]. It consists of several dozen structures and  more than 50 technological and 200 engineering systems. Two  identical launch pads are located here. They are served by a  cryogenic center located to the north, with storage areas  (spherical containers 12 meters in diameter) for liquid oxygen  and hydrogen and gaseous nitrogen and helium (pressure in the  tanks 400 atmospheres).    The launch structure goes down five stories. It is a  reinforced- concrete structure with monitoring and check-out  apparatus, elevator equipment, massive protective doors weighing  two tonnes apiece, a gas offtake port 20 meters in diameter,  three gas offtake channels 23 meters deep and two masts 64  meters high. One of them is for refueling and drainage. One  feature of it is that it has a platform that is removed only  after the start of rocket movement, so as not to permit the  displacement of the hydrogen with atmospheric air, the formation  of "knall gas" and an explosion. The other tower is intended for  putting the orbital crew into the spacecraft, or for their  emergency evacuation through two elevator tubes that lead to  bunkers. One tube has a lift and a rail car designed for twelve  people, for bringing the cosmonauts up. The other is for  emergency evacuation, in which people slide downward in a  sitting position as in an ice slide. Each crew member lands in a  separate bunker below, with a closing iron door.    Two railroad tracks 18 meters apart run to the launch  structure. The reusable space system is delivered along them to  the pad by four powerful diesel engines from the installation  and refueling wing on a placement unit. The total weight of the  moving structure is about 10,000 tonnes.    The launch-complex systems are automated, and are controlled  from a command post located five kilometers away. It is a  three-story subsurface building with an enormous (100 x 50  meters) central hall. The electric power consumed at the launch  pad during times of operation would be enough for a city of a  hundred thousand. The composition of the reusable space system,  apart from the pad, includes a general- purpose pad intended for  launches of the Energiya/Buran system, as well as the test-bed  and technological testing of rockets, firing and post- flight  testing of its side units as part of the technological package  and test beds for the Energiya with a mock-up of the Buran  orbital vessel. It was built before the launch complexes.    The landing complex is located 12 km northwest of the pad.  The runway is unique, with a length of 4,500 meters and a width  of 84 meters. The surfacing is up to half a meter thick. The  deviation from the horizontal is no more than three millimeters  on a three-meter section of the runway's length, which is a  third of that at the international airfield at Sheremetyevo. The  servicing and engineering area of the landing complex supports  the unloading of fuel components from the orbital craft, loading  operations and the storage of ground servicing equipment.  Stations for the receipt and processing of telemetric  information, a main hall for control and analysis, a set of  navigational and landing systems, a meteorological center and an  ornithological service are accommodated in a six-story combined  command and dispatching station.    The engineering complex for the Energiya and Buran includes  operational and production zones located 40 km from the city of  Leninsk and 5 km from the launch pad.    The operational zone is made up of an installation and  refueling wing, a refueling station and a pyrotechnics station,  while the production wing has an installation and testing wing  for the launch vehicle and the orbital craft. All of these  structures are of truly cosmic dimensions. The installation and  testing wing for the Energiya, for instance, was built for the  N-1 launch vehicle, and is the largest building at the  cosmodrome. It is 240 meters long, 190 meters wide and 47 meters  high. There are more than 2,000 people working in it during  periods of intensive preparations. The installation and testing  wing for the Buran is a structure 225 meters long, 121 meters  wide and 30 meters high. The Buran complex also has a  dynamic-testing test bed--a building more than 100 meters high.    The barracks and residential compound is able to hold up to  20,000 people, residing there permanently or coming in for  temporary duty of several years.    "Right" flank. A second complex for "seven,"  analogous to the Gagarin launch pad, is located 50 km southeast  of the city of Leninsk. It entered service in 1960 and was  intended as a back-up for "two," and was built with a regard for  prevailing experience--the excavation was twice as large, and  the installation and testing wings and the residential areas  were brought closer to the locations for the preparation and  launch of the launch vehicles and spacecraft. Manned launches  were also made here, but it was primarily spacecraft for  interplanetary flights--Venera, Mars, Phobos and Vega, among  others-- that were prepared here. More than 330 launches were  made in all.    Ten kilometers from this pad is the Zenit complex,  consisting  of a launch installation, a cryogenic center and more than 50  technological systems. All of the operations in the  transporting, placement of the rocket on the launch  installation, hook-up of electrical and air lines and fueling  are performed automatically, and the rocket can be launched an  hour and a half after placement. Service towers will be put into  operation at the launch pad, through which the placement of the  cosmonauts into the craft will be accomplished, when the Zenit  becomes the principal launch vehicle for manned space flight,  replacing the famed "seven."    The cosmodrome is in a difficult situation today, suffering  from shortages of people, resources and funds and experiencing  organizational and financial difficulties. The future of space  science for the CIS countries depends on how these problems are  resolved in the future.    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

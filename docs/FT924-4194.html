			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: UAP to pump FFr1.4bn into bank UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's largest insurance group, yesterday provided the latest sign of the severity of the collapse of the Parisian property market when it announced a FFr1.4bn (Dollars 259m) recapitalisation for its banking unit, Banque Worms. UAP warned at the end of October that it would have to pump more than FFr1bn into the lossmaking Banque Worms, but yesterday's package was bigger than most analysts had expected. Some of the recapitalisation, to take place by the end of the year, is to cover losses on the bank's large Parisian property portfolio, for which it has had to make heavy provisions and will make more to come. The bank lost FFr179m net last year after a FFr310m provision against property risks, rising to a FFr350m net loss in the first half of this year after FFr150m of property provisions. Mr Didier Pfeiffer, UAP's managing director, warned that property provisions in the current half could rise, though analysts expect overall provisions in 1992 to be lower than last year. The fresh capital would bring the bank out of difficulty, said Mr Pfeiffer. Part of the cash would be used to set up three property and financial intermediation companies, jointly owned by Banque Worms and UAP, to encourage 'better synergy' between the insurance group and the bank, he said. The French cabinet yesterday named Mr Philippe Lagayette, 49, deputy governor of the Bank of France, as the new chairman of the Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled financial institution. The post is one of the most important in French finance because the Caisse is France's largest institutional investor. It manages the state savings system, has influential holdings in many top industrial companies and has as a result been an important player in several of France's most important takeovers. Mr Lagayette replaces Mr Robert Lion, who resigned last month on the grounds that he had always planned to leave after 10 years in the job.</p>

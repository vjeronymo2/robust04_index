			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Stream of issues lifts 1993 volume above last year's total A STREAM of new issues in the Eurobond market yesterday lifted volume this year above last year's record level. Total 1993 volume has reached Dollars 271.6bn, according to IFR Securities Data, compared with Dollars 269bn for the whole of 1992. The Kingdom of Belgium launched its widely-expected D-Mark Eurobond issue and Cheung Kong, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's Hong Kong business empire, made its Euromarket debut. Meanwhile, the World Bank was putting the finishing touches to its global dollar offering last night, in preparation for a launch at the start of trading in Tokyo. The Bank is expected to raise Dollars 1.25bn of 10-year bonds, priced to yield between 10 and 13 basis points over the yield on underlying US Treasuries. Belgium's DM1bn offering of 10-year bonds was well received, syndicate managers said. The bonds were priced to yield 16 basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent Bund due 2003, the lower end of the indicated range. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was unchanged. Lead manager Morgan Stanley said Belgium's offering provided fresh liquidity at the long end of the D-Mark sector. Other 10-year Eurobond issues launched earlier in the year have risen well above par, which makes investors less inclined to trade in them. The Belgian finance ministry said the 10-year maturity was chosen to tap demand for longer-dated paper as well as to lengthen the maturity profile of Belgium's foreign debt. Belgium is scheduled to launch a dollar-denominated Eurobond issue in the next month and may tap the Swiss franc sector early in 1994. The other significant deal of the day was Cheung Kong's Dollars 500m five-year issue, the first straight Eurobond by a Hong Kong corporate. Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the offering established a benchmark for other Hong Kong companies wishing to raise funds internationally. 'Cheung Kong's issue opens up a whole new market,' it said. The fact that investors were willing to buy the issue despite its maturity in 1998, one year after the UK is due to hand Hong Kong back to China, bodes well for future issues by Hong Kong borrowers, it added. Demand for Cheung Kong's bonds was such that they are likely to be priced to yield 82 or 83 basis points above the 4 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 1998, at the lower end of the indicated range. The issue is due to be priced today. The aim of the issue is to expand Cheung Kong's investor base and to raise its profile internationally. Cheung Kong does not have a rating at present and any rating would be limited by Hong Kong's sovereign ceiling of A by Standard &amp; Poor's and A3 by Moody's. Late in the day, Citibank led a Dollars 300m seven-year Eurobond for Telefonica de Argentina. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 8 3/8 per cent, were priced to yield 348 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 2000. Venezuela is expected to tap the Eurodollar sector in the next few weeks with a Dollars 300m two-year offering. The issue, via Goldman Sachs, is expected to be priced to yield between 250 and 300 basis points over the yield on US Treasuries. Another late-comer was France Telecom, which raised SFr300m through an offering of six-year bonds. Lead manager Swiss Bank Corp said the issue would refinance two Swiss franc deals which are due to mature in October. It added that the coupon of 4 1/8 per cent was the lowest for a straight bond since 1988. Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank gave a significant boost to the Matador market, Spain's domestic bond market for foreign borrowers, with its Pta40bn three-year offering, the largest Matador to date. An official at the lead manager Banco Central Hispano said that the bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points below the yield on the underlying Spanish government bonds, a more generous margin than investors had been expecting. In the sterling domestic market, Halifax Building Society raised Pounds 100m through an issue of permanent interest bearing shares (PIBS). The issue was priced to yield 150 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent UK government bond. Spreads on PIBS have tightened substantially in recent months, reflecting strong demand from investors for high-yielding instruments. The National Bank of Slovakia yesterday raised Dollars 240m through its first bond placement. The fixed-rate issue, in two tranches with maturities of five and seven years, was privately placed with institutions in Europe and Asia.</p>

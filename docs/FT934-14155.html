			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Bonn savings face cities with 'financial disaster' MORE than 1,000 mayors, lord mayors and council leaders from towns and cities throughout Germany descended on Bonn yesterday to protest at government savings plans, which they claim are driving them to financial disaster. They warned of drastic cuts in spending on libraries, youth and sports clubs and theatres, which German citizens have come to take for granted. The representatives of more than 7,000 towns and cities, with a combined population of more than 50m, called on the government to rethink its plans for cuts in social spending, which will transfer costs of up to DM6bn (Pounds 2.4bn) a year by 1996 on to local budgets. Mr Norbert Burger, lord mayor of Cologne, and president of the standing conference of German municipal authorities, charged the government with precipitating the 'financial collapse' of many towns and cities. Plans to cut unemployment pay and reduce the duration of benefits would inevitably force more people on to the basic provisions of social assistance, paid for by the local councils, he said. The only way to finance this would be by cuts in all other municipal services. He accused Chancellor Helmut Kohl of refusing to listen to their plight, in spite of repeated efforts to seek a compromise. 'It is our duty to tell you loudly and clearly: this is not the way to behave, Mr Chancellor,' Mr Burger declared to a storm of applause. Mr Kohl was seeking to involve city councils in special programmes to counter violence and racism among young people, while was forcing councils to lower spending on youth clubs and culture, he said. At the heart of the spending crisis is the simultaneous pressure of rising unemployment and the switch of public spending priorities from western Germany to the new states in the east. From the government's side, there was barely a sign of movement. Mr Horst Waffenschmidt, state secretary in the interior ministry, was adamant that all must cut back in the current spending squeeze.</p>

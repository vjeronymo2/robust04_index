			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Moscow] </F>   [Text] Russia is not obligated to promptly assist North  Korea pursuant to its treaty of military alliance with North  Korea even if a military dispute occurs on the Korean peninsula,  a senior Russian Government official said.    Valentin Moiseyev, chief of the Korean division of the  Foreign Ministry's First Asian Department, interviewed by  ITAR-TASS today, said this adding that Russia has already  modified the interpretation of the clause on automatic military  intervention, which is the key clause of the DPRK-Soviet Treaty  on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance signed in 1961.    He explained that Russia conveyed its position on the  modification of the automatic military intervention clause to  Pyongyang about a year ago through a diplomatic channel.    Moiseyev noted that although Russia, which succeeded the  Soviet Union, admits that the treaty is still valid, a different  interpretation has to be made as to the automatic military  intervention clause under the present circumstances.</p>

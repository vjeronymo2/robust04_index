Correa said: "The president was encouraged to adopt a  Fujimori-style solution." The minister did not quote names but  journalist Carlos Chagas, who hosts the program, recalled that  in those days Senator Pedro Simon made some remarkable  statements, like when he said that President Itamar Franco was  even willing to resign in the name of democracy. Chagas now  interprets this statement as the result of the spirit generated  by the pressures on the president.    The coup possibility revealed by Correa becomes more  believable if we add to it the rumors of a possible break of the  institutional order that circulated at the time. A  well-informed source close to the military chiefs told JORNAL DO  BRASIL at the time that the three military ministers told the  president: "In face of the political crisis and the latent  conflict among national government branches, they were willing  to offer a support base to allow him to govern."    Correa last night confirmed: "The coup did not take place  only because President Itamar did not want it." Correa said the  coupists believed the atmosphere for a Fujimori-style solution  was created by the first charges of corruption against the  budget committee, the high inflation rate, and the  dissatisfaction of the military men with their low salaries.  Correa said: "The public would not complain about a coup  against corruption charges and high inflation." The minister  said that this solution, however, "was never considered by  Itamar."</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government tries to reassure passengers THE government yesterday attempted to reassure passengers that the so-called network benefits of a single national railway would not be lost as a result of fragmentation by franchising. The national timetable would be preserved, it said. So would through-ticketing, making it possible to book tickets from principal stations in one franchise area to stations in other franchise areas. However, this would not be possible for all journeys, such as those commencing at unmanned stations. Railcards giving discounts to disabled people would be continued as a special concession. The Department of Transport offered no guarantees on the continuation of other benefits such as bargain fares. But Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said it would be in the commercial interests of private sector train operators to get more passengers on to the railways by offering attractive fares.</p>

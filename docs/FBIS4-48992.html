			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Francis Deron: "Statement </F> by Taiwanese Foreign Minister--Taiwan Unruffled by French  Reconciliation With Beijing"]    [Text] Taipei--One would have expected more bitterness from  Taiwan following Paris' recent political turnabout with respect  to China and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's trip to Beijing.  After all, when General de Gaulle had the French Embassy in  China transferred to the mainland in 1964, it was Taipei that  severed relations.    How things change! While Taipei still claims, as does  Beijing, that it is the "only legitimate government" of the  whole Chinese territory, pragmatism prevails in the capital of  the non-Communist island, whose government is urging France to  remain "realistic." In essence, the Taiwanese regime wants to  put an end to the Manichean tradition of many Western countries,  which in their relations with the Chinese world tend to choose  either for Taiwan or for mainland China .    Such is the underlying message of the statements to LE MONDE  by Taiwanese Foreign Minister Frederick Chien, who appeared  surprisingly serene following the first concerns after the  normalization of Franco-Chinese relations. "The aim of the  (French) prime minister's visit (to mainland China) was not to  damage relations between France and Taiwan. Accordingly, I  think that we shall maintain the same relationship as we did  before Mr. Balladur's trip," he said.    However, Taiwanese feelings were hurt by two aspects of  France's new policy. First, in its 12 January joint communique  with Beijing, France acknowledged for the first time the PRC  point of view that Taiwan "is an integral part of China." The  joint communique of 1964 on the establishment of diplomatic  relations between Paris and Beijing had been more restrained,  leaving Communist China free to interpret it the way it saw fit,  but expressing no agreement on the part of France. Only in a  recent text -- of a purely technical nature, since it referred  to air connections between France and the two rival Chinese  capitals -- has France acknowledged Beijing's position.  <H5>  Intertwined </H5>   "While there is only one China," Mr. Chien notes, "it is  unfortunately divided into two political entities. The PRC  rules over the whole mainland territory, and the Chinese  Republic rules over Taiwan as well as the Quemoy, Pescadores,  and Matzu islands. These are the jurisdictional boundaries of  the two entities. We sincerely hope that France will be  realistic enough to accept this fact: The PRC's claim of  sovereignty (over Taiwan) is not based on today's de facto  situation." Besides, he adds, this has been going on for 45  years: "You may have a visa for mainland China, but you will  not have any use for it here!"    Another cause for disappointment for the Taiwanese has been  the return of the notion--expressed by, among others, [French]  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe before Mr. Balladur's visit to  mainland China -- that the Taiwanese market (20 million people)  is a tiny one compared to that of the mainland (1.15 billion  people). "Look at per-capita income figures: $350 on the  mainland, compared with $10,000 here. The PRC is not as large a  market as Mr. Juppe seems to think it is."    Mr. Chien does not mention what many French businessmen and  economic experts have been anticipating: Ultimately, unless  tensions between Taiwan and the mainland become worse than what  they currently are, Taiwanese entrepreneurs and financiers will  play a key role in many industrialization projects on the  mainland. They think that this at least is a trend that can no  longer be ignored, since the two economies have become so  intertwined that 30-year-old views of the two-headed Chinese  world have become anachronistic.    This is a fact that should be taken into account during the  upcoming visits to the two Chinas of [French] Foreign Trade and  Industry Minister Gerard Longuet: One to Beijing, where he has  promised to head an industrial mission, and one to Taipei, where  he is to inaugurate a French industrial high-technology  exhibition in July. Seeing how the Chinese police went about  harassing people during Mr. Balladur's trip to the mainland, the  true magnitude of the "Chinese challenge" is becoming apparent  for French exports to both Chinas.</p>

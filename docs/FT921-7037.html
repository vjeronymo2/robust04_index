			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Sao Paulo brokerages may be sued THE Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) plans to bring administrative charges against two brokerages suspected of price manipulation, according to Mr Alvaro August Vidigal, Bovespa president, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo. If a Bovespa administrative council rules that the two brokerages, Banco Garantia and Talarico, are guilty, they could be fined and suspended from operating in the market for up to 90 days, Mr Vidigal said. 'We already have enough evidence that these two firms attempted to manipulate the market.' Mr Vidigal said the exchange would be in charge of the administrative prosecution, but if the brokerages were found guilty the case could be passed to police for criminal prosecution. 'If the fraud is confirmed, we will also take the case to the CVM (the Brazilian Securities Exchange Commission) and to the Public Ministry,' Mr Vidigal said. If the case were to reach the Public Ministry, directors and traders from the companies involved might be criminally prosecuted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Government Deputy </F> Chairman Yu.F. Yarov by Ivan Ivanyuk under the "Interlocutor for  Today" rubric; place, date not given: "Petty Economies in  Maintaining the Army Are Impermissible"]    [Text] [Ivanyuk] For many years social policy in our  country was built around the paternalist principle -- the  state's "fatherly" concern for its citizens. What approaches  are being established now and how can they be realized?    [Yarov] If by paternalism you mean ostentatious  "philanthropy" for the sake of creating an illusion of concern  for the interests of working people, then I cannot agree that  our state feigned concern for its citizens. Our social  achievements since 1917 have been widely recognized, and they  can hardly be underrated now. It is quite another matter that  these achievements were founded on a certain impersonality.    Today, however, the character of social policy is radically  changing; it is now increasingly oriented toward assisting  specific people, those who really do need assistance. And  believe me, this is a very complex task, much more complex than  lavishing care on absolutely everyone.    The main ways of reforming the economy and making social  transformations are determined by the Russian Federation  Government's program "The Development of Reforms and the  Stabilization of the Russian Economy," the implementation of  which was begun last year and is scheduled to run through 1995.    According to a forecast by the Russian Ministry of  Economics,  these social policy measures will stabilize the standard of  living of the bulk of the population by the end of 1994.  Citizens' income will increase 310 percent, including an  increase in nominal wages, pensions, benefits, and grants of 340  percent. Although the budget resources allocated for 1994 can  only ensure the minimum social guarantees for Russian citizens.    [Ivanyuk] What priorities has the government specified in  the social sphere for servicemen and members of their families?    [Yarov] Bearing in mind the limited possibilities of a  newspaper interview, I will only dwell on the main points.  First and foremost, we have finished formulating the legal  basis of social protection for servicemen and persons discharged  from military service within the framework of implementing the  Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen." The  formulation and implementation of a blueprint for targeted  social support for servicemen who find themselves in the most  unfortunate situations is extremely urgent: We are talking  about servicemen who are without an apartment, who have been  discharged without a civilian profession, who are performing  their service in military conflict zones and distant garrisons,  and who have been forced to redeploy to garrisons that have not  been fully prepared. Moreover, we intend to ratify a list of  minimum social conditions without which it is forbidden to  implement measures to cut back and redeploy troops.    Also on the agenda is the introduction of a system of  measures to ensure active enlistment of nonbudgetary resources,  land and other potential resources, real estate belonging to  military subunits and formations scheduled for cutbacks, and  also citizens' private resources in order to resolve the housing  problems being experienced by servicemen. Let me mention  another topical problem -- the conclusion of interstate  agreements ensuring civilized living conditions and legal  guarantees for former servicemen in CIS countries.    [Ivanyuk] The government believes that the country should  not be turned into one big social security department, we need  to create incentives to earn money. But servicemen cannot do  this and most of them believe that the state is failing to  compensate them adequately for the expenses of their nomadic  lifestyle and the lack of housing, nor is it providing them with  the opportunity to find jobs for their wives or a normal  education for their children, and so forth. What do you think?  And what is to be done with the law "On the Status of  Servicemen," half of which does not work?    [Yarov] Of course, the government's position on this  question cannot be applied to servicemen by virtue of the  specific nature of their activity. The Russian Government  believes that the social protection of servicemen and members of  their families is a task for the state. The program of priority  state measures to strengthen social protection of Russian  Federation servicemen, persons discharged from military service,  and members of their families in conditions of economic and  military reform and the list of state measures to implement the  Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen" are geared  toward this task and have been adopted because of it.    The following state programs have been ratified: To provide  housing from 1993 through 1995 to servicemen, persons discharged  from military service, internal affairs organs staff, and  members of their families; and to withdraw Russian forces from  the territory of other states and subsequently provide them with  housing and facilities.    As regards the second part of your question, I must remind  you that the law "On the Status of Servicemen" is the first  legislative act to establish a system of fundamental rights and  social guarantees for servicemen and persons discharged from  military service. It was enthusiastically adopted although it  was elaborated in special conditions when experience of the  systematic solution of this problem had not yet been built up  and confrontation between the legislative and executive branches  could already be felt, and also the state's economic potential  was not forecast, which meant that a number of benefits could  not be delivered. In some cases the text of the law did not  specify the sources of financing. The legislators also made  flagrant errors. For example, the law affects compensation to  servicemen for expenditure incurred on treatment at sanatoriums  and health resorts. The benefit introduced by the law has made  the previous situation even worse (25 percent of servicemen's  travel costs are paid, and 50 percent of their family's).    Nevertheless, during 1993 the government adopted 11 decrees  designed to implement the law. Among the issues resolved was  the the question you yourself raised about finding jobs for  servicemen's wives. This has been resolved by the Russian  Government's decrees No. 1215 and 1217 dated 22 November 1993.    At the present time the government is working on five  elaborated draft decrees, the adoption of which will bring us  close to implementing the law in full (on the procedure for  introducing benefits in respect of payments for apartments,  municipal services, and apartment telephones, travel on public  transport, insuring the property of servicemen serving in  "trouble spots," and providing financial assistance for  individual and cooperative housing construction). A total of 10  draft decrees are in the final stage of coordination. In order  to implement a whole series of other benefits, the government  must obtain from the legislators a law on amending and adding to  10 legislative acts in connection with the adoption of the law  "On the Status of Servicemen." The State Duma is planning to  examine this draft law in the near future.    [Ivanyuk] Last year considerable funds were earmarked for  local organs of power for the construction of housing for  servicemen released into the reserve, but a considerable  proportion of these funds did not reach their destination. Will  the picture not be repeated this year?    [Yarov] I should like, in answering this question, first of  all to try to remove the prejudice with regard to local organs  of power. The majority cannot be accused of squandering the  funds allocated for the construction of housing for those  released from military service. The problem is far more  complex. And its roots lie primarily in the country's economic  potential.    Although complaints could be leveled against some of them  for  their inability to deal with the funds they have received and  sometimes, why hide it, the desire to resolve problems of the  development of mains utility networks and the urban  infrastructure using some of the appropriations received from  the federal coffers for the construction of housing for those  released from military service. The money would seem to have  gone nowhere except into construction but at the same time the  number of commissioned apartments can only be expressed in  symbolic figures. Thus, under equal conditions, in 1993 the  Sverdlovsk Oblast Administration managed to ensure the  commissioning of 71 percent of the planned level of housing, the  St. Petersburg Administration 69 percent, the Tomsk and Kemerovo  Oblast Administrations 63 percent, and the Tyumen Oblast and  Moscow City Administrations 60 percent. At the same time in  Novgorod and Amur Oblasts only 2 percent of the apartments  planned for the year were constructed while in Pskov, Astrakhan,  and Kostroma Oblasts the figure was 5 percent, in Tver and  Kaliningrad Oblasts and Maritime Kray the figure was 6 percent,  and in Leningrad Oblast 9 percent.    This year the question of providing housing for this  category  of citizens will be no easier to resolve. At the same time  there are no grounds for pessimism. Effective steps are being  taken to ensure the rhythmical nature of financing and the  implementation of regional programs. The ministries and  departments involved have now submitted to the government a  draft decree on the procedure for rendering free financial aid  to servicemen and citizens released from military service who  have joined housing construction cooperatives and are  constructing individual houses.    As for the Federation components, we intend to build  relations with them according to the following scheme: When you  have received money from the federal budget for the construction  of housing for those released from military service, you must be  responsible for this money in terms of erecting the maximum  number of apartments.    [Ivanyuk] The basic guidelines of social policy for this  year provide for the elaboration and implementation of  comprehensive regional programs for the close accommodation of  and rational provision of jobs for servicemen. Yet plans of  this kind existed last year and the year before that.... Is all  this not Utopian? You familiarized yourself with the experience  of the social adaptation of former servicemen when you were in  St. Petersburg. How do you assess it?    [Yarov] No, it is no Utopia. After all, today the regions  have acquired the opportunity to elaborate their own programs  and to attract for their implementation both the funds earmarked  by the budget and other nontraditional sources of finance and to  use all available reserves and conditions. This became possible  after the Russian Federation president signed the 24 December  1993 edict no. 2281 "On the Elaboration and Introduction of  Nonbudget Forms of Investment in the Housing Sphere," which  provided the opportunity for the active implementation of these  programs.    If we are speaking of the regional program for Leningrad  Oblast, then it is still too early to assess the real successes  here. I have had occasion to criticize them more than praise  them.    [Ivanyuk] What do the Armed Forces mean for you personally?  To judge by the consistency with which you investigate  servicemen's problems this is connected not only with the fact  that you are leader of the interdepartmental commission for the  social questions of servicemen and members of their families.  Are you personally also not indifferent to their problems?    [Yarov] It has so happened that in my work I have had to  collaborate a lot with the military and to visit military units  and ships. So I know of the Armed Forces' problems at first  hand. They existed in the past, and they exist now. And they  must be resolved, and as soon as possible. The people who have  devoted their lives to serving Russia and who perform the tasks  set them under very hard conditions, often risking their lives,  must feel the state's special concern and attention for them and  their families. The petty saving of money on the maintenance of  the servicemen could weaken Russian statehood and result in the  collapse of the army and far greater expenditure on its  restoration. You obviously agree with me that it is simply  intolerable to be indifferent toward such issues.</p>

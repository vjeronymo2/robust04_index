The minister did not elaborate. However, an official Jordanian  source said that four of the arrested people are charged with  last Thursday's blast in Amman and that the other three are  suspected of having a connecttion with the bomb attack in  al-Zarqa yesterday.    The source said that those arrested belong to groups of  returnees from Afghanistan, adding that the explosive material,  Acetone Peroxide, was used in both blasts but said that the  explosives were prepared in a very crude manner which means that  the group did not have enough experience in such explosions.

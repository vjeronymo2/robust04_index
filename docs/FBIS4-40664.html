			<p>BFN     [Text] A first ever kurultay [meeting] was held by the  working aksakals [veterans] of the town of Naryn and Naryn Rayon  and was held in the oblast center. The problem of setting up a  new administrative territory was discussed. This new territory  is expected to comprise the town of Naryn and the former  Tian-Shan Rayon. It was noted that decisive measures are being  taken in order to implement the presidential edicts on  extraordinary measures to strengthen the state financial  discipline, and on measures to deepen the land and agrarian  reform in Kyrgyzstan. Every peasant association has set up  rural committees, the activity of which is targeted at  improvement of the economic and social situation of people.    The participants adopted an appeal of the kurultay to Prime  Minister Dzhumagulov that says that with the transition to a  market economy, a good prerequisite has emerged that will  strengthen the unity and solidarity of the Kyrgyz people in the  spirit of the best traditions of our ancestors. The people  understand the great economic and political significance of  merging the town and rayon, the appeal says. By merging,  artificial barriers are removed between the city and village.  It is easier to process agricultural raw materials directly,  without any red tape; and to fully use industrial enterprises  reserves and labor resources of the agrarian sector. The  participants in the kurultay assured the head of the government  that all grounds exist for improving the economic and social  situation in Naryn.</p>

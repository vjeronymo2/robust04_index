			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Digital to lose 3,700 employees DIGITAL Equipment said that 3,700 employees in the US, including seven of the company's vice-presidents, would leave the company under an early retirement programme that began in March. Digital has been trying to cut its payroll for two years in the face of losses and declining sales. It had about 119,500 employees when the retirement scheme was announced in early March, against a peak of 126,000 at the end of 1989. The response to the early retirement programme has been stronger than expected. Digital offered retirement incentives to 7,200 US employees over the age of 50, expecting about one-third to accept. Further job cuts are expected. For the first three quarters of fiscal 1992, Digital reported net losses of Dollars 403.9m, including charges, on sales of Dollars 10bn. It expects an additional charge, perhaps as high as Dollars 1bn, in the current fourth quarter. Digital said seven corporate officers would take early retirement. They include Mr George Chamberlain, vice-president, marketing finance; Mr Henry Crouse, vice-president, strategic relations, and former president of the Open Software Foundation; Mr James Cudmore, vice-president, operations staff; Mr William Heffner, vice-president, image, voice and video products; Mr Robert Hughes, vice-president, US sales; Mr Albert Mullin, Jr., vice-president, corporate relations; and Mr Richard Yen, vice-president, Far East manufacturing.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Observer: Mainz and men The awful truth is slowly starting to dawn in Germany that perhaps Frankfurt may not be a foregone conclusion for the site of the future European central bank. The bank's forerunner, the European Monetary Institute, is supposed to be up and running by January 1 next year, and still no one can agree where it should be. It is not that anyone gives credence to British micawberish optimism that London still somehow has a chance of hosting the institution itself. It is merely that the British resistance to Frankfurt, as the rival financial centre to London, appears to have gained support in Paris. Step foward the good citizens of Mainz. Barely a stone's throw further from Frankfurt airport than the German Bundesbank itself, just across the river Rhine, Mainz believes it can offer almost all the advantages of its neighbour, without the disadvantage of the name. It can even offer a central bank building with vacant possession: the former headquarters of the state central bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate, now amalgamated with that of neighbouring Saarland. It has high-level support in Paris, according to French officials in Bonn for the recent visit of Edouard Balladur. After all, Mayence is more than a little French; Napoleon made it his military headquarters for one campaign, and more recently, it was in the French occupation zone of Germany after the second world war. Yet the British remain hostile. For them, Mainz is far too close to Frankfurt for comfort. 'You can almost see the top of the Bundesbank from Mainz cathedral,' one Whitehall official remarked grimly yesterday.</p>

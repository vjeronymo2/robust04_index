Sale of AHP-Assisted Rental Housing Project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.16(d) of the proposed rule provides that in the event that the owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing project sells the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental units, or portion thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application, and the purchaser does not agree to maintain the project according to such commitments and to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that applied to the seller, then:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the Bank shall require the seller to repay a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> share, except for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> amounts, of the grant received by such seller, reduced for every year the seller owned the unit, to be repaid from any net gain from the sale of the project after deduction for sales expenses, and to be returned to the Bank, except that the Bank in its discretion may waive such requirement if the imposition of such requirement will cause undue hardship on the seller, as defined by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant and the applicant provided a below market rate loan to the seller, then the applicant shall either repay the advance to the Bank or the Bank shall convert the advance to a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize the advance shall be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> L. AHP Applications Involving Loan Funds and Loan Consortia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.17 of the proposed rule sets forth specific requirements governing the use of loans and grants received by loan funds and loan consortia pursuant to the AHP. The Board's existing AHP regulation does not address specifically the use of loans or grants by loan funds or loan consortia pursuant to the AHP. See 12 CFR part 960. However, the Board has adopted policy guidelines for the Banks governing the award of subsidized advances and direct subsidies to applicants that then make loans or grants to loan funds and loan consortia (policy guidelines). See Board Resolution No. 93&hyph;54, June 23, 1993. The provisions in &sect;960.17 of the proposed rule, if adopted in final form by the Board, would incorporate the policy guidelines, with some modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides generally that an applicant may use a subsidized advance or a direct subsidy to make a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan consortium. Section 960.17(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that AHP applications involving the use of loans or grants by loan funds or loan consortia are governed by the provisions of part 960, except as provided in &sect;960.17 of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(b) of the proposed rule provides that the requirements for approval of an AHP application that proposes to use subsidized advances or direct subsidies to make a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan consortium are the same as the requirements for approval applicable to all other AHP applications under &sect;960.8 of the proposed rule, except that an AHP application that involves a loan fund or loan consortium will be scored on the criteria that the loan fund or loan consortium proposes to use to select projects that will ultimately receive a loan or grant from the loan fund or loan consortium that is subsidized by the AHP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision is intended to address the fact that loan funds and loan consortia do not have specific proposed projects in place at the time they apply for funds under the AHP. Section 960.17(b)(1) of the proposed rule therefore requires the Banks to score AHP applications involving loan funds or loan consortia based on the criteria that the loan fund or loan consortium commits to use when selecting the projects it will fund. This provision carries forward a requirement of the Board's existing policy guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, &sect;960.17(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall review and shall require the applicant to review each new rental housing project funded by a loan fund or loan consortium prior to disbursing a loan or grant to ensure that the project meets the threshold requirements of &sect;960.9 of the proposed rule and the project selection criteria committed to in the approved AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is a change from the provision in the Board's existing policy guidelines that requires the Bank and the applicant to review both rental and owner-occupied housing projects prior to funding by a loan fund or loan consortium under the AHP. This change is intended to eliminate duplicative review of loan fund or loan consortium activities where funds are used to finance owner-occupied housing units under the AHP. However, since rental housing projects are more complex than owner-occupied housing projects, the Board believes that the applicant and the Bank should continue to review each rental housing project funded by a loan fund or loan consortium prior to disbursement of any funds to ensure that the project meets the feasibility, maximum subsidy, and other threshold requirements of &sect;960.9 of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(c)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the requirement in the Board's existing policy guidelines that if an applicant receives a subsidized advance and uses the proceeds of the advance to make a loan to a loan fund or loan consortium, the total value of the interest rate subsidy must be passed on to the borrower of the funds. Thus, &sect;960.17(c)(1) provides that a loan fund or loan consortium shall extend credit to the borrower at a rate of interest equal to the rate of interest charged on the subsidized advance plus a reasonable interest rate spread approved by the Bank. The applicant and the loan fund or loan consortium may determine between themselves what proportion of the interest rate spread the applicant and the loan fund or loan consortium will share.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(c)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that a loan fund or loan consortium that receives a grant from an applicant pursuant to the AHP must either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

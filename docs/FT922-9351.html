			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Laying cable was never so easy Installing or moving video-based applications like dealer board systems in financial services companies is prohibitively expensive. Now Amulet, an Exeter-based company, has developed an adapter which allows video systems to be run over high-quality telephone cable. Under a marketing agreement with Amulet the new system is available from Case Cabling, a subsidiary of network specialists Dowty Communications. The video adapter requires no external power supply and simply plugs into the video monitors at one end. The system provides a brighter and sharper picture than the traditional triax cable over long distances. The cost savings lie in the initial installation and in the reduced price of subsequent moves or changes. Alterations to the system are a matter of 'plug and patch', completed in minutes without skilled staff or any cable laying. Case Cabling: UK, 0628 810818.</p>

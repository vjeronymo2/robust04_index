			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TINY ISLAND OF MALTA CELEBRATES 25 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE, CONFIDENT OF ITS  FUTURE  </P> <P> Twenty-five years ago many people doubted that a small Mediterranean island  with no raw materials could survive on its own after 160 years as a British  colony.  </P> <P> But Malta this month celebrates the Sept. 21, 1964, anniversary of its  independence, confident of its economic future and determined never again to  serve as a base for a foreign power.  </P> <P> The 122-square mile island that was once Britain's main fortress in the  Mediterranean is today constitutionally committed never to join NATO or the  Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> Doubts over Malta's economic viability have faded. Tourism and textiles are  thriving industries and the accent is now on developing electronics and light  engineering.  </P> <P> Malta is striving to establish itself as an off-shore financial center and is  developing a container depot and free port to meet the challenge of the single  European market in 1992.  </P> <P> In a delicate political balancing act, nonaligned Malta is cultivating closer  ties with the West and the European Community while maintaining good relations  with the Soviet Union and Libya, its nearest neighbor.  </P> <P> The opposition Maltese Labor Party, which says real freedom only came when the  last British servicemen left the island on March 31, 1979, is boycotting the  celebrations.  </P> <P> It maintains the independence Malta was given in 1964 was a sham because key  areas such as the ports, the only airport, telecommunications and broadcasting  remained in British hands.  </P> <P> The Labor Party's Dom Mintoff, in fact, prolonged the British presence in Malta  by seven years by agreeing to lease the base facilities.  </P> <P> But since then both the ruling Nationalist Party of Prime Minister Eddie Fenech  Adami and the Labor Party, in a rare show of agreement, have vowed that Malta  will never again serve as a foreign military base.  </P> <P> The Nationalists have promised to take Malta into the EC when conditions are  right, and Fenech Adami has been to the United States and Britain in search of  closer ties and economic help.  </P> <P> The relationship with the United States has not so far delivered the results  that many had hoped for, possibly because the Americans are not convinced that  things have changed all that much since the days under the Labor Party when  Malta had an extremely close relationship with Libya.  </P> <P> While declaring that Malta will never allow itself to be dominated by any one  country or bloc, Fenech Adami has neither broken nor scaled down relations  established by the Labor government with Libya, 200 miles to the south, other  Arab countries and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Relations with Libya, a good trading partner for Malta and a high investor on  the island, remain excellent. But gone are the days when ties with Libya were  so close that Arabic was a necessary requirement for university entry and many  a Libyan might have felt Malta was an offshore post of his own country.  </P> <P> Malta faced an uphill task when the British left. It had to find new jobs for  the thousands of people who worked for the British forces. It chose the textile  industry and tourism and had to start from scratch in both.  </P> <P> Textiles absorbed surplus unskilled labor, and joint ventures with foreign  firms later provided management expertise and ready export markets for Maltese  goods.  </P> <P> Junior Industry Minister John Dalli has traveled extensively in an effort to  attract industrial investment, particularly from Japan and the United States.  </P> <P> A free port and container depot under construction at Marsaxlokk, southwest of  Valletta, is designed to re-export third-country goods to Europe, particularly  after the 1992 EC single market.  </P> <P> Tourism remains one of the main sources of foreign revenue. Earnings in 1988  totaled more than $290 million and Malta hopes to host a record 800,000  visitors -- nearly three times its population -- by the end of the year.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Milan, March 30 (AFP) -- Media magnate Silvio  Berlusconi, the main victor in Italy's legislative elections,  has offered to sell one of his television networks to ease  opposition to his forming a new government.    Berlusconi has said he wants to become prime minister  following the landslide election victory Monday [28 March] of  the rightwing alliance led by his Forza Italia party.    But a key coalition partner, Umberto Bossi of the Northern  League, has objected that Berlusconi's vast financial and media  holdings made him unsuited to lead a government.    Questioned during a television interview late Tuesday about  Bossi's remarks, Berlusconi replied, "If I could find someone  ready to buy, I could give up one of my television stations."    Burlusconi's huge conglomerate, Fininvest, owns three  national television networks as well as other media,  telecommunications, property and distribution holdings.    He also said he was willing to sell other unidentified  "companies" in the Fininvest group.    When he entered the political campaign last January,  Berlusconi handed the presidency of Fininvest over to an  associate.    The right-wing coalition that won a majority in Italy's  latest election comprises Berlusconi's Forza Italy party, the  federalist Northern League and the neo-facist party National  Alliance.</p>

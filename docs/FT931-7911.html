			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Economics Notebook: Steady nerves needed in Spain There is near panic in Spain's ruling socialist party and government over the dire state of the economy and the government's own polls suggesting it might even be defeated if an election were held this week. Fortunately for the socialists, an election can wait until the end of November. But Spain went into recession in the last quarter of 1992 and the mood of the country has taken a turn for the worse in the last month. The government is being paralysed by cabinet divisions, with ministers urging prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez to ignore finance minister Mr Carlos Solchaga and relax fiscal policy. Worse, relations between Mr Gonzalez and the left-wing deputy party leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra have become even more strained than usual. Momentarily at least, Spain is rudderless and drifting. Last Friday's regular cabinet meeting ended without its equally regular press conference. Earlier, after the official statistics institute reported unemployment had risen to an historic 3.04m in 1992, the government added to the air of unreality by driving up interest rates in secondary markets to defend the peseta from some relatively mild speculation. 'Defending' the strongest currency in the EMS may have been consistent with the government's commitment to exchange rate stability and a strong peseta (to attract foreign currency to its debt auctions). But with bankruptcies at record levels and the jobs created in the 1986-1989 boom fast disappearing, posturing for foreign bond dealers did not, perhaps, strike quite the note the country was looking for in the wake of the unemployment figures. The Spanish business community has deserted the Gonzalez administration en bloc, furious about the party forcing a watered-down strike law through parliament last week. Opposition from Mr Solchaga, who wanted a tougher bill, was simply ignored in yet another demonstration that when push comes to shove on domestic issues, it is Mr Guerra and the party who rule. This crunch - recession and election - was bound to catch the socialists sometime. Spain's core problem is its Dollars 200bn-plus (Pounds 140bn-plus) public debt and the price it pays - high interest rates - to persuade foreigners to finance it. If it cuts rates faster than the Bundesbank, it cannot sell its debt. But unless it does, the recession will probably deepen. One way out would be a third devaluation in a year but this would signal panic to the markets and cause great anguish in neighbouring Portugal. A second way out, unspoken even a year ago but broadly canvassed now in business and, more timorously, in cabinet, is to pull the peseta out of the exchange rate mechanism and allow the currency to float. Downwards, inevitably. But this government would not be able to do that. It has staked everything on being a loyal player in the EC and it has, anyway, no way out of the debt trap. The Spanish public purse pays about 15m people - pensioners, the unemployed and a massive civil service - and any serious threat to any of those sectors would unquestionably cost the socialists the election. Thus interest rates will have to stay relatively high (13 per cent against headline inflation of around 5 per cent) at least until financing for the year is complete and to keep pressure on employers until the spring wage round is over. There are already worrying signs that settlements are averaging 8 per cent or more. Faced with all this, Mr Gonzalez has to decide when to hold his election and, then, how to win it. He first needs to repair the rift with Mr Guerra. Mr Gonzalez is considering running the socialist campaign himself but he has never run an election and Mr Guerra has put him in office three times in a row. This cannot be the end. They have fallen apart over policy before and they are doing so again, but neither is suicidal. Second, he needs some policies that do not upset the peseta - perhaps the removal of or a cut in a business tax, a public works programme and a possible labour reform that would end obligatory and expensive government arbitrage in large-scale redundancy programmes. That may or may not be enough but the socialists have time to fine-tune and to steady themselves. Certainly, the victory rolls already being drummed out in the opposition press seem absurdly premature. Their economic platform - outlined earlier this month - is an opportunistic mix of unspecified tax cuts and privatisations and an uncosted promise to create jobs at the expense of cutting inflation. But Mr Solchaga's orthodoxy may pay off. Inflation is already falling and slowly creating room for interest rate cuts later and the gut feelings of many in business that the recession will be deep and long remain just gut feelings. Who knows? The worst of this could just as easily be over by September.</p>

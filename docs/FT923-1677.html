			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Sears The volume of red ink which has flowed from Fosters is reason enough for Sears to dispose of the business. Menswear retailing is having an awful time and Fosters was ill-placed to compete, even in good market conditions. Still, the exit price is high. Sears must write off Pounds 42m of goodwill through the profit and loss account, which had been previously charged to reserves. Then there are Pounds 40m of other extraordinary losses associated with the withdrawal, including Pounds 5.3m of trading losses since May. Whatever one thinks of the zealous way Sears has thrown everything into the extraordinary line, at least the pain is now visible. There is also relief that under Mr Liam Strong's management deep-seated problems are at last being tackled. Next week Sears is expected to announce further provisions against the British Shoe Corporation along with its interim results. This again raises the question of whether the company will maintain its dividend. It may be argued this would be inappropriate when the payout is uncovered. However, Sears' balance sheet is strong. Cutting the dividend could send the wrong message to the market when the company's fortunes are near their nadir - a point with which other managements may have to grapple in a post-ERM world. On top of that the management is in a ticklish position. If they provide for a clean-out and then cut the dividend, a falling share price may just tempt in a predator.</p>

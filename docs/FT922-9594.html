			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: TJ Hughes heads for USM TJ HUGHES, the Liverpool-based discount retailer founded in 1912, aims to lure investors with a homespun philosophy of value for money as it prepares to join the USM next Tuesday. The group - which operates a chain of 11 stores selling a wide range of both branded and generic clothing, household goods and toiletries at low prices - yesterday announced plans to raise Pounds 8m via a placing of 11m shares at 75p. Hughes is expected to be valued at about Pounds 15.2m when the total of 20.2m shares begin trading. Mr Gurth Hoyer Millar, chairman, said the company was stopping off on the USM, en route to its goal of a full listing in 1993. The proceeds of the USM placing would be used to pay off Pounds 3.4m in debt and to reduce the holding of LET, the international property and development division of SPP, the Swedish mutual life company. The flotation was partly prompted by the demands of Swedish law, which restrict the scope of investments held by insurance companies. As a result, LET will receive about Pounds 4m from Hughes in return for preference and ordinary shares, leaving the investment group with a holding of 45 per cent. This stake would be subject to review, and possibly further reduced, at the end of June 1993, Mr Millar said. The management and staff of the company would hold a further 7 to 8 per cent, including options, after the flotation. Profits for the year to January 25 were up 35 per cent at Pounds 1.1m on sales 39 per cent higher at Pounds 28.4m.</p>

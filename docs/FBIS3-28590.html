			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned on 1 February that the government  has formulated a draft action program for government procurement  in response to foreign criticism that Japan's current procedures  for the government procurement lack transparency. The draft  action program calls for: 1) making it a principle for the  government to procure goods through open competitive contracts;  2) lowering the size of government procurement subject to public  announcement from the current amount of 1 million SDRs (the  IMF's special drawing right and approximately 162 million yen)  to 0.8 million SDRs (approximately 130 million yen) and  expanding opportunities for foreign firms to obtain information  on the government procurement; and 3) making all goods subject  to the current complaint-addressing procedure in order for  foreign companies to file their complaints with the government  about its procurement.    The government, which will formally decide on the draft  action program at a cabinet meeting on 4 February, plans to  brief the U.S. side on the draft action program at the  Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February. Both Japan and the  United States have been locked in a sharp confrontation in their  negotiations on the government procurement under the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks. The government intends to break the  deadlock in the negotiations by describing the action program as  a "declaration of the Japanese market opening in the government  procurement sector," (says a Foreign Ministry source).    The draft action program calls for making it a principle for  the government to procure goods through open competitive  contracts which allow foreign firms to bid for contracts out of  consideration to U.S. complaint that "Japan's free (individual)  contracts shut foreign firms out of biddings for the contracts."  The draft action program explicitly calls for cutting the number  of free contracts that are concluded between the government and  the government- designated individual enterprise. The draft  action program also calls for the need to raise the transparency  in the government procurement by announcing the government's  procurement plans beforehand in the Official Gazette even if the  government inevitably concludes free contracts.    In the government procurement of computers in which the U.S.  companies are greatly interested, the draft action program calls  for adopting a general assessment formula under which the  performance of computers is assessed as a criteria for  procurement judgment in addition to the current tender formula  under which contracts go to under-bidders [saiteikakaku  rakusatsuhoshiki].    As for large-scale government procurement, the government  has  made public its plans for the procurement of goods worth more  than 1 million SDRs once in January every year since 1991, but  the draft action program calls for holding down the amount to  more than 0.8 million SDRs. For foreign firms which are eager to  bid for contracts but have no detailed knowledge of the  government procurement, this step will promote their market  access by helping them gain more and quick information on the  government procurement.    As part of freedom of information efforts, the government  intends to increase the transparency of its procurement by  releasing an annual report (white paper) on the government  procurement.    In addition, the government plans to expand the application  of the current procedure to address foreign complaints about the  government procurement of computers to all other goods. As part  of steps to prevent a recurrence of bid riggings, the government  plans to ask the Fair Trade Commission to set a guideline on  biddings for the government procurement and deal sternly with  illegal practices.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Two-way market in Tokyo outlook Once again, Japan dominated the FT-Actuaries World Indices last week, taking the World Index to a gain of 1.1 per cent in local currency terms in spite of flat performances from the US, and Europe. Declining corporate profits, low economic growth, and political scandals have put the health of the recent Tokyo rally in question. It has been suggested that the gains, owing much to the performance of NTT, the partly state-owned telecommunications stock, have been engineered to get Japan's financial institutions comfortably through the closing of their books on March 31. However, Mr Nicholas Knight, the Nomura strategist who called the turn of the Tokyo market last year, thinks that the market is more strongly based than that. He says that institutions are turning their attention to next year and that, after a drop in domestic interest rates, equities are much more attractive. Investors are beginning to expect a massive reflation of the Japanese economy, with a fiscal package of Y14,000bn now on the cards. Mr Knight says that there is growing evidence that the bad corporate news has been priced into the market, and that institutions are beginning to look beyond that to prospective recovery. The Japanese, now, are much more receptive to talk of corporate restructuring than they used to be; and, finally, foreigners are losing their conviction that big short positions in Tokyo equities will pay off from next April onwards. Ireland put up the biggest gain of the week and, indeed, of the year so far. Dealers at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin say that the country's inclusion from May 1 in Morgan Stanley's world index series has helped; talk of an outside buyer in the Greencore privatisation has moved on to Irish Life; and the steady reduction in domestic interest rates continued with another cut last Friday.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     % change   % change             % change in local currency*            sterling* in US Dlrs*            -------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of   Start of   Start of                                              1993       1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -1.44     +1.18   -17.31      +6.34      +6.51      +4.79 Belgium       +1.72     +5.82    +6.30     +13.77     +14.26     +12.41 Denmark       -1.19     -2.29   -17.11      +7.96      +9.52      +7.75 Finland       -0.16     +8.31   +23.37     +21.93      +9.12      +7.37 France        -0.01     +1.74    +2.68      +7.52      +8.45      +6.69 Germany       -0.94     +1.45    -4.14     +10.91     +11.81     +10.00 Ireland       +7.06    +16.97    +5.74     +23.61     +15.12     +13.25 Italy         -4.07     -1.31    +2.81     +13.90      +8.02      +6.27 Netherlands   +1.51     +5.02    +9.64     +11.50     +12.38     +10.56 Norway        +2.39     +9.21    -3.68     +12.76     +14.46     +12.60 Spain         -0.34     +0.67    -7.16     +11.26     +10.97      +9.18 Sweden        -0.77     +0.45    +9.34      +6.02      -0.92      -2.52 Switzerland   +2.39     +3.43   +17.62      +5.89      +4.46      +2.77 UK            -0.17     +2.25   +18.86      +3.02      +3.02      +1.35 EUROPE        -0.08     +2.21    +8.92      +6.86      +6.49      +4.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +0.79     +5.70    +5.22      +8.27     +14.55     +12.69 Hong Kong     -1.58     -1.47   +17.44      +9.89     +11.85     +10.04 Japan         +4.26     +8.97    -1.03      +7.83     +18.07     +16.16 Malaysia      -0.27     +2.21   +15.77      +5.60      +8.23      +6.48 New Zealand   +0.71     +2.47    +7.61      +5.66     +11.45      +9.65 Singapore     +1.33     +0.37    +6.17      +3.52      +5.12      +3.43  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +1.30     +4.36    -0.02      +5.91      +9.81      +8.03 USA           -0.08     +3.62    +9.66      +3.11      +4.81      +3.11 Mexico        -0.14     +5.80    -4.79      -6.26      -4.60      -6.14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +2.63     +2.19    -3.05      +9.42     +17.45     +15.54  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +1.12     +4.62    +6.03      +5.55      +8.98      +7.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on March 19th 1993.

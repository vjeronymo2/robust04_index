			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In many places in Israel  there were demonstrations yesterday to protest the murder of  Tzipora Sason. Our military affairs correspondent Karmela  Menashe reports that the security forces are continuing the  manhunt in search of the murderers, but so far without any  results. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will beef up its  presence in the Trans-Samaria highway and adjacent areas. A  senior military source told our correspondent that over the last  few months security presence has been increased along the  Trans-Samaria highway, but there are dozens of Arab villages on  both sides of the road, and this makes it hard to prevent  attacks.    Some 25-28 wanted men from the rejectionist front  organizations and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are active  In Judaea and Samaria, as well as three 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  squads.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that the Palestinian  detainees who participated in terror attacks will not be  released. He emphasized that first the problem of the Israeli  MIA's must be solved, as well as that of the inhabitants of the  territories who have aided Israel -- only then will Israel  discuss the release of the Palestinian detainees.    Over the last few days the Palestinian representatives  negotiating with Israel have said that unless it is ensured that  all the Palestinian detainees are released, they will not sign  the full agreement with Israel.</p>

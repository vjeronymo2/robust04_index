			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES SITING SETS IN STATE OF WASHINGTON  </P> <P> When Steven Spielberg brought his movie production company to the small eastern  Washington towns of Sprague and Moses Lake for the filming of "Always," he had  planned to stay less than a week.  </P> <P> But after seeing the diversity of the landscape and the possibilities for the  film, he wound up staying 20 days.  </P> <P> The story of Spielberg's discovery of Washington is becoming a common one, and  Hollywood moguls, television crews and producers of commercials are turning the  state into one of the most popular spots in the country for filming.  </P> <P> "If you look back at the state's history, there were some years when there was  a lot (of film production) going on," said Lynn Murphy, assistant manager in  the state's Department of Trade and Economic Development's Film &amp; Video  Office. "But our reputation as a film center has really grown in the past three  or four years."  </P> <P> The Film &amp; Video Office recently released statistics showing a dramatic  jump in the money spent by out-of-state production companies.  </P> <P> In 1985 a total of $5.5 million in direct spending was generated by  out-of-state film companies. A spate of commercials boosted that number to $12  million -- a 118% increase -- in 1986. In 1987 and 1988 the total grew to $14  million and $16.9 million respectively, and last year production companies  spent $20.2 million.  </P> <P> Feature films such as "Always" brought the most income to the state in 1989,  with producers spending $10.8 million. Direct spending by commercial production  companies was $7.6 million, while documentary, industrial, television and other  projects brought in $1.6 million.  </P> <P> In-state production companies have also grown significantly, contributing $33.7  million last year to the state economy, a 48% increase over 1988's spending.  </P> <P> In all, last year there were 14 feature films and television movies made in the  state; 27 video and television episodes; more than 80 commercials; and about 37  industrial videos, documentaries and other projects.  </P> <P> "We don't have any hard numbers right now, but I am confident we are in the top  10 production states based on the number of film days and the dollars spent on  production," Murphy said.  </P> <P> In-state companies obviously know what the state has to offer, but what is the  attraction for out-of-state producers?  </P> <P> Murphy said one big plus is the availability of experienced crew staffers --  such as gaffers, camera people, special effects and wardrobe experts.  </P> <P> "That means producers don't have to bring in a lot of people and pay for their  housing and per diem expenses, so they can really keep their production costs  down," she said.  </P> <P> Just as important, however, is the combination of terrain that offers virtually  any kind of landscape needed -- from seascapes to mountains to deserts, from  small farm communities to All-American suburbs to sprawling urban areas.  </P> <P> "In the past when you said Washington state people thought just of forests. But  they're finding there's a lot more," Murphy said.  </P> <P> " 'I Love You to Death' needed a Pennsylvania coal mining town, and it was  filmed in Tacoma. 'The Fabulous Baker Boys' wanted seedy night spots, so we  found them in downtown Seattle. 'The Hunt for Red October' was filmed in Port  Angeles, Bremerton and around Puget Sound -- they needed a lot of water.  </P> <P> " 'War of the Roses' wanted a New England setting but didn't want to go to New  England, so we took them to Coupeville," Murphy said. "We do New England very  well."  </P></p>

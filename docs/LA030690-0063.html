			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> KILBEY TAKES ON T. REX IN SOLO ACOUSTIC SHOW  </P> <P> "I hate to see something like that beat me," said the Church's lead singer and  songwriter Steve Kilbey, just before he gave up trying to remember the start of  an old T. Rex song during his solo acoustic performance on Sunday at Club  Lingerie. It was just one of many little gaffes (forgotten words and chords,  etc.) in the 80-minute set, but it was just the perfect sort of thing for an  easygoing evening in the club's new, relaxed Sunday acoustic format (tables on  the dance floor and everything!).  </P> <P> Kilbey pretty much played whatever he or the audience wanted -- he managed that  T. Rex song later and did two others as well -- and to heck with the  formalities. Throughout, the puckish Aussie was charming and disarming, in  contrast to his band-mate Marty Willson-Piper, who was often pensive and  melancholy in his recent solo show at Bogart's Bohemian Cafe.  </P> <P> Not that Kilbey doesn't offer his share of melancholy. As a songwriter, it's  his stock-in-trade. But there's a gauzy wistfulness to his style and voice that  translated quite well to the acoustic context, where he drew on the Church  repertoire and selections from his solo albums, as well as the T. Rex numbers  and a gorgeously sad version of Lou Reed's "Caroline Says."STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

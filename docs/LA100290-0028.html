			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TIGHTER PLAN SOUGHT FOR VENTURA BLVD.;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: COUNCILMAN WOO WANTS THE CITY TO BE ABLE TO STOP OR DOWNSIZE  PROJECTS ALONG THE CORRIDOR THAT THREATEN TO CLOG SPECIFIC INTERSECTIONS.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo told leaders of homeowner groups Monday  that he wants to tighten up the Ventura Boulevard specific plan to halt  development at the boulevard's most traffic-choked intersections.  </P> <P> Woo warned, however, that any far-reaching changes in the plan as it now stands  might increase the difficulty of passing the changes.  </P> <P> Woo, who represents portions of Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks and Studio  City, is one of three members of the council's Planning and Land Use Management  Committee, which is scheduled to review the plan today.  </P> <P> The plan, which has been under study for five years, is designed to limit  future commercial development along the Ventura Boulevard corridor from  Cahuenga Pass to Woodland Hills, often called the Valley's Main Street.  </P> <P> Woo and his staff said they want to determine if the city's Department of  Transportation is empowered -- or can be empowered by the Ventura plan -- to  stop or downsize a particular development along the boulevard when it threatens  to create unmanageable traffic.  </P> <P> "My intention is to ask the city attorney's office if we can stop development  at 'F level' intersections, or what additional mitigation measures we can get,"  Woo told a dozen leaders of homeowner groups from Sherman Oaks, Encino,  Tarzana, Woodland Hills and Studio City. Intersections are designated "F level"  by city traffic engineers when they produce traffic jams large enough to spill  over and clog neighboring intersections.  </P> <P> As proposed, the Ventura Boulevard plan does not provide a specific mechanism  to slow or stop development at particular intersections.  </P> <P> The plan would permit 8.6 million square feet of additional commercial  development, increasing by 44% the 19 million square feet that exists now and  generating 30,000 more auto trips on the boulevard during the peak afternoon  rush hour, bringing the total to 100,000.  </P> <P> Under the plan, commercial property developers would pay hefty fees to the city  that would be used to finance a nearly $200-million remake of the boulevard to  cope with the load, ranging from widening the street to installing left-turn  lanes.  </P> <P> But Woo also said he did not want to jeopardize a speedy enactment of the  complicated specific plan by proposing major reforms that would require more  study and possibly more votes to approve.  </P> <P> Woo also said he will consider introducing a separate 90-day moratorium on  Ventura Boulevard development, to take effect after enactment of the specific  plan, to give city officials time to acquaint themselves with the plan's  intricacies so they do not mistakenly approve projects not permitted by it.  </P> <P> "Unless we have some moratorium in place," Woo said, "we'll have all those  projects rushing ahead, trying to beat the city's ability to implement the  plan."  </P> <P> A moratorium "would send out a really tough message," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, leaders of Encino and Sherman Oaks homeowner groups said they wanted  to strengthen the height restrictions of the proposed plan, ban temporary  advertising signs and make it more difficult to close alleys.  </P> <P> But Woo warned them that altering the plan too much might trigger a provision  of city law requiring that the plan be approved by 10 votes in the City Council  instead of the normal eight-vote majority.  </P> <P> If the city's planning director declares that the planning committee has  recommended a plan significantly different from what the Planning Commission  approved, he may disapprove it -- a move that would require 10 council votes to  override.  </P></p>

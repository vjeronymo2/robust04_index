			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Mohamed Farah Aidid, chairman of the Somali  National Alliance [SNA] and the United Somali Congress [USC],  met a U.S. delegation in Nairobi recently led by Robert Oakley,  U.S. special envoy to Somalia. The two sides discussed many  issues affecting the situation in Somalia and how to find a just  solution to them.    Speaking on the occasion, Mohamed Farah Aidid referred to  the  problems brought upon the Somali people by the UN Operation in  Somalia [UNOSOM]. He said there is a need to create another  agency which will perform humanitarian work, given the fact that  UNOSOM-II has lost the Somali people's confidence. Chairman  Aidid added that fighting would not break out in Somalia when  the foreign troops leave. He stressed that all the foreign  troops should withdraw from Somalia since they are not required  at the moment.    Speaking on the reconciliation efforts, Aidid said the SNA  is  still having talks and consultations with other parties in light  of the failed consultations in Addis Ababa. He said the Addis  Ababa consultation meeting collapsed because of UNOSOM-II,  foreign interference, and because of a few individuals serving  their colonial masters.    On the subject of peace, the chairman said the American  troops have deliberately massacred 78 Somalis since the  cease-fire was declared. The chairman warned the foreign troops  concerning the continued massacres and violation of the  cease-fire.    Robert Oakley spoke about the importance for the Somali  people of working for peace among themselves and embarking on  the reconstruction of the country. He made it clear that  UNOSOM-II's responsibility is to assist the Somali people,  adding that his government will not give preferential support to  one region of the country over another when it comes to  reconstruction and development. Mr. Oakley said that America  will provide millions of dollars for the country's  reconstruction and rehabilitation if a stable political  situation is reached.    The talks took place in an atmosphere of understanding.  [passage omitted]</p>

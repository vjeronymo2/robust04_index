			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Investors 'misled about forecasts' THE FORMER chairman of Harland Simon, the electronics company, had no knowledge that the company's profit forecasts would be revised downwards soon after he allegedly spoke to two institutional investors about its likely results, he told Aylesbury Crown Court yesterday. Mr Roy Ashman is alleged, at a meeting last February, to have told Mr Nigel Savage and Mr Marc Gordon - two managers of Govett Strategic Investment - that he was comfortable with initial forecasts for Harland's pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m to Pounds 14m. The two fund managers bought 155,000 shares worth almost Pounds 1m in the group just hours before the profits forecast was reduced to Pounds 4m and the share price fell from 585p to 270p. The company eventually reported a pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 6m. Mr Ashman denies making a misleading statement contrary to section 47 of the Financial Services Act 1986. Mr Colin Nicholls QC, cross-examining, said the company had known by January that year that the original profit forecast could not be met and that something in the region of Pounds 6m was a more correct figure. Mr Ashman replied: 'No one mentioned to me that the figure would be Pounds 6m.' He denied saying anything to indicate Harland's profits would be in line with the original forecasts. At the meeting with the two fund managers Mr Savage had led the discussion and asked 'questions he should not have been asking', Mr Ashman told the court. The trial continues.</p>

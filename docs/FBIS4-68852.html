			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Myroslav Levytskyy under the rubric "Political </F> Commentary": "Is Rukh Ridding Itself of Opposition within Its  Ranks? The Ukrainian Republican Party Is Analyzing the  Situation... The Leftists Are Making a Push To Compete in the  Presidential Election!"]    [Text] A number of political events took place in the  capital of Ukraine on the 16th and 17th April of this year.  Unquestionably, the event that attracted the most attention was  the second phase of the Fifth All-Ukrainian Rukh-Party Congress.  Of the 1,200 delegates, 826 took part in the work of the  congress. The main topic at the congress was a discussion of the  results of the parliamentary elections. In his programmatic  speech on the results and lessons of the parliamentary  elections, the leader of Rukh stressed that Rukh won the  elections despite the fact that only some seven percent of its  candidates won seats. He admitted that this number was lower  than anticipated, but blamed the conservative nature of the law,  the actions of governing structures, irregularities in the  counting of votes, and the ambitions of Rukh's partners in the  democratic camp for the outcome. Levko Lukyanenko and the  democratic Ukraine bloc he heads were the targets of especially  harsh criticism in V. Chornovil's speech and in the speeches of  many of his supporters. There were the customary harsh attacks  on the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP]. The second target of  criticism was the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN].    This criticism often went beyond the bounds of propriety.  People's Deputy of Ukraine Bohdan Boyko, the Ternopil Oblast  chairman of Rukh, is particularly adept at this kind of attack.  The language of his speech was more reminiscent of the old  meeting bully than that of a civilized parliamentarian. These  days, fewer people by far are impressed by the antilogical  bullying that was customary at our meetings. In contrast to  earlier years, populism no longer elicits ovations. The accents  are slowly changing. Much more likely to be applauded are  attempts to assess what has been accomplished and one's place in  the scheme of things.    Serhiy Odarych, a member of the Rukh Leadership, and  People's  Deputy of Ukraine Yevhen Zhovtyak from Kiev Oblast tried to do  just that. Zhovtyak, in particular, underscored the need to rise  above party egotism because the good of Ukraine must come before  the party. He said that for Rukh, which aspires to be the leader  of the people, winning seven percent of the seats in parliament  is not a victory but a crushing defeat. The blame for this does  not lie with the government, the URP, or the KUN, but with the  party's style and system of work. In the opinion of the speaker,  the party apparatus needs to be revitalized. The personal  ambitions of Rukh's leaders at the rayon level were another  reason for the party's defeat. Instead of searching out  exceptional individuals from the democratic camp as a whole,  automatic support was given to the rayon leaders.    Serhiy Odarych is also inclined to regard the elections as a  defeat. Only five of the 21 oblast chairmen won seats. For our  part, we should add that most of Rukh's elected deputies are  people who came into parliament in 1990. Serhiy Odarych pointed  out a number of things that the party leadership had failed to  do, and he urged Rukh to take the initiative in forming an  alliance of national-democratic forces to create a single  democratic organization.    Following these two fundamentally divergent speeches, V.  Chornovil ordered that a special, closed meeting of the Small  Council of Rukh be convened.    Meanwhile, the congress returned to its normal course of  analyzing the election results and denying the notion of a  defeat. A statement was adopted in which the reasons for the  results of the election were analyzed. The results were deemed  satisfactory. Criticism was levelled against the Ukraine  Alliance. Rukh's regional organizations were instructed to begin  preparations for elections to the local councils and the  leadership of Rukh to begin preparing for the additional  parliamentary elections, to initiate the creation of a bloc of  democratic forces within the democratic corps of deputies, and  to hold a meeting of the representatives of the  national-democratic forces.    But why not rely on already existing structures -- the  Congress of National-Democratic Forces [KNDS] and the Ukraine  Democratic Alliance? Apparently the stereotype of support for  the mythical "party of power" poses an obstacle. There is also  another reason, which I will discuss later.    A meeting of parties and organizations that comprise the  Ukraine Democratic Alliance was held on 14 April. This meeting  was also attended by Leonid (Les) Tanyuk, a member of the  Central Leadership of Rukh. The meeting resolved to extend its  participants' best wishes to the Rukh congress and to take the  initiative in calling for expanded cooperation. This mission was  assigned to Levko Lukyanenko.    To everybody's astonishment, the chairman of the Ukraine  Democratic Alliance was not among the guests who spoke at the  [Rukh] congress. In answer to my question, V. Chornovil replied  that he did not know why Lukyanenko had not appeared.  Invitations had supposedly been sent to everybody. It turns out  that some were "forgotten." Lukyanenko's was one of these. This  way the idea concerning the need to unify the [country's]  democratic forces can be represented as coming from one side  only. However, one can see with the naked eye that all of this  is merely a subtle ploy in the struggle for absolute leadership.    How then is this unity to be achieved? This question arises  at all the crossroads of the political process. What we are  seeing today is a very complex phenomenon -- the further along  we move in the process of establishing a multiparty system, the  more Bolshevism we encounter.    Vyacheslav Chornovil no longer denies that Rukh is a party.  It was precisely for the purpose of establishing this status and  strengthening organizational discipline that a number of changes  were made in Rukh's charter. In the Rukh leader's view, the  election results would have been much more modest had they not  decided in March of 1992 to rebuild Rukh structurally and  conceptually into a party.    The second day of the Rukh congress was devoted to issues  pertaining to changing the charter and forming the leadership.    The election of the new leadership of Rukh provoked a great  deal of emotion. V. Chornovil, whose powers as chairman were  extended by the congress back in December 1993, proposed  electing the leadership by voting for a full slate of nominees.  He nominated Oles Lavrynovych for the office of deputy chairman  of Rukh. Mykhaylo Boychyshyn was proposed for another of the  deputy chairman slots and for head of the secretariat. As his  other two deputies, V. Chornovil chose Olena Bondarenko, a  journalist from Luhansk, and Professor Robert Kartashov, a  Russian.    The congress participants demanded that the party leaders be  voted for individually and not as a full slate. For some reason,  this greatly angered the leader of Rukh, who argued that he had  to work with these people. The quarrel about the way in which  the vote should be held lasted much longer than the voting for  individual candidates. It is difficult to explain this  resentment of a dissenting position in light of the fact that at  the stage of the formation of the national-democratic forces, V.  Chornovil constantly used the tactic of taking an opposite and  separate stand. Moreover, as the congress participants elected  the nominated individuals without any problems.    Passions really flared in the process of forming the Central  Leadership. Once again, a list of candidates was proposed. Those  present expressed their surprise that it did not include  Professor Chernyak and the lawyer Holovatyy. The chairman of  Rukh explained that S. Holovatyy had not taken part in the work  of the Central Leadership since last year and that Professor  Chernyak had chosen to run in the elections in a district that  had not been approved by the leadership.    Holovatyy, a member of the Central Leadership of Rukh for  whom V. Chornovil had fought a bitter battle at the Fourth  All-Ukrainian Congress, took part in the Fifth Congress as a  guest. He expressed his resentment on this account in his  speech. He rejected all accusations that he had failed to do his  job in the Central Leadership and, instead, called the work of  the Rukh leadership immoral.    Inasmuch as all this results from internal animosities, I  have no desire to enter into the real gist of this conflict, but  it was precisely of immorality that the congress delegates  accused S. Holovatyy. V. Chervoniy, the chairman of the Rivne  organization of Rukh, added oil to the fire in the debate  surrounding the president of the Ukrainian Legal Foundation by  bringing up S. Holovatyy's writings against the Kiev  Patriarchate. This ultimately tipped the scales. With 273 votes  cast against him, S. Holovatyy did not make it into the Central  Leadership. An experienced strategist, V. Chornovil immediately  announced that he was prepared to forgive Holovatyy's apostasy  if the latter promised to submission inside the Rukh faction.  But submissiveness and S. Holovatyy are two incompatible  concepts.    Also missing from the list of individuals elected to the  Central Leadership was S. Holovatyy's colleague, Valeriy  Ivasyuk, on whose behalf V. Chornovil also waged a passionate  battle in 1992.    Under pressure from the delegates, Professor Chernyak was  included in the list of members of the Central Leadership of  Rukh, but he was elected only conditionally.    As I followed the progress of the congress, it struck me  that  the much publicized leader of the opposition is skillfully  ridding himself of opposition in his own party. Can it be that  the opposition fears opposition? That is how I posed the issue  at the press conference. V. Chornovil stated that this was my  own subjective understanding of the situation. The incident  involving Holovatyy was not grounds for such a conclusion.    Perhaps, but I see this as a much broader problem that goes  beyond a simple party incident. After analyzing all the nuances  of Holovatyy's ouster and taking into consideration his  personality, I believe that this step will have a negative  effect on the process of establishing the Ukrainian multiparty  system. Holovatyy will set about ruthlessly discrediting V.  Chornovil as a politician at all levels, and this will lead to a  conflict of generations that will not be confined to the bosom  of the Rukh party. The beginnings of such a conflict were  evident at the Rukh forum. As a result, I fully agree with the  warnings expressed by Yuriy Badzyo in his thoughts against the  current, "Let Us Not Commit Suicide in Vain!"    Just as at the Rukh congress, passions ran high at the  meeting of the URP leadership held on 16 April. However, these  passions were aimed in a different direction. Levko Lukyanenko,  the chairman of the Ukraine Democratic Alliance and honorary  head of the URP, argued in favor of opposing the party of power.  Other URP politicians and activists tried to analyze the  situation. Questions were posed: where did they fail and why,  with whom did they fail to agree and why? They primarily blamed  themselves. The chairman of the URP stressed that the party  cannot be a serious entity if it follows the tide rather than  forming the political climate. Owing to objective and subjective  circumstances, the URP was unable to create the climate needed  to win, and therefore only seven percent of the candidates it  fielded won seats in parliament.    The leadership of the URP approached with restraint the idea  of unifying political forces that had been expressed at the Rukh  forum. Mykhaylo Horyn believes that the times are such that  there is a real need for an alliance of ideologically close  political structures. However, if there is a continued attempt  to substitute Bolshevik-style annexation for unification, this  issue will remain deadlocked.    He also rejected the thesis posed by V. Chornovil at the  Rukh  congress that there can be no room for many kindred political  forces in the same political niche. In M. Horyn's opinion, the  niche is so large and there is so much work to be done that it  is wrong to take this stand.    The URP came up with the initiative to create a coalition of  democratically oriented parties whose factions are represented  in parliament. In addition to political parties, the coalition  can include public organizations that are also represented in  parliament. The goal of the coalition is to unite the patriotic  forces in parliament so that they can coordinate their  activities in lawmaking, statebuilding, forming the government,  and passing the most important decisions affecting the state.  The head of the coalition will be put forward for the post of  prime minister.    This initiative largely corresponds to that put forward by  UKRAYINSKE SLOVO and the Olzhych Fund to create an anti-Kuchma  front. It is onsonant with many of the voices heard at the Fifth  All-Ukrainian Congress of Rukh.    Apparently the leadership of Rukh views this issue  differently. V. Chornovil is convinced that all the democratic  forces, with the exception of Rukh, lost the elections and  therefore the individual deputies will be forced to place  themselves under his wing.    Apart from the factor of pure ambition -- the monopoly on  patriotism --which causes serious concern among nationally  conscious journalists, this serves as dynamite for  confrontation. Serhiy Holovatyy has already announced that he  will form a faction parallel to Chornovil's.    One of today's key issues is the presidential election set  for 26 June. This matter was widely discussed both at the Rukh  congress and among the leaders of the URP. Participants in both  events urged that their parties not take part in this  undertaking. As a last resort, they will support an acceptable  candidate for the office of president. At the same time, they  stressed that the greatest threat to Ukraine is the  Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Reform Bloc, which speculates on  pro-Russian sentiments and proclaims slogans that do not serve  the national interests of Ukraine. It is therefore essential to  concentrate all efforts on neutralizing this bloc. This struggle  will prove less effective, because the corps of directors are  more flexible than the orthodox Reds.    It is no secret that Kuchma is the leading claimant to the  presidential chair. As he announced at his press conference, he  will try to win over even the rightist radicals (Khmara and the  Ukrainian National Self-Defense Force [UNSO]) if their economic  concepts coincide. In addition to Kuchma, O. Moroz, the leader  of the Socialists, is also a candidate for the office. As the  Central Election Commission has reported, the intention to put  forward candidates has been announced by the Communists, the  Civic Congress of Ukraine [GKU], the Labor Congress, the  Christian-Democratic Party of Ukraine [KhDPU], and the DSU  [State Independence of Ukraine]. Thus, only the vociferous  radical structures are announcing their intention to join in the  presidential race. However, in view of the fact that 6 May is  the deadline for collecting signatures, it is difficult to  imagine that many candidates will manage to collect the  necessary number of signatures in time. It is quite possible  that the presidential epic may end with the collection of  signatures. Then the date of the election will automatically be  postponed. For some reason, Ivan Plyushch, the speaker of the  old parliament, takes an overly calm and optimistic approach to  this.    Ukraine could be considered to have gained if only two  candidates remain on the ballot, because this would mean a  contest to the end. But this would be a very costly game. It may  well be that the leftists want to exhaust Ukraine with this game  and thus produce tension and increase regional polarization.  After all, none of them has a chance to win the presidential  chair at this time. Yet each of them can serve as Ukraine's  "Trojan horse."    Given the situation, the desire of the radicals from the DSU  to play at the presidency in the select company of the leftist  radicals and the chauvinists from the GKU is a complete puzzle!</p>

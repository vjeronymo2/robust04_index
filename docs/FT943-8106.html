			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Sharp boost in Indian foreign investment Direct foreign investment in India has risen rapidly, with the government approving more than 2,100 foreign investment proposals, worth Rs156.2bn (Dollars 4.98bn) between August 1991 and June 1994, the Ministry of Industry said yesterday. Inflows in the first half of 1994 reached Rs11.3bn, compared with Rs17.86bn for the whole of 1993 and Rs6.75bn in 1992. The 1994 invest-ments included Rs9.32bn under schemes to attract investment from non-resident Indians. In all, foreign direct investment in the four years to June 1994 stood at Rs39.43bn, the ministry reported, compared with Rs3.51bn in 1991, the year India began its liberalisation programme. Some 80 per cent of investment approvals have been in high-priority industrial sectors. They include power and fuels at Rs47.33bn; the metallurgical industry at Rs15.03bn; services at Rs17.51bn; food processing at Rs14.14bn; electrical equipment at Rs12.25bn; chemicals, excluding fertilisers, at Rs10.95bn; tourism and hotels at Rs7.28bn; transportation, including the car industry at Rs5.39bn; and telecommunications at Rs1.89bn. 'This should allay fears among the critics of the liberalisation programme that foreign investment is only pouring into the consumer durables and luxury goods sectors,' a ministry spokesperson said. The US continues as the leading foreign investor in India, accounting for Rs58.54bn of the total approved figures in the four years to June 1994. Other leading investor nations include Switzerland at Rs11.71bn; Japan at Rs9.88bn; the UK at Rs9.45bn; Germany at Rs6.21bn; the Netherlands at Rs5.46bn; and Oman at Rs5.44bn. Approvals to non-resident Indians totalled Rs16.58bn.</p>

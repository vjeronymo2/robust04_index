			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Another head rolls in VW group THE head of sales and distribution at Audi, the Volkswagen group's luxury car division, has left the company after less than a year. Mr Eckart Ramthun, recently hired from Daimler-Benz, left 'by mutual agreement', Audi said. However, he appeared to be the latest victim of relentless pressure within the group for a rapid return to profit. Audi, formerly run by Mr Ferdinand Piech until he was installed as group chairman in January, is believed to be heading for a substantial loss this year. Its sales in western Europe slumped 26 per cent between January and the end of September, compared with falls of less than 20 per cent for Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The overall car market is down around 16 per cent, while total VW group deliveries have dropped 22 per cent. Mr Ramthun was brought in by Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, a former regional sales executive for Mercedes, who was chosen by Mr Piech as his successor at the group's hitherto most successful subsidiary. Mr Ramthun's departure follows the recent resignation of Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, chairman of the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat, amid an internal storm over looming Seat losses of DM1.25bn (Pounds 508m) this year.</p>

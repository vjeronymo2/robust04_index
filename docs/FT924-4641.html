			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big aluminium and nickel output cuts announced SUBSTANTIAL production cuts were announced yesterday by Pechiney, Europe's biggest aluminium producer, and Falconbridge, the second-largest nickel group outside the former Soviet Union. Traders said this caused some chaotic conditions in the London Metal Exchange's nickel market. Prices rose very strongly last week, by Dollars 600 a tonne to touch a peak of Dollars 6,100, and this attracted some determined selling yesterday. Falconbridge's announcement caused prices to fluctuate in a wide, Dollars 265 a tonne, range at one stage but the downward pressure was relentless and in after-hours dealing nickel was quoted at Dollars 5,812.50 a tonne, down Dollars 257.50. Aluminium was boosted to a nine-week LME peak of Dollars 1.334 a tonne by Pechiney's announcement but the price later fell back to close at Dollars 1,221.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2 on the day. Pechiney said it would close permanently its high-cost, 31,000-tonnes-a-year smelter at Venthon in the south of France. It also will reduce the operating rate of other smelters - at Flessinque in the Netherlands and Auzat, Lannemezan and Saint-Jean in France - to 80 per cent of capacity which means temporarily cutting annual output by 79,000 tonnes. Pechiney's workforce of 3,954 will be cut by 337. The group has an annual primary aluminium capacity of about 1m tonnes. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, pointed out that this would take total annual aluminium capacity cuts announced by the industry since June last year to 1.07m tonnes but new capacity had come into operation and the western industry was heading for record output of more than 15m tonnes this year. Falconbridge, which is jointly owned by Noranda of Canada and Trelleborg of Sweden, cited weak prices, high stocks, increasing costs and a poor market outlook for its decision to cut 200 jobs at its Sudbury division in Canada and 4,000 tonnes of nickel output next year by temporary shutdowns at Sudbury and the Nikkelverk refinery in Norway. This is on top of cuts of 7,000 tonnes announced last month. The company's Dominican Republic operations will also shut for three months next year, resulting in another 7,700-tonnes cut in output. Falconbridge said in total it was removing 18,700 tonnes of nickel from the market in 1993. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the commodity broker, suggested Falconbridge's cuts were larger than expected and helped to justify last week's rally. However, Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, thought the market would once again see these producer cuts as 'too little, too late'.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Markets: Equities are bowled over by Gooch - London THERE IS one explanation for the behaviour of the equity market this week - it has been tracking the performance of the England cricket team touring India. After a downcast start - when England, already two down in the series lost the third and final test - shares ended the week in much brighter mood. A 48-run-win in the final one-day international prompted a 39.3 point rise in the Footsie index yesterday, which ended the week at 2868.0, a gain of 28 points. Perhaps the much criticised England selectors have been guilty of the short-termism charge often aimed at fund managers - picking one day winners, rather than a side with staying power. The real reason for the market's performance, though, is that investors have spent the week focusing on the ICI announcement which was made on Thursday. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were occupied with fears that ICI would cut its dividend or launch an immediate rights issue, or both. Thursday brought relief on both counts, and the market began to rise. The rally gathered pace yesterday. Thursday's 11.7 point rise owed much to a 70 1/2 p jump in ICI's share price. But yesterday's increase, with ICI up another 55 1/2 p to 1208p, suggested buying interest was more widespread. Another feature of the market this week was that the Footsie did better than the 250 index. The second tier index includes a large chunk of recovery stocks and has greatly outperformed the Footsie since Black Wednesday last September - a day which Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's chairman, persists in calling Sunny Wednesday. A better performance by the front line stocks suggests that UK investors are turning away from recovery stocks to more mainline shares and also that overseas investors are beginning to buy the UK equity market. The big deterrent for foreign investors of late has been sterling's collapse since Sunny Wednesday. While the pound was in free fall, no non-sterling based investor would look at the UK market. But there is now the beginning of a belief that sterling - which hit another record low against the D-Mark this week - is near its bottom. If foreign investors can be confident that the pound will at least stabilise at these levels, they can start looking at yields on UK equities which are attractive compared to other equity markets, and in some cases compared to cash and bonds. ICI, to pick a stock at random, yields 6 per cent with the promise of a maintained dividend in the current year too. There is another group of investors which had been wary of buying shares but have changed their view. UK private investors are back in the market, as evidenced by unit trust sales which topped Pounds 500m net of repurchases in January. Ignoring the cynics who believe that unit trust investors always buy at the top, this could be another good sign for the market. Individuals have seen the rates they get on savings accounts shrink as base rates fall. When they can get a higher income from shares, and the chance of capital gain, they are not slow in shifting their cash. It may be clutching at straws, but a new-found interest from foreign and private investors could form the basis of another run in the equity market. While institutional investors are unlikely to sell shares, when re-investing the cash would give a poorer return, the squeeze on their liquidity was putting a damper on the market. The fears of a rights issue from ICI - which will be coming in June from the demerged Zeneca - and other rumoured cash callers has been a depressant for the market. Although shares of those companies which have staged issues have generally done well, and the take up of issues such as Burton's and Asda's has been high, the demand for new equity allied with the government's desperate need for cash to plug the gaping budget deficit has been weighing on investors' minds. At least some companies are trying more imaginative ways to raise money, and ones which could put less of a burden on the UK institutional investors. A series of bond issues, convertibles and fixed rate, have been launched. This week's crop included a convertible from BPB, the plasterboard group, which was accompanied by a forecast of a dividend cut on the ordinary shares, and a Pounds 100m bond from Royal Insurance, which also announced lower losses. A couple of large, cash takeover bids would do even more for share prices, but that may be too much to hope for. Perhaps surprisingly, the market seems less concerned about the economy than for some time. Fourth quarter gross domestic product figures on Monday, revealing a tenth quarter of recession, were shrugged off. Discussion about what the budget might bring has yet to become intense. There is just the assumption that base rates will be cut again. Even the latest job losses stories have had little effect on a market which knows that unemployment continues to rise long after a recession turns to recovery. The beginning of the company results season has so far brought few nasty surprises. Even apparently huge pre-tax losses, such as British Aerospace's Pounds 1.2bn and ICI's Pounds 384m, are being ignored. The excuse is that the introduction of new accounting rules, which make companies take all one-off losses and profits into the pre-tax figure, means that the losses are not 'real'. Equally Shell appears to have largely got away with making a Pounds 131m provision against foreign exchange losses, putting the blame firmly on the Japanese associate where the currency speculation took place. Top managers there did the decent thing. Indeed, there has been some good corporate news this week. It must be encouraging that Unilever could increase pre-tax profits 13 per cent to Pounds 2bn in spite of the recession, and that SmithKline Beecham could raise profits 11 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn. Encouraging may not be the word to apply to Amstrad's sudden return to profits. Shareholders in that company must have been more than a little surprised to see a profit and an interim dividend from the consumer electronics group. Only last December Amstrad's chairman and chief executive Alan Sugar was telling them that the outlook was so bleak they should accept his 30p a share offer. Shareholders are having to pay the Pounds 1.1m cost of defending the company from its own chairman. The shares finished the week at 27 1/2 p, up 3p.</p>

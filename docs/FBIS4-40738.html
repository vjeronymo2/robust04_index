			<p>BFN     [Text] The Public Chamber under President Yeltsin upheld  Sergey Filatov's proposal for focusing on the realization of the  civic accord agreement on June 23. Filatov is the chief of  staff under Boris Yeltsin.    The Public Chamber is to have commissions on political  stability, social and economic problems, administrative makeup  and interethnic relations, security, and science research,  education and culture.    The five commissions will be expected to supervise the  realization of the civic accord agreement and offer advice to  the conciliatory commission.    In Filatov's view, they must have a membership of twenty  nine  and bring together representatives of political movements and  parties, parliamentary factions, public organizations, labor  unions, religious communities, etc.    Arkadiy Volskiy, Mark Masarskiy, Anatoliy Dolganov, Viktor  Andreyev and Vladimir Kudriavtsev were presented as choices for  the commission's chairmen. According to Filatov, they represent  "a wide spectrum of the Russian public" because their political  affiliations as well as jobs they hold are very different.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Boost for Dublin's tax haven The European Commission has extended the deadline for projects that seek to use the tax and other incentives for setting up in the International Financial Services Centre tax haven in Dublin. The original cut-off date of the end of 1994 has been extended to the end of the century following representations from the Irish government. Dublin argued that it needed more time in order to attract enough projects for it to become self-sustaining. Offshore financial services companies that set up in Dublin by December 31 2000 will have a 10 per cent corporation tax rate until 2005 compared with the standard 40 per cent. More than 300 banks and financial services organisations have set up in Dublin since the establishment of the centre in 1987. The main areas are offshore fund management and specialised insurance.</p>

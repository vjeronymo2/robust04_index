			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Government communique] </F>   [Text] As a result of the events which occurred on the  evening of 5 January and which led to the firing of shots at  different areas in the capital, as well as the imposition of a  curfew, the government calls on the people of Lome and its  environs to remain calm and not to leave their homes. All  workers in the public and private sectors are urged not to  report to work today in order to enable the security forces, who  have routed the attackers who came from Ghana, to deal with the  situation.    It all began shortly after 1800 on 5 January, when sporadic  shots from automatic weapons were heard at the Dove of Peace  Monument, CICA-Toyota, and Tokoin-Ramco. According to a  statement issued by the national defense minister, the  attackers' aim was to surround the Togolese Inter-Arms Regiment  camp, capture the soldiers, and repeat the 25 March 1993 events.    A curfew was imposed from 1800 to 0600 in Lome municipality  and its environs, and all land borders have been closed until  further notice.</p>

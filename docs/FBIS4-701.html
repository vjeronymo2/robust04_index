			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 13 Apr (PANA) -- Economic activity has  resumed in downtown Bujumbura, the power house of the Burundian  economy, a week after the death of President Cyprien Ntaryamira  in a plane explosion near Kigali, in neighboring Rwanda.    The resumption of activity was more marked in the informal  sector where traders selling second hand clothes, drinks, and  luxury clothing from Europe, America and Asia were selling.    In the last three days, prices of beans and rice, the  country's staples, have dropped below the symbolic two hundred  francs a kilo (1 U.S. dollar; 575 Burundian francs). Prices of  these commodities had risen way above this figure after the  assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye in an attempted coup  on 21 October 1993.    Red meat is too expensive for low-wage earners. A slice of  beef steak costs up to 1,000 francs. However, fish, beans,  maize or casava (manioc) and rice are still affordable for  low-wage earners.    However, government officials said that few civil servants  are back at work. Those who are spend much of their on the  telephone enquiring about the safety of relatives and debating  political situation of the country. As a result, the speaker of  the National Assembly, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, gave a public  warning to "idle people" when he visited other parts of the  country Sunday [10 April]. "There will be no more wages for  people who do not work," he said.    The warning seems to have had its effect judging by the  resumption of activity in various sectors of production since  the beginning of the week. However, the education sector is  still paralysed. Students and teachers can still be seen  outside the Education Ministry. They are asking to be sent to  schools in the interior of the country, where they say is safer.  Private schools have never closed.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Paramount bid battle thrown open by US court verdict The Delaware supreme court threw open the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications for a fresh round of bidding last night when it ordered the creation of a level playing field between the company's rival suitors, Viacom and QVC Network. The supreme court's verdict is a victory for QVC, a television shopping channel headed by film industry figure Mr Barry Diller, which had asked the courts to remove various defences placed in the way of its offer by Paramount. The judgment also represents a significant elaboration of US takeover law. The supreme court upheld a ruling on November 24 by the Delaware chancery court, which blocked a friendly takeover of Paramount by Viacom because the Paramount board had not adequately considered a higher but hostile offer from QVC. Yesterday's ruling is expected to lead to a fresh round of bids by Viacom and QVC, with victory going to the company with the highest final offer. Viacom's current bid is worth about Dollars 9.5bn and QVC's about Dollars 10bn. Paramount said last night it would 'promptly establish procedures applicable to all bidders for an orderly and fair process'. The key question in the hearing was QVC's contention that Paramount's takeover agreement with Viacom obliged Paramount's board to seek the highest offer. Paramount argued against this on the grounds that its deal with Viacom was a 'strategic merger' offering better long-term benefits to the combined group. The supreme court, upholding the lower court ruling, said the agreement with Viacom amounted to a change of control of Paramount because the majority of voting shares in the group would be held by Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman. Control by Mr Redstone of the surviving entity would provide him with the power to break up the company or buy out minority stockholders 'irrespective of the present board's vision of a long-term strategic alliance'. In these circumstances, the Paramount board was obliged to seek the highest offer for shareholders, yet it had failed to consider properly the QVC offer. The supreme court affirmed the lower court's decision to throw out a special stock option programme, currently worth some Dollars 400m, which Paramount gave to Viacom in the original merger agreement. The court said this, and other defensive measures, were 'improperly designed to deter other potential bidders'. It let stand another agreement under which Paramount will give Viacom Dollars 100m if its bid fails. The Paramount case was the most important takeover issue to come before the court since the battle for control of publishing group Time Inc in 1989. In that case, the court ruled that Time was not obliged to accept a hostile offer from Paramount instead of a lower-priced, friendly merger with Warner Brothers which the board felt offered better long-term value. Paramount argued yesterday that the Time precedent applied to its current case. But the supreme court judgment makes clear this is not so when control of a company changes hands.</p>

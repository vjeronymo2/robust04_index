			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A survivor's guide to the recovery - The UK economy may be improving, but dangers still lurk for companies striving for growth So your business survived the recession. Now comes the tricky part, surviving the recovery. More businesses go bust as the economy starts to recover than fail during a recession. At least that was the experience in 1981-82. This time around the experience may be different. Insolvency figures show that company failures are actually falling. This may be explained by the slow pace at which the economy is improvingdespite the wave of positive economic statistics published so far in 1994. It may also be because businessmen and women took such a pounding over the last four years that they are reluctant to expand. But it is too soon to say the pattern will not be repeated. The traps of over-trading, poor cash-flow management and under-capitalisation are in position and ready to snare the unwary once the economy makes a more robust recovery. This page will return to many of these themes in greater depth in the coming months. But today it offers a quick route map around the hazards remaining for growing businesses as they emerge from the longest recession in memory. Beware over-trading 'My guess is that we will see over-trading problems emerge in the next 18 months because the recovery has not been strong enough yet to get people into trouble.'  -Nigel Males, Turnaround partner, KPMG It is a basic tenet of business that a company making an accounting profit can go bust even when sales are rising if cash flow is not enough to pay suppliers. New orders involve an increase in stocks, work-in-progress and debtors and a consequent rise in the need for working capital. Trouble looms if you are paying suppliers before you are paid by your customers. Yet a recent study by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, showed an alarming lack of understanding of how much working capital is needed to expand. Half the companies surveyed with sales of Pounds 5m to Pounds 150m, said they expected to grow by up to 15 per cent in the next two years. But only a third said they planned to raise any new money or increase their overdraft. A simple example demonstrates that such alchemy cannot work - growth is not possible without additional capital in some form. Take a typical manufacturing company with sales of Pounds 10m that plans to grow by 17.5 per cent over 18 months. Realistic expectations, but the impact on cash flow is startling. Males says that if this company had a typical manufacturing cycle and, as one would expect, had to pay its suppliers before its customers paid their bills, the company could need Pounds 250,000 in additional working capital to cover the 10 weeks before cash came in from the additional sales. As this company could well have a capital base of only Pounds 500,000, the balance sheet would clearly be put under pressure. If margins are improving, it is possible the company could generate enough cash. But others may not have this luxury. 'For companies with very rapid growth there is a problem and banks will be less keen to provide overdraft,' says Michael Queen, a director of 3i, the development capital group. One solution may be to resist jumping on the treadmill of trying to increase sales rapidly (more about this in the section on pricing). Kidsons Impey, the accountancy firm, says a preferred option might be to invest in capital equipment. This could increase profitability on existing business, which would then provide internally generated cash to finance the working capital demands of future sales growth. Either way there would be a need to raise finance. Raise capital 'Almost the defining feature of a small business is that it is undercapitalised.  -Graham Bannock, Consultant to DTI Last year saw a near record number of quoted companies raising capital through rights issues. Some were opportunistic on the back of a rising stock market. But many companies were seeking shareholder support to finance a recovery in sales or investment. The same rules apply to smaller companies. But many of the unquoted companies appear to think they can grow without extra capital. While consultants and accountants provide anecdotal evidence that banks have been more supportive during the latter stages of this recession, they say companies should be under no illusions. The banks are not necessarily going to line up to finance the next stage of growth. Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, may try to cajole banks to lend on the strength of cash-flow projections and business plans. But it is unrealistic to expect them to increase unsecured overdrafts to fund growth. 'In essence companies are asking for equity on an overdraft for a lousy return,' says Males. Bank reluctance will be greater when a company makes an urgent request for working capital - a sure sign that it has not planned the management of its growth. Companies that want to grow must therefore be prepared to raise new funds, even if this means dilution of control. 'If you have a coherent plan and a well managed management team there is no shortage of finance,' says Queen. 'What businesses will have to get used to is that financiers will increasingly demand quality proposals.' Dilution of an owner-manager's control need not be as great as many suppose. Queen says that packages of funds can be put together in a relatively short period of time. For example, a company needing Pounds 500,000 might only have to raise Pounds 150,000 in equity, while the balance could be provided by the government's small loans guarantee scheme and overdraft. Avoid under-pricing 'Many companies are doing a lot of bad business which is not profitable. Most companies would be more profitable if they were a little bit smaller.  -John Winkler, pricing consultant, Winkler International Possibly because of the slow pace of recovery margins and profitability are hardening, according to Queen. But there is a great temptation as orders begin to reappear for order-starved companies to grab any business that comes along. This can be fatal. Companies should be rebuilding margins, but accepting any orders or giving unnecessary discounts in order to secure them is exactly what the company does not need. First, low-margin business uses capacity that could be used for higher-margin contracts later; a 1 per cent price cut for a company earning 10 per cent net margins leads to a 10 per cent reduction in that margin. Conversely, as the accompanying diagram shows, the most effective way to rebuild margins is to put prices up. Cutting costs is almost as effective and the least efficient way is to increase sales. That said, pricing strategies need to be seen in an industry context. Winkler says downward pressure on prices is much more intense than a year ago, particularly for manufacturers who are large OEM (original equipment manufacturer) suppliers. If a business has survived the recession it will typically have already cut costs, and removed overheads. But such businesses are increasingly faced with demands from large customers for immediate 5 per cent price cuts and the same in each of next two years. Winkler says that rather than reducing this pricing pressure, the end of recession has actually added to the problems - as orders increase, so the biggest customers are demanding even more price cuts. The only solution is to resist being 'seduced by volume' and to avoid becoming dependent on one customer for more than a certain proportion of sales. 'The only way in the long run is to be able to turn round to the customer and stick two fingers up,' he says. 'You have to get yourself structured - by putting all that business though one line or one plant - so that you can walk away from the business.' Winkler's advice to smaller companies is; 'Paradoxically don't worry too much about market share; worry about profitability and margin management.' Beware your bank 'If you are under water on your security, don't pay large amounts into you account at one time. This could put your bank manager in the position where he has to pull the plug'  -Anonymous consultant Few banks would admit it, but companies in financial difficulty may be more exposed to their banks when they start to recover than in the depths of recession. Company X's overdraft might have risen at the same time as the value of its security was falling during the recession. As the recovery gathers pace it finally receives a large cheque from a customer. If paid into the account, it would not be unknown for a bank to take the opportunity to cut the company's overdraft limit. While not actually pulling the plug, the bank would effectively prevent company X from continuing to trade even though prospects were improving. Banks and accountants publicly say the best way around this, as in many things, is to keep the bank well informed of likely cash movements. Ideally the bank could be asked for an undertaking that the line would not be cut. But privately consultants and equity providers say companies are hugely exposed in these circumstances and need to protect themselves even at the risk of upsetting relations with the bank. One option is to pay large payments in slowly so that the overall overdraft comes down only marginally. Another is to pay large cheques into a different bank account. Neither solution is ideal and again better planning would help. Just as a company would never dream of becoming dependent on one customer or one supplier, nor should it become dependent on one source of finance. Review and consider Factoring and invoice discounting. Companies, particularly fast-growing ones, should consider using these two alternatives to the traditional overdraft. Both are flexible, compared with an overdraft, as the size of the facility generally increases in line with sales growth. One disadvantage is that they can be expensive - possibly a third more than overdraft finance. Recognise pressures on management. Queen believes managements are going to have to live through times that will be as stressful and demanding as they went through when the recession first hit. Having pared away layers of management and sales staff, chasing new orders could stretch management resources while taking on new sales staff will increase overheads before orders are actually won. Additionally, managers may be poached by competitors as sales increase. Companies should review compensation packages for key people and consider share option schemes to tie them in. Review marketing strategy. Having survived the recession, the shape of the market served may have changed dramatically. Some competitors will have gone to the wall, others will have been greatly strengthened. Others may have avoided cutting deeply into development budgets and will be bringing out a new product range. In short, companies should not assume they can resume pre-recession levels of sales or margins.</p>

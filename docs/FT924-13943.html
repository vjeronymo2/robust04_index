			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Exporters pick up the pieces as barricades fall - Next year's European Single Market may bring with it a bureaucratic nightmare for companies that charge VAT Radical changes in the way that businesses in Europe account for value added tax (VAT) are causing consternation among companies and industry associations throughout the European Community. From January 1 the formal creation of the Single European market will lead to the abolition of border controls and remove the customs posts which at present monitor VAT and collect trade statistics. Companies with customers and suppliers elsewhere in the Community will record their own VAT information and compile their own trading records. There are widespread fears that this, the most fundamental shake-up of the VAT system for two decades, will create a bureaucratic nightmare and impose considerable extra costs. The new VAT and reporting systems will affect the 140,000 UK companies which currently trade with other EC countries while some 30,000 companies will be required to fill in far more detailed monthly returns on exports. Many hundreds of thousands of businesses in other EC countries must also comply. 'We have been horrified at what is happening,' says Sandy Anson, tax specialist at the Institute of Directors (IOD). 'This was a political decision taken by the Community before anyone thought of the practical ramifications. The more you look at it, the worse it gets.' Other industry groups around Europe share these fears. The French Employers' Association, the Patronat, doubts whether the new system will really simplify cross border trade, while its German counterpart, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie, describes the transitional system as 'an optical illusion'. By moving from customs posts to internal controls within companies, the Community is merely exchanging a visible hindrance to trade for a less visible, but equally, powerful barrier, says Winfried Eggers, the BDI's tax specialist. The tight timetable which has been imposed has meant that many businesses are scrambling to modify their VAT procedures and their internal data collection systems. But others remain unaware of the implications of the changes. Many companies have made the mistake of treating the new VAT rules as a purely technical issue and have delegated responsibility to junior managers in their tax departments. 'There is not the grasp at board level of the importance of the new system,' comments John Arnold, a tax partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'We are looking at major changes in the way companies operate.' The need to have the new system in place by January 1 has put pressure on both the European Commission and national governments. Amendments to the new system are still being considered in Brussels while many member states have yet to pass the legislation needed. Under the present system, no VAT is payable on exports but tax is levied when the goods reach their port of destination. When border controls go, this system will no longer be possible so the European Commission proposed moving to what it calls an 'origin' system of taxation. This would have meant an exporter based in London and selling to a customer in Milan would charge UK VAT just as if he were selling to Liverpool. The Italian businessman would then recover the UK VAT through his Italian VAT return and charge Italian VAT when he sold the goods to his Italian customers. The problem with this proposal was that it would have required far greater harmony between VAT rates in the different countries. It would have probably meant that the UK would have had to drop its zero-rating of childrens' clothing and many foods, a step with serious political implications. A clearing house would have been needed to redistribute VAT revenues around the member states and many countries doubted whether this could have been made to work effectively. These difficulties persuaded to the Commission to go for a transitional system from next January with the aim of launching a full-blooded 'origin' system in January 1997. Under the transitional system, there is still no VAT on exports to another EC country and the importer, if it is a VAT-registered business, pays VAT when it takes delivery of the goods. But if the purchaser is a private individual, or an organisation not registered for VAT, the goods are taxed in the exporting country. And special rules have been drawn up for 'distance sales', such as through mail order and for sales of high value, easily moveable items like cars, boats and planes to non-VAT registered individuals. Finally, since VAT inspectors will no longer be collecting data at border posts, companies will be required to submit details of imports and exports to Customs. Smaller traders must file what is known as a European Sales List every quarter while larger companies, buying or selling more than Pounds 135,000 a year, must make a more detailed declaration every month. UK Customs &amp; Excise acknowledges that the new tax regime is complex but says it represents a necessary compromise between the demands of the 12 EC member states. It has been publicising the new system for more than a year and has already visited 20,000 companies. 'We hope people will get it right but, realistically, they will not at the outset so we will treat errors and misunderstandings leniently in the early stages,' Customs says. Despite these worries, even the new regime's critics accept that it will bring some benefits. There should be an end to border delays and a saving on freight clearance costs at ports. According to one estimate, the abolition of tax controls at the frontier will lead to Europe-wide savings of Pounds 10bn. Importers will no longer have to provide bank guarantees to Customs for VAT payments due. Since the banks set these guarantees against their customers' total loan facility, this could free a total of up to Pounds 3bn worth of capital for other uses, the IOD's Anson calculates. But there are considerable doubts about many of the details of the new regime. They include: Difficulties in accounting for what is known as 'triangular trade', when a buying office in, say, Germany orders goods from Spain for delivery to a branch location in France. To avoid the risk of being taxed twice, the buyer must choose where to register for VAT purchases. Triangular trade is far more common than at first thought. It may be difficult for an exporter to provide proof his goods have gone abroad. The government has said exporters will not be penalised if they take all reasonable precautions but business organisations wonder how understanding Customs will be. Exporters must record their customers' VAT-registration number on invoices but some countries, such as Germany and France, are only now issuing numbers. Mail order companies doing substantial foreign business must appoint a representative to handle their affairs locally and provide a contact point for the local VAT authorities. It may prove difficult and expensive to find such agents since they will assume an unlimited liability for paying VAT, says Adrian Ogley, tax specialist at the CBI. 'The cost of maintaining a local representative may wipe out any profit for a small company.' Differing currency valuations, transfers to overseas branches which have to be registered as sales, and alternative ways of doing business such as leasing, may all create distortions in the reporting of trade information to the VAT authorities. Many UK companies will have to modify their internal data collection methods to provide the much more detailed information required. The potential for fraud. At present if Customs suspect a misdeclaration of the value of a shipment, they can hold on to the goods. In future they may have to check back on the value of consignments made three or more months earlier. Confusion could result in the first few months of 1993 because many countries have yet to introduce the legislation needed to implement the new system. Countries such as Germany, Italy and Denmark will be introducing detailed legislation to implement the new VAT system this month or next. The EC itself is currently working on a 'cleansing directive' to sort out some of the problems created by the original VAT directive but this may not be agreed until November or December. Industry lobbyists around the Community agree that there is little they can do now to change the way the transitional system will work from January 1 though they are determined to make their voices heard before the final system is introduced in 1997. Ultimately, apologists for the new system claim, acceptance is just one of the start-up costs of the single European market which is forecast to bring general trading benefits of Pounds 170bn to businesses in the Community. 'But the benefits come in the general commercial area while there are a lot of costs on the VAT side,' says the CBI's Ogley. 'Everyone wants the single market but the question is, do they want it at this price?'</p>

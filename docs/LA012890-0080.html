			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAIL-CONTROL FIGHT LEAVES SCARS IN ANOTHER COUNTY;  </P> <P> DETENTION SYSTEM: AFTER A HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE, SANTA CLARA COUNTY WRENCHED  CONTROL OF ITS JAILS FROM THE SHERIFF. HOW IS IT WORKING? OPINIONS ARE VARIED.  </P> <P> One year after seizing control of the jails from the sheriff, county political  leaders here are convinced that their decision to establish a new Department of  Correction was the right one to bring down high jail costs and institute new  inmate rehabilitation programs.  </P> <P> They believe they will save $62 million over 10 years for the taxpayers of  Santa Clara County and that their concept of "direct supervision" of jail  inmates and new drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs will help beat back a  rising crime rate.  </P> <P> "It is doing what I envisioned that it should be doing," Susanne Wilson, a  veteran member of the County Board of Supervisors, said in a recent interview  at City Hall, reflecting on her role in championing the board's fight to manage  the jails.  </P> <P> "It is a responsible agency. It's more economical. And it's a safer and cheaper  place for our prisoners."  </P> <P> In late 1988, Santa Clara County became the only large county in California to  switch from a jail system traditionally run by the Sheriff's Department to one  managed, operated and controlled by civilian authorities. (Much smaller Madera  and Napa counties already had switched to a jail system separate from the  sheriff.)  </P> <P> Now, that dramatic shift in power is under serious consideration by the San  Diego County Board of Supervisors, which has toured the new jail system here  and discussed in detail the ramifications of stripping the jails from the  Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> But one of the key lessons learned from the long struggle in Santa Clara County  is that such a power shift can leave a tremendous amount of ill feelings and a  good measure of political blood on the floor.  </P> <P> Robert Winter, sheriff in Santa Clara County for more than a decade, abruptly  stepped down in August after his jails were cut out from underneath him. He now  is weighing a campaign for a seat on the same Board of Supervisors that stole  his thunder.  </P> <P> Many rank-and-file deputy sheriffs, some of them forced to work in the new jail  system until there are openings on sheriff's patrol assignments, fear that a  major jailhouse riot or, worse yet, an officer's death lies in the near future.  Many deputies openly criticize the new correctional officers as undertrained  and note that last year criminal charges were filed against half a dozen of  them.  </P> <P> "If something major happens, people are going to get hurt very, very badly,"  said Deputy Ronald Levine, who filed one of the many lawsuits over the jail  issue and who now, in between his work shifts at the jail, is nurturing his own  political ambitions.  </P> <P> "That is simply because they are not that well-trained," he said of the  correctional officers. "They don't have the skills. They don't have the  training. And many of them are lazy."  </P> <P> The local Deputy Sheriff's Assn. fought the change with three-quarters of a  million dollars it had saved to buy a new headquarters building. The deputy's  association leadership today is left frustrated and angry, and is investigating  the backgrounds of the Board of Supervisors, looking for any embarrassing  skeletons to exact some political revenge.  </P> <P> Like Levine, the equally bitter Sgt. Tom Beck, a sworn deputy for 30 years and  outgoing president of the deputy's association, said:  </P> <P> "There's a difference between getting angry and getting even. And, if I can  prove certain things, I'll do it."  </P> <P> Just as San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy has sparred openly with the Board  of Supervisors, Sheriff Winter of Santa Clara County never backed down from a  fight.  </P> <P> Now selling real estate in the south valley town of Gilroy, Winter recalled the  1978 election, when he first ran as a lieutenant and still managed to defeat  the incumbent sheriff with 59% of the vote.  </P> <P> Once in office, he said, the public backed him each year when he complained  that the Board of Supervisors was not allocating enough money to his department  to properly staff the crowded jails.  </P> <P> "The question was, did we want a strong sheriff or a submissive one?" said  Winter, a gray-haired, 59-year-old conservative. "That was the deciding issue."  </P> <P> While Winter was projecting the strong-sheriff image, the board saw him as a  poor administrator unable to manage a budget. Board members were repeatedly  upset with his cost overruns, much of them spent in overtime for jail deputies.  One jail deputy earned more than $100,000 in a single year, they said.  </P> <P> According to the board, Winter overran his jail budget by more than $7.7  million during four consecutive years in the 1980s, and, in 1987 alone, his  $67-million budget was overspent by $3.5 million. And, while the board was  making cuts in other county services and programs, the sheriff's budget for  running the jails was increasing by 98%, although the jail population rose only  34%.  </P> <P> Because of the division of power in government, board members have limited  authority, beyond setting the size of the budget, to oversee the way a sheriff  manages his departments. According to the way county governments are set up,  the elected boards approve the size of the sheriff's budget, but the elected  sheriff decides how that money is spent.  </P> <P> There were political omens too. Although Winter was seen as a popular figure at  the polls, the board felt it was being cast in a dark light every time it  attacked his management style.  </P> <P> "Bob Winter looked more like a sheriff than anyone I ever saw," said Supervisor  Wilson. "He was tall, with wavy hair and guns on his hips. He was a good old  boy.  </P> <P> "He had good political skills, but he never managed a budget. He lacked  administrative skills. Each year he doubled his overruns. The system was out of  control."  </P> <P> Supervisor Zoe Lofgren, equally frustrated by the cost overruns, was slowly won  over to Wilson's side, convinced that the board should invoke its powers to set  up its own private corrections department.  </P> <P> Lofgren said the board was then under a court order to ease jail crowding.  There were pressures to implement more humane conditions for inmates. And,  because the county was building new jail facilities anyway, she was convinced  that a civilian Department of Correction was the best way to go.  </P> <P> That kind of ambitious thinking fits her political style, she said. In her  office hangs a portrait of Albert Einstein, with the caption: "Imagination is  more important than knowledge." Bucking the time-honored tradition of letting  elected sheriffs run the jails, she said, was an innovative idea, and there was  always a chance that even repeat offenders could be rehabilitated.  </P> <P> "While you've got those guys locked up, why not try to turn them around?" she  said.  </P> <P> Ron Diridon was the least optimistic of the supervisors about embracing a  separate corrections department. He studied other counties in the nation that  tried a corrections system separate from the sheriff, and he worried that the  cost would be too great if it failed.  </P> <P> But he also understood that Winter and the board could not continue taking  punches at each other and still provide good government.  </P> <P> "If Bob Winter had had the personality that would have allowed him to work with  the board, the board members never would have found the need to take the jails  away from him," he said.  </P> <P> Beck, president of the deputy's association during the jail fight, said the  board's arguments were "a lot of bunk." He said Winter was never given enough  money in the first place to run the jails, so of course he would have to  authorize overtime and come in over budget.  </P> <P> "It's like if the board hired you to drive a truck to go to New York, but only  gave you enough gas to get to Chicago," he said. "Does that mean you're a bad  driver?"  </P> <P> When the board members voted to create a Department of Correction, they told  the public that most of the $62 million in savings would come from lower  salaries for new correctional officers and reduced training costs.  </P> <P> Under the new system, correctional officers undergo a seven-week training  course, as contrasted with 18 weeks for deputies, and they are paid a lower  entry-level annual salary of about $30,000, versus about $41,000 for starting  deputy sheriffs.  </P> <P> According to county figures, $8 million has been saved already under the new  department, and the county should have saved $10.4 million by next June. The  current jail budget is about $80 million.  </P> <P> The deputy's association did not buy the cost-savings arguments, and the group  gathered 77,750 signatures to place an initiative on the 1988 ballot, asking  that the county charter specifically declare that only the elected sheriff can  run the jails.  </P> <P> The board answered by placing its own advisory initiative on the same ballot,  asking voters whether they supported a Department of Correction. Then politics  took its course.  </P> <P> The board labelled its initiative Measure A. The board then added four other  less significant measures on the ballot, and then came the deputy's association  proposal, Measure F.  </P> <P> Supervisor Wilson said she helped raise $250,000, against the $750,000 that the  deputy's association took from its building fund to fight the Department of  Correction. While the proponents of Measure A were saying that Sheriff Winter  was spending too much money, the deputy's association never forced the board to  fully justify how it would save the $62 million, and to this day does not  believe the savings are real.  </P> <P> With radio, television and newspaper advertisements in full swing, the most  popular refrain against the deputy's association proposal, still being heard  with laughs in Santa Clara County, was simply, "F no."  </P> <P> "I hope it was good politics," said Lofgren, reflecting on the bitter election.  "I think we were straight with the voters."  </P> <P> Beck, the deputy's association president, said his group was far too naive in  trying to defeat the politically savvy board members. If he had it to do over  again, he said, "I would not play fair. I would go for the throat like they  do."  </P> <P> Lawsuits followed, and the state Supreme Court ruled in November, 1988, that  the board could take over the jails. By January, when Winter formally turned  the jail key over to newly hired Department of Correction Director Frank Hall,  about $300,000 in legal fees for both sides had been borne by the taxpayers.  Eighteen months of debate, campaigning and lawsuits were over. All that was  left were bruised egos.  </P> <P> Winter left office, and the board appointed an interim sheriff to serve the  rest of his term. Without the jails, which had been two-thirds of Winter's  domain, the new sheriff's responsibilities cover only the unincorporated areas  of the county and law enforcement services for some contract cities.  </P> <P> "We had supported so many of the board members in the past, and they were our  friends," said Beck. "But they wanted Bob Winter so bad that they were willing  to step on their friends."  </P> <P> Wilson sympathized with the hard feelings at the deputy's association. But she  alludes to the political maxim that "every person has to make their own  decision. And then live with it."  </P> <P> After years running state correctional systems in Massachusetts, Maryland and  New York, Frank Hall moved in to Sheriff Winter's old office in San Jose. As  the first director of the Department of Correction, he took control of a jail  system that included two new detention facilities built in the aftermath of the  lawsuits over crowding.  </P> <P> Hall today has control of five jails with about 5,000 inmate beds, compared to  seven jails and 4,269 inmates, as of last Wednesday, in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Hall also inherited a good portion of the sheriff's deputies still working in  the jails, and today he supervises a correctional staff of 800 workers,  including about 200 sworn deputies who have yet to be phased back into  sheriff's patrol duties.  </P> <P> He also implemented a direct supervision concept, with correctional officers  overseeing the jail by mingling with inmates, rather than the traditional  prison system of guards watching inmates from behind thick glass windows in  steel-reinforced control rooms.  </P> <P> He has brought local self-help agencies into the jails to work with inmates in  drug and alcohol rehabilitation projects. He has set up incentive programs for  inmates who with good conduct can earn perks such as extra candy bars and the  right to select the evening videocassette tape.  </P> <P> "I just finished 20 employee interviews, and no one mentioned poor morale," he  said. "There's a whole new atmosphere here. We're trying to provide some new  direction, some new leadership."  </P> <P> Pat Doyle, a deputy sheriff for 18 years, is one of the remaining deputies  still assigned to the jails. Once skeptical of direct supervision, he now is a  believer.  </P> <P> "Really, it does work," Doyle said. "We stopped being jailers and became inmate  managers. And, if rehabilitation can happen, it will happen here."  </P> <P> Several inmates in one of the drug programs, who have marked time under both  Winter and Hall, were grateful for the chance to improve their lives. "I've  been in prison seven times already," said 38-year-old Earl Soto, jailed now for  possession of cocaine. "But, if I'd had this program before and this setting,  maybe I wouldn't be back again."  </P> <P> The deputy's association leadership doesn't believe for a second that county  inmates are really being turned around. "That's hogwash," said Beck.  </P> <P> But Hall and his staff said it was a worthy aim of the new corrections officers  to at least try to change the lives of criminals. "I think we're making some  real strides here," said David Gonzales, an assistant director of the new  Department of Correction.  </P> <P> Winter and Beck scoff at such optimism. They said that trying to rehabilitate  county inmates, many of them headed for state prison, is a hopeless task,  particularly since the average inmate spends only four months in the county  system.  </P> <P> Beck added that many of the correctional officers, who have been ridiculed as  "Smurfs" because of their new blue uniforms, are learning fast that a jailhouse  drug program doesn't always save souls.  </P> <P> "They do not like working for Mr. Hall," Beck said. "Most of them don't care to  work there. They don't care much for his operation."  </P> <P> Beck and Winter noted that criminal charges were brought against some of the  new correctional officers last year. One officer was charged with two felony  counts of assaulting an inmate.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Winter is skeptical that the board really will save the $62  million.  </P> <P> "That's a pie-in-the sky figure," he said. "The board directed their controller  to come up with a figure, and he dreamed one up."  </P> <P> But Supervisors Wilson and Lofgren insisted the savings are real. "Our auditors  didn't make this stuff up," said Lofgren. "We're tracking it, and we'll issue  yearly report cards to the voters."  </P> <P> But the board and Hall and others backing the civilian-run jail system stop  short of pushing their system on other counties with similar problems, such as  San Diego.  </P> <P> "We did it here because it worked for us," Hall said. "We're proud of our  system. But I'm not going to go demand everyone else go to a Department of  Correction."  </P> <P> COUNTY CORRECTIONS COMPARISON  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.42IN:3.32IN:3.10IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>

Under recent legislation, there is now a 90-day (720-hour) maximum limitation on the amount of annual leave an SES member may carry over from one leave year to the next. Previously, SES members could accumulate annual leave on an unlimited basis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Effective Date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> October 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Comment Date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be received on or before February 21, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send or deliver written comments to Donald J.

Section 201 of the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;356, enacted October 13, 1994) amended 5 U.S.C. 6304(f) to provide a 90-day (720-hour) limit on the amount of annual leave an SES member may carry over from one leave year to the next. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 201 also contains a grandfather clause to allow individuals who were SES members on the effective date of the law and who had accumulated more than 90 days (720 hours) of annual leave to retain as their personal leave ceiling the annual leave they had accrued as of the effective date of the law. The personal leave ceiling is the maximum amount of accrued annual leave an affected member can carry over from one leave year to the next. The personal leave ceiling is subject to the existing reduction provisions contained in law and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are amending paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 5 CFR 630.301 to implement the new 90-day (720-hour) limitation. Paragraph (a) specifies the maximum limitation on annual leave accumulation for members of the SES. Paragraph (b) specifies how leave is prorated when an employee serves part of a pay period in an SES position and part in a position outside the SES. Paragraph (c) provides that SES members may retain their leave balances when they take a non-SES position, but that the balance is subject to reduction under 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) until the balance reaches 30 days (240 hours) or 45 days (360 hours) depending on the leave ceiling for the new position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are adding paragraph (d) to explain how the grandfather clause is to be applied to establish a personal leave ceiling for SES members. The grandfather clause also applies to former career SES members who elected to retain SES leave benefits under 5 U.S.C. 3392(c) following appointment to an Executive Schedule or equivalent position. The personal leave ceiling does not include advanced annual leave or restored annual leave. Annual leave restored to an SES member under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) will continue to be placed in a separate leave account and must be scheduled and used within the time period specified in 5 CFR 630.306 or 630.309. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 103&hyph;356 provides for the reduction of the personal leave ceiling under the existing provisions of 5 U.S.C. 6304(c). Thus, if an SES member has a personal leave ceiling and uses more annual leave than he or she earns in a leave year (or between the start of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, and the end of the 1994 leave year), the personal leave ceiling is reduced by the difference at the start of the next leave year. If the personal leave ceiling falls to or below 90 days (720 hours) at the end of a leave year, the member becomes subject to the 90-day (720-hour) limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an SES member with a personal leave ceiling earns more annual leave than used in a leave year (or between the start of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, and the end of the 1994 leave year), the excess hours are forfeited at the start of the next leave year. SES members are subject to the same provisions in the law and regulations for the restoration of unused annual leave as apply to other employees (5 U.S.C. 6304(d) and 5 CFR 630.305 through 630.309). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an SES member separates from the Government before the end of a leave year, the member is paid a lump-sum payment for all accumulated annual leave (including any unused restored leave), even if the amount of leave exceeds the member's personal leave ceiling. (See 5 U.S.C. 5551.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Example:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An SES member had 1,000 hours of annual leave at the beginning of the first pay period after October 13, 1994. The SES member's personal leave ceiling would be 1,000 hours. If during the remainder of the 1994 leave year the member uses 100 hours more leave than earned, the member's personal leave ceiling for the 1995 leave year will be 900 hours (1,000 minus 100 hours). If during leave year 1995 the member earns 100 hours more leave than used, the member's personal leave ceiling for the 1996 leave year will remain at 900 hours, and the excess 100 hours will be forfeited. Finally, if the member separates from the Government on September 30, 1996, with 1,040 hours of accumulated annual leave, the member will receive a lump-sum payment for 1,040 hours of annual leave at the member's then current rate of pay. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOMMY TUCKER; MELLOW LEADER IN BIG BAND ERA  </P> <P> Tommy Tucker, whose long-ago recording of "I Don't Want to Set the World on  Fire" turned his musicians from an ordinary $500-a-week band into a major, if  temporary, presence during the Big Band Era, died Tuesday of heart failure in a  Sarasota, Fla., hospital.  </P> <P> Tucker, 86, retired to Florida many years ago.  </P> <P> A short, quiet-spoken man in an age of flamboyant leaders, Tucker was probably  the only band leader of any time to boast a Phi Beta Kappa key (from the  University of North Dakota).  </P> <P> His band was known for its sweet sounds and capable singers and was playing the  hotels and cafes of the day. But Tucker was still looking for a hit record in  the summer of 1940 when he was performing at the Hotel Berkeley-Carterer in  Asbury Park, N.J.  </P> <P> With his wife and female singer, Amy Arnell, they visited a club in nearby  Philadelphia where a group called the Three Keys was singing "I Don't Want to  Set the World on Fire."  </P> <P> It was not a new song and had been recorded earlier but at a faster pace.  </P> <P> Tucker's new, moderately paced version with Arnell on the vocal sold more than  500,000 records.  </P> <P> Other well-known Tucker songs were the band's theme, "I Love You (Oh, How I  Love You)," sung by a trio, and "The Man That Comes Around."  </P> <P> Tucker, who played the piano, trumpet and trombone, was also familiar to radio  fans for such shows as "Sing for Your Supper With Tommy Tucker," "Thirty  Minutes in Hollywood" and "Hit Parade." And he made numerous television  appearances on "The Kate Smith Show," "Cavalcade of Bands," "Arthur Murray  House Party" and "Strike It Rich."  </P> <P> In the mid-1940s Tucker tried to add luster to his quiet arrangements, but he  had been so long associated with a mellow sound that audiences did not respond.  </P> <P> He eventually gave up the band, returned to academia as a professor of fine  arts at Monmouth College in New Jersey and then retired to Florida.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE  </P> <P> In his perceptive April 8 review of "The Cinema of Adventure, Romance and  Terror," David Colker mentions that "some of the behind-the-scenes anecdotes .  . . are suspect because the book is not footnoted and the sources . . . go  mostly unnamed."  </P> <P> Most of the material in my book is from primary sources, such as author  conversations and interviews over a period of many years with personnel  involved in production of the films and from information in studio files. . . .  </P> <P> For example, our information on "The Most Dangerous Game" was obtained from the  producer, the director, the music supervisor, four of the cameramen, two  effects technicians, the first matte artist, a stuntman, two lead players and  the RKO production files.  </P> <P> We tried to avoid published sources and whatever secondary materials were used  are attributed in the text. Further blame may be attached to the editor's  college-days hatred of reading footnotes.  </P> <P> GEORGE E. TURNER  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD  </P></p>

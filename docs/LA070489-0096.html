			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SATURN SPECTACULAR LEAVES ASTRONOMERS IN A HEAVENLY STATE  </P> <P> Saturn sailed across the heavens with a diamond in its rings Monday morning,  dazzling mortals on a distant planet.  </P> <P> Witnessing the event were thousands of amateur and professional astronomers who  traveled to the high country throughout the Southwest so they could take part  in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  </P> <P> And Saturn, one of the most popular objects in the sky because of its  spectacular rings, did not let them down.  </P> <P> Standing out in brilliant contrast against a black, moonless sky, the  second-largest planet in the solar system passed in front of a bright star late  Sunday night and early Monday morning. That happens so rarely that it drew the  undivided attention of many of the largest telescopes in the West, from Chile  to Arizona to Hawaii to California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Saturn Owned the Skies  </P> <P> The event gave scientists a chance to study the size and nature of Saturn, and  its rings and many moons, but it was far more than that. From the moment  shortly before midnight that the star first flickered and dipped behind the  outer ring to the time it emerged more than three hours later from the other  side, Saturn owned the skies.  </P> <P> "That's pretty bloody spectacular," sighed Leif Robinson, editor of Sky and  Telescope Magazine, who talked to the fledgling Mt. Wilson Institute about  using the 60-inch telescope at the Mt. Wilson Observatory to study the event. A  handful of scientists and a few guests crouched on their hands and knees on the  observatory's concrete floor to watch the entire drama on a small television  monitor hooked up to the historic scope.  </P> <P> Much of the time the crowd was quiet, almost reverent, but every time the star  blazed through a hole in the rings it brought cheers and applause from  astronomers who are more accustomed to fighting sleep than controlling their  exuberance during long, nighttime stints at the telescope.  </P> <P> "You could measure the size of the rings by the sound level in this room,"  observed astronomer Art Vaughan of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Vaughan is  chairman of the board of the Mt. Wilson Institute and one of the prime movers  in the drive to save the historic observatory from the scrap heap.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Role in Astronomy  </P> <P> For nearly a century the Mt. Wilson Observatory played a major role in  astronomy, but a few years ago the Carnegie Institution shocked the scientific  world by announcing that the institute would concentrate its limited resources  on its more modern observatory in Chile, and that would force it to close Mt.  Wilson.  </P> <P> But scientists and enthusiasts like Vaughan rose up en masse to challenge that  move, giving birth to the Mt. Wilson Institute, a grass-roots organization that  is dedicated to preserving the observatory. Last Jan. 5, the Carnegie  Institution turned over the entire observatory to the Mt. Wilson Institute, and  the old facility began a new life.  </P> <P> The institute plans to turn the observatory into a major educational facility,  and Vaughan noted that along the way it would be nice if it could fill in a few  gaps left by the upstart observatories that have come along to take its place.  </P> <P> That is exactly what it did Monday morning.  </P> <P> Just a few days ago Robinson, whose magazine enjoys the respect of professional  as well as amateur astronomers, was trying to find some way to capture the  moment for his readers when he thought of Mt. Wilson. At first, Robinson said  Monday night, he thought he would just ask permission to attach a small  telescope to a  </P> <P> drive mechanism at the observatory, giving him a chance to photograph the  event.  </P> <P> But when he approached the institute, he got a surprise.  </P> <P> A team of scientists from the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics has  been using the 60-inch telescope to study other stars to see if they have  sunspots like the sun (they do, it turns out) and they were willing to turn the  instrument toward Saturn for its rendezvous with a star known as 28 Sagittarii.  </P> <P> "I was amazed by how quickly this all came together," Robinson said. "In a  matter of a day or two we knew we had a telescope."  </P> <P> Others quickly came aboard with instruments needed to study the eclipse, which  astronomers call an "occultation," and by Sunday night the only thing lacking  was a drum roll.  </P> <P> "There it goes," astronomer Jim Frazer of the Harvard Smithsonian yelled as the  star edged up to the outer ring.  </P> <P> The rings of Saturn have long fascinated celestial observers because they  create one of the most spectacular views in the sky.  </P> <P> The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft took much of the mystery out of the  rings when they confirmed earlier evidence that the rings were not solid. Their  contents range from gas and dust particles to the second largest moon in the  solar system, but they also have gaps and even intermittent rings that are  largely void of matter.  </P> <P> Knowing that, the scientists at Mt. Wilson expected the star to disappear  behind the rings almost immediately, but it turned out to be rather reluctant  to leave the stage.  </P> <P> "Bye, bye, starlight," Frazer said as the star first dipped behind the outer  ring.  </P> <P> But a second later it blazed brightly again, and the old dome housing the  telescope reverberated with shouts and applause.  </P> <P> "Holy mackerel, it's still there," Robinson said. "This is more fun than a  pinball machine."  </P> <P> "It's more fun than Christmas," added Lyndine McAfee, executive director of the  Mt. Wilson Institute.  </P> <P> And so it went, throughout the evening.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, other scientists at other observatories in Arizona, California,  Hawaii and Chile were compiling data on the event. Videotapes from Mt. Wilson  will be sent to the University of Arizona as part of that effort.  </P> <P> Unchanged by it all was Saturn, second in mass among the planets only to  Jupiter, an ethereal vision that does not look real as it moves across the sky,  cloaked in rings of gold.  </P> <P> But Sunday night and Monday morning, it blocked out the rays from a distant  star, proving that it is, indeed, real.  </P></p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / US pursues fillip for oil and gas THE US Energy Department is examining various proposals to shore up the domestic oil and gas industries, aiming to promote technology, stimulate markets and develop an oil import policy. The department is expected to intensify the emphasis on renewable energies and seek a reduction of reliance on nuclear energy. A recommendation by US industry for an oil import fee is 'definitely off the table', said a departmental official. The department's proposals will be published in a report late this month. No draft legislation is likely to be submitted to Congress very soon, it being busy with health care, the North American Free Trade Agreement, government restructuring and welfare reform. Debate over US energy policy was launched in April by Mrs Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, in a speech to the Louisiana state legislature. Acknowledging her responsibility to establish a coherent set of policies, she said she would aim to increase production of energy resources while protecting the environment. The Energy Department, working with the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, has met industry and environmental groups. The report has gone through various drafts, but has not reached secretary level. According to a summary of an early draft of the report, the industry recommended a wide range of tax incentives for production and technology advancement. The ideas include stimulating the use of oil recovery technology through tax credits and depletion allowances, tax incentives for environmental equipment, tax credits for low-production wells, and promoting vehicular use of natural gas. It is not clear how many of these will be in the final report. The department is also considering foreign sales initiatives likely to win approval from an export-minded administration. For example, the restrictions on oil exports to Japan from Alaska could be eased. Exports of oil and gas equipment services could be aggressively promoted. An energy efficiency centre, now being opened in Moscow, could be joined by an oil and gas centre, which would offer a focal point for industry efforts to work abroad.</p>

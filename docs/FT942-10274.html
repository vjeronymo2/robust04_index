			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant 25% ahead Holmes &amp; Marchant Group, the marketing services company, reported pre-tax profits ahead 25 per cent from Pounds 461,000 to Pounds 576,000 for the six months to end-March. The improvement was achieved on turnover down by Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 13.3m. Earnings per share emerged at 1.76p (1.45p). Comparative figures have been restated to reflect the accounting policy adopted for empty leasehold property costs. Mr John Holmes, chairman and chief executive, said Pounds 1m of the decline in turnover was accounted for by the closure of the group's consumer advertising agency in February 1993, while a further Pounds 1.5m related to client expenditure on new product launches. With lower average borrowings in the period and a reduction in interest rates, net interest payable was reduced from Pounds 450,000 to Pounds 350,000. Net borrowings at March 31 stood at Pounds 8.6m, an improvement of Pounds 400,000 on the 1993 year end.</p>

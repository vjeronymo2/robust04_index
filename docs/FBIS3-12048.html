The business delegation, headed by  (Coy Stork), was interested in contacting Cuban enterprises for  research, coastal management and shoreline restoration in Cuba  and the Caribbean, registration and joint operation of Cuban  ships, construction in third countries, and joint productions in  the machine tool, food, and textile industries. In exchange, the  Netherlanders will supply canned milk, meat, fruit, and  vegetables to Cuba.    In the 1994-95 work program, the group will promote  possibilities for investment in Cuba and will support the  efforts of Dutch enterprises established in Havana. The creation  of joint enterprises and variants of associations of mutual  benefit and the introduction of the scientific-technical,  biotechnical, and pharmaceutical industries to the Netherlands  market were additional aspects considered in the final document,  which was signed by (Van Vough), head of the Dutch section, and  Ariel Maso, director of (Cubanique) and head of the Cuban  section at the meetings.</p>

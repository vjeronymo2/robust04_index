			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Loophole allows water companies to avoid tax A TAX loophole has enabled the privatised water companies to make Pounds 7bn in profits while paying hardly any mainstream corporation tax, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will claim today. This is one of a number of loopholes Mr Brown is expected to highlight at a press conference this morning, which is billed as the government's 'double whammy' on taxation, in a reference to the Tory advertising slogan attacking Labour in the last general election campaign. Mr Brown is expected to urge the Treasury to end the water companies' concession on capital allowances, which he says is costing the taxpayer as much as Pounds 1bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ye. N. Voronin, Moscow Aviation Institute; UDC </F> 621.3/535.2]    [Abstract] A medical radio-tomograph is  proposed. The tomograph is designed for active selective  diagnostics in conjunction with frequent therapy of internal  organs in the millimeter to decimeter wave range. Its  functioning is based on combining the principles of selective  holography with adaptive location. The methodology of microwave  nonlinear tomography, based on methods of contrasting  substances, a priory radio- testing and adaptive self-focusing  of radio-illumination is described. A diagram of the  radio-tomograph is provided and the algorithm of its functioning  is also described. Implementation of the proposed scientific  principles and engineering solutions would improve the spacial  resolution, the contrast range, and the information content of  radio-holograms; expand the spectrum of applications (biomedical  diagnostics, selective analysis and thermal processing,  non-invasive defectoscopy etc); and increase the diagnostic and  therapeutic capacities of the radio-tomograph (additional  diagnostic information, focused treatment or heating of the  internal organs, etc).

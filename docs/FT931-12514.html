			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / More take holidays in Australia THE NUMBER of British holi-daymakers visiting Australia and New Zealand trebled in the 1980s as a trend for long-distance holidays grew. In Europe, the biggest percentage increase was in holidays to Portugal. But four out of every 10 British people do not take a holiday, a figure which changed little during the 1970s and 1980s even though 94 per cent of employees now qualify for more than four weeks paid annual leave. Watching television remains the most popular home-based leisure activity. In 1991 people watched an average of 26 hours a week. They apparently retained their critical faculties while doing so; between 1981 and 1991 complaints about television advertising more than doubled. Although the development of satellite, cable and video has extended the range of television available, there has been a slight decline in the time spent viewing since 1986. Listening to radio, by contrast, increased from an average of less than nine hours a week in 1986 to nearly 10 1/2 hours in 1991. People aged 16 to 34 were keenest, with an average of nearly 13 hours. Blackpool pleasure beach retains its position as Britain's most popular tourist attraction with free admission - 6.5m visitors were counted there in 1991 - followed by the British Museum with 5.1m. If this year's Social Trends suggests that the glories of Mammon may have faded a little for many British people, there is no evidence that they are seeking solace in the eternal. Adult membership of the main Christian churches fell by one-sixth to less than 7m between 1975 and 1990, although Muslim, Sikh and Hindu worshippers all increased.</p>

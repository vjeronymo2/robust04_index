			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Observer: Crazy rhythm Ruddy-cheeked Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France's Front National, was in prime ranting form for the extreme right-wing movement's annual Joan of Arc rally, but his choice of music becomes ever more eccentric. After a presidential campaign conducted to the stately chorus of the Children of Israel from Verdi's Nabucco - ironic, considering the regularity with which Le Pen is convicted for anti-semitic remarks - the theme song at the rally was Elgar's Land of Hope and Glory. Although preferable to Keep the Home Fires Burning, it was a curious way to commemorate the Maid of Orleans.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Channel tunnel delay hits 35 jobs Eurotunnel yesterday made 35 telesales staff redundant, about half its customer-service staff, because of the delay in opening services through the Channel tunnel. Reservations have been suspended since it was announced the tunnel will not open fully this spring as planned, but in September. The tunnel operator said: 'We have carried out the maximum re-deployment within the company, but we still had to let 35 staff go.' Some remaining staff had been redeployed to deal with inquiries about the service.</p>

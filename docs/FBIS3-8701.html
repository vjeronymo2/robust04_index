First, because for  the first time a civilian -- who is not familiar with military  issues -- is leading the armed forces, and second, because many  of the members of the Army Intelligence Direction claim that  Tinca used to work for the Securitate, more precisely for SIE  [Foreign Intelligence Service]. During the reign of the  deceased [former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu] it was known that  the Army and the Securitate used to loath each other. The  memory of those times still persists. Had it not been for the  precedent of the CADA [Action Committee for the Democratization  of the Army, an organization of young officers immediately after  December 1989], when the attempt by certain officers to revolt  against the army leadership was suppressed, many officers would  now react more harshly, the sources said.</p>

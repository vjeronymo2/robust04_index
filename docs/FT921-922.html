			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Worker qualification standards criticised NEW BRITISH qualifications have led to young people being taught how to lay bricks but not how to estimate the materials required, according to a study published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The study, by Ms Hilary Steedman, compares young people on construction industry courses in France and Germany, and says the British teenager on a Youth Training (YT) programme is 'uniquely disadvantaged in northern Europe'. It finds that the new British competence-based National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) for the industry has less mathematics training than the City and Guilds qualification. Numbers of people attaining a recognised NVQ would rise, but the quality of those trained might be lower than before. The vocational qualification is based on standards of competence elaborated by the industry as appropriate for an employee at this level. The report said: 'It is difficult to understand, therefore, that so little emphasis should be placed in the industry on building calculations.' It said shifting the financial burden for training away from government and towards employers was a reason for the reduction in education and training in YT.

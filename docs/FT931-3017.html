			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Triangular transactions Simplification procedures will apply to some commercial transactions which involve traders from other member states of the European Community from August 1. These changes are for 'triangular' transactions when commercial goods are supplied in a chain involving three traders located in different member states, but where physical delivery of the goods involves their movement direct from the first member state to the third; and goods installed or assembled in the UK by traders from other EC countries. The intention is to give legal effect to an EC-wide scheme aimed at reducing the need for intermediate suppliers to register for Vat in the country where the goods are delivered.</p>

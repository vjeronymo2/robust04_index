			<p>-- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY  <F P=103> OW0306223094 </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tetsuro Hasei: "Report on Unfair Trade Policies </F> -- Argument Lacks Persuasiveness"]    [Text] Just as it did last year, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI], in its annual "Report  on Unfair Trade Policies" announced on 31 May, strongly  criticized the U.S. Government for its "results-oriented" trade  policies. The report is characterized by a harsh tone  throughout its entirety. However, it is questionable whether  the report's message has any persuasiveness, particularly when  Japan is currently being harshly criticized abroad for the lack  of openness in its markets.    Taking into consideration the trade policies of the  administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, MITI took the  trouble to include in its report a topic entitled "The Problems  of Results-Oriented Criteria" to put up a counterargument based  on logical reasoning against U.S. trade policies. Harsh  expressions can be found throughout the report. For example,  the report refers to U.S. trade policy as "tantamount to a  single country serving both the roles of judge and prosecutor  and lacking in due process." MITI's stance as indicated in this  report is due to its concern that "a results-oriented way of  thinking can easily turn into managed trade." In fact, even  though the same problems were pointed out in last year's report,  the Clinton administration's policies turned out to be what  Japan had feared. For example, the Clinton administration,  among other actions, reinstated the Super 301 provision (for  determining and taking counteraction against unfair traders and  trade practices) of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness  Act.    What is emphasized as the basis of Japanese assertions is  GATT, which Japan considers the "Constitution for International  Trade," and the new World Trade Organization (WTO), for the  establishment of which an agreement was concluded not so long  ago. MITI then urges in its report to actively utilize the  process of settling disputes through the WTO.    While there should be no argument against such "idealistic  thoughts," why then are Japanese assertions hard to understand?  Even if the primary objective of the report is not necessarily  to point out "unfairness" in Japanese markets, it goes without  saying that the least Japan can do to gain understanding from  its trading partners is to show that it is not reluctant at all  at striving to open its markets to foreign access.    However, the lack of openness of the Japanese markets is not  the only problem. There have been only two instances when Japan  took its case to GATT for review under the latter's regulations.  In particular, when a problem arises between Japan and the  United States, Japan resorts to bilateral negotiations rather  than turning to international rules. It has opted for  "ambiguous measures" as represented by the semiconductor  agreement and voluntary restraint agreement on automobile  exports.    A GATT report of investigation into trade policies has  criticized Japan, saying "unless it is in line with the  principle of a multilateral trade system which includes a  nondiscriminatory rule, a bilateral settlement undermines the  multilateral trade system itself as well as confidence in the  system." Therefore, Japan, which has succumbed to U.S.  pressure, cannot help but be labeled in international trade  circles as a country that "acts contrary to its words."    If Japan has made changes to its previous stance, then it  should actively try to make that known. Above all, it must show  that through action, or else the rest of the world will not be  convinced. Even should the logic which the report bases its  assertions on be valid, it can be said the problem lies in how  to carry out the policies the report advocates.    Otherwise, the report would only focus on counterarguments  and tend to invite results which are contrary to its aim to  "present a framework for bringing about constructive solutions  to disputes due to trade frictions which often invite illogical  confusion."</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / No appeal for tax rebellion in Epsom STORIES of council tax chaos and imminent rebellion in the Home Counties are wildly exaggerated, if yesterday's placid atmosphere in Epsom Town Hall is any indication. With council tax bandings just released, few residents who dropped in to find out their band were either clamouring to appeal or furious at their likely average bill of Pounds 620, which is less than the average houshold is paying in poll tax. 'If you think about it, councils need the same amount of money as before, so we won't escape it', was a typical response, voiced by Mr Charles Jarman, who paid Pounds 95,000 for a house now worth Pounds 88,000. Like most others, he does not intend to appeal, although his house has been put in Band E, which starts at Pounds 88,000. The borough's treasurer, Mr Trevor Willington, is relaxed about the public response. He said: 'There will obviously be appeals, but people can't appeal until next April, after they get their bills, and when they realise that the gap between the central bands is not much over Pounds 100, I doubt we'll have too much fuss.' The Borough of Epsom and Ewell is a fair barometer of the south-east, outside London. Its northern parts - including Worcester Park, where Mr John Major grew up - are outer suburbia, mostly band D (Pounds 68,000-Pounds 88,000) territory. Move south towards the green belt and band E and F properties abound. Few households are at the extremes - the borough has just 57 properties in band A and 120 in band H. Most residents calling at the town hall seemed happy with the council tax and their banding. Even the disgruntled ones were unsure whether to appeal. Mr Patrick Webb, a sales director with a Pounds 60,000 flat, said: 'It's a Catch-22 situation. If you try to get your property into a lower band, it may backfire when you try to sell it.' One council officer said she would 'certainly' appeal against her own band F (Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 160,000) valuation for a house bought for Pounds 115,000 in November 1987, but said: 'I am very surprised one cannot appeal until April '93. I guess the thought is that a lot of people will have cooled off before then.' Mr Willington said he was 'struck that most people are finding themselves on the band they expected'. The council was not using council tax to boost spending but was anxious to move down to the government's assessment of what it should be spending. It was planning to reduce its budget from Pounds 6m to Pounds 5.6m. A pensioner caught the Epsom mood: 'The poll tax was shocking. Now they have swung the other way, but you will never find a truly fair system.'</p>

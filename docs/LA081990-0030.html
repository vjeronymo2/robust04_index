(I happen to appreciate all six artists in the article  -- both the "lightweights" and the "critically profound and approved.")  </P> <P> There are times when non-political and non-intellectual music can be a  refreshing, feel-good, fun escape from reality!  </P> <P> I can't help but wonder what Hilburn listens to at the beach . . . or is the  beach too mindless an activity?  </P> <P> KENT JAMES  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

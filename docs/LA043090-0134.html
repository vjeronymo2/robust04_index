			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RAIDERS WANT HARRIS, QB'S AGENT SAYS  </P> <P> The agent for former West Virginia quarterback Major Harris says the Raiders  have asked him to suspend negotiations with a Canadian football team.  </P> <P> Ed Abram said Sunday that he and Harris were ready to go to Vancouver for talks  with the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League when the  Raiders contacted him.  </P> <P> "They are serious," Abram told the Dominion Post in an interview published  today.  </P> <P> "(Raiders Coach) Art Shell is going to call me," Abram said. "They have been in  contact often. . . . Things have changed a little. They have asked us to hold  off talks with BC until certain things have happened."  </P> <P> Abram said the Raiders' hiring of former Illinois head coach Mike White as  special projects coach could bode well for Harris, who gave up his final year  of college football eligibility to seek a professional career.  </P> <P> "Mike White is a quarterback coach," Abram said. "He works well with them. . .  . What is more of a special project than Major Harris?"  </P> <P> Abram said the Raiders are "extremely serious" about signing Harris.  </P> <P> "They are the Raiders and they go against the grain on a lot of different  things," Abram said. "All indications are they are not even remotely thinking  about (paying) 12th-round money. That's one of the things that got our  attention. We were told not to worry about 12-round money."  </P> <P> Abram said he is pleased with the way contract negotiations have gone with the  Raiders and the Lions.  </P> <P> "Everybody seems to be concerned and showing that Major is wanted," Abram said.  "At this point we are extremely optimistic that by May 7 or 8 Major will be in  the Raider camp full time or in Vancouver."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICARE TO PAY FOR MAMMOGRAMS IN '90  </P> <P> Medicare will pay for routine mammography tests to detect breast cancer  beginning Jan. 1, under a regulation the government proposed Friday.  </P> <P> Congress authorized Medicare coverage of mammography examinations last year,  making an exception to the law that prohibits Medicare payments for routine  physical checkups.  </P> <P> One of every 10 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetimes, medical  experts say, and elderly women have the highest risk.  </P> <P> "Early detection of breast cancer is essential for effective treatment, and  Medicare coverage will encourage more older women to obtain mammography  screening on a regular basis," said Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of the Health  and Human Services Department.  </P> <P> The regulation, drafted by HHS, was published in Friday's Federal Register.  After 60 days of public comment, a final regulation will be drafted.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HERRICK ESTABLISHED CLEVELAND TRADITION  </P> <P> While visiting friends in the San Fernando Valley recently, I followed the  hiring of Marc Paez as the new basketball coach at Cleveland High with great  interest. As an alumnus and a member of the 1981 City Section 3-A champion  Cavalier basketball team, I find it interesting that your staff writers give  Bob Braswell credit for "establishing one of the most highly regarded programs  in the state."  </P> <P> Bob did a fine job at Cleveland and should be given credit for his efforts. It  was, however, Coach Greg Herrick who built and developed the Cleveland  basketball program to its present status as a prep power. Coach Herrick was the  guiding force behind the success of Bob Braswell, and Bob maintained the fine  tradition that Coach Herrick left behind.  </P> <P> Coach Herrick taught me many things in the two years that I played for him and  he has likewise positively influenced many other young men in his years at  Cleveland -- including Bob Braswell. Give "Braz" his due, but when you talk  about the establishment of the Cleveland dynasty, all credit should be laid at  the feet of my coach -- Greg Herrick.  </P> <P> RON SIMMONS  </P> <P> Cleveland High  </P> <P> Class of 1981  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting Presidential Adviser on Peace Process Manuel  Yan called for understanding and accommodation in order to  advance the peace talks between the government and the Moro  National Liberation Front [MNLF]. Yan, who is also the chairman  of the government negotiating panel with the MNLF said the peace  talks which seek to end the conflict in southern Philippines  should not be derailed by rumors and suspicions. Both sides are  now preparing for the second round of formal talks to be held in  Jakarta, Indonesia.    Published reports said that MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari  resented a statement made by President Ramos, in answer to a  question in a press conference last Monday, regarding possible  MNLF participation in the forthcoming election. Misuari was  also reported as planning to elevate the issue before the  Organization of Islamic Conference or OIC.    Yan said in a statement that this controversy should now be  closed and the peace process given greater momentum by the  spirit of understanding and accommodation. Yan said the  president's statement was never intended to preempt the ongoing  negotiation and that he [Misuari] should not impute sinister  designs to it.    With respect to Misuari's plan to raise the issue with the  OIC, Yan said, it is not necessary. He said the president's  statement was obviously made within the ambit of our national  sovereignty and constitutional processes which OIC charter is  mandated to respect. OIC is not a mediator in the peace talks he  said, but a constructive participant and a partner for peace to  both sides.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Haitian MPs fly back to draft amnesty law US efforts to achieve the first quorum of the Haitian legislature in more than a year looked set to be rewarded as a dozen exiled parliamentarians were flown in for the ceremonial opening of parliament yesterday afternoon. The special session was convened by elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide primarily to pass a law granting amnesty to General Raoul Cedras and the army generals who seized power in a coup three years ago. The military leadership is expected to step down once the law is passed. The meeting yesterday was ceremonial and the business of drafting an amnesty law is due to get under way today. The deployment of US troops around the parliament buildings is a further illustration of the significance the Clinton administration is placing on the amnesty law, which would not only mark the end of military rule but could pave the way for the reconciliation of Aristide supporters and Cedras loyalists. The conspicuous US presence has led to criticism in the Haitian press that the nation's democratic institutions are being violated. As a result, there will be no US army presence inside the chamber. The delicacy of respecting Haitian sovereignty while sending in servicemen to secure its legislature even tripped up the deft Mr Stanley Schrager, US embassy spokesman, who said: 'We need a quorum, no, they need a quorum.' He added: 'It (the parliament) is a Haitian institution. It's a convocation of the very important Haitian parliament.' As well as the deputies and senators returning from the US and Canada yesterday morning, US officials were hoping that some of the 13 parliamentarians in hiding in Haiti would also attend. The 82-person Chamber of Deputies has not mustered the necessary 42 US servicemen working side-by-side with Haitian police officers guarding the legislature were expected to bar the 11 senators elected in January 1993 in a poll which the US, among others, believes to have been stage-managed by the Cedras regime. There was considerable interest outside the parliament buildings yesterday as to whether Gen Cedras, who as Haiti's commander-in-chief has the constitutional right to attend the opening of parliament, would come to the session. Mr Bernard Sanzaricq, president of the Senate, was understood to be preparing a draft of the amnesty law, although another draft that was due to be debated last year before its author, the then Justice Minister Guy Mallory, was assassinated, has found favour with a number of deputies and, unofficially, with US embassy officials. President Aristide, in convening parliament, has called on the assembly to debate not only the amnesty but also six other pieces of legislation, including the separation of police and army powers. Continued looting of humanitarian foodstores elsewhere in Port-au-Prince was a further cause of concern to US officials yesterday. The embassy announced that the transport of USAid food had been temporarily stopped, but did not give a date when the lines would be reopened. US army officials would not promise non-governmental organisations army protection, but pledged that the 'US military will not stand idly by while this looting goes on'. Mr Schrager confirmed that the surge in pillaging was a reflection of the breakdown of domestic policing. 'Clearly we are seeing some police stepping back and letting the law and order situation evaporate,' he said, 'but I can't tell whether it's by design or happenstance'.</p>

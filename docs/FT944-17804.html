			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Purdey goes out with a bang James Purdey &amp; Sons, Britain's most famous sporting gunmaker, is giving up its independence nearly 200 years after James Purdey set up shop in London's Piccadilly. The company yesterday announced that it was being sold for an undisclosed sum to Vendome, the luxury goods group which owns Dunhill and Cartier. The deal, which sees Purdey's ultimate ownership transferring to a Swiss holding company, mirrors the sale of Purdey's leading rival Holland &amp; Holland to Chanel for Pounds 11m in 1989. Vendome and Purdey would provide no further details of the deal, which, because of its size, was not the subject of an official announcement. But the companies stressed that Purdey would 'continue its activities entirely unchanged' under the chairmanship of the Hon Richard Beaumont. Founded in 1818, Purdey has always aimed at the top end of the market, with its best double-gun then costing about Pounds 55. Today the price would be closer to Pounds 40,000. Even so, there are 100 customers on an 18-month waiting list. Purdey has had a somewhat chequered financial history, suffering particularly from difficulties in extracting prompt payment from its upper-class customers. In the founder's day, the company occasionally waited 10 years between the sale and final payment. Based in Mayfair, the company now makes guns, rifles and cartridges, sells a range of shooting accessories and runs a shooting school. Vendome was formed in August last year by combining the luxury goods interests of Richemont, the Swiss holding company based on the South African Rupert family's stake in cigarette group Rothmans. In addition to Dunhill and Cartier, Vendome owns watch makers Piaget and Baume Mercier, Montblanc pens and Chloe, the fashion and perfume house. More recently it has bought Karl Lagerfeld's women's fashion business and the UK traditional menswear company Hackett. Vendome, which is 70 per cent owned by Richemont, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 196m in the year to March, down 5 per cent.</p>

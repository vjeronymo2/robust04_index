			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Kenneth Grob, man at centre of scandal: Obituary MR KENNETH GROB, one of the main figures in the scandals that hit Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, in the 1980s has died, aged 70. Mr Grob was chairman of the Alexander Howden insurance broking group when millions of pounds of funds were found to be missing after the group was taken over in 1982 by Alexander &amp; Alexander, the US insurance broker. The affair was one of the main cases that prompted a reform of the regulatory environment at Lloyd's. Mr Grob and his co-defendant Mr Ian Posgate, a Lloyd's underwriter, were brought to trial in 1989 accused of siphoning off funds to private accounts through a network of offshore companies. Mr Grob, who faced 16 charges of theft, and Mr Posgate, were acquitted on all counts at the end of a 15-week trial. The trial stemmed from the Pounds 150m takeover of Alexander Howden. A post-acquisition audit revealed the shortfall in assets. However, a report into the affair by the Department of Trade and Industry heavily censured Mr Grob for misuse of reinsurance schemes to transfer money. Mr Grob was flamboyant as chairman of Alexander Howden, when he would dispense champagne in silver goblets to visitors, in offices in Leadenhall Street known as the 'Hanging Gardens of Howden' because of their extravagance. He started work in Lloyd's at the age of 16 and spent all his working life there, except for wartime service in the RAF.</p>

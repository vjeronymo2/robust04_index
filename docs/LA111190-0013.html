			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SET YOUR VCR  </P> <P> Come and See (Bravo Sunday at 10 p.m.) Eminent Soviet director Elam Klimov's  ambitious, grueling 1985 film depicts the savagery of the Germans in  Byelorussia during World War II through the eyes of a sturdy peasant youth  (Alexei Kravchenko) eager to join the brave Soviet partisans. A bold, stylized,  largely successful attempt to make a familiar story fresh.  </P></p>

Today the Austrian Temelin  delegation returned from Washington. The Greens want to  continue intervention in Washington, while the federal  chancellor is against the so-called permanent lobbying by the  Austrian side. There is, however, agreement that the Austrian  efforts in Washington have had a positive effect.    [Vranitzky] They have objectively become better, even though  one cannot yet say anything for sure at the moment.    [Czoeppan] What will happen next? Will Austria pursue a  kind of permanent lobbying strategy on Temelin?    [Vranitzky] Well, it will probably not be permanent  lobbying, but we will certainly take advantage of the chances  that we still have, which is why Professor Heindler stayed  there. As new information comes in, I will decide whether or  not we will engage in other activities. [passage omitted]</p>

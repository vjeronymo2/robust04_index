A  candidate for the position of chairman of a Soviet is considered  elected when the requirements stipulated for a candidate for  deputy are met, provided that no less than ten percent of the  voters who are entered on the list of voters voted for him.    3. The elections of deputies and chairmen of Soviets are  deemed not to have taken place if less than half of the overall  number of voters entered on the lists of voters took part in  them, as well as owing to the withdrawal of all of the  candidates registered in a district (the territory of a Soviet).    4. The district (territorial) election commission may deem  an  election invalid both for individual electoral precincts and for  the district (territory of the Soviet) as a whole, if violations  of this Law that had an effect on the results of the voting were  committed in the course of the voting or during the counting of  the votes.

Chernomyrdin's expected speech in the Federation  Council did not take place 3 February.    The prime minister's refusal to come and give information  about government policy was regarded by the senators not only as  a lack of respect for the upper house of parliament but also as  a political gesture.    It was maybe the first time the deputies had used such harsh  terms in demanding that V. Shumeyko explain why the meeting was  shelved. In response the speaker cited the most diverse  arguments. Specifically, that without a discussion of this  question at a special government session Chernomyrdin's speech  would be of an unofficial nature and would reflect his personal  viewpoint. That a session of the Cabinet of Ministers Presidium  had begun on the morning of 3 February. In addition, it was  learned that the premier is flying to Minsk in the evening while  O. Soskovets, his first deputy, is in Georgia. And that Economy  Minister A. Shokhin will speak in the Federation Council.    Shumeyko reminded all his colleagues that it is his job as  speaker to conduct sessions and keep order, not to deliver the  premier there.    But Shumeyko's arguments merely added fuel to the fire: Even  sterner words followed from the microphones -- about the  Federation Council's role and place in Russia's political life.  For example, a deputy from Udmurtia said that he is not greatly  concerned by what is happening in Belarus -- right now there is  a crisis situation in his own Udmurtia and in Russia as a whole:  "We want to know our government's actions in the next few days."    After a heated debate the senators again instructed the  speaker to hold talks with the premier and to inform him during  the recess of the house's insistent wish to see him on the  Federation Council platform on 3 February.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / People: Educated moves The appointment of Sir Ron Dearing as chairman of the new School Curriculum and Assessment Authority has initiated a reshuffle at the top of three powerful education quangos. Sir Ron, who was chairman of the Post Office Corporation between 1981 and 1987, is currently chairman of the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The Schools Authority will be responsible from October for the national curriculum in England and Wales and for the compulsory tests administered to all schoolchildren at 7, 11, 14 and 16. It replaces the National Curriculum Council (NCC) and the School Examinations and Assessment Council (SEAC), whose chairmen, David Pascall and Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach respectively, will stand down on April 19 so that Sir Ron can chair both through the transition. This will be the second time Dearing has performed such a role: he was chairman of both the Universities Funding Council and the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council when they merged to form the Higher Education Funding Council. The new chairman of the Higher Education Funding Council for England is to be Brandon Gough, chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. A chartered accountant, Gough became chairman of the accountancy firm at the unusually young age of 45, and saw it through the merger with Deloitte's. He is currently chairman of the Doctors' and Dentists' Pay Review Body and a member of the Financial Reporting Council. One more vacancy remains to be filled in the education world: a chairman for the new Funding Agency for Schools, set up to dispense funds to opted-out schools, is to be announced shortly.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SADNESS FOR A SEARCHER  </P> <P> On reading Gregg Barrios' moving portrait of his long-lost heroine, Carol  Ohmart, ("The Last Starlet," Jan. 1 and 8), I felt very moved -- and very sad.  But my sadness was not for Ohmart.  </P> <P> The actress' scapegoats were anything and anyone within reach -- she blamed her  mother, the system, the Hollywood of the '50s, the producers.  </P> <P> The real victim in this story of fading dreams and fallen stardom is the  writer, Barrios. How let down he must have felt when he discovered that his  childhood fantasy turned out to be anything but the pure beauty queen with a  heart as golden as her yellow hair. What a shock to discover that the object of  one's former fan club was a weak, bitter woman who delighted in turning her  back on society and blaming others for her shortcomings.  </P> <P> I'm sorry, Mr. Barrios. Instead of searching so long and hard to find the  answer to "whatever happened to Carol Ohmart," I think it might have been  better to let the sleeping dogs lie -- or in this case, an image that really  stopped existing back in 1958.  </P> <P> ARLENE GREENE  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Challenge of manufacturing Sir, With such age and distinction, Henry Grunfeld's words are likely to be taken seriously ('Still warning and encouraging', May 31). Thus, it is a pity that he thinks that in industry 'it's more or less the same every day'. I can think of no more exciting and rewarding a career than running a world business with new markets, products, technologies, customers, exchange rates and people challenging the management intellectually and physically almost daily, while focusing on the creation and provision of resources for long-term sustainable success.

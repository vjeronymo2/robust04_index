			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- A senior Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) member presented Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on  Wednesday [15 June] with a petition calling for the next general  election to be held under the new electoral system approved by  the Diet earlier this year.    The petition was signed by LDP lawmaker Yuji Tsushima and  305  other House of Representatives legislators, or more than half of  the 511 lower house members.    The new electoral system combining 300 single-seat  constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats has yet  to be implemented pending passage of a bill defining the  electoral districts.    Hata told Tsushima and other petitioners that he fully  agrees  with the thrust of their petition, officials said.    He called on proponents of the new electoral system to work  together in their respective capacities to see it realized.    Tsushima, deputy chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs  Research Council, paid calls later in the day on leaders of the  Social Democratic Party, New Party Sakigake, the Democratic  Socialist Party and Komeito, as well as lower house Speaker  Takako Doi.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Fowler to review claims on spending CONSERVATIVE Central Office is to look into claims the party spent significantly more than it disclosed under electoral law on by-elections in the run-up to the 1992 general election, David Owen writes. Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, told a Blackpool press conference he would try to find papers detailing the overspending, referred to in The Times newspaper. The newspaper said it had seen unpublished and confidential documents showing the party spent more than Pounds 300,000 - 50 per cent more than budgeted - on six by-elections up to November 1991. The party said it had adhered to legal limits on the amount it could spend on the promotion of its by-election candidates. It said suggestions in the same article that there was an apparent Pounds 7m 'hole' in the party's 1992 accounts were unfounded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Position of the Kuwaiti Rulers and Their </F> Supporters and the Correct Conclusions"]    [Text] The speaker of the Kuwaiti parliament has rejected a  proposal by Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the Iraqi National  Assembly, expressing the Iraqi Assembly's readiness to discuss  with a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation all outstanding issues  in order to serve the Arab national cause, achieve stability,  and avoid the conflicts certain well-known quarters are trying  to foster.    Important facts have been revealed by the Iraqi call for  dialogue and the Kuwaiti parliamentary speaker's rejection of  this call. It is up to sincere and honest Arabs everywhere to  draw the right conclusions from these two stands, especially in  the current difficult Arab situation in which Arab national  interests need earnest, sincere, and responsible endeavors to  solve Arab problems through dialogue and within the Arab  framework.    Any sincere and honest Arab, whether an ordinary citizen or  a  government official, must link the Kuwaiti parliamentary  speaker's stand with ill intentions, introversion, lack of  desire to solve problems through dialogue and within the Arab  framework, and more open dependence on foreign powers and their  trusteeship over the region.    This is nothing strange for the Kuwaiti rulers and their  supporters. They created the crisis through their own policies  and liaisons, refused to resolve it through dialogue within the  Arab framework, and then rushed for the help of the foreigner.    Arabs, Iraqis, and Kuwaitis will recall that recent events  revealed the facts that Jabir instructed Sa'd [al-'Abdallah] on  the eve of the Jeddah meeting not to reach an agreement and to  go to the UN Security Council, rather than use an Arab framework  within the Arab League. Developments confirm how the stands of  the Kuwaiti rulers and their supporters were selfish, mean,  introverted, incomprehensible, and arrogant.    Those stands, which did not help Kuwait and which in fact  harmed the Arab stand, were and still are contrary to the Iraqi  stand. Thus, the Iraqi National Assembly's readiness for  dialogue with a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation is based on a  responsible Iraqi stand that has tried by every means to resolve  differences through dialogue and to find an Arab solution to the  crisis that serves the higher Arab national interests and  protects Arab national security.    The difference between the two stands reveals many of the  facts about the previous phase and how Iraq's pan-Arab stands  were serious and open-minded. Leader President Saddam Husayn  presented the dispute with Kuwait during a closed session of the  extraordinary Baghdad summit in a fraternal, calm, and  responsible spirit marked by wisdom, courage, and patience.  Iraq presented the dispute to the Arab League in a memo  addressed by the Iraqi foreign minister on 16 July 1990. A day  later, Iraq's leader warned in his speech on the anniversary of  the 17 July revolution of the dangers of the continuous harm  being done by the Kuwaiti rulers. Throughout the weeks that  preceded and followed 2 August 1990, Iraq took initiatives and  responded to others in order to resolve the dispute through a  dialogue within an Arab framework. However, the Kuwaiti rulers  and their supporters followed a course different from that of  the nation and brotherhood.    Sincere and honest Arabs everywhere are facing these facts  anew. They can, after all that has happened, draw the correct  conclusions and call a spade a spade. The Kuwaiti rulers and  their supporters still reject the resolution of these  differences through dialogue within the Arab framework. By  holding to that suspicious rejection and continuing to maintain  an atmosphere of panic, fear, and lies to justify their alliance  with the foreigner and the continued presence of U.S. forces on  Kuwaiti territory, they are serving their overlords who are  exploiting the Kuwaiti rulers. They will continue to be the  ones who determine when and how to provoke or permit the  provocation of wars and seditions and guarantee placing the  region into the wolf's mouth, as leader President Saddam Husayn  said on 17 July 1990.    The Kuwaiti rulers and their supporters continue on the path  of crisis, divisions, and dispute, while Iraq continues its  honest and responsible pan-Arab stands which sincerely seek to  resolve all outstanding issues and serve the Arab cause.    This makes it the duty of honest men in Kuwait and sincere  and honest Arabs everywhere to confront the Kuwaiti rulers'  suspect course, which is doing more harm to the region and the  nation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- Kim Ki-nam, secretary  of the Central Committee [C.C.] of the Workers' Party of  Korea[WPK], made a speech at the national seminar held here  Thursday upon the lapse of 30 years since the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il began working at the C.C., the WPK.    He said the main fruition of the leadership of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il over the past three decades since he  began to work at the WPK Central Committee is that he has  strengthened and developed the WPK to be an ever-victorious  revolutionary party of chuche type and to be authoritative  vanguard of the world socialist movement standing in the  foreground of modern history.    Noting that the dear leader's idea and theory of party  building are the immortal banner of the building of the  revolutionary party of chuche type, he said:    His idea and theory of party building serve as the guideline  that, first of all, indicates the most correct way of building  the working-class party as a leading political organization for  realising the idea and guidance of the leader.    The dear leader gave the famous formulation that the  working-class party is, in essence, the party of the leader,  basing himself on the stark fact that the WPK was founded and  has been strengthened and developed by the great leader  President Kim Il-song and on the principle of the chuche  philosophy that the oneness of the ideology, leadership and  unity must be ensured in the socio-political organism with the  leader, its brain, in the centre.    Having formulated the essence and mission of the  working-class party with the leader in the centre, he set it as  the fundamental principle of party building to establish a  monolithic ideological system in the whole party, thus becoming  the first in history to indicate a correct way of building the  party as the leader's.    His idea and theory of party building are a guideline that  shows the most correct way of building the working-class party  as a genuine party of the people which assumes responsibility  for their destiny and serves them.    The working-class party is necessary for the people and only  when it is united with the people in one mind, it has viability  -- this is the basic stand of the dear leader toward the party  building.    The dear leader has established chuche-based principles and  mode of politics with benevolent politics and magnanimous  politics as the main point and gave a full exposition of the  revolutionary method of party work and popular working style.    The immortal significance of his idea and theory of party  building also lies in that they are the guideline which  indicates the most correct way of building the working-class  party as an independent and creative party.    The dear leader has held high the banner of chuche, the  banner of independence and creation in party building and party  activities, wholly inheriting the idea and will of the respected  leader President Kim Il-song, who had hewn the path of  independence and creation under the banner of the great chuche  idea.    With the dear leader's idea and theory of building an  independent and creative party successfully realized, the WPK  has been strengthened and developed to be the most dignified and  authoritative party of chuche that maintains our way in the  organizational and ideological work and in the establishment of  leadership art and shapes and carries out the revolutionary line  and policies of the party in our way.    Indeed, the dear leader's idea and theory of party building  are an ideological and theoretical summing up of the historical  experience and lesson gained in the communist movement in the  20th century and the building of working-class party and an  immortal banner of the revolutionary party building in the era  of chuche.</p>

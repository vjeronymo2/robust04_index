			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: CONCERNED USD BRACES FOR SANTA BARBARA  </P> <P> Two dates in the past year make tonight's (7:30) basketball game against UC  Santa Barbara a worrisome one for University of San Diego Coach Hank Egan. The  other date proves anything can happen in the early portion of the college  basketball season.  </P> <P> On Dec. 3, 1988, USD barely had its warm-ups off before UCSB assumed leads of  11 and 22 points en route to a 76-58 romp in Goleta. It was one of USD's few  lopsided losses of an 8-20 season.  </P> <P> On Saturday, a similar script favored UCSB over Pepperdine, 67-46, in both  team's season opener. Pepperdine is picked by some to win the West Coast  Conference.  </P> <P> In the preseason, UCSB lost to Athletes in Action, 85-81. The Toreros beat AIA,  85-84.  </P> <P> UCSB finished 21-9 in 1988-89, including a first-round loss in the National  Invitation Tournament. In the Pepperdine game, the Gauchos were led by Gary  Gray who had a career-high 24 points. Eric McArthur had 15 points and 11  rebounds. UCSB, which has won 20 of its last 21 nonconference games,  out-rebounded the Waves, 42-27.  </P> <P> USD won its opener against Cal Lutheran, 82-46. USD's John Jerome had 15  points, Dondi Bell 13 and Gylan Dottin 12. UCSB leads the series, 7-4.  </P> <P> MEN'S TENNIS  </P> <P> The San Diego All-College tournament begins today and runs through Saturday at  the University of San Diego. The tournament is open to all full-time college  students in the San Diego area.  </P> <P> USD sophomore Jose Luis Noriega (No. 6 in the Volvo/ITCA Collegiate rankings)  is the defending singles and doubles champion (with teammate David Stewart).  </P> <P> The top-seeded players all received first-round byes, but La Jolla's fifth and  sixth-seeded players both advanced in the men's 45 singles of the Beach Club  Invitational at the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club.  </P> <P> No. 5 Bob Seymour defeated Tom Laughlin of Del Mar, 7-5, 6-3, and No. 6 Bill  Bond ousted San Diego's Joe Hathaway, 7-5, 6-1. The second round continues  today. JIM LINDGREN  </P></p>

McCowin,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;151),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Food and Drug Administration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 200 C St. SW.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, DC 20204,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 202&hyph;205&hyph;4561.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 8, 1990, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub L. 101&hyph;535) (the 1990 amendments) was enacted. This new law amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number of important ways. One of the most notable aspects of the 1990 amendments is that they added section 403(q) to the act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)). This section provides that, with certain exceptions, a food_that is, both a food in conventional form and a dietary supplement of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances_is misbranded unless its label or labeling bears certain nutrition information (nutrition labeling).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 amendments, however, also provide an exemption from mandatory nutrition labeling for small businesses. Section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act provides that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [I]f a person offers food for sale and has annual gross sales made or business done in sales to consumers which is not more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers which is not more than $50,000, the requirements of subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) [the provisions that establish the nutrition labeling requirement] shall not apply with respect to food sold by such person to consumers unless the label or labeling of food offered by such person provides nutrition information or makes a nutrition claim. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60376), in a document entitled ``Food Labeling; Reference Daily Intakes and Daily Reference Values; Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision'' (hereinafter referred to as ``the mandatory nutrition labeling proposal''), FDA proposed to reflect this provision of the 1990 amendments in &sect;101.9(j)(1) of its regulations (21 CFR 101.9(j)(1)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many comments to the mandatory nutrition labeling proposal stressed that the dollar exemption limits that FDA proposed to implement in the 1990 amendments were too low. The comments argued that the sum of the analytical, printing, and other costs of nutrition labeling are prohibitively expensive for low-volume products. FDA found that these comments were persuasive, and that some adjustment to this exemption was necessary. Additionally, FDA participated in a series of public forums that had been scheduled by the United States Department of Agriculture to discuss the small business issue. These forums were held in May 1992 in Kansas City, MO; Atlanta, GA; and San Francisco, CA. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19410), FDA announced its participation in the public forums and requested comment on a number of issues concerning exemption of food products of small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency compiled the information that it received in response to the notice and at the public forums. This information helped form the basis for the agency's ``Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the Regulations Implementing the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990'' (Ref. 1). FDA announced the public availability of this analysis in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36205).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In adopting the exemption for food labeled by small businesses in its final rule on nutrition labeling of January 6, 1993, entitled ``Food Labeling: Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision, Format for Nutrition Label'' (58 FR 2079 at 2144) (hereinafter referred to as ``the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule''), FDA stated that it was constrained by the requirements of section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act. Therefore, the agency adopted the exemption for small business, as it had proposed the exemption, as part of the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule in &sect;101.9(j)(1)(i). This exemption (as corrected on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 44063 at 44083)) states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Food [is exempt from &sect;101.9  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Nutrition labeling of food <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  when] offered for sale by a manufacturer, packer, or distributor who has annual gross sales made or business done in sales to consumers that is not more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers of not more than $50,000,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Provided <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The agency stated, however, that it would make changes in &sect;101.9 with respect to products labeled by small businesses if Congress were to amend the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

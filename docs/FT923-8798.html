			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Third Guinness trial is postponed THE TRIAL of Mr Thomas Ward, the US lawyer and former non-executive director of Guinness, has been delayed until January 11 next year. The trial was due to start at the Old Bailey in London in October. However, Mr Justice Turner, the judge, agreed to allow Mr Ward more time to prepare his defence. Mr Ward faces charges of theft of Pounds 5.2m and false accounting in connection with the Pounds 2.7bn Guinness bid for Distillers. The trial will mark the end of prosecutions in the Guinness affair. However, Lord Spens, a former corporate finance director at Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank, has been granted a judicial review, set for November, of the decision at the second Guinness trial not to acquit him nor to award him costs. That followed the Serious Fraud Office's decision not to proceed against Lord Spens after the collapse of the trial due to the mental strain placed upon his co-defendant, Mr Roger Seelig, a former Morgan Grenfell corporate financier.</p>

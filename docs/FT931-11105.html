			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Accountancy Column: Environmental auditing still awaits its green signal - The challenges facing the measurement of ecological issues on the balance sheet DAYS BEFORE the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this past June, Greenpeace's ship, the Rainbow Warrior, blockaded Aracruz Celulose's port in Brazil. Activists had turned up to confront the chairman of the world's largest exporter of bleached eucalyptus pulp, who was speaking at a conference of the Business Council for Sustainable Development in Rio. At stake was the new concept of 'sustainable development' he was promoting, and for which the United Nations is now trying to draw up an accounting standard. In a publication released for the conference, Aracruz declared that its pulp production methods demonstrated that 'enlightened environmental and social stewardship can be combined with corporate profitability'. Greenpeace claims this is not really what Aracruz is doing. Near the port they were blockading, Aracruz grows eucalyptus trees which it harvests for wood every seven years. The company claims that new eucalyptus forests it had planted are regenerating the local economy and the environment. But forest campaigners for Greenpeace say that Aracruz's forests are eucalyptus monocultures that destroy topsoil, water tables and biodiversity. They also say that Aracruz omits to mention that the land it now harvests belonged to the native Tupiniquim people and was handed over by a former military regime which claimed the local people were not natives. These are a few of the issues with which accounting for sustainable development is fraught. Its proponents argue that the newly-emerging field of environmental accounting is only the tip of the iceberg. Groups like Greenpeace say it is not enough to increase forest cover; only by including issues such as the types of forests, their effect on the environment and the impact on the local community can the full picture of corporate performance emerge. A traditional set of accounts shows financial profits and losses. It takes into account the depreciation of tangible assets acquired, certain intangibles like goodwill, and sets aside provisions against disasters or liabilities. New environmental standards say that it should also reflect expenditure of natural resources like air or soil. If a toxic substance is emitted, there could be a future cost that would affect the traditional balance sheet. This impact might include respiratory problems caused by the emissions, or even loss of life. The latest accounts of the chemical manufacturers Monsanto noted that it had doubled its balance sheet liability for cleaning up its toxic wastes in the last financial year from Dollars 120m to Dollars 245m, for instance. Kristin Dawkins, an analyst at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minneapolis, who has been developing a model for what she calls 'full cost accounting', explains that even this approach to accounting for future liabilities is not sufficient. She stresses the importance of other factors that cannot be identified so easily. She says there can be a vast difference between the market's valuation of social and ecological impacts, and a community's definition of the non-market value of the same resources. The full value of a particular log would be different for a furniture company, the timber industry, and a Amazonian Kayapo Indian living in the forest, for example. Simply replacing a mahogany tree with eucalyptus is good enough for the timber company, which will return to harvest the tree seven years later. In succeeding years, if the soil continues to produce eucalyptus, the company gets its share of wood every seven years. Likewise the furniture company is satisfied with the same return. But for the Kayapo, the eucalyptus tree has few leaves and adds very little value to the soil. By contrast, the traditional Brazilian rainforest trees decompose and add organic material that supports millions of other plants and animals on which the Indians depend for food and medicine. These environmental issues are gradually beginning to be tackled by some accountants. Daniel Rubenstein, of the Canadian Auditor General's office in Ottawa, has been attempting to develop green standards. He says that companies should present separate environmental balance sheets so that analysts and shareholders can compare the protective measures taken by different businesses. Resources that are used and returned in their original state, such as a factory site, can be considered 'borrowed'. While they are being used, the company will have to pay a 'price' for the dangers of contamination. Oil companies will have large 'expenses' for transporting oil over the sea, for instance, but they can write off the liability once it is sold. Rubenstein's work was partly commissioned by the United Nations' Transnational Corporations and Management Division in New York. Lorraine Ruffing, the chief of its accounting section, says there is now similar work beginning on green accounting in Britain and at the European Community in Brussels. But her the latest project, which is being developed by Harris Gleckman in the environmental department of the same UN division, will try take the issue still further towards the approach suggested by Dawkins. In the case of an oil company, that would mean taking into account what happens to the oil after it has been sold. This is called 'full life-cycle accounting', by which a company must reflect the impact of a product from cradle to grave. Ernst Callenbach, an adviser on eco-auditing for the Elmwood Institute in Berkeley, California, says: 'Companies need to be viewed as living, breathing and excreting organisms. We have to look at everything that goes in and everything that goes out.' One company that employs these ideas is a Danish textile manufacturer called Novotex. It analysed the environmental impact of every stage of the production of cotton T-shirts, covering every detail of cultivation, such as the use of pesticides, fertiliser, irrigation, defoliant, transportation and the working conditions of labourers. The same comprehensive thinking was applied to spinning the raw cotton, knitting the thread into fabric, dyeing, shirt manufacturing, possible recycling, and finally its destruction. Other companies attempting to scrutinise the full costs include Esprit, which has started a line of more environmentally-responsible clothing, and the Swiss corporation Ecover, which manufactures washing liquids and even cautions consumers against using too much of its product  - a novel but effective marketing technique. But most such experiments are still at a very early stage. Novotex readily admits that it still has 'a lot of goals ahead'. For some companies, the choices are also much more difficult. Extractive industries clearly cannot replace the minerals they take from the earth, for instance. In many cases, the potential future environmental significance may remain unclear. For instance, loggers had cut down all but the last few clumps of the Pacific Yew  - once known as a 'trash tree'  - before researchers discovered that its bark could treat breast cancer. How does an accountant or an actuary work out the possible benefits of this discovery? The only way is to ensure that no stocks of natural 'capital' are completely depleted. That goal is many years off.</p>

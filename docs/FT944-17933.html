			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Greece moves on telecom sale Greece's Socialist government has proposed legislation clearing the way for the partial privatisation of OTE, the state telecoms monopoly, by the end of the year. The government hopes to raise some Dr350bn (Pounds 917m) through floating 25 per cent of the company on the Athens stock exchange. Some 7 per cent will be offered to local investors, while the remaining 18 per cent is to be sold to institutional investors abroad. The new law, expected to be approved by parliament this month, restructures the company as a public corporation and provides for sharp increases in domestic tariffs over the next three years, aimed at boosting OTE's revenues by Dr100bn yearly. But management will remain under government control, with six out of 11 board members being appointed by the state. The law does not make any provision for appointing an international telecom operator as a technical consultant. Local analysts described the legislation as a compromise designed to appease OTE's unions, which are opposed to the flotation. But they said the appointment of a technical adviser was seen as crucial to the flotation's success.</p>

Foreign Trade Minister  Roberto Rojas indicated that with the treaty "an increase in  Costa Rican exports to Mexican markets is anticipated," which  could bring in from $60 million annually to nearly $250 million  in 1996.    This Thursday, Costa Rica and Mexico announced the  conclusion  of negotiations that began in August 1991, as well as the  signing of an agreement by next April. The Costa Rican official  stated that when the treaty enters into effect on 1 January  1995, it will be possible to freely export products such as  televisions, electrical energy distribution equipment, and dry  batteries. Items that will benefit from zero customs tax also  include polyester filaments used in textile manufacturing,  motorcycle safety helmets, and safety deposit boxes.    "Likewise, preferences deriving from a partial extension  agreement that includes 150 customs items with a five-percent  maximum tax were also consolidated." Among the items included in  this category are glass bottles, aluminum products, rubber  tires, leather suitcases and wallets, leather shoes, and wood  doors.    Rojas added that the Costa Rican textile industry was  favored  with a $5 million quota for clothing garments which is expected  to increase each year by 15 percent. The minister emphasized  that in the areas of intellectual property rights and services  guarantees the Costa Rican system "will not have to be  substantially modified."    The document establishes that "Mexican investment, already  present in the country for several years now, will continue to  be encouraged in Costa Rica."    Rojas emphasized that this agreement is the result of  several  months of negotiations and close coordination between both  countries' governments and private sectors. "All things  considered, the agreement places us in the forefront of the  political map of those Latin American countries that are drawing  closer to the path of hemispheric integration," the Costa Rican  official commented.    The bilateral treaty includes chapters on areas covering  market access, guidelines for country of origin, unfair trading  practices, services, investments, solving disputes, purchases  from the public sector, and intellectual property, among others.    Costa Rican businessmen pointed out that the treaty will  facilitate greater trade flow under conditions of openness,  equality, and mutual benefit for Mexico as well as for Costa  Rica. They stressed that Costa Rica was able to ensure that the  principle of asymmetry was reflected in terms of customs  preferences for the entry of most Costa Rican products into  Mexico and the purchase of Mexican raw materials with zero taxes.    With respect to the guidelines which will determine the  origin of the items included in the treaty, local businessmen  indicated that the Raw Material Regional Integration Committee  (CIRI) was established. It will be responsible for evaluating  and solving any disputes related to the supply of regional raw  materials.</p>

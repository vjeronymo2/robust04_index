			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: THOUSAND OAKS BANS STREET SALE OF USED CARS  </P> <P> The Thousand Oaks City Council has banned the sale of used cars along a  six-mile stretch of Thousand Oaks Boulevard because a study showed that the  activity posed a safety hazard.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously Tuesday to prohibit owners from displaying their  cars for sale on Thousand Oaks Boulevard between Lakeview Canyon and Moorpark  roads. About 90 cars were parked along the thoroughfare each weekend, causing  drivers to double-park and slowing traffic, said Jano Baghdanian, the city's  traffic engineer.  </P> <P> The council also approved an ordinance that gives the city the authority to ban  car sales on other streets if a study shows there are safety problems.  </P> <P> The council is studying a proposal to allow public use of a city parking lot to  sell cars on weekends.  </P></p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: GE dips 1.6% in wake of charge General Electric, which this week revealed that a phantom trading scheme at its Kidder Peabody investment bank would depress first-quarter profits, yesterday announced a 1.6 per cent dip in net earnings after taking a Dollars 210m charge over the Kidder embarrassment. The group reported earnings of Dollars 1.068bn, or Dollars 1.25 a share, down from Dollars 1.085bn, or Dollars 1.27, in the same period of last year. The non-cash Kidder charge worked through at 25 cents a share, of which 16 cents, or Dollars 139m, was related to trading activities in previous quarters. Excluding the charge, GE's figures were in line with Wall Street expectations and were struck on revenues which rose 10 per cent to Dollars 14.2bn. Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said nothing had changed the fundamental global strengths of the business 'and with innovative new product introductions and our increasing international market penetration, we remain committed to deliver record earnings for the year'. The group's operating margin rose in the quarter to 12.5 per cent from last year's 12 per cent. GE said six businesses, including the NBC television network, appliances, motors and electric distribution and control, had improved their margin rates by more than a point. GE Capital's reported earnings rose 20 per cent, led by retailer financing, commercial real estate, auto leasing, financial guaranty insurance and commercial equipment financing. However, the profits of GE's entire financial services operations fell sharply to Dollars 330m because of the charge.</p>

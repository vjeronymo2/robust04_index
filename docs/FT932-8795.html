			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Spanish Government Bonds: Corset is stripped off and abandoned EVERYTHING the Spanish bond market had been piously taught to expect for as long as anybody cares to remember has to be unlearnt. Restrictive monetary policy has been turned on its head and what bond traders had come to call the corset has been stripped off and abandoned. The 8 per cent devaluation of the peseta last Thursday, followed by a 1.5 point cut in the official intervention rate at the end of the week, prompted long bond yields to fall by about 40 basis points and left everybody wondering what would happen next. Guessing games on this scale have not been part of the domestic fixed income scenario for a long time. Devaluation was not a surprise. The peseta had been realigned downwards in the European Monetary System by 5 per cent last September and by a further 6 per cent in November. It was not a question of whether the currency would be devalued for a third time, but of when it would be again forced to take the plunge. What was new this time was the interest rate cut. This had not occured on the previous occasions as the authorities continued to preach strict orthodoxy in the face of the twin demons of inflationary temptations and immoderate wage rises. At the end of last week, the Bank of Spain appeared to be throwing caution to the wind. It lowered rates on the back of a month-on-month consumer price index rise of 0.4 per cent, the biggest April inflation rise for four years, at a time when the wage agreements were running at about 6 per cent. Market watchers had to look no further than the June 6 date for general elections to find an explanation for such uncharacteristic behaviour. Faced with a strong challenge at the polls, the government seems determined to cut and run - which is exactly what it had previously insisted it would not do. The about-turn raises all sorts of questions that bond investors in Spain have virtually forgotten how to ask. For a start, it is possible that given the current official mood, short-term interest rates will be allowed to fall very quickly. It is anybody's guess how much the rates will be brought down by an outgoing government that is rightly appalled by a recession that has wiped out more than 500,000 jobs in the past six months and which continues to destroy them at the rate of some 3,000 a day. Yet how far can monetary indiscipline go when there is the looming threat of imported inflation? The April inflation figure would have been worse had food prices not remained static. Rise in service prices were sharply up from 7.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent, and underlying inflation remains menacing at 5.8 per cent year-on-year. There is the sort of uncertainty in the air which makes the climate fit only for gamblers. 'We are not advising clients to buy strongly in the short because there are too many political factors,' says Ms Claudine Innes of brokers Maxwell Espinosa. When the votes have been counted after the June 6 election, one of two things will happen. The first is that discipline will return under the aegis of a centre-right coalition government commited to a strong and salutary retrenchment. The second is that, in spite of the collapse of its economic policies last week, the socialist party will manage to scramble back into power, shorn of its majority and bereft of ideas. Under the first scenario there could be a strong rally. Under the second, the currency speculators are likely to have a field day with the peseta.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hugo Caligaris: "The PJ Needs More Air To </F> Breathe at the Constituent Assembly"]    [Text] Not everything has been decided. The convention will  take up changes that were not agreed on at Olivos. The governing  party must win by a wide margin at the ballot box in order to  avoid surprises in connection with constitutional reform.    Regardless of the lead that the polls are giving it, the  Justicialist Party (PJ) needs to win the 10 April elections by a  very wide margin in order to avoid surprises at the future  Constituent Assembly.    Contrary to what people believe, the changes in the new  constitution do not stop with the reelection of the president or  even the so-called core agreement, the "closed package"  containing the measures that Menem and Alfonsin agreed on in the  Olivos pact.    Up to this point the assumption is that Peronists and  Radicals will vote together. It will be interesting to see,  however, when the convention delegates gather in Santa Fe or  Parana, what wording they will use to describe the powers of the  cabinet chief, the election of the third senator, or the  autonomy of the Federal Capital. Each period, each comma will be  examined under a microscope because they may subtly confirm or  distort the spirit of the agreement.    But the changes in the constitution do not stop there. There  is another vast sphere, the 15 issues that Congress has  authorized for discussion by the Constituent Convention, on  which there is no agreement.    The assumption is that the PJ will be able to do as it  pleases on these varied issues, inasmuch as not many people are  daring enough, not even in the UCR [Radical Civic Union] itself,  to deny that the ruling party is going to win. This certainty  will not give way to complete calm until we know whether the PJ  has an absolute majority in the legislature that will take a  scalpel to the Constitution of 1853.    "Yes, we will get 50 percent," the president of the bloc of  deputies, Jorge Matzkin, told LA NACION. If this happens, the  ruling party will have nothing to fear when a vote is taken on  the "uncontrolled," open issues. But there are several people  who are still losing sleep over this. One is Minister Cavallo,  who feels that in this regard the Constituent Assembly could  pose a threat to his economic program.  <H5>  The Federal Issue </H5>   The section "Authorized Issues" is made up of the following  items: 1) Federalism; 2) Municipal autonomy; 3) Mechanisms of  semidirect democracy; 4) Senate approval of officials in  oversight agencies and the Central Bank; 5) Powers of Congress  and the Executive; 6) Ombudsman; 7) The nation's attorney  general; 8) Investigative powers of Congress; 9) International  treaties; 10) Political parties and electoral system; 11)  Environment; 12) Economic and social council; 13) Protection of  customers and consumers; 14) Habeas corpus and amparo; and 15)  Consolidation of terms of office.    There are disagreements between the two major parties on all  of them, but the most striking differences concern various  aspects of item 1.    The UCR insists that the amounts of federal revenue sharing  be indicated expressly in the constitution, in other words, what  percentage of the taxes collected by the federal government  ought to be sent to each province. It also wants to empower the  provinces to conduct international negotiations aimed at taking  out loans or bringing in investment.    Led by Cavallo, the ruling party wants to block such moves  and any under point two (there is a proposal under which cities  would be able to collect and administer their own taxes),  because they could "impair stability."    The provincial parties could play a decisive role in the  vote  on the federal issue if the PJ does not command an absolute  majority and they back the UCR's stand.  <H5>  Further Doubts </H5>   The doubts about what the constitution might look like are  branching out, as the summary below shows.     -  Two mechanisms of "semidirect democracy" will be  introduced, but it is not known what their scope is. The UCR is  an especially strong backer of the "initiative" (a bill backed  by a certain number of signatures of citizens must be taken up  as soon as possible by Congress). The PJ wants the "binding  referendum."    Knowing that they have not done well at the polls lately,  the  people in the largest minority party are afraid that the  administration will call referendums to impose its programs.  "What would happen if there were two or three terrible murders,  and the idea of bringing back the death penalty through a  referendum were raised?" they ask, citing an extreme case.     -  Senate confirmation will be needed for officials in  oversight agencies, but the Radicals do not want this  requirement applied to the auditor general, who henceforth will  be a Radical whom they do not want subject to confirmation by a  PJ-controlled legislature.    -  What powers will the ombudsman have?  As far as the UCR is concerned, he will be able to file suit in  the event of improprieties. The Peronists, as potential targets  of complaints since they are in power, do not go as  far.    -  According to the Radicals, the nation's attorney general (a  post that will be provided for in the next constitution) may be  removed only by impeachment. The PJ wants to leave the door open  so that the president can tell him to leave, as has already  happened.    -  The status of international treaties may be open to  many changes. If they are accorded constitutional rank (that is  to say, higher than a regular law), then various issues related  to human rights could be incorporated into the constitution.    -  The  election system also raises question marks. According to the  Radicals, the current law may be amended only by a two-thirds  majority of Congress. The ruling party accepted this in  principle, and it was written into the "closed package." But  qualifying the issue for unrestricted debate seems linked to the  PJ's desire to eliminate or water down the D'Hont system (which  is proportional) and to assure more generous representation for  electoral majorities.    -  An economic and social council, made up of  businessmen, workers, and representatives of various social  sectors, will be formed. The PJ is pushing this strongly and  wants to give it broad powers, whereas the UCR wants to assign  it only advisory functions.    -  What will be done to consolidate  terms of office? In light of their election winning streak, the  Peronists are proposing that all terms (of the president, the  deputies, and the governors) begin on the same day. In this way  the party that wins an election will have clear political  sailing. The Radicals, who have been losing, want a more gradual  approach.  <H5>  Disagreements in the Constituent Assembly </H5>   Federalism: This is what worries the administration,  especially Minister Cavallo, the most. The Radicals, backed by  the provincial parties, are insistent about setting the amount  of revenue sharing in the constitution and about the provinces  being able to negotiate foreign loans on their own.    Referendum: This will be incorporated into the new  constitution, but the UCR fears that the administration will use  it for purposes of "political manipulation."    Municipal autonomy: The disagreement has to do with whether  cities should be able to set and collect their own taxes and  spend the revenues.    Checks and balances: The PJ wants the auditor general of the  nation (who will be from the opposition) to be confirmed by the  Senate, in which it has a wide majority.    Election system: The UCR is calling for a two-thirds  majority  in Congress to amend the election law. The ruling party's desire  to eliminate or pare back the D'Hont system is hovering over the  issue.    Economic and social council: As far as the PJ is concerned,  this council representing social sectors ought to play a  prominent role. To the Radicals this smacks of "corporativism,"  and they want to "pare back its scope appropriately."</p>

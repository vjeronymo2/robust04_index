			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Fair pay for the teachers YESTERDAY'S PAY review body reports will attract a predictable chorus of disapproval. Some organisations representing the teachers, doctors, nurses and health workers will attack their awards as niggardly. Private sector employers will regard the awards as over-generous at a time when they are being battered by recession. This is in the nature of the pay review process, which must balance the expectations of the people it covers against pressure from the taxpayer and private sector employers to keep increases in public sector pay as low as possible. Independent review bodies offer the most acceptable way of resolving that conflict for teachers, doctors and other large groups in the public service, where government is the sole employer. Central to the pay review process is some form of comparability with private sector pay rates, combined with analysis of turnover and vacancies. But comparability is inevitably backward-looking: this year's pay increase for the public sector reflects last year's increase in the private sector (which in turn is bathed in the glow of last year's rate of inflation). The public sector pay rises above the going rate announced yesterday are only the obverse of public sector pay rises below the going rate when the economy was racing. Scale back The government of the day may find this uncomfortable, especially if it is lecturing employers on the need for prudence. The temptation to scale back this year's awards or phase them in has been resisted - generosity not unconnected with the imminence of an election. The government is to be congratulated on this, however, since the results of such tinkering are all too often low morale and difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff in key public services. These are exactly the problems facing schools in England and Wales, where teachers this year benefit for the first time from an award by an independent review body. Turnover remains at worrying levels: a survey published in December by Manchester University School of Education found that almost one in 20 teachers left teaching in 1989. More than a third of vacant teaching posts attracted three or fewer applicants during the year - with the figure reaching nearly two-thirds in the south-east. Attract recruits There is some comfort in the 90 per cent leap in applications this year for teacher training. But the review body is right to see this as little more than a consequence of the recession. Its task over the next few years will be to ensure that teachers' pay reaches levels which can attract high quality recruits to the profession - and remains at such levels when the economy starts to grow again. There is particular cause for concern in turnover among new entrants to the profession, one in three of whom leave teaching within the first five years. About half of these subsequently return to teaching - often after starting a family - and the education department is investigating what can be done to lure more back. But higher pay may not be the only solution: opportunities for part-time working, job-sharing and childcare schemes all have a part to play. More needs to be done to keep in contact with teachers who have temporarily left employment for family reasons, including courses to keep them in touch. There is scope for further use of targeted incentives for experienced teachers, scarce subjects and hard-to-staff schools. The decision to increase substantially the number of primary schoolteachers who receive extra incentive allowances is a good example of how this can be done. The review body promises to put 'properly designed performance-related pay arrangements' at the top of its priorities for the next year. The aim should be to pay good teachers much more, and edge out the poor performers. But the review body is right to insist that only adequate levels of basic pay will recruit and retain enough teachers of the right calibre. When teaching can attract the very best entrants to the labour market, Britain's schools may score better in Europe's league tables.</p>

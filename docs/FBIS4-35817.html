			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Text] Speaking at a closed forum in Gaza last weekend,  Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn, who the PLO chairman appointed  justice minister in the Palestinian Authority, revealed that the  three Israeli MIA's from the battle of al-Sultan Ya'qub --  Zekharya Baumel, Tzvi Feldman, and Yehuda Katz -- were buried by  a squad belonging to Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir]. According to  him, today there are five other people who know where the bodies  are buried, but he would not name them.    This is the first time such a high-ranking Palestinian  official has admitted that the PLO has information regarding the  three Israeli MIA's from the al-Sultan Ya'aqub battle.  Abu-Middayn's remarks were published in the East Jerusalem  paper AL-QUDS two days ago. According to the paper, Abu-Middayn  said: "Once we find the bodies of the three Israeli soldiers,  the problem of the Palestinian prisoners will be solved."  Abu-Middayn said Israel is willing to release all the  Palestinian prisoners in return for the bodies of the three  soldiers who have been missing since 1982 and stressed that the  problem of the MIA's is on the verge of solution.    Abu-Middayn further said at the Gaza gathering that all the  Palestinian prisoners should be released in view of the Oslo  agreement, "but Israel has reservations about this. It is no  secret that the matter depends on the bodies of the three  Israeli soldiers, which are being held by Palestinians."    Several months ago, the PLO delivered half of MIA Baumel's  dog tag to the defense establishment.    A senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officer has said that  the PLO information on the MIA's is reliable. According to the  officer, it is obvious that the PLO has information regarding  the three MIA's from the al-Sultan Ya'qub battle, and Israel  expects to receive that information.    Defense establishment sources have said that Abu-Middayn's  remarks are interesting but that Israel continues to seek  information about all its MIA's, including those from the  al-Sultan Ya'qub battle. The reference is to the bodies of  MIA's Yosi Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh as well and to information  about captive navigator Ron Arad.    Two years ago, Uri Lubrani, who headed the negotiating team  on the MIA and POW issue, was relieved of this task, and it was  handed over to Major General Yoram Ya'ir, head of the IDF  Personnel Branch.    At present, 8,000 Palestinian prisoners are being held in  IDF  detention facilities. So far, some 2,000 prisoners and  detainees have been released after pledging in writing not to  carry out terror attacks and declaring their support for the  peace process.    At the Gaza gathering, Abu-Middayn further said that the  Palestinian leadership has established a special ministry to  deal with casualties and prisoners. According to him, the  office will handle the rehabilitation of the casualties and  prisoners and take care of their needs. No decision on who will  head this ministry has been made yet.</p>

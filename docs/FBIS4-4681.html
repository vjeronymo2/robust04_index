			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hideaki Kumano, administrative vice minister </F> of international trade and industry, by unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The government is currently  calling for deregulation, but what do you think of the fact that  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has more  regulations than any other government office?    [Kumano] It is not good to evaluate deregulation efforts by  focusing only on the number of regulations. In some cases, the  number increases. For example, although the Gas Industry Law  was recently revised to liberalize the industry, the number of  regulations on the gas industry increased as a result. We have  to promote deregulation while reviewing all systems and  structures which have supported this nation since the end of the  war. MITI has taken a broader view of this issue.  <H5>  A Role for the Market </H5>   [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Since the Meiji era, Japan has pushed  an industrial policy. But because the policy has almost  completed its role, some people are arguing that MITI is no  longer necessary.    [Kumano] It is a matter of course that the framework of  industrial policy changes with the times. The administration's  role is to meet the needs of areas that it takes charge of or to  anticipate these needs. Our major tasks include deciding what  industries should do at a time when systems and structures are  being reviewed, and rectifying price gaps between Japan and  other countries.    The market mechanism forms the basis of industrial  activities. It is very important that the mechanism functions.  The government sometimes creates a big demand or forecasts the  demand. Some people say it is undesirable for the government to  forecast demand, but I do not think so.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] MITI still has two divisions in  charge  of administering iron and steel. Don't you think that the  significance of the existence of bureaus that directly supervise  industries, including the Basic Industries Bureau and the  Machinery and Information Industries Bureau, is decreasing?    [Kumano] MITI has constantly reviewed its structure. What I  want to stress is that no government office in the world covers  broader areas than does MITI. On macroeconomic policies, the  Ministry of Finance [MOF] is in charge of finance, while the  Economic Planning Agency is responsible for coordinating all  policies. Meanwhile, MITI is asked to speak from its position  of covering broad areas. I think that this structure is capable  of contributing to the Japanese economy.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] I think that some government offices  will become obsolete when the roles of the market increase.    [Kumano] The areas supervised by MITI introduced the market  mechanism at an early point. I am confident that I am the best  market theorist in Kasumigaseki. However, market theory is not  100-percent correct. Somebody has to assume the task of  operating markets. I think that politicians and bureaucrats,  who work under politicians, should assume the task.  <H5>  Reduction Not Necessary </H5>   [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Don't you think that government  offices tend to become larger because they have a less-developed  sense of costs compared to the private sector?    [Kumano] While administrative service is provided using the  market mechanism, it is always exposed to the criticism of the  mass media. We should prevent government offices from becoming  larger. But, I do not think that they are getting larger. For  example, there is only one division in charge of the auto  industry, and it is composed of only 10 or so officials.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] But they will not become smaller,  will  they?    [Kumano] If government offices are doing unnecessary things,  we will have to review them. We always accept criticism of  ourselves. We need to reflect on our actions.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think it is necessary for  MITI to become smaller to some extent?    [Kumano] I think it is unnecessary at the moment.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some people call MITI the second  MOF because it takes the same stand as the MOF on macroeconomic  policies.    [Kumano] The truth is that the MOF has been influenced by  MITI's opinion and that the two have coordinated their views  through arguments. When the two ministries confront each other,  you call it a negative effect caused by a vertical  administrative system. And when the two cooperate through  arguments, you call MITI the second MOF. It is regrettable.    At present, macroeconomic measures are very important. From  a short-term point of view, they undoubtedly boosted the economy  for the last two to three years. From a mid- and long-term  point of view, macroeconomic measures are necessary to  effectively use Japan's high ratio of savings in the process of  the nation's moving toward an aging society. There is currently  an imbalance between savings and investment, and this is the  cause of the current accounts surplus. Japan has to invest its  high savings in housing, research institutes, and the  information infrastructure. To do so, the government needs to  either go into debt or to increase taxes. It is impossible to do  so only with debt.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What you have explained resembles the  idea advocated by the MOF of emphasizing a financial equilibrium.    [Kumano] No, it does not. We have not said that the  investment should be made solely with taxes, but we have  proposed increasing the government's debt. We have not agreed  with the MOF on everything. We are thinking of what we should  do to carry out (our policies). It is unpleasant to be called  the second MOF when we make realistic arguments. I am doing my  job with confidence and based on economic theory and the belief  that we can better our society.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is it also MITI's duty to check on  the  MOF?    [Kumano] Yes, we are checking on them. It would be  problematic if the MOF did not take action [to cause an economic  recovery]. But in actuality, they are taking action. If  anything, they are taking the initiative in some ways.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] U.S. President Bill Clinton recently  criticized both MITI and the MOF by name.    [Kumano] The President called Japan a big-export but a  no-import nation. This is very regrettable because his remark  ignores the facts.  <H5>  Final Decisions Should Be Made by Politicians </H5>   [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you draw a line between  bureaucrats and politicians in policymaking?    [Kumano] It is difficult to draw the line because there are  various kinds of policies. But in principle, final decisions  should be made by politicians. It is absolutely impossible for  bureaucrats to do what ministers are opposed to.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the so-called  [Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) Chief Secretary Ichiro] Ozawa  plan, which includes the idea of establishing a parliamentary  councilor post?    [Kumano] I do not know whether news reports on Ozawa's plan  are accurate. At any rate, I think it is good to discuss  various things, including Ozawa's plan.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of politicians  taking part in bureaucrats' personnel management?    [Kumano] It is true that ministers have the right of  personnel management. But the neutrality of the administration  is also important. I cannot say absolutely that their  participation is not good.</p>

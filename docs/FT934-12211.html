			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (14): A fast-growing business - Profile: Lanka Garments MR Shabbir Sangani, head of Lanka Garments, has views which would raise eyebrows among Sri Lanka's economic planners, writes Kieran Cooke. 'We should forget all this business about becoming a newly industrialised country,' says Mr Sangani. 'If the economy does take off and we start growing above 5 per cent, then wages are bound to rise. We'll lose our main advantage; the garment industry will go elsewhere and then we'll create more problems than we've solved.' Mr Sangani is one of a new breed of entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. At 29, he heads a fast-growing, privately-held business employing 1,500, with a turnover of more than Dollars 2m last year. He started Lanka Garments in the mid-1980s with Dollars 15,000 capital loaned by his father. He now has three factories, one on the outskirts of Colombo and two in rural areas, set up under former President Premadasa's industry disbursement programme. Lanka Garments produces jackets and rainwear for the US market. Very little of the product content is sourced in Sri Lanka. The fabric for a popular brand of jacket destined for the US market is purchased in China by a South Korean company. The only thing sourced locally is the thread. The company's workforce is more than 90 per cent female. Wages are set at a minimum of SLRs2,000 a month. A South Korean has been brought in to help supervise the work. 'She earns about 50 times the wages of a local but has paid her wage by increases in productivity,' says Mr Sangani. Like other garment producers, Mr Sangani feels that Sri Lanka will face growing competition on wages from countries such as Vietnam, India and Bangladesh. To hedge against any downturn in the garment business, Mr Sangani has diversified into diamonds. A diamond cutting factory next door to Lanka Garments in Colombo now employs 250 workers. An Israeli technical adviser has been brought in. The uncut diamonds arrive from dealers in Antwerp and Tel Aviv. They are cut in Sri Lanka and then shipped for sale in Japan. The next step is to open a jewellery factory. The cut diamonds and the jewellery for their setting will then both be sent to Japan. Mr Sangani has a half-Japanese Sri Lankan partner who makes the all-important contacts in Tokyo. 'I'm going to stick with these two industries,' says Mr Sangani. 'In theory, when textiles hits a rough patch, then diamonds will come to the rescue. But I know nothing in business works quite so neatly.'</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / CBI attacks planned EC consumer laws THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday warned that a proposed European consumer law directive would result in higher insurance costs for business and a field day for litigants and lawyers. The directive, which forms part of the European Commission's three-year consumer law programme, would reverse the burden of proof in negligence claims by consumers against suppliers of services. Suppliers would have to prove they were not at fault to avoid paying compensation. All services except medical and construction would be covered by the directive. Miss Judith Vincent, head of the confederation's law group, said the CBI would fight its implementation. Miss Vincent said: 'If, for example, there is a car accident when the car has just been to the garage for a service, the garage would have to prove that it carried out the service correctly.' The result of such a burden on service businesses would be a less competitive economy caused by potentially vast legal fees and higher insurance costs, she warned. The CBI believes the commission has not demonstrated the need for the directive. It says services are not the same as products, and liability for them should not be treated in the same way. Products are distributed widely from the point of production to people with no contract with the supplier, whereas services are subject to a contractual relationship between supplier and end-user. The CBI urges the commission to: Assess the directive's impact on business costs. Place a limit on claims - without one, liability under the directive may prove to be uninsurable. Restrict liability claims to customers and prohibit those from third parties.</p>

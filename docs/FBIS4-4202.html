			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Japan's new prime  minister Tsutomu Hata pledged today to strive for Diet  (Parliament) passage of a tax system reform bill by the year-end  aimed at increasing the current three percent consumption tax.    He told a nationally televised news conference at his  official residence this evening that the government should  introduce higher indirect taxes to extend this year's income tax  cuts into years ahead.    Without a hike in indirect taxes, he said, the government  "cannot finance the income tax cut with the issuance of  deficit-covering bonds, since the accumulated budget deficit  will exceed 200 trillion yen (1.9 trillion U.S. dollars).    Hata also said his government will abide by any United  Nations resolutions in seeking a solution to the suspected  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula under the constraints of  Japan's war-renouncing constitution.    Asked how his administration would try to overcome  difficulties of a shaky minority coalition cabinet, Hata said he  will ask the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and Social  Democratic Party to cooperate "on whatever policies they can,  such as the legislation of the budget bills."    He dismissed suggestions that he would have no choice but to  dissolve the 511-seat House of Representatives and call a  general election in the face of a possible submission of a  no-confidence motion by the opposition.</p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPLE ROLLS OUT CHEAPER MACINTOSH MODELS;  </P> <P> COMPUTERS: THE NEW PCS ARE KEY PARTS OF AN AGGRESSIVE CORPORATE PUSH TO SLOW  THE FIRM'S DECLINING MARKET SHARE.  </P> <P> Apple Computer Inc., in an aggressive but overdue effort to stem a decline in  market share, launched a new line of computers Monday that cuts the price of  the flagship Macintosh in half and fundamentally alters the company's strategy.  </P> <P> The elaborate introduction ceremony, featuring live satellite links with  Berlin, Singapore and a number of U.S. locations, took place at Apple's factory  in Fremont, emphasizing the company's intention to transform itself into a  high-volume, low-cost manufacturer of personal computers.  </P> <P> The new strategy has been described by Apple Chairman and Chief Executive John  A. Sculley as the outgrowth of a complete re-evaluation of how Apple will  compete in the volatile personal computer business. Although the Macintosh is  widely recognized as being easier to use than competing IBM-compatible personal  computers, it has also been far more expensive -- until now.  </P> <P> Analysts say Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple must increase its market share  beyond the estimated 10% that it now holds if it is to be more than a niche  player in a market dominated by IBM-compatible machines that use the DOS  operating system. That challenge has been sharpened by the success of  Microsoft's Windows 3 software, which gives DOS machines many of the  easy-to-use features that made the Macintosh a success.  </P> <P> Most analysts have praised the new products, whose basic characteristics have  been widely known for months, although Wall Street has been uncomfortable with  the expected reduction in Apple's profit margins that will come with the  low-priced products.  </P> <P> "This is a tremendous product announcement, though I don't know why they didn't  do it a year ago," said David Wu, a computer analyst with S. G. Warburg &amp;  Co.  </P> <P> Sculley emphasized that Apple did not simply cut prices of existing machines,  but rather redesigned them to reduce cost and increase performance. And though  he said the economy was already in a recession, he nonetheless maintained that  businesses and consumers would continue to buy productivity-enhancing  computers.  </P> <P> The new Apple machines include:  </P> <P> * The Macintosh Classic, an entry-level computer priced at $999 with one  megabyte of memory and a floppy-disk drive, or $1,499 with two megabytes of  memory and a 40-megabyte hard-disk drive. The Classic, available immediately,  is equivalent to the Macintosh SE, which will be discontinued, as will the  Macintosh Plus.  </P> <P> * The Macintosh LC, a color computer that has a small, pizza-box-like shape  with a separate monitor. It comes with a 40-megabyte hard-disk drive and a new  sound-editing system that allows voice or other sound to be attached to files  and edited. The LC, which will not be available in volume until February, will  sell for $2,499 without a monitor. A special card that will allow the machine  to run Apple II software will cost $199.  </P> <P> * The Macintosh IIsi, a high-performance color machine that uses the fast 68030  microprocessor from Motorola. The IIsi is faster and has better expansion  capabilities than the LC, and includes the new sound-editing system. It is also  available now, at a price of $3,769 in a basic configuration that includes two  megabytes of memory and a 40-megabyte hard disk. It replaces the existing Mac  IIcx.  </P> <P> All the products are expected to sell at "street prices" up to 20% below the  listed price.  </P> <P> Sculley said the new machines had been brought to market even more quickly than  Apple had originally planned, and that the company would have plenty of the  Macintosh Classics on hand for the Christmas season. But the limited  availability of the LC, considered by some analysts the most important of the  new products, could make it harder for Apple to build momentum.  </P> <P> The LC is the key to Apple's efforts to win back the education market, which it  once dominated with the Apple II but has lately lost to IBM-compatible  machines. One of the new television advertisements that are part of a  $40-million marketing campaign features a teacher giving a roomful of  LC-equipped students an inspirational lecture on the value of production and  productivity.  </P></p>

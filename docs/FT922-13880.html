			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (7): The word that says it all - Profile, London Business School IF Mr George Bain were given just a single word to encapsulate the London Business School, there is little doubt which one he would choose. Talk to the faculty and students, wander the buildings, or read the brochures, and the theme is everywhere. The word is 'international'. So much so that a party of visitors arriving blind-folded from abroad at the grassy campus in Regent's Park, central London, might not even realise which country they were in. Mr Bain, the principal of the school, deserves his chosen word. A Canadian with dual nationality, he says he spends much of his time defending Britain to the British. But his vision for the school stretches far more to the west over the Atlantic and south across the Channel than it does north into the traditional industrial heartland of the UK. 'We are one of the top maybe 10 or 12 business schools in Europe and the US,' he says without hesitation. 'This may sound self-serving, but I'd like to think we combine the best American and European business school traditions.' The LBS, he suggests, has elements of the north American schools which traditionally have a reputation for academic excellence, mixed with European ones which are historically more focused on vocational skills. He likens the school to an aircraft carrier, on which future business leaders can land, re-orient themselves and then take off again in new directions. Students from the US are partly driven to the LBS by the over-academic focus of institutions in their own country, he suggests, and partly as a way of becoming exposed to 'a wider Europe' while their language skills may initially hold them back. Conversely, many European students want a flavour of American business without committing themselves to a full course there, Mr Bain argues. 'If you ever find a dean who says he is not internationalising his business school, tell me,' he says. 'But I don't think any other British school is as international as we are.' That, if anything, is the unique selling point of the LBS, he says. The statistics certainly go some way to bearing out this vision. Two-thirds of the students on the full-time MBA degree are foreign nationals, and half of those studying for PhDs. Even on the part-time MBA course 20 per cent are not British, and a handful commute from continental Europe even for this programme. Mr Bain's drive to internationalise the school has led to radical changes in the curriculum over the past few years, which he characterises by three 'I's. International is, of course, the first. The others are integrated and dealing with implementation. By integrated, he means providing a course which is coherent with interdisciplinary teaching. 'Business schools have historically been far too vertical,' Mr Bain says. 'Courses have been compartmentalised into functional units, such as accounting, finance, production and marketing. They then painted a little glue called strategy on top and hoped it all hung together.' By implementation, he refers to the need to switch emphasis from simply problem-solving to providing solutions and the skills which allow managers to put their recommendations into action. 'The MBA has traditionally been longer on analysis and a bit short on process skills,' he says. In addition, he talks about four specific aims for the school as a whole over the next few years. The first - surprise, surprise] - is to enhance the internationalism of LBS still further. While non-UK nationals are a high proportion of students, he would like to see more foreigners among the faculty. Second, he places great emphasis on what he calls 'balanced excellence'  - that teaching and research are of equal importance. He says the faculty should be expected to gain visibility in the business community as much as in the academic community - which, he adds in the same breath, they have been doing. Third, he wants to see further growth in some parts of the school, despite its presence already as the largest in Europe. He says there needs to be 'a bigger critical mass' in some specialisms such as accounting and marketing. Finally, he calls for a much closer partnership with business through 'effective learning partnerships'. 'That reflects a recognition that there is no substitute for the company as the learning laboratory,' he says. All this management education does not come cheaply. The full-time MBA, which currently enrols 210 people a year, costs Pounds 9,000. The part-time equivalent at the moment costs Pounds 6,600 for each of three years. There is also a wide range of more specialised courses to choose from, ranging from Pounds 4,700 a year for a PhD and Pounds 13,000 for the international executive master's programme to Pounds 20,000 for the Sloan MSc degree. To these costs students obviously have to add accommodation and forgone earnings. Recently, those who are not sponsored have often had to face the possibility of another risk, even at a school as highly-regarded as LBS: unemployment. The school's most recent annual report has rather more text and glossy post-modern collages than it does figures. But one box showing the destinations of the 176 MBAs graduating in 1991 includes 20 per cent in a euphemistic 'other' category, which comprises 'freelance work, deciding on offers and seeking employment'. 'It is taking people longer to find jobs,' Mr Bain concedes. 'MBAs are finding it harder to get job opportunities than a few years ago. They have to have to look harder. But the fact I don't know the proportion who are unemployed is an indication of how serious I think the situation is.' For those with the money, or sympathetic and education-committed employers, an alternative is participation in the non-degree programmes stretching over a number of days or weeks and costing a few thousand pounds each. These cover subjects from corporate finance and brand strategy to one dedicated entirely to discussing the issues raised in copies of the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.</p>

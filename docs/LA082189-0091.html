			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> TURKEY TO CLOSE BULGARIA BORDER TO CHECK INFLUX OF ETHNIC TURKS  </P> <P> Turkey announced today it will close its border with Bulgaria to curb an influx  of ethnic Turks and pressure Sofia to negotiate an agreement over their future.  </P> <P> About 310,000 ethnic Turks, saying they faced a Bulgarian campaign of religious  and cultural assimilation, have fled to Turkey in an unchecked flow since  Turkey waived visa obligations for them in June.  </P> <P> It was Ankara's first direct retaliation over Bulgaria's refusal to negotiate  the future of the 1.5-million-member minority.  </P> <P> Deputy Premier and State Minister Ali Bozer said Turkey will close the frontier  at 2 a.m. Tuesday. He insisted Ankara remains ready to accept all ethnic Turks  once a comprehensive agreement is reached with Bulgaria.  </P> <P> Bulgaria has rejected Turkey's call for an accord to compensate refugees for  property left behind and to protect the rights of ethnic Turks who want to  remain.  </P> <P> "We had to draw the line at some point . . . to bring some sense and order to  the haphazard way Bulgaria heaps people on the border," a senior Foreign  Ministry official said.  </P></p>

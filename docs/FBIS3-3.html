			<p>SUMMARY                                    Pyongyang's response to the latest South Korean proposal for  resumption of inter-Korean talks seems to reflect an effort by  the North Korean regime to score polemical points against the  South and its ongoing preference for negotiating with Washington  over Seoul on the nuclear issue.                               END SUMMARY      Apparently violating a recent DPRK-U.S. agreement, Pyongyang  countered Seoul's proposal for a 1 March working-level contact  with a later date, a counterproposal that seemed aimed mainly at  gaining some perceived polemical advantage over Seoul.  According  to Pyongyang radio on 1 March, Pak Yong-su, North Korean chief  delegate to the proposed working-level talks, sent a telephone  message to his Southern counterpart proposing a meeting on 3  March.  Pyongyang's attempt to delay the North-South meeting for  two days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached  with Washington for resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S talks.  The  25 February agreement, announced by Pyongyang radio on 28  February, specified 1 March as the date the following will take  place "simultaneously":      + Seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this year's  running of Team Spirit and Washington will announce its consent  to Seoul's decision.      + The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear  inspections in the North to ensure continuity of safeguards.      + Inter-Korean contacts will start at Panmunjom to discuss  exchanging of special presidential envoys.      + Pyongyang and Washington will announce resumption of high-level  bilateral talks to take place on 21 March in Geneva.      Pyongyang's Motives In proposing a later date for North-South  contacts, Pyongyang may have been showing its concern about  appearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear  inspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but  Washington on the nuclear issue.  In the latest attempt to  portray Seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue, the party paper  Nodong Sinmun in a 28 February commentary ridiculed ROK President  Kim Yong-sam for allegedly acting "as if he receives U.S. reports  on DPRK-U.S. talks" and "as if he controls the talks" (Pyongyang  radio, 28 February).  Kim creates this impression, the commentary  added, even though "he is not even qualified to join the talks."      Pyongyang's reluctance to engage Seoul in anything of substance  was also evident in the sheer contempt for President Kim North  Korea expressed in commenting on Kim's 25 February press  conference commemorating the first year of his presidency.  Departing from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal  attacks on South Korean leaders during periods of inter-Korean  dialogue, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 February heaped  abuse on President Kim, calling him, inter alia, a "traitor," a  "puppet," and a "political mountebank," accusing him of "arch  crimes of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, repression," and  promoting national "division and confrontation," and  of plain  "stupidity."  KCNA went on to claim that Kim's remarks about the  probable absence of nuclear arms in the North and his proposal  for an inter-Korean summit constituted a de facto admission that  his "criminal" policy "against the North" had been wrong.  The  party paper Nodong Sinmun on 28 February similarly ridiculed  Kim's "preposterously absurd remarks" (Pyongyang radio).      DPRK-U.S. Talks In sharp contrast to its reluctance to meet  with Seoul, Pyongyang was upbeat about the prospect of upcoming  talks with Washington.  Although monitored Pyongyang media have  not commented on the news of the upcoming high-level bilateral  talks, Ambassador Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's mission  to the United Nations, was depicted in South Korean media as  being optimistic about the eventual outcome of the negotiations.  In an interview with the Seoul daily Hangyore Sinmun (28  February), Ho termed it "fortunate" that Washington, "although  belatedly," withdrew "unjustified preconditions" to resumption of  the high-level talks, thus paving way for "a package solution" of  "not only the nuclear issue, but also other issues now standing  in the way of diplomatic normalization.      Implications Pyongyang's contrasting media treatment of  Washington and Seoul indicates that the North Korean leadership  continues to prefer the United States as partner for nuclear  negotiations and is inclined to limit talks with the South to the  minimum required to fulfill preconditions to resumption of high-  level talks with Washington.

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Bus sell-offs in Scotland rapped THE privatisation of 10 Scottish bus companies between August 1990 and October 1991 netted Pounds 103.1m, the National Audit Office said, but this was Pounds 15m less than the Scottish Office had been advised to expect when the sell-offs were planned in 1988. In a report published today the public expenditure watchdog says more could have been done to maintain the companies' profitability before privatisation. A deterioration in profits during the pre-sale period reduced the companies' value to potential purchasers. The NAO also criticises the Scottish Office for its failure to monitor the sale costs, which totalled Pounds 2.3m. The Scottish Transport Group, which owned the companies before privatisation, spent Pounds 1.2m on professional fees, three times the Scottish Office's estimate. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the acquisition by Stagecoach Holdings of Lancaster City Transport. The Department of Trade and Industry has referred the acquisition on the advice of Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, after concern over its impact on the bus market in the Lancaster and Morecambe area. Stagecoach has ordered bus bodies worth Pounds 13m, with an option for a further Pounds 10m, from Walter Alexander of Falkirk, Stirlingshire. Sale of the Scottish Bus Group. HMSO. Pounds 7.50.</p>

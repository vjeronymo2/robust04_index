			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Former electronics chief cleared MR ROY ASHMAN, the former chairman of Harland Simons, the electronics company, was acquitted yesterday at Aylesbury Crown Court of making misleading statements to two investors shortly before a reduced profits forecast caused the company's share price to fall. The jury's verdict after the five-day trial represents a disappointment for the Department of Trade and Industry which brought the prosecution under Section 47 of the Financial Services Act, which outlaws the making of misleading statements. The case was the fourth to be brought under Section 47 since the passing of the legislation. Section 47 has been under close scrutiny by lawyers and regulators since its introduction. Of the four prosecutions to date two have succeeded and two have failed. Mr Ashman had been accused of misleading two fund managers from Govett Strategic Investments by telling them, at a meeting last February, that he was comfortable with the company's initial forecast of profits of about Pounds 13m to Pounds 14m. The two fund managers, Mr Nigel Savage and Mr Marc Gordon, then bought 155,000 shares worth almost Pounds 1m in the group. Just hours later the profits forecast was reduced to Pounds 4m and the share price fell from 585p to 270p. The company eventually reported a pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 6m. Mr Ashman denied knowing at the time of the meeting that the profit forecast was about to be reduced. He also told the court that Mr Savage had been 'getting around to questions he should not have been asking' about anticipated year-end returns. Mr Ashman refused to comment after the verdict. His solicitor, Mr Graham Huntley said: 'We are very happy with the result and it is unfortunate that this prosecution was brought in the first place.'</p>

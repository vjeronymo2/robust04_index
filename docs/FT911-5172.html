			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Stick to the devil you know FT-SE Index: 2,542.8 (+16.7) General Accident's ignominious exit from NZI Bank is perhaps an appropriate finale to the financial swashbuckling of the late 1980s. No wonder the market is littered with corpses when a prudent Scottish financial institution like General Accident - which in the two previous less eventful decades barely strayed further from its native Perth than the dales of Yorkshire - suddenly throws caution to the winds and buys into an unfamiliar business at the far end of the world. The cost of General Accident's escapade is unclear: anything between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of shareholders' funds, depending on how generous a valuation is put on the remaining insurance assets. Whereas the Prudential and Guardian Royal Exchange can be fairly certain that the book is closed on their estate agency and Italian non-life blunders respectively, GA shareholders may not necessarily have heard the last of this one. Winding down a bank which nobody else wants to buy - notwithstanding the company's assurance that the loan portfolio is clean - generally proves an expensive and time-consuming business. The market has become numbed by bad news from the composites. Yesterday's 7p fall in the shares to 555p reflected merely the disappointment of earlier hopes of finding a buyer for NZI. Meanwhile, it is back to basics for GA in the sober knowledge that net assets were actually lower last year than at the end of 1983 - a period in which dividends and premium income have almost trebled. At least there is the comfort that the stock market is still prepared to buy the shares at a 12 per cent premium to estimated net assets.</p>

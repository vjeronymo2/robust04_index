			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALING WITH SCHOOL VIOLENCE  </P> <P> Nothing illustrates the real problem faced by public schools better than the  mentality behind "Toughen Discipline Policy, Report Urges L.A. Schools" (Part  A, March 20).  </P> <P> The board of education appoints a task force that takes 10 months to come to  the brilliant conclusion that violent students should be expelled.  </P> <P> Obviously, there is an established procedure to accomplish this end. Do they  recommend that it simply be used? No, they recommend another "assistant  superintendent" to oversee what is already in place.  </P> <P> They also want a "computer tracking system" to alert receiving schools to  violent students who are transferred within the district. I suppose a telephone  call and the existing documented student file is too old-fashioned and might  require actual contact with the real participants in this drama.  </P> <P> Any teacher could have defined the problem in minutes, but the board finds new  ways to reinvent the wheel and add layers of administrative costs in the  process. It's the perfect example of the kind of bureaucratic thinking that  entangles and chokes our schools.  </P> <P> JULIANN REYNOLDS  </P> <P> Alta Loma  </P></p>

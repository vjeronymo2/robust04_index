			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One respondent recommended that armor overlap be changed from 3.0 millimeters to either 1.8 millimeters or sufficient to meet the requirements of paragraph (q) of 7 CFR 1755.900.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reason 7 CFR 1755.900 specifies a minimum armor overlap of 3.0 millimeters is to assure proper forming of the armor overlap is achieved to avoid longitudinal splitting of the jacket during installation. Since REA is concerned that armor overlaps less than 3.0 millimeters can result in longitudinal splitting of the jacket during installation because of improper forming, REA will not change the present requirement of 3.0 millimeters to the recommended comments of the respondent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended that reduction in thickness of the armoring material due either to corrugating or the application process be changed from 10 percent to 5 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA would like to point out that the 10 percent requirement for the reduction in armor thickness is the same requirement as specified in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90. Since manufacturers have been meeting the 10 percent armor reduction thickness requirement as specified in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90 for more than seven years without any reported problems, REA will not change the 10 percent armor reduction thickness requirement in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the 5 percent armor reduction thickness requirement as recommended by the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two respondents recommended changing the present language of paragraph (k)(6) to more clearly define the intent of the requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA has reviewed the proposed language submitted by both commentators and agrees that their proposed language will more clearly define the intent of the requirement. Therefore, REA will change the present language of paragraph (k)(6) specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the proposed language recommended by the commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended that paragraphs (k)(8), (k)(9), and (k)(10) of the specification be eliminated from the specification because they consider these tests to be cable component tests and not completed cable performance tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA considers the tests specified in paragraphs (k)(8), (k)(9), and (k)(10) of the specification to be completed cable performance tests because these tests provide REA with the means of assuring that the plastic coated steel armor of the cable will withstand the rigors of the installation as well as a means of assuring that the plastic coated steel armor of the cable will provide satisfactory service over the life of the completed cable. Since REA considers the performance of the plastic coated steel armor to be a critical requirement in the installation and service life of completed cables, REA will not eliminate paragraphs (k)(8), (k)(9), and (k)(10) from 7 CFR 1755.900 as recommended by the respondent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended that paragraph (k)(10) of 7 CFR 1755.900 be modified to exclude from the 90 percent calculation the area of the armor under the strength members for cables containing embedded strength members in the outer jacket because these type cables can still pass the armor to jacket bond strength requirement specified in paragraph (k)(10) of the specification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A review of recent armor to jacket bond strength data for cables containing embedded strength members in the outer jacket when the area of the armor under the strength members is excluded from the 90 percent calculation revealed that these type cables can pass the requirement specified in paragraph (k)(10) of the specification without difficulty. Since test data indicate that these type cables can pass the armor to jacket bond strength requirement, REA will modify paragraph (k)(10) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to allow the exclusion of the area of the armor under the strength members for cables containing embedded strength members in the outer jacket from the 90 percent calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended that low density polyethylene, low density ethylene copolymer, and linear low density polyethylene compounds not be allowed as outer jacket materials. The reason for their comment is that installation damage to the cable can occur as a result of the above materials becoming soft at the high temperatures experienced during hot summer weather.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Low density polyethylene, low density ethylene copolymer, and linear low density polyethylene compounds have been used by REA as outer jacket materials for copper cables for over twenty years and for fiber optic cables for over seven years without any reported high temperature installation problems associated with hot summer weather. Since REA has never received complaints from borrowers installing cables using any one of the above compounds during hot summer weather, REA will not eliminate the use of low density polyethylene, low density ethylene copolymer, and linear low density polyethylene compounds as outer jacket materials from the specification as recommended by the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended that melt flow rate, environmental stress crack, and impact tests for jacketing materials be eliminated from the specification because they consider these tests to be cable component tests and not completed cable performance tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA considers the melt flow rate, environmental stress crack, and impact tests for jacketing materials to be completed cable performance tests because these tests provide REA with the means of assuring that the jacketing material of the cable will withstand the rigors of installation as well as a means of assuring that the jacketing material of the cable will provide satisfactory service over the life of the completed cable. Since REA considers the performance of jacket material to be a critical requirement in the installation and service life of completed cables, REA will not eliminate the melt flow rate, environmental stress crack, and impact tests for jacketing materials from 7 CFR 1755.900 as recommended by the respondent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended replacing the ASTM D 4565&hyph;90a test method referenced for both jacket tensile strength/elongation and jacket shrinkback in 7 CFR 1755.900 with the EIA&hyph;455&hyph;89A test method for jacket tensile strength/elongation and the EIA&hyph;455&hyph;86 test method for jacket shrinkback because these test methods are the current fiber optic industry standards for these jacket properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A review of the ASTM and EIA test methods for jacket tensile strength/elongation and jacket shrinkback properties indicates that the EIA test methods are more applicable for the testing of fiber optic cables than the ASTM test method. Since the EIA test methods are more applicable to the testing of fiber optic cables, REA will replace the reference to ASTM D 4565&hyph;90a in paragraphs (m)(5)(ii) and (m)(5)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900 with EIA&hyph;455&hyph;89A and EIA&hyph;455&hyph;86, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended that the minimum jacket thickness over the strength members for cables containing embedded strength members in the outer jacket be changed from 0.5 millimeter to 0.9 millimeter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA has accepted one manufacturer of fiber optic cable containing embedded strength members in the outer jacket using the 0.5 millimeter minimum jacket thickness over the embedded strength members. That manufacturer's cable has been used by REA borrowers for over four years without any reported field failures. Since REA has satisfactory field performance history on fiber optic cables with embedded strength members using the minimum 0.5 millimeter jacket thickness over the embedded strength members, REA will not change the 0.5 millimeter minimum jacket thickness specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the minimum jacket thickness recommended by the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

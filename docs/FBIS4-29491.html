			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Armed Forces Spokesman Lieutenant General </F> Anuson Kritsanaserani by Watsana Nanuam, date and place not  given; under the "Who Will Trust the Thai Military" rubric]    [Text] Military leaders reiterate that there will be  no more coups, so why does the public still believe a coup could  occur?    In the past, it seemed to the public that the military  overthrew democratic governments. These days, the military  worries whenever people suggest it will stage a coup. None of  us thinks about coup; we don't want to talk about coups. Every  time there's a rumour, we try to find out where it originated.  If you see any military unit mobilizing, please inform us.    There will always be rumours about coups, because of fear  and  the stock market. Investors in the stock market are always  watching politics and the military. They check out information  from several sources, in particular the press.    If you have any such negative information, you should inform  the military. I can assure you that there will be no coup. The  military is not prepared (to stage a coup). According to my  information, I can assure you that there will be no coup. But  you can't say a Boeing will never again crash. I can assure you  that at present there will be no coup.    Army chief Wimon Wongwanit on June 7 warned Army  officers not to listen to certain instigators. Did he want to  warn certain people not to act wrongfully?    The Army commander in chief wants the country to be  peaceful.  He wants his subordinates to be disciplined. He wants to warn  his subordinates not to cause unrest. But I don't know whether  he has any information about a possible threat.    You can't call soldiers opportunists. At present, we are  professional soldiers. We know what the people don't want the  military to do; we know that from opinion polls.    We will perform in line with what the people want. We  consider ourselves the people's army. If we act against the  people's will, we'll be viewed as dictators. We have to adjust  our attitude to match the public's. We will not get involved in  politics. If we take sides, the people will think military rule  has returned; we have to be neutral.    But the press always asks us about politics. Officers from  the supreme commander to commanders of the Armed Forces don't  want to talk about it. But when asked, they have to say  something.    The supreme commander and commanders of the Armed Forces  support the government. We have to back the government because  it's legitimate. The government is elected by the people. If  we say we don't support the government, the people will be angry  at the military. We don't want the people to hate the military,  so we have to support the government. We don't want to  criticize anything, including the government.    If there was violence in the streets, would the  military stay idle?    The military has to listen to the government. The prime  minister, as director of internal security, has the power to  call out the military and police.    The prime minister, who is elected by the people, knows what  is right or wrong. We have to obey his policies.    The military will not get involved if there is no order  from the prime minister?    That's right. We don't want to be offside. If we do  anything without orders, the people will be watching us.    What did you do when reports arose recently that  certain military officers had met to form a plot?    The supreme commander called everyone together and asked  whether anyone knew anything. I told him some officers had gone  to Hong Kong. You should know that when there are holidays, our  officers like to go to Hong Kong: we play golf and our wives  and children go shopping. This is a personal matter.    What are "professional soldiers"?    We are soldiers; we want to be soldiers; we receive a salary  from the military. We have to be disciplined and do what we are  ordered to do by our superiors. We don't want to repeatedly say  `we are professional soldiers and we will not become involved in  politics'. We have to act, not just talk.    Did the military survey public opinion about coups?    No, not directly. It would be like someone asking you how  many wives you have. People don't want to answer that kind of  question. We have regularly used public opinion polls to find  out what people want us to do.</p>

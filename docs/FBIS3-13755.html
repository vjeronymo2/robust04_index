The newspaper AL-ANBA quoted the minister of state for  cabinet affairs as saying that the State of Kuwait "has not and  will not agree to this type of maneuvering and trickery, which  is undertaken by the Baghdad regime from time to time to create  a stir and give the international community the impression that  it is seeking to find stability in the region." He pointed out  that "the aim behind this attempt is to lift the economic  sanctions that have been imposed on Iraq for some time now."  [passage omitted]</p>

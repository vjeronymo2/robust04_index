			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article in four installments by Rusen Cakir: "Understanding </F> the Prosperity Party"]  <H5>  [10 Apr p 23] </H5>   [Text] The organization of the Prosperity Party [PP] is  described as the "worry beads model." The PP appoints an  official to every neighborhood. That official finds and  appoints other officials to every avenue, every street, and even  every apartment building. Inspectors check on the work of the  neighborhood officials, who are directly attached to the party's  district chairman. In each province, there are party councils  composed of 50 members and 50 reserve members. Similar councils  function in the districts, too.    In all its units, in parallel with its main organization,  the  PP has mobilized the women in "ladies committees." After every  election, the PP gets ready for another election as if it is  going to be held the next day. The organization model is also  implemented in the ballot boxes. In other words, the  neighborhood officials appoint committees made up of at least  three people for every ballot box in their area. The duties of  this committee are to collect information about all the voters  registered to that ballot box, to brief the party propagandists  on these voters when necessary, and especially to do whatever it  can to ensure that the voter expected to vote for the PP goes to  the ballot box.    Currently, PP members fall into three basic groups. First,  there are the "founding big brothers" who advocate the "National  View," which is an extension of the National Order Party and the  National Salvation Party [NSP]. They are followed by the young  NSP members of the seventies. Those who joined the movement  after 1980 make up the third category.    The "founding big brothers" enjoy uncontested authority and  respect within the party. They lose their status only as a  result of certain high-level conflicts or because of health  reasons. The general headquarters and the Turkish Grand  National Assembly group of the PP are composed mainly of these  members. The second group is composed mainly of members in  their thirties and forties who are usually administrators in  provincial organizations and in local authorities. Those who  followed the 1968 events with envy from afar as religious  students are now formulating and implementing the new PP  policies with social democratic, civilian populist, and, at  times, liberal tendencies. Those who were students during the  seventies or in the early eighties, on the other hand, are  closer to radical Islamic trends.    Prominent in the third category are those who have broken  away from different ideologies, women of all ages, students who  were politicized during the Islamic wave of the eighties, young  workers, and young unemployed citizens.    The abundant middle cadres of the PP (mostly middle-aged)  provide the equilibrium between the enthusiasm and dynamism of  the grass roots and the caution and meticulousness of the top  cadres. The high-level administrators -- no doubt Necmettin  Erbakan in particular -- appear inaccessible and legendary in  the eyes of the grass roots, who continuously come into contact  with the middle cadres.    Maybe this is why Erbakan conducts more tours in the country  than other leaders, allows party members to kiss his hand, and  wins their hearts by turning the inaccessible into accessible.    The PP, which does not appear to have any factional  conflicts, is actually a very complex coalition. For example,  PP members in central Anatolia are more provincial and closer to  Turkish nationalism, and their religion is widely mixed with  Alawite contradictions. Those in the Black Sea region display  more urban qualities and incorporate the religious element into  politics more. The Kurdish identity in southeast Anatolia, where  religious schools have always been predominant, is becoming  increasingly prominent. The big cities, in turn, incorporate all  of these characteristics.    Undoubtedly, the way to advance such a complex organization  and prevent power squabbles is to limit the democratic channels  within the party as much as possible and replace them with  centralism.    At this juncture, Erbakan's personality becomes important.  Erbakan, who has been operating the National View movement with  practically the same top cadres for the past quarter of a  century (Oguzhan Asilturk, Sevket Kazan, Recai Kutan, Fehim  Adak, and Ali Oguz), is the embodiment of the party center. All  the important decisions in the PP are made by Erbakan (or so it  seems). Erbakan has the final say (sometimes also the first) in  determining election candidates, party central decisionmaking  and executive council members at congresses, and assembly group  leaders.  <H5>  Prosperity's Identity </H5>   The fact that decisions within the PP, which in essence is a  coalition, are reached unanimously or to be more accurate the  fact that decisions of the party oligarchy dictated by Erbakan  are endorsed unanimously cannot be explained through Erbakan's  personality. The PP's main magic is that it has, above all,  managed to convert its members to Prosperity.    The PP, which can be viewed as a religious organization from  the outside, actually has an organizational concept which can be  termed secular. The PP possesses the mechanism for transforming  the individual joining its ranks, irrespective of his motives  for joining, his past or future, into a Prosperity member.  These mechanisms begin functioning as soon as the individual  establishes contact with the party.    Erbakan has never claimed to be the sheikh and his attitude  has rendered things easier. Since the death of Mehmed Zahid  Kotku on 13 November, 1980, however, Erbakan has claimed that  political authority should precede religious authority, which  has led to serious problems.    PP members refer to their leader as "Mujahid Erbakan." In  other words, the PP is an organization for "jihad." Although  being versed in religious issues may carry prestige within the  party it does not bring along status. The way to status is  through having good organizational skills, eloquence, and  expertise in certain issues. No doubt, it is desirable that a  party member with some of these characteristics also be an  authority on religion, but this is not required. No one within  the PP interferes with anyone else's adherence to religious  obligations. It is taken for granted that everyone is  fulfilling the requirements of Islam. Theoretically, however,  each PP member has the right to interfere in the daily life of  any other member.    One of the secrets for the success of the National View  movement, which has been in Turkish politics for over 25 years  through the legality and power attained from the argument that  "Islam does not separate between religion and state affairs as  is the case in Christianity," is that it has gradually made a  distinction between religion and state affairs and it has, at  the same time, put state affairs above those of religion. The  embarrassed NSP administrator of the past who could not answer a  question relating to the interpretation of an Islamic scripture  has now been replaced by PP administrators who proudly reply  "address your questions on scriptures to the pertinent  authorities."  <H5>  The Goal Is Political Power </H5>   Today's PP members have dedicated themselves to "formulating  projects on Turkey's concrete problems" rather than religious  issues. The National View can thus be viewed as a movement that  modernizes and secularizes the religious, which is the case with  all Islamic political groups in the world. Since the National  View is at the same time a communicational organization and  since this strategy of communications has, since the eighties,  been directed to those who are not religious, it has aimed at  training cadres expert in economics and politics. This stand  further strengthens the process of secularization which the  movement has entered. The role of theologians and clergy is  gradually diminishing within the PP. The Prosperity identity  every member adopts in the beginning is actually a secular one  that has been given the patina of Islam. The Islamic dimension  of this identity is very shallow, static, and confused since it  has frequently been deformed due to legal reasons. As a result,  PP members, who agree in general on Islamic goals (for example  to attain sharia), when asked to go into the details of these  goals (for example the sharia) will come up with thousands of  opposing interpretations.    When, however, asked to go into the details of the political  dimensions of the Prosperity identity the members will agree in  general irrespective of their region or ethnic origin. The  political dimension is also very dynamic, constantly developing  and changing, but it keeps on coming to the very same point:  That of gaining political power.  <H5>  [11 Apr p 21] </H5>   [Text] According to unofficial final results of the 27  March 1994 local elections, the Prosperity Party [PP] received a  total of 5,340,969 votes. It increased its share of the vote to  19 percent, and got a total of 327 mayoral positions of which  six were in cities, 22 in provinces, 92 in districts, and 207 in  townships. These elections show that once again, the PP was very  successful in the southeast. It got the mayoral positions in  the provinces of Mus, Agri, Bingol, Bitlis, Batman, Siirt,  Diyarbakir, Van, Sanliurfa, and Adiyaman. As in the past, the  PP received the highest rate of votes in the southeast.    Even though the official figures have not been released yet,  it is believed that the election boycott by the Democracy Party  [DEP] helped raise the number of PP's votes. It is being  alleged that some of the voters abided by the DEP's instructions  and either did not vote or cast invalid votes deliberately. It  is being said that close to 50 percent of the voters boycotted  the elections in certain parts of the southeast.    For example, the PP received 40,000 votes or 26.6 percent in  Siirt in 1989. According to figures given by the TRT [Turkish  Radio and Television], the PP received 21,000 votes in Siirt in  the 1994 local elections. However, the rate was 31.5 percent.    The PP received 52,000 votes or 19.6 percent of the vote in  Diyarbakir in 1989. This time, it received 25,000 more votes  but managed to almost double its percentage of votes to 33  percent.    Similarly, after five years, the PP got only 1,000 more  votes  in Mardin but its percentage went up by 6 percent.  <H5>  The Effect of Kurdish Votes </H5>   Another allegation that is being made is that in the  southeast, the PP got a significant number of civil servants'  votes, like policemen, special team members, officers and so on.  DEP officials deny that DEP voters voted for the PP. However,  it is conceivable that part of the DEP supporters gave up the  boycott and voted for the centrist parties and the PP in order  to prevent the election of the candidates of the Nationalist  Action Party [NAP] and the Great Unity Party [GUP] -- parties  which took part in the elections through state support.    Regardless of these facts, the 1994 local elections show  that  the PP took important steps in rehabilitating its relations with  the southeast -- the PP's traditional vote depot.    A much more important conclusion we can draw from the 1994  elections, is that the PP clearly showed that it is a movement  that is centered in the big cities. It won the mayoral  positions in five metropolises [as published] and 28 provinces  [as published]. However, it lagged even behind the Social  Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] by winning only a total of 338  mayoral positions in districts and townships [as published].    The PP won mayoral positions in the five provinces it had  won  in 1989 -- including in Van and Sanliurfa which it had lost in  the by- elections. The other mayoral positions in 23 provinces  it won this time used to belong to the following parties: 11 to  the SDPP, six to the True Path Party [TPP], four to the  Motherland Party [ANAP], one each to the Nationalist Labor Party  [NLP] and the Republican People's Party [RPP].    As you can see, the PP got mayoral positions and  consequently  the votes from all the parties, but particularly from the SDPP  which had emerged as the victorious party in the 1989 local  elections. By getting the mayoral positions in the metropolises  of Istanbul and Ankara, the PP confirmed that.    The March 1994 elections also confirmed that the PP's engine  power is its organization in Istanbul. In earlier elections,  the PP's average percentage for all of Turkey and for Istanbul  were almost the same, while this time the average for Istanbul  was 5 to 6 points higher. As a result, the PP got 17 mayoral  positions in Istanbul.  <H5>  The Success in the Metropolitan Areas </H5>   The PP, which entered the political scene in the 1984 local  elections with a 4.4 percent vote, increased its number of votes  in every subsequent election, finally reaching 19.0 percent in  the 1994 local elections. A comparative study of the number of  votes received by the PP in all the elections demonstrate that  contrary to common belief, this party is not a "peasant" party,  but an urban party which is developing in the cities. The PP,  which proved it is an urban party by winning the mayoral posts  in 28 provinces in the latest elections, has actually been an  urban party since the first elections it participated in.    When we study the number of PP votes in the 26 largest  provinces, we see that the PP received more votes than its  nationwide average in 11 of these provinces in 1984, in seven of  them in 1987, in nine of them in 1989, in 10 of them in 1991,  and in 11 of them in 1994. The list of these 11 provinces in the  latest elections presents an interesting picture: Ankara,  Diyarbakir, Erzurum, Gaziantep, Istanbul, Kayseri, Kocaeli,  Konya, Kahramanmaras, Sakarya, and Trabzon. Given the fact  that, except the last three provinces, eight provinces have  metropolitan area status from a local authority viewpoint and  that the total number of metropolitan areas in Turkey is 15, we  can conclude that the PP is the choice of approximately one out  of four voters in more than half of the country's leading  industrial, commercial, educational, tourism, cultural, and  administrative centers. The PP, which lost the mayoral  elections in Gaziantep and Kocaeli to SDPP by only a slight  margin, won the mayoral posts in all the metropolitan areas in  central and eastern Anatolia.  <H5>  The Areas Where the PP is Weak </H5>   The four provinces where the PP is weakest consist of  Edirne,  Kirklareli, Mugla, an Tunceli. In Antalya, Aydin, Canakkale,  Denizli, Izmir, Icel, Kastamonu, Tekirdag, Bartin, and Ardahan,  the PP received between 5 and 10 percent of the votes. In other  words, with the exceptions of Tunceli and Ardahan, the PP is  unable to rise to prominence in the coastal strips of the  Aegean, the Mediterranean, and the western Black Sea. The PP,  which increased its votes by 14.6 points in 10 years, owes this  increase largely to central, eastern, and southeast Anatolia,  and the industrial regions in the eastern Black Sea and Marmara.    To understand the extent of the success attained by the PP  in  the recent elections, it will be more meaningful to compare the  results of the 27 March 1994 elections to the results of the  1989 local elections. The 1991 general elections could lead to  misleading comparisons because of the alliances. The PP  increased its votes by nine points in five years and did not  regress in any of the regions. The lowest increases were noted  in Mugla at 0.8 percent, in Edirne at 1.2 percent, in Kirklareli  at 1.6 percent, and in Kastamonu at 2.3 percent. The biggest  leap forward of 21.5 percent was registered in Malatya. This  was followed by 19.3 percent in Bingol, 15.9 in Sakarya, 15.2 in  Erzincan, 14.5 in Adiyaman, 14.4 in Ankara, 14.1 in Istanbul,  Kayseri, and Kocaeli, and 14.04 in Corum.  <H5>  The PP-NAP Rivalry </H5>   It became clear in the 1994 elections that the  nationalist-conservative votes, which were concentrated in ANAP  and the TPP in the wake of the 12 September 1980 military  intervention, moved away from the center in the past 10 years.  In the 1991 elections, the PP-NLP-Democratic Reform Party [DRP]  alliance received 16.9 percent of the votes. In 1994, the PP  won 19.0 percent, the NLP, which now goes under the name of NAP,  won 8.0 percent, the GUP, which broke off from the NAP, won 1.2  percent, and the DRP, which changed its name to Nation Party  [NP], received 0.4 percent of the votes. In other words, the  total percent of the votes received by the alliance exceeded 28.  The total number of votes received by the PP, the NAP, the GUP,  and the NP ranged between 40 and 50 percent in the following  provinces: Bayburt, Yozgat, Sivas, Erzurum, Bingol, Konya,  Kayseri, Gumushane, Karaman, Cankiri, Elazig, Corum, Aksaray,  Erzincan, Kahramanmaras.    In most of these provinces, there was a fierce race between  the PP and the NAP. While scoring points by "not recognizing  the Kurdish reality," the NAP used the democratic line advocated  by some of the "civilian" members of the rival party for the  solution of the Kurdish problem as an excuse to accuse these  persons of belonging to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan].  Democratic Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit's "pro-Kurdish"  accusation leveled at the PP served the interests of the NAP in  these areas.    While both parties tried to steal votes from the Sunni-  conservative grassroots, the PP developed policies for the  benefit of low-income Alawite citizens, who live in shantytowns  in urban centers, who have been alienated from the social  democrats, and who are afraid of the NAP. Although it is  difficult to prove, it appears that the PP received votes from  this sector as well.  <H5>  [12 Apr p 21] </H5>   [Text] Following the Prosperity Party [PP] victory in the  local elections, there is new tension. This is felt among  citizens who engage in largely prejudicial predictions regarding  the possible measures PP municipalities may adopt. These  individuals are apprehensive about these possible changes. For  others the election victory symbolizes that "the time for  revenge has finally come." This tension is felt in our daily  life.    The tension stems from the fact that PP opponents and  supporters do not consider themselves equal. The opponents of  the PP consider themselves above the supporters of the party.  These opponents attempt to prove their superiority through  arguments such as "they are 18 percent, as opposed to our 82  percent." The opponents are especially unable to accept the  fact that the PP will run the municipalities of Ankara and  Istanbul.    The supporters of the party, on the other hand, believe that  the election results accord them superiority. We observe that  this sector of the population -- scorned since the republic's  establishment and treated as second-class citizens to be ignored  rather than accorded the proportional interest it deserved prior  to the recent elections -- is afflicted with a wounded sense of  citizenship accompanied by a wounded awareness of Islam. These  mutual claims of superiority become claims of the real ownership  over Turkey. The "Istanbul is ours and will remain ours"  slogans heard during PP demonstrations merely epitomize the "us  and them" discrimination.  <H5>  Is the Prosperity Victory Lasting? </H5>   Even though the PP failed to attain Necmettin Erbakan's goal  of "30-35 percent of the votes and 1,000 municipal posts," it is  clear that the party emerged victorious from the 1994 elections.  Also clear is that the fragmentation of the centrist parties  contributed to this election victory. This victory, however,  brings the PP to the brink of a test for which it may be  unprepared.    The PP, gained strength far from public view. Developing  away from the political limelight resulted in certain advantages  as well as disadvantages for the party. There is no need to  dwell on the advantages, but the degree to which the PP will  brave the disadvantages will determine the future of this party.  The mayoral posts it has won could make or break the PP,  because it must satisfy many categories with different  expectations. The traditional grassroots of the National View  movement occupies the top of this list. To please this sector,  which for better or for worse has Islamic aspirations, the  municipalities of the PP must adopt some Islamization measures.  This is required to dismiss criticism from Islamic circles  which accuse the PP of not being pro-Islam. These  municipalities are also obliged to engage in Islamization moves  to distinguish them from other parties. Moreover, this will  enable them to win over the conservative masses which lean  towards the rightist parties outside the PP. If the promises to  build a mosque in Taksim Square; close down the public brothels;  allocate different buses for female students; and refuse  licenses for alcoholic drinks are fulfilled, these will  inevitably be followed by other measures. Given the fact that  the biggest wish of the PP grassroots consists of not allowing  women with uncovered heads to work in PP municipalities and, if  possible, not allowing women to work in these places altogether,  we can say that this is the limit of the Islamization measures.  <H5>  Work, Food, and Service </H5>   The PP municipalities, however, will feel the shadow of the  state, especially the army, over them in all their moves,  particularly in the big cities. It is therefore very likely  that the PP administration will follow previous mayors and not  allow the state to interfere, in matters such as closing down  brothels and tell its grassroots, who are demanding further  Islamization measures, to "wait until the party takes over the  government and establishes a just order."    The sector that will push the PP furthest consists of the  needy and destitute masses who sympathized with the party for  socioeconomic reasons. These masses, who are difficult to  please with Islamization measures, are expecting employment,  food, and service. The PP approached these masses with populist  statements and extended assistance in cash or in kind, thus  giving the message that "what we are doing is the guarantee of  what we will do in the future." The PP must now develop  concrete projects and realize them successfully.    The claim that there will be no bribery or corruption in PP  municipalities will be put to the test during this period. The  PP will try at all costs not to allow any black marks to tarnish  its municipalities until the first elections. To this end, PP  mayors, who are obliged to continue to work to a large extent  with the old cadres, will try to control the old personnel  through trusted persons they will place in key positions. It is  evident that during this coming period, allegations against the  PP will focus on nepotism rather than bribery and corruption.  <H5>  Imitating the Motherland Party [ANAP] </H5>   PP mayors can also be expected to launch several "mega"  projects. Conservative business circles will be the first ones  to come to mind for new resources. Many businessmen will  inevitably discover conservatism in the wake of the PP municipal  election victory. It is known that MUSIAD [?Muslim Businessmen  Association] gained many new members after the elections. For  example, Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcek referred to "ultra mega"  projects and said that these will be submitted to a tender in  the private sector. The PP is showing signs that it will  imitate the ANAP municipalities during the years 1984-1989.  This may be followed by a recourse to oil-rich Arab countries,  using PP leader Erbakan's connections.    Even if resources are found, it will be necessary to find  the  necessary personnel. In actual fact, the conservative sector  has sufficient professional administrators to manage all of the  country's municipalities. It is not clear, however, to what  extent the PP will or will want to benefit from them. The fate  of the PP municipalities will be directly affected by whether  personnel appointments will be determined according to loyalty  or merit. PP mayors may be expected to act rationally, but it  is also possible that the party headquarters and Erbakan will  appoint "political commissioners" to important municipalities.  Moreover, Tayyip Erdogan and Melih Gokcek could each rise  towards the position of party leadership.  <H5>  Mega Projects </H5>   The "better understanding from technology" element of the  PP's Islamic grassroots will gain confidence in proportion to  the success of "mega" projects. In addition, circles outside  the PP will become more tolerant of this party with each  success. However, these projects are directed toward the  "center" and therefore the poor, who shifted their preference  from the social democrats to the PP, will not be that affected  by these projects, apart from temporary employment  possibilities. The masses looking for "now, instant" solutions  to their problems will find no answers from the "mega" projects  because they are long-term projects.    So, what the PP leaders carry out in this sector -- in  addition to distributing food during Ramadan and fuel in winter;  conducting collective circumcisions and establishing a "marriage  waqf" for the young people -- is very important.    In the past, the PP district mayors complained of not  getting  enough attention and support from the SDPP Metropolitan Mayor  Nurettin Sozen [as published]. They no longer have such  problems. Will the SDPP or ANAP mayors of Sisli, Bakirkoy,  Besiktas, and Kadikoy have similar problems? Tayyip Erdogan is  making promises that he will treat everybody equally. Will he  be able to keep his promise?    Will the en masse layoffs -- postponed by other PP  municipalities until after the elections -- be implemented after  the reactions in Kagithane? If they are, what guidelines will  there be? Will PP supporters be given the jobs of those who  were laid off? This type of questioning can be expanded. It  will then be obvious that the PP mayors will be subjected to the  same questions addressed to other party leaders. The difference  is that the PP has not yet been tested in municipalities and its  perspective from outside the system due to its Islamic motifs.  <H5>  [13 Apr p 21] </H5>   [Text] The National View achieved the biggest ascent in  its history on 27 March 1994 and has embarked on an unknown  future. Undoubtedly, this future will be determined by the steps  taken by the Prosperity Party [PP] and its rivals and changes in  international and national conjunctures. The rivals must have  noticed that it suits the PP to be presented as a force "outside  the system." However, instead of admitting the truth, they are  developing a new strategy of challenging the PP to prove its  sincerity by presenting the PP's claims of being an insider as a  new situation.    To determine its future, the PP must be successful in the  municipalities, or at least give that impression. This is  essential, but not sufficient on its own. Whether it wants it  or not, the PP, which has become the party of the masses, has to  abide by these requirements. Otherwise, efforts to keep the  "ideological backbone" in good condition can take it back to the  10 percent margin.    PP circles can certainly get rid of the "party of the  masses"  label which is associated with degeneration, but the first  condition for this is the full operation of the democratic  channels inside the party. This is the most important handicap  facing the PP. The PP's success stems also from the party  administration preventing the natural organizational  permutations. On account of its centralized structure -- far  from democratic -- a great number of sectors which contributed  to PP's success are not represented in its leadership. The  National Youth Waqf -- the backbone of the party -- is headed  by leaders and administrators who are not young anymore and the  ladies committees are supervised by certain members of the  provincial administrative councils. In short, the PP leadership  is approaching its grassroots with affection but with suspicion.  <H5>  Women in the PP </H5>   A study of the status of PP women, who greatly contributed  to  the success of the party and who are expected to influence its  future, offers important data regarding intraparty democracy.  There were no women mayoral candidates, although it is women  who constitute the most dynamic groups at all party meetings and  who have knocked on every door to conduct party propaganda. In  an interview published in the March 1994 issue of NEHIR  magazine, Sibel Eraslan, chairman of the PP Istanbul Women's  Committee, said: "Currently, we are in the center of active  politics. It will be the PP women who will decide whether or  not to assume office in local authorities or in the central  administration, on the condition that our delegates make such a  request and our administrators view it positively. This is a  matter of historical process, which will finally be decided upon  by PP women. I know that our delegates proposed the names of  some of our colleagues for membership in municipal councils. In  other words, we have names for candidates, but only God knows  what the future holds."    After this interview, Eraslan, whom we met at the 25 March  Sultanahmet meeting, said that only five PP women in Bakirkoy,  Beykoz, and Kadikoy were submitted as municipal council member  candidates out of all the districts in Istanbul. Another PP  member had earlier reported that serious discussions were  conducted at provincial and district administrative councils on  the subject of women candidates and that a significant part of  the all-male administrators opposed women candidates on the  grounds that it constitutes "liberalism." Women in the PP,  whose duty to care for children and cook can be overlooked when  it is necessary to knock on doors to promote the party, are told  that "their place is in the home" when they want to exercise the  right to be elected. As stated by Eraslan, however, the PP  women who are at the center of active politics, know and are  learning that, in addition to the right to elect, which is  considered sacred by their administrators, they are the ones who  will decide whether they want to exercise their right to be  elected. As it happens, Eraslan declares that she will become a  deputy, but she must wait three years until she is 30 years old.  <H5>  Intellectuals in the PP </H5>   The PP's future will also be determined by the nature of its  relations with independent Muslim intellectuals. The PP, which  has stayed away from intellectuals in the past for fear that  they will voice opinions against party discipline, has begun  opening up to them in recent years. The PP submitted some  Muslim nonparty candidates during the general and local  elections based on the belief that they will not pose any  problems because of the responsibility they will shoulder; and  this proved to be largely justified.    The party, which is now at the head of many municipalities,  needs educated people at least to conduct cultural activities.  It is known, however, that some young Muslim intellectuals, who  were employed as press or cultural advisers in district  municipalities, did not work in harmony with the mayors. The  mayors were not willing to provide a wide autonomous area for  these intellectuals who accepted the jobs because they were in  financial difficulties. The formula of "how much money do you  want?" will probably continue because there are many needy  university graduates, educated religious intellectuals, and  semi-intellectuals. There will certainly also be PP mayors who  will regard the creativity and industriousness of Muslim  intellectuals as an advantage and not view the issue as a simple  employment procedure. It is these mayors who can seriously  contribute to Turkey's cultural life and improve the PP's image.  <H5>  Democracy Is the Solution </H5>   It is claimed that PP municipalities will restrain  themselves  and try to appear charming to outsiders for two years because of  the upcoming general elections in 1996. According to another  claim, the PP will benefit from the further impoverishment of  the large masses as a result of the "historic stability package"  announced on 5 April 1994.    However, the fact that PP leader Necmettin Erbakan warned  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who explained the stability  measures to him, about "possible social explosions" could be  seen as an indication that this prediction is not necessarily  correct. If the economic measures fail and the system  collapses, the PP will also be crushed under the wreckage,  because it is also part of the system.    All the same, as in many other things, the PP is capable of  benefiting from the stability package as well, because among the  big parties, the socioeconomic opposition argument of "the rich  are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer" has been  monopolized by the PP. If the stability package falls short of  causing the total collapse of the system and merely results in  the people's suffering, then, barring extraordinary  circumstances, PP victory in the coming elections appears to be  certain.    The PP victory is an opportunity for Turkey to return to  real  politics and shatter the depoliticization of the 12 September  period. But, the sectors which do not have the strength or the  inclination to compete with the PP in the political arena are  consciously rejecting this opportunity and calling each other  for help.    It is desirable for Turkey as a whole that the PP, which  contains fundamentalist, democratic, authoritarian, as well as  pro-freedom elements, adopt a democratic line, just like the  other parties. Everyone has a duty with regard to the  democratization of the PP. Everyone now has a right to speak  about the PP, which has become the property of the whole of  Turkey for the first time. Those who do not support the PP  should seek ways of coexisting and working together in mutual  understanding with PP supporters, while maintaining their  differences.</p>

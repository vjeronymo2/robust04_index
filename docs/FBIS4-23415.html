			<p>BFN     [Text] President Joaquim Chissano has pledged to meet fully  the demands made by the 16,000 soldiers the government  demobilized in June 1993, eight months after the signing of the  General Peace Accord. SAVANA reports the former soldiers feel  they were treated differently from other troops demobilized from  assembly areas. They are demanding the payment of 18 months of  salaries [words indistinct], pension, and what they regard as  perks given to other demobilized troops. SAVANA says Chissano  made the pledge at a meeting held in Maputo on 13 May with a  commission representing the 16,000 demobilized soldiers.    The demobilized soldiers say if their demands are not met  they will destroy business centers owned by Mozambican  officials, boycott the 25 June and 25 September celebrations,  and prevent multiparty elections from being held in October.</p>

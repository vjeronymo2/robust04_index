			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Ford accused of unfair pressure over job losses FORD UK was accused yesterday of using unfair pressure to steer up to 1,200 production and 200 staff employees towards applying for voluntary redundancy over the next four months. The job cuts would bring Ford's total employment losses within its UK operations this year to 2,500. The company said all redundancies would be voluntary. 'No further action will be taken if the targets are not reached,' it said. But in a move which will be seen as designed to encourage early departures, Ford warned that it was reviewing the terms of its voluntary redundancy programmes. Future programmes were likely to offer reduced payments, it said. Mr Jimmy Airlie, principal negotiator with Ford on behalf of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said the company was seeking to blackmail employees into accepting current terms. He said Ford's unions would fight 'rigorously' any attempt to reduce payments. The company has been hit hard by the steep slump this year in continental new car and light commercial vehicle markets. Its share of total new car sales has also declined in the UK, where it is market leader. However, Ford insisted yesterday that the cuts were part of productivity improvements and not directly related to market conditions. The biggest intended job losses, of up to 450 hourly paid workers and 50 staff, are at Dagenham, where Ford makes engines, Fiesta cars and vans, kits for exports and has its general services activities. Up to 350 hourly paid and 20 staff jobs are intended to be cut at the Halewood plants on Merseyside, which make transmissions as well as Escorts, and another 205 jobs are planned to be cut at the Transit van plant at Southampton. Of the remaining job cuts, 140 are to be spread over South Wales plants at Bridgend, Swansea and Treforest, 50 at a Belfast castings plant, 20 at Basildon Radiator and 15 at the Dunton, Essex, research and development centre. Ford made clear that voluntary redundancy programmes could be expected to continue as part of efficiency improvements. These have already seen Ford's UK workforce fall from around 72,000 in 1980 to 31,350, while vehicle output has remained almost steady. The company is also under severe financial pressure, following combined losses of about Pounds 1.5bn over the past three years.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (8) - Up the Creek without a handrail / An 'abra' water taxi ride is not for the faint-hearted The German lady in the group decided against it and called a taxi. The precipitous steps down to the quay were bad enough, but the sight of the flat boats banging together in the murky water proved too much, writes Anne Counsell. An 'abra' water taxi ride across the Creek is not for the faint-hearted. There are no niceties such as handrails or handles, or even seats. The only concession to comfort is a length of striped canvas overhead to shield passengers from the sun, but this seems gratuitous since travellers have, save for a piece of carpet or tiling, to perch on the scorching heat of the engine casing. A raised plank is the only barrier between passengers and the water a foot below. Some abras, when laden with Indian workers, appear to be only the width of the plank away from sinking. The drivers, using a small wheel which turns the wooden rudders, appear to obey few accepted rules of the waterways - heading straight for the nearest docking point from all directions and often denting the sun-bleached wood of the boats and the quay in the jostle to moor. There are no tickets on the abras and the fares are collected after the boat casts off. Its a good idea to have a handful of change as you may not see much back from a note in the scramble to disembark. An hour-long trip around the Creek is worthwhile, costing Dh40. It takes in most of the sights and provides an insight into Creek activity. There is a slight breeze which makes the journey more pleasant than attempting to sightsee on foot and an abra is a far better vantage point than a taxi. Short abra crossings can also be included in city tours which are run by most of the travel operators.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: GARCIA PUTS LIFE INTO DEAD'S 'BUILT';  </P> <P> GRATEFUL DEAD "BUILT TO LAST," ARISTA ** 1/2:  </P> <P> When it's Uncle Jerry's Band, the Dead is something to hear. But when Jerry  Garcia steps back and lets the other guys take over, "Built to Last" subsides  into something less durable. The best songs are the three valedictory numbers  sung and co-written by Garcia. They're fine (especially the title track),  except when Brent Mydland's incongruous synthesizer flourishes creep into the  Dead's woody sound, like prefab housing thrown up in a fine old historic  district.  </P> <P> A couple of Mydland songs about relationship woes provide a good counterpoint  on Side 1 to Garcia's philosophic overviews about striving, understanding and  enduring. But Mydland winds up singing four of the album's nine songs, giving  too much weight to a singer who, while earnest enough, is basically a  second-string Bob Seger.  </P> <P> Bob Weir's two contributions are bookend songs about doubt and inspiration --  the doubt-ridden number, "Victim or the Crime," giving the Dead a chance for  some dark blazing that belies the band's reputation as just a sunny, loping  sound track for the free-form dancing of tie-dyed concert fans. "Built to Last"  holds up well as a thematically coherent look at the prospects for getting by,  and maybe even soaring a bit, in a fallen and dangerous world. But taken one by  one, most of the songs don't live up to the title's warranty. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

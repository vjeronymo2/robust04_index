			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Elzbieta Graczyk: "It's Our Turn Now"] </F>   [Text] Work on the organization of an apolitical, loyal,  and professional civil service corps has continued since the end  of 1989. All successive prime ministers, from Mazowiecki to  Suchocka, believed that the head of the Council of Ministers  Office [URM] should not be involved in any way or degree in the  shaping of any personnel policies in the state. However, thus  far none of the government teams has made an effort to make any  radical moves. During the election campaign, parties belonging  to the present government coalition had very little to say about  their proposed personnel policy. However, it was possible to  predict their appetites when, immediately after the announcement  of the election results, the winners let slip a resounding,  triumphant cry: "It's our turn now!" And that was heard not  only among the so-called grass roots, but also in the ranks of  experienced politicians. For example, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz  soon demanded that immediate changes be made in the Polish  National Bank [NBP] and the Supreme Chamber of Control.  Although the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] leader Aleksander  Kwasniewski tried to tone down such utterances and persuade  people that the alliance wanted to form a government of experts  and did not intend to make profound personnel purges, even  though it did mean to put an end to the Solidarity tradition of  a "buddies' republic," he did not give the impression that he  himself was convinced by his arguments. At that time, the  peasants kept quiet, but, as soon as the coalition negotiations  gave them the prime minister's chair, they began to implement  the principle "it's our turn now" quickly and consistently.    The prime minister's first office appointments turned out to  be quite significant. He gave Ewa Wachowicz, a student from a  farming background and a former Miss Polonia, the post of prime  minister's press assistant. During her very first press  conference, Miss Wachowicz disclosed with a charming smile that  she could say "I love you" in several European languages.  Furthermore, the prime minister appointed the Polish People's  Republic's [PRL] blue-eyed boy Ireneusz Sekula to the office of  head of the Customs and Excise Office, while the post of voivoda  of Olsztyn went to Janusz Lorenz, who was introduced there as  "currently director of a meat-processing plant and author of a  scientific dissertation on the quality of Polish export ham."  Needless to say, Lorenz is a member of the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL]. Already during his Sejm preliminary hearing, the URM  boss Michal Strak (Prime Minister Pawlak's most trusted  colleague and former cabinet director at President Wojciech  Jaruzelski's Chancellery Office) asserted that pre-1989  activists would prove to be better stewards to the country than  their predecessors, and that the coalition parties would refrain  from demanding voivodas' posts for their own members in only 10  voivodships. All announcements made by Strak are extremely  important. At one time, personnel decisions were made by the  Central Committee, while, after 1989, the role of URM head  increased so much (he handles the civil service attached to the  prime minister, the government, and all of the state  administration) that, after the president and the prime  minister, he is practically the third-most-important figure in  the state.    The Office of the Council of Ministers employs 600 people  directly and 900 in so-called ancillary enterprises. During the  17 months of the so-called system transformation, Tadeusz  Mazowiecki dismissed 293 URM employees and appointed 304. On  leaving office, Strak's predecessor, Jan Maria Rokita, had  prepared a complete draft program of a transformation of the URM  structure and organization. The present incumbent has no  intention of implementing Rokita's program or even reforming it  according to his own concepts. "On assuming office, our new  civil servants do not need to memorize room numbers or acquaint  themselves with the telephone system. These are people who know  very well how to move around the URM."    New appointments to the URM include one secretary of state,  six under secretaries, and five directors general. The posts of  secretary of state and secretary of the Economic Committee of  the Council of Ministers [KERM] went to Andrzej Zor, a  54-year-old philologist, formerly (1978-82) departmental  director at a ministry, later in other high-ranking URM posts,  then Polish Republic ambassador to Malaysia. He has had no  party allegiance since the dissolution of the Polish United  Workers Party [PZPR].    The posts of under secretary of state were offered to  Kazimierz Korona, a graduate of the Main School of Planning and  Statistics [SGPiS], an activist of the agricultural circles  movement, a member of the supreme administration of the United  Peasant Party [ZSL], an URM official since 1984, a ZSL and  Polish Peasant Party [PSL] adviser to deputy prime ministers,  and deputy director at the State Treasury Agricultural Property  Agency since 1992; and Stanislaw Dobrzanski, a graduate of the  Maria Curie-Sklodowska University [UMC], former deputy director  of the National Library in Warsaw, subsequently director of the  Sugar Refineries Industrial Bank's East Poland Division, and a  member of the PSL. The posts of URM under secretary of state  and secretary of the Council of Ministers' Sociopolitical  Committee went to Grzegorz Rydlewski, a graduate and member of  the Institute of Political Sciences and a high-ranking official  of the Office for Religious Denominations during the 1980's,  since 1990 a member of the Public Initiatives Foundation, and a  PZPR member until 1990. He is directly responsible to  Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz. Another under secretary of state is  Jan Zagajewski, a former employee of the Spolem [food retail]  cooperative and later an official at the City Office in  Pruszkow. He was URM director general during Pawlak's 33 days  [first term of office as prime minister in 1992], and has  returned to URM now.    Two more appointees to the office of secretary of state are  prime minister Pawlak's advisers Andrzej Wieczorkiewicz and  Franciszek Mleczko. The former has no party affiliation and is  a professor of economic sciences; the latter, also a nonparty  member (but a PZPR member until the party's dissolution), is a  sociologist, formerly a lecturer at the Main School of Rural  Economy [SGGW] and the Academy of Social Sciences attached to  the PZPR Central Committee [KC]. He was deputy director at the  Ministry of Culture and the Arts in the years 1974-78. He  collaborated with Michal Strak and was author of election  forecasts and analyses for the PSL.    The post of URM director general was offered to Andrzej  Piwowarczyk, former teacher and later a high-ranking official at  the Voivodship Office in Siedlce, who, tragically, died recently  in a car accident. Another URM returnee is Jan Guz, a graduate  of Leningrad University, an employee of the PZPR Central  Committee Planning and Analysis Department and a long-serving  adviser to former prime ministers in the 1970's and the 1980's;  and Marian Wegorowski, also a long-serving and high-ranking URM  official, a PZPR member from 1951 until the party's dissolution,  currently of no party affiliation. He now runs the URM  personnel movements department. The post of head of the Public  Administration Office was won by Marek Ungier, political  scientist and activist in the Union of Socialist Polish Youth  [ZSMP], and then (from 1974 to 1990) in the PZPR. He was later  a partner in a light-clothing business, a member of the  Supervisory Board of the ATU Insurance Society, an activist in  the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], and an  adviser to the SdRP chairman.    The following have returned to active politics (not only as  high-ranking officials but also as advisers to the prime  minister and the URM boss): Wladyslaw Szymanski, former member  of the Council of State and ZSL and PSL expert; Marek Ksiazek,  deputy chairman of the Cepelia [Central Office of Folk and  Artistic Crafts] cooperative; Tadeusz Materka, retired leader  (active since 1952) of the peasant movement, former voivoda of  Piotrkow and Rzeszow, former deputy chairman of the Samopomoc  Chlopska [Peasant Self-Help] cooperative, and former deputy  chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control. He held the office  of domestic trade vice minister during and after the martial law  period. Finally, Jan Bisztyga, former PZPR Central Committee  press spokesman and author of the party's new information policy  advising "throwing open the doors to party committees" following  the 12th PZPR Congress, previously under secretary of state at  the Foreign Ministry and ambassador to Greece. Until his  retirement (in 1992), he was active as an adviser to Wojciech  Jaruzelski.    There have also been many changes among high- and  middle-ranking officials at all ministries. By the end of  January, new appointments were made for six secretaries, 37  under secretaries, and eight directors general at 16 ministries  and two central administration offices. Here, as at URM, the  new appointees are drawn mainly from the "pool" of former PRL  officials returning to their previous--or higher--ministerial  offices. At the Construction Ministry, the post of secretary was  given to Tomasz Lodeczka, until recently chairman of a housing  construction cooperative in Bielsko-Biala (SdRP member), and  that of secretary to Wojciech Rzepka, who has been associated  with that sector since 1978. AT the Ministry of Ownership  Transformations, appointments to the post of under secretary  went to Jozef Kowalczyk, a journalist writing for CHLOPSKA DROGA  [Peasant Way] and ZIELONY SZTANDAR [Green Banner] and head of  the ZSL Supreme Committee Press Office, and Andrzej Zebrowski, a  lawyer at the Main School of Commerce and chairman of the Profit  company.    At the Ministry of National Education [MEN], the posts of  under secretary of state were given to the following: Tadeusz  Pilch, philosopher and PSL member; Danuta Grabowska, the  ministry's schools superintendent in Radom, formerly a PZPR  (later SdRP) Sejm deputy; and Kazimierz Dera, director of the  MEN Personnel Department from the imposition of martial law  until 1990.    Appointments to the post of under secretary of state at the  Ministry of Culture and Arts [MKiS] were given to Waclaw Janas,  who was MKiS vice minister in the years 1983-90, and Zdzislaw  Podkanski, longstanding Rural Youth Union [ZMW] and ZSL activist  in voivodship structures. Two new under secretaries of state at  the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Economy began their careers  at posts with the State Agricultural Farms [PGR]. They are  Jerzy Pilarczyk and Ryszard Smolarek. Pilarczyk, who belongs to  the SdRP, later represented the PGR Association at the Agency  for Agricultural Marketing [ARR] Council; Smolarek, who for many  years represented the ZSL in the Sejm, managed his own farm  after leaving the PGR.    Jacek Buchacz, a new appointee at the Ministry of Health and  Social Welfare, was active on the board of the Dairy  Cooperatives Association and in the Juventur [student travel  agency] until 1986, and then held the post of secretary at the  Polish Embassy in Morocco until 1990. New vice ministers at the  Justice Ministry are Grzegorz Ciecierski (PSL), formerly an  official at the Finance Ministry, and Bohdan Zdziennicki (no  party affiliation now), a member of the Bench at the Supreme  Administrative Court [NSA] since 1981.    Jerzy Szreter is back at the Ministry of Labor and Social  Policy, where he has been employed since 1978. As secretary of  state, he took part in the Roundtable Talks; still earlier, he  worked at the PZPR Central Committee Economic Management  Department. Another returnee is Leslaw Nawacki, who was  employed at the Labor Ministry until the end of 1991.    Following the successive dismissals of Stefan Kawalec, Marek  Borowski, and, recently, even Witold Modzelewski, the Finance  Ministry suffers from an unstable personnel situation. In  practice, it is currently headed by Henryk Chmielak, director of  the Planning Commission 1987-89, later under secretary of state  at the Central Planning Administration, and, still later, deputy  chairman of the [Government] Committee for Radio and Television  Affairs. He describes himself as "an expert with no party  affiliation."    Henryk Jasik is new under secretary of state at the Ministry  of Internal Affairs [MSW]. A chemist by profession, Jasik was  employed at the scientific and technical directorate of the  intelligence service between 1970 and 1990; later, he held the  post of director at Department I--that is, the Intelligence  Service--and also worked for the State Protection Office [UOP].  The MSW gains Jerzy Kozminski (transferred from URM) and  Stanislaw Szymanski (from a succession of diplomatic posts).  CUP gains Jozef Zegar, professor of economics at the Main  School of Planning and Statistics, formerly chief editor of WIES  WSPOLCZESNA [Contemporary Rural Community], deputy chairman of  the Council of Ministers Planning Commission (1986), and a PSL  activist.    The new head of the Office for Veterans Affairs is Adam  Dobronski, historian of the peasant movement. He owes his  appointment to the support his nomination received from veteran  soldiers of the People's Army [AL] and the Peasant Battalions  [BCh].    A proposal offering the post of chairman of the General  Savings Bank-National Bank [PKO-BP] Supervisory Board was  extended to Marian Krzak, currently chairman of the Union of  Polish Banks [ZBP], former finance minister (1980-82) and PKO-BP  chairman (appointed 1988), dismissed by Prime Minister Bielecki  in 1991.    Zbigniew Sobotka, PZPR Central Committee member since 1986  and Politburo member since 1988, is to represent the government  coalition interests in the president's office.    In addition, a wholesale exchange of heads of the  government's local administration structures was carried out  until quite recently on a nationwide scale. "We have reached a  situation where the personal composition of the voivodas' corps  is almost settled. We are a stable and cohesive team," Michal  Strak said during a recent meeting with voivodas. Of the total  of 49 voivodas, 27 were dismissed from their posts. Strak also  added the following remark: "The transfer of power was effected  in a pleasant atmosphere, and I was even posing for photographs  with the former Lodz voivoda," who is a Christian National Union  [ZChN] member. Asked about the new voivodas' party membership  profiles, Strak admitted that the PSL took advantage of the  changes to a much greater extent than the SSLD. During the  aforementioned meeting, voivodas were asked to evaluate a  proposed parliamentary bill on the Council of Ministers, which  provides for the automatic dismissal of voivodas following each  successive change of government unless the new prime minister  chooses to extend their "contracts." In Strak's opinion, such  contracts will serve to stabilize the administration system and,  at the same time, highlight the principle that a voivoda  represents the current government in his administrative area.    We note that a pattern of civil servants returning to office  according to a specific political key applies not only at URM.  Notably, the Ministry of Culture and the Arts--or, more  specifically, its head, Minister Dejmek--is eager to spend 20  billion zlotys to sponsor publication of a new periodical  devoted to cultural affairs and edited by Krzysztof Teodor  Toeplitz. The periodical is likely to be a weekly, with a print  run of 50,000. As yet, its future chief editor has no blueprint  for the periodical's program or the composition of his editorial  team. But he has the money: the taxpayers' money.</p>

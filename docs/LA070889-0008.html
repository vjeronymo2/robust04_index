			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICKLAUS' NEW COURSE OUT OF BOUNDS FOR MANY  </P> <P> I have admired Jack Nicklaus, the golfer and the man, for nearly 30 years. His  contributions to the game are legend. And yet . . .  </P> <P> Nicklaus' course design for David Murdock's enclave for the super rich, the  Lake Sherwood Country Club, further divides the game of golf between the  ultra-haves and the not-so-lucky.  </P> <P> The nature of Lake Sherwood's shrine to grandiosity is to be found in the  quaint Marie Antoinette style of its publicity. The first 300 "deemed worthy"  (and who can come up with $100,000) will be admitted.  </P> <P> It is not the best of all worlds when the words wealthy and worthy are  seemingly synonymous.  </P> <P> JOHN FREDERICK  </P> <P> Lake Sherwood  </P></p>

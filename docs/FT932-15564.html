			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Seoul sides with China in N-crisis SEOUL should cooperate more closely with Beijing instead of relying solely on the US in resolving the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapon programme, South Korea's new ambassador to China said yesterday, writes John Burton in Seoul. 'We have seen issues too much through western eyes in the past,' Mr Hwang Byung-tai, a former close aide to South Korean president Kim Young-sam, told a news conference. His blunt remarks underscore a growing divergence of views between Seoul and Washington on the nuclear issue, matched by closer ties with China - after diplomatic links were established last August. 'I believe it is time for us to take into account Chinese perspectives in dealing with South-North (Korean) issues,' Mr Hwang said. He added China was likely to play a pivotal role in solving the nuclear crisis as it was the principal supplier of food, oil and coke to North Korea.</p>

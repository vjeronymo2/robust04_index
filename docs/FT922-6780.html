			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases in absence of Fed move on rates Wall Street US SHARES turned slightly lower following signs from the Federal Reserve that monetary policy would remain on hold, at least for another day, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 3,400 level at 11.30am, by adding a mere 2.93 points, but it failed to hang on to its slim gain and ended 4.15 down on balance at 3,393.84. New York SE turnover, which has been thin in recent weeks, was moderate with 198.7m shares changing hands. Declining issues narrowly exceeded advances by 861 to 820. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 0.98 to 415.39, but the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks added 2.24 at 580.29. On Tuesday, the Dow climbed 21.96 to a record close of 3,397.99, assisted by widespread speculation that a surprisingly sharp drop in April's US housing starts would prompt the Fed to ease monetary policy. Share prices turned lower shortly after the Fed failed to intervene in the open market, which was taken as a sign that it did not intend to reduce interest rates. The Fed often signals a change in monetary policy through its open market operations. A large offering by General Motors on Tuesday also put pressure on prices. The company's global public offering of 55m shares were priced at Dollars 39 apiece through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley. The company, which has said it would use the proceeds to improve liquidity and its balance sheet, had increased the size of the offering from 50m. GM eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39. Of the other big US auto makers, Chrysler softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 and Ford lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 44 1/4 . Humana tumbled Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23 in active trading after the company warned that a decline in hospital admissions and heavy discounting might cut into its third-quarter profits. It has projected earnings of less than 50 cents a share in the quarter, compared with 64 cents a year earlier. In the department store sector, Dayton Hudson advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 , adding to its Dollars 3 5/8 gain on Tuesday which followed news of first-quarter net income of 40 cents a share, against 39 cents a year earlier. Dean Witter Reynolds has added the issue to its recommended list and increased its rating on the stock to 'buy'. A number of blue chip stocks were prominent among the most active issues on the NYSE, including Walt Disney, down Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 , McDonalds, up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 46 1/8 , and Coca-Cola, off Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 44 3/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Intel led trading, rising Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 7/8 . QVC Network jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 20 5/8 on news of first-quarter net earnings from operations of 29 cents a share, compared with 5 cents a share on fewer shares outstanding a year earlier. An initial public offering of 2.2m shares in Holson Burnes was priced at Dollars 14, and the stock traded at Dollars 14 3/8, up Dollars 3/8. Canada TORONTO shadowed Wall Street to end slightly down as many investors remained on the sidelines awaiting further news on possible cuts in US and Canadian interest rates. The market is still hoping for a reduction in the US discount rate and a lowering of Canadian prime rates. Some traders said an expected 13 basis-point fall in today's Bank of Canada key lending rate could lead to a round of  1/4 percentage point prime lending rate cuts by leading Canadian banks. The composite index finished 4.1 lower at 3,381.2 and declines outscored rises by 314 to 246, with 251 issues unchanged. Volume came to 26.7m shares.</p>

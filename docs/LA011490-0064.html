			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL DREAM  </P> <P> Last year for the first time I went to Israel in March.  </P> <P> I loved it so much that I returned with my family in November. Israel is a  tourist's dream. Great food, lovely accommodations, history, modern cities and  sites that leave you breathless.  </P> <P> Some recommendations: Laromme Hotel in Jerusalem, lovely accommodations, indoor  heated pool and a very helpful staff; La Pasta restaurant, Jerusalem. A tour  guide is a must; my family and I spent four days with Gozal Ben Shaul who  speaks excellent English and is well-versed historically. He can design a tour  to fit interests. His number is (04) 336-779.  </P> <P> JUDY MARTINEZ  </P> <P> Topanga  </P></p>

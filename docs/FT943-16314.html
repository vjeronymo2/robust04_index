			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: John Menzies improves 14% - Newspaper price cuts against industry interests says wholesaler A strong performance from distribution was behind a 12 per cent rise in annual profits at John Menzies, the wholesale and retail chain. Group pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 34.4m in the year to end-April, on turnover up from Pounds 1.17bn to Pounds 1.23bn. Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, managing director, said the group had produced 'solid, sensible results in a difficult year'. The distribution division lifted operating profits by 15 per cent, from Pounds 20.9m to Pounds 24m, on turnover up 8 per cent, from Pounds 768.1m to Pounds 829.5m. Mr Noel-Paton said the newspaper wholesale business had so far been unaffected by the newspaper price war, but 'it would be unwise to assume that it won't'. Circulations remained under pressure in spite of price cutting which the group does not believe is in the long-term interests of the industry. However, wholesale growth was driven by a strong performance from magazines and periodicals. Sales and profits also grew strongly at TBD, which distributes home entertainment and books. Sales at Universal Office Supplies were higher, but intense competition kept profits under pressure. Operating profits at the retailing side edged ahead to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 11.1m) on sales ahead from Pounds 375.7m to Pounds 402.1m. John Menzies Retail, with 263 outlets, experienced 'tremendous' competition in the high street, with higher sales driven by price cutting. But trials of revised store lay-outs had proved encouraging. Early Learning Centres had performed 'very satisfactorily'. The two superstores, which carry clothing and nursery goods as well as toys and books, had proved a success and the group was spending Pounds 4m to bring 10 new superstores on stream this year. The group had also opened its first franchised ELC outlet in the Middle East. The group invested Pounds 30m in the year, up Pounds 8.5m. It plans to invest a similar amount in the current year. Net interest payable halved from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 800,000, reflecting strong cashflow and lower rates. Earnings per share advanced from 35.3p to 40.7p. A final dividend of 7.7p is proposed, taking the total to 11.8p (10.8p). COMMENT While these results can by no means be seen as disappointing, there are a couple of areas that need to be watched carefully in the current year. The most important is newspaper distribution. While distributors' margins have been protected during the price cuts, they are unlikely to move higher for some time. On the retailing side, the John Menzies shops are not performing as they should be, and it is not yet clear that the management has found the right format. Profits of Pounds 37m this year give a prospective multiple of 13 - a discount to the market that makes the shares an unexciting hold.</p>

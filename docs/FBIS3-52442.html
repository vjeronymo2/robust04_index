			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jerusalem correspondent Nadav Shragay] </F>   [Text] Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said that he was not  concerned or unduly ruffled by the official demarche submitted  by the United States over construction plans in the Jerusalem  area. Olmert said that with all due respect to the Americans and  their amazement over the scope of construction around the city,  they must understand that the future of Israel's capital will  not be decided by the U.S. State Department.    Olmert declared his intention to foil any possibility of  Jerusalem becoming the Palestinian capital. This was one of the  reasons to increase construction work around the city.    "As far as the United States is concerned, the neighborhoods  of Gilo, Ramot and Pisgat Ze'ev are not part of Jerusalem, and  whoever wants to get along with the Americans has to give up  Gilo as well. Of course, this is totally inconceivable," Olmert  said.    Olmert met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the  beginning  of the week and presented a plan to pave "the east ring road,"  which was approved by the local planning board during the  previous government's tenure. Olmert wants to expedite the  paving of the road. One segment of the road lies outside the  city's municipal jurisdiction.    According to Olmert, the road will prevent Arabs coming from  the north from crossing through Jerusalem on their way to towns  situated to its south.    In his meeting with Rabin, Olmert asked the prime minister  to  make sure that the government ministries fulfill their  commitments to the Jerusalem Municipality expeditiously. Rabin  acceded to the request and promised to instruct the ministers to  give Jerusalem priority in their policies.</p>

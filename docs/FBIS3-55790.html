Anatoliy Smirnov, who has not yet turned 30, defeated former  speaker Yuriy Manakov who boasts the highest popularity rating  in the republic, according to the latest opinion polls.    Smirnov made a typical Soviet-Russian style career. He began  as an ordinary worker, but then switched to Komsomol, the youth  branch of the former Soviet Communist Party, and succeeded to  raise to the post of the secretary of a district party committee.    However, when market reforms began in the country, Smirnov  abandoned the Communist post and went to work in a commercial  bank and after that to a property managing fund which organised  privatisation.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Nordex share trading system ceases operations A CROSS-BORDER share trading system that had sought to pioneer international screen-based dealing in Europe has ceased to operate, sounding a warning to other planned ventures which aim to service Europe's equity markets in the coming months. Nordex, launched two years ago to trade Scandinavian and, later, Dutch shares, ceased to operate as a market just before Christmas. It had acted as an anonymous screen-based dealing service, capturing trade that flowed between the home markets of the companies whose shares were traded and the active international share market in London. At its peak, Nordex only managed to capture around 2 per cent of the international market in these shares, said Mr Clive Archer, managing director of Transvik, which owned Nordex. He blamed lower volumes in Scandinavian stocks and high Scandinavian settlement charges, which he put at around Pounds 50 a trade. Nordex also suffered from the extra costs associated with using Citicorp as a central guarantor to the system. Besides the cost of paying the bank for providing the guarantee, Citicorp acted as a counterparty to all transactions, effectively doubling the number of trades that needed to be settled and doubling settlement costs. Nordex had also antagonised some of its broker-dealer users when it began to offer the service direct to their institutional customers, said Mr Archer. The closure comes after a difficult period for Scandinavian markets generally, and an attempt by Sweden to recapture turnover in Swedish shares by dropping its turnover tax. The London Stock Exchange said that, while the volume of Scandinavian shares traded on its Seaq International market had not declined, it has lost two Scandinavian market-makers in the past year, reducing the number to eight. Nordex's departure comes as other providers are preparing to target the secondary equity markets in Europe. Among them is Tradepoint, a venture which plans to use trading technology developed by the Vancouver Stock Exchange to break into the European market. Mr Peter Bennett, chief executive, said yesterday that Nordex's failure did not spell problems for Tradepoint, which would target London-based share trading and had already sorted out technological and regulatory issues ahead of its launch which took Nordex two years to resolve. Tradepoint was officially given a listing in Vancouver at the end of last year.</p>

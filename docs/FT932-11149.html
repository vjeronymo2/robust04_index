			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Naples is bankrupt with debts of Dollars 1.4bn THE city government of Naples, blighted by a widening corruption scandal, has declared itself bankrupt with an estimated Dollars 1.4bn in debts, Reuter reports from Naples. Following a proposal by Mr Nicola Mancino, interior minister, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is to appoint a commission to run the city's finances, after the southern port city's council voted to declare itself bankrupt. Investigators have claimed that city councillors from several parties, including the Christian Democrats and Socialists, financed their electoral campaigns with kickbacks on public works contracts for the World Cup soccer finals in 1990. A dozen members of the city council are under investigation in the scandal. Police yesterday said they had arrested Mr Ferdinando Clemente, a former president of the local regional council, who is accused of extortion. Nearly half the city's debt is expected to be covered by the central government. The council hopes to recover the rest by various means, including an appeal to the Napoli soccer club to pay an estimated Dollars 13.6m in rent arrears for its stadium.</p>

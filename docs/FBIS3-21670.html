Interior Minister Dr. Muhammad  Harbah deputized for the prime minister. The session opening  was attended by a number of ministers; (Bernard Farahi),  representative of the UN drug-control program; and (Kendall),  secretary general of Interpol. The opening was also attended by  assistant ministers, heads of desks and departments at the  Interior Ministry, representatives of the popular organizations  and trade unions, a number of Arab and foreign ambassadors in  Damascus, and the heads and members of the delegations  participating in the session.    Dr. Harbah delivered a speech in which he welcomed the  participants in this session, noting the importance of its  convening in Damascus. He added that this shows Syria's  interest in the issue of narcotics.    The interior minister referred to the drug combating law  issued last year. He said this law has two characteristics:    First: The law views drug addicts as individuals who must be  treated. He added that the country has established specialized  sanatoriums for the treatment of addicts and has avoided legal  pursuit of addicts if they approached a sanatorium for  treatment. He added that an establishment has been set up to  care for and rehabilitate addicts who had received treatment in  sanatoriums so that they can adapt to the society and prevent  their deviation.    Second: The law calls for applying tough measures, including  the death penalty, against all those who commit crimes of  trafficking, cultivating, or manufacturing drugs.    The interior minister added that in 1987 Syria formed a  national committee for narcotics and psychotropic drugs. This  committee is charged with laying down general policies and  coordinating cooperation between the various drug combating  quarters in the country and their Arab and international  counterparts. He added that an independent directorate for  drugs was established in Syria with the aim of activating and  reinforcing preventive, combat, and treatment measures.    Minister Harbah added that Syria has participated in laying  down and endorsing the Arab strategy for combating the illegal  use of narcotics and psychotropic drugs, the phased steps  stemming from this strategy, and in adopting an ideal unified  Arab draft law on narcotics.    Dr. Harbah said: Syria concluded bilateral cooperation  agreements in the drug combating field with Saudi Arabia,  Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and Oman. It also signed the Arab  agreement for drug combating adopted by the Arab Interior  Ministers Council at the beginning of this year. It has been  cooperating with the Arab Center for Security Studies and  Training in holding narcotics seminars.    On the international level, Harbah stressed that Syria is a  party to the international agreements on narcotics and a member  of the subcommittee on illegal drug trafficking in the Near and  Middle East. He added that Syria signed bilateral agreements  with Turkey, Cyprus, and Iran for cooperation in combating  drugs. He said that it also participates in regional seminars  and meetings on combating drugs. The minister reiterated the  importance of this seminar and presented many basic working  points. Noting the importance of self immunity, he said: We,  in Syria, work hard to implant in our youths religious, social,  and cultural deterrents which are an important factor and  impregnable shield which protect people from falling victim to  narcotics. We also work toward tackling ignorance, family  divisions, and illiteracy. The interior minister underscored  the role of educational institutions as well as cultural,  social, and sport clubs in looking after youths and protecting  them. He also highlighted the role of popular organizations and  trade unions which contributed to enlightening people.  Consequently, he added, the narcotics problem remained very  limited and was not a cause for concern.    The interior minister added: In order to continue the war on  drugs, illegal cultivation of narcotic plants should be stopped,  drug combating personnel should receive continuous training to  enhance their performance, and the extradition of drug criminals  must be included in agreements signed between countries.

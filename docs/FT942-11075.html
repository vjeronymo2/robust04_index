			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Civil war threatens to redivide Yemen: Eric Watkins in Sanaa explains why politics and religion have torn the recently united country apart The outbreak of civil war in Yemen has all but put paid to the country's aspirations to become a unified, democratic and modern state. Instead, there are fears that prolonged fighting between rival northern and southern factions could lead to the establishment of two or more Yemens, or to complete fragmentation. This week's fighting is primarily the outcome of growing economic disarray, and of irreconcilable political aims which have marred the union of north and south contrived nearly four years ago. The leaders of the two Yemens, General Ali Abdullah Saleh for the north and Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh for the south, each had good reason to enter the union. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, Mr Beidh and his Yemen Socialist party were in a highly exposed position. Having supported Marxist incursions into Afghanistan, Ethiopia and neighbouring Oman, Mr Beidh and his political partners were isolated from the rest of the Arab community and, with the example of the Ceausescu regime in Romania before them, faced a sudden end to their political careers. Foreign debts of some Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) and few sources of revenue added to the southerners' precarious position. In the north, Gen Saleh was also having problems. Although he had provided a stable regime for some 10 years, the parliament elected in 1988 was already beginning to launch investigations into his government and, not least, was demanding greater democratic freedom for itself and the people in general. The north's debts were lower and its assets greater, especially because of oil production begun under Gen Saleh, but its economy was beginning to falter from high imports and a drop in remittances from expatriate workers in the Gulf. The union of south and north Yemen on May 22 1990 was thus a marriage of convenience involving two sickly economies, dressed up for popular appeal with promises of democracy. Yemen's Gulf war stance contributed to its descent into civil war. While condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Yemen likewise condemned the US-led coalition and called for negotiations within a purely Arab context. Stung by such lacklustre support from their impoverished neighbours, Saudi Arabia quickly changed its residency rules in September 1990, forcing nearly 1m Yemenis to leave the country. The sudden decline in remittances and the simultaneous needs of so many extra people were disastrous for Yemen's economy. A year later, the Yemeni riyal was trading at 37 to Dollars 1, a drop of nearly 200 per cent over its pre-war value. Today it trades at 78 to Dollars 1. Political in-fighting has been the chief cause of Yemen's conflict. Almost from the outset of unification, Yemen found itself plagued by a series of unexplained assassinations and attempted murders. Ominously, most of the targets were Mr Beidh's political associates. Repeatedly, the socialists demanded stronger security measures and determined efforts to catch and punish the assassins. The Saleh regime turned a blind eye to the problem and, as it did so, the southerners became increasingly convinced of its determination to see them liquidated. Elections on April 27 1993 also convinced Mr Beidh and his party of Gen Saleh's intentions to marginalise them in the government. Within days the fundamentalist Islah party began to demand a greater role in government because of its performance at the election. The socialists grudgingly yielded and, together with Gen Saleh's General Peoples' Congress, entered into a coalition with Islah. The new coalition had no sooner been formed than Islah leaders, with the apparent approval of Gen Saleh, began to demand a repeal of socialist-sponsored legislation. Fearing the gradual erosion of his party's position and the potential annexation of the entire south as a result, Mr Beidh left Sanaa in August 1993, vowing not to return. In September 1993 he issued an 18-point programme of national reform as a condition of his return to Sanaa. Though Gen Saleh and Mr Beidh eventually signed the agreement last February the document has never been implemented, nor is it ever likely to be. The crisis turns on many factors, not least last year's parliamentary elections. Few in Yemen accept the results as genuine, citing many abuses in the electoral proceedings before, during and after the vote. As the editor of one newspaper recently wrote, they were 'make-believe elections'. But Gen Saleh and his political allies claim to have won a legitimate mandate and, with it, the right to use military force to preserve the unity forged four years ago. Mr Beidh does not accept Gen Saleh's claim to legitimacy, seeing it as a ploy to annex the south and to impose his will by force over the entire nation.  ---------------------------------------------------------------                        YEMEN: KEY FACTS  --------------------------------------------------------------- Population                                                 13m  --------------------------------------------------------------- GNP per capita                         Dollars 300-Dollars 400  --------------------------------------------------------------- Oil production                                      340,000b/d  --------------------------------------------------------------- Marib/Jawf fields                                   195,000b/d (Operator: Hunt Oil Company)  --------------------------------------------------------------- Masila, Hadhramaut                                  135,000b/d (Operator: Canadian Occidental)  --------------------------------------------------------------- Shabwa                                                5,000b/d (Operator: Atlantic Richfield)  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: MEED  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

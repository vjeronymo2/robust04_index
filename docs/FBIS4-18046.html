			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yaroslav Shimov report: "President's Experts Hunt for </F> Economic Idiocies" -- from the "Expert Analysis" section]    [Text] The Russian president's group of economics experts  was organized in the fall of 1991 by Professor Igor Nit, now  sadly deceased. For the first time academics who had contrived  to study the problems of the market economy for several years in  a country where official theory invariably coupled the word  "market" with the term "capitalist," which had a universally  negative sense, were included among the president's expert  advisers.    The group was and remains very small: There are six people  directly involved in work connected with the formation of  economic policy. The majority are young people aged between 25  and 40. In the words of the group's current leader, Doctor of  Economic Sciences Aleksandr Livshits, two qualities serve as the  criterion for the selection of experts: professionalism and  personal integrity. Mr. Livshits calls his staffers "ammunition  carriers," not, however, investing this term with any scorn. In  the final analysis, no weapon will fire without shells.    The 47-year-old leader of the expert group has been in his  current post for just six weeks. Before this, having graduated  from the Plekhanov Institute of the National Economy, he spent  many years in academic work. He devoted his doctoral  dissertation to market problems -- to "Reaganomics," the economy  policy of the U.S. Administration in the first half of the  eighties.    The experts handle three things. First, "they support the  president's current work on economic questions." To put it  simplistically, they endeavor to make presidential edicts  concerning the economy as rational and useful as possible.  Second, they make short-term forecasts of the country's  economic development. Third, they assess decisions on economic  questions made by the president, the government, and the  legislature.    Objections to these decisions arise among the experts quite  frequently. One recent example is the issue of changing customs  tariffs. On this score the expert group has its own opinion,  which it will endeavor to bring to the president's notice. The  experts also had a hand in B. Yeltsin's recent letter to V.  Chernomyrdin and to the Federal Assembly and Central Bank  leaders on the subject of the defaulting problem.    Although the expert evaluations do not always please  everyone, the group's leader claims that there have been no  significant conflicts between government structures and the  experts. Relations with the State Duma are also developing just  fine.    The president sees his own experts rarely. However, for them  it is not personal contact with Boris Yeltsin that is of  greatest significance but the frequency with which the president  reads the analytical memoranda and other documents that the  expert group sends him. After all, right now in Russia economic  policy is above all the result of a struggle between powerful  lobbies whose deep bass is capable of drowning out the quiet  voice of the specialists.    However, on so important a document as the draft state  budget  the experts did manage to exert their influence. Their remarks  and proposals were sent to B. Yeltsin in Sochi, where the  president vacationed in March. In the words of Aleksandr  Livshits, a significant number of these observations were taken  on board by those who finalized the draft. As a result more  attention was devoted in the budget to the social sphere.    The experts themselves are also people of flesh and blood,  with their own prejudices in economics and politics. However,  according to their own claims, the expert group endeavors to be  as objective as possible, keeping within the limits of strictly  economic calculations and forecasts. As for attempts to lobby  the president via the experts, few have been made. The group  leader refused to cite specific examples, referring to the fact  that "the interests of the most diverse forces are mixed up in  this business."    The Kremlin's comfortable offices dispose one to speculative  constructs: Let us do such-and-such, they say, and rivers of  milk and honey will flow from Moscow to the borders.  Understanding this, the president's experts endeavor to behave  fairly openly, meeting with a very wide variety of people.  Among those who have visited them recently are "black-hands"  (representatives of the independent mine workers' trade union),  bankers, and farmers. Incidentally, most visitors complain that  reforms, especially in the provinces, are at a standstill, and  bureaucracy is as all-powerful as ever.    Apparatus traditions should be anathema to the president's  analysts themselves, even though their group belongs to the  Russian president's staff of aides. None of the Kremlin  economics experts worked under old system with the state leaders  who preceded B. Yeltsin. Overall, the chief of the expert group  sums up his work as follows: "Perhaps we have not done so very  much. I cannot say precisely that we have managed to save  Russia from a mass of economic idiocies which might have been  committed."</p>

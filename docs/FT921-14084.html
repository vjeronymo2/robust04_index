			<p>920117 FT  17 JAN 92 / Privatisation to go private Turkey's privatisation agency is to be restructured as a private company, in an attempt to insulate the government from criticism before the sale of state assets, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara. The changes form a key part of an economic package to be unveiled this weekend following yesterday's presentation of the new budget to parliament. More than 120 state companies are to be grouped under this new body, which will prepare them for sale. Companies affected include THY, the national airline, cement factories and the Tupras oil refining corporation.</p>

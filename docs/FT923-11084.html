			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Iraq bows to UN pressure IRAQ yesterday averted its most serious clash with the United Nations since the Gulf war by agreeing to allow inspectors to search its agriculture ministry in Baghdad. The agreement appeared to lift any immediate threat of western military action against Iraq to enforce the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire. But President George Bush branded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 'a bully, a dictator, a merchant of death' and warned that the world would not tolerate further Iraqi defiance. Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN official overseeing the dismantling of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is due to arrive in the Iraqi capital tomorrow accompanied by a new UN inspection team headed by a German. The team was appointed after discussions with the Iraqis at the weekend. As a gesture to Baghdad, two American members of the team will not enter the disputed ministry but will stay outside, sifting through any material their colleagues take from inside. Asked if the crisis was over, Mr Ekeus said: 'I feel the immediate problem is now settled. I am convinced about that.' Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the UN, said the dispute had been resolved to the 'mutual satisfaction' of the UN weapons inspection commission and the Iraqi government. In London, the Foreign Office said Iraq had seen sense in the face of international resolve. Its 'blatant attempts' to flout the UN ceasefire resolutions had failed. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic challenger to Mr Bush in the November presidential election, said the US and its allies should continue to press Baghdad to comply fully with the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire. The agreement yesterday was a 'good first step,' he said. In his scathing remarks about the Baghdad regime, Mr Bush said the Iraqi leader had lied about the extent of Iraq's weapons programmes. Its agreement to give UN weapons inspectors access did not change that. Asked about a proposed ultimatum threatening force against Iraq, Mr Bush replied: 'I don't know that anything more is required at this minute.' But 'the real test' of Mr Saddam's behaviour would come in Iraq's response to future inspections, he said. 'Behaviour along the lines we have just witnessed will not be tolerated.' Over the past week the US, France and Britain have made increasingly overt threats of military action against Iraq after the UN inspectors were barred. The inspectors were forced to camp for 18 days outside the ministry building, which they believed housed information on Iraq's missile programme. Mr Ekeus acknowledged a probability that during the stand-off the ministry building had been 'effectively cleaned out'. But there might still be material significant for UN inspectors, including some relating to missiles and nuclear weapons. Asked if Iraq's intransigence had thwarted UN efforts to eliminate its heavy arms capability, he said: 'I think we have successfully identified existing weapons and destroyed them.' Even more important, he said, was that the Iraqi production capability had been destroyed, and there was no possibility of a major new effort to reconstruct the missile programme. He said that UN operations since the ceasefire meant Iraq was no longer a 'threat through intimidation and terror'. But it still had a formidable air force and a strong land force. US officials warned earlier yesterday that the resolution of the inspection crisis was only one element in a pattern of confrontation by Iraq. Mr Richard Cheney, the US defence secretary, said that as well as giving unrestricted access to UN inspectors, Iraq must: Agree to the destruction of anything that supports a programme of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. Agree not to use military force to suppress Shia Moslems in the south. Participate in the UN-sponsored commission to resolve the boundary dispute with Kuwait. Allow UN refugee and humanitarian officials to continue to have unimpeded access to Iraq.

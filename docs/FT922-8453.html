			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of West Norfolk (1): Drive to attract new investment  -Plans for improved road and rail links are adding to the region's attractions FOR LONG a quiet town, somewhat off the present century's beaten tracks, King's Lynn was not always so. The capital of western Norfolk, between Norwich 40 miles away and the Fens, King's Lynn was in medieval times one of England's premier towns, gaining the first of many charters as far back as 1204. It owes its early growth from the 11th century onwards, to its position on the eastern bank of the Great Ouse estuary, and to the strength of the East Anglian economy in those times. The town grew prosperous as a centre for exporting the products of the local wool trade and for importing the fashionable goods and necessities of the day from other important centres across the North Sea, in particular the cities of the Hansaeatic League. It was after visiting Lynn in 1215 to feast with the burghers that King John, in one of the best-remembered episodes in English history, lost his jewels in the Wash, the bight into which the Great Ouse pours its waters. The legacy of King's Lynn's long period as a great port remains in one of the finest collections of medieval domestic buildings in England, in its two market squares, in King Street and Queen Street, and in the lanes which lead back from them to the town's old wharves. It boasts two guildhalls, including the oldest in England, the Guildhall of St George, dating back to the early 15th century, and the Guildhall of the Holy Trinity from 1421. St. Margaret's church is even older, with parts going back to the 12th century. As late as the 18th century, King's Lynn remained a fashionable town, not quite in the same league as Bath or Cheltenham, but still a desirable resort in which to spend part of the year. The most recent boost to the fortunes of the area came in the l960s when an overspill agreement was signed with London. This has meant a virtual doubling of the population of King's Lynn to what it is today, just over 40,000. West Norfolk as a whole, which also includes the market town of Downham Market, as well as the royal estate at Sandringham, and the seaside resort of Hunstanton, is home to around 135,000 people. A number of companies, particularly in food-processing and agriculture-related engineering, have been attracted to the area - partly through government grants - to supply jobs for the enlarged population. The region also remains one of the most prominent vegetable growing areas in the country, although fewer and fewer people are employed in this sector because of mechanisation. Though there have been some job losses in the present recession, including the closure of Anglia Canners at a cost of 200 redundancies, most of the companies which arrived in l960s and l970s, such as Campbells Soups and Sun Electric, have remained and many of them have expanded. Unemployment for the area at just under nine per cent is high for East Anglia, but it is not out of line with the Midlands or the national average. The port's potential is limited because of the heavy tidal drop and the distance from the open sea. But Associated British Ports, the owner, recently made a Pounds 3m investment in a new dock - as a result, the port can now accommodate vessels carrying 5,000 tonnes of cargo as opposed to 3,000 tonnes. The local authority's aim now is to attract high technology or service employment to capitalise on the area's advantages as a location - 'the national economy has been changing. There are fewer blue collar or industrial jobs, and more and more jobs in new white collar service industries and high technology concerns. 'Frankly, we have not been getting our share of these new industries,' comments Mr Richard High, the council's chief economic development officer. The drive to attract new investment is timed to take advantage of British Rail's decision to electrify the railway line from London to King's Lynn. This will cut the journey time from well over two hours to 100 minutes. The new service is due to start next month. To secure it, the King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council have had to promise a revenue guarantee to British Rail of Pounds 650,000 over the next five years. The council has also secured agreement from the Ministry of Transport that the three routes which pass through West Norfolk, the A10 from King's Lynn to London, the A17 from King's Lynn to Newark, and the A47 from Peterborough to Great Yarmouth will all be dualled or upgraded in the next few years. The rail link is seen as particularly important, as Mr Alan Pask, the chief executive of the West Norkfolk District Council points out. 'The faster rail service is the key to attracting new investment. From next month, King's Lynn will be up on the board at King's Cross in London as a destination. We will be locked into Europe, and the idea that we are remote and inaccessible will be gone.' The shorter journey time is not expected to result in large numbers wanting to commute to London (although Mr Pask points out that by rail King's Lynn will be closer in journey time to London than Norwich and people do commute from Norwich). It will, however, become viable to relocate back office or administrative functions in West Norfolk while maintaining a small headquarters in London. Executives will easily be able to travel between the two bases. It is companies willing to do this that West Norfolk, with the help of agents in London, is targeting. 'We are targetting companies in the services or high technology sectors that would employ up to 500 people. We could take a company wanting to employ 1,000 but not too many of them,' says Mr High. Apart from better communications, the area has other attractions. The 9 per cent unemployment rate represents 4,500 mostly skilled male workers. There is a very low female activity rate. There could be a further 4,000 women looking for jobs if a bank or insurance company decided to established itself. Property and land are also modestly priced. Residential housing can be half the cost of something similar in the south east. Industrial land costs Pounds 100,000 an acre - cheap, even compared to Peterborough. Office rents or rents for B1 office/light industrial properties can be as low as Pounds 5 to Pounds 6 a sq ft which compares with Pounds 15 in Cambridge. One problem is that there is hardly any modern B1 property on the market as low returns have meant there has been little speculative property development. There is plenty of land scheduled but very little new B1 type premises - the kind that high technology companies like to move into - has been developed. Local authority officials are, however, convinced that this problem will not be difficult to overcome. Initially, too, companies which want to design and build their own properties will be targeted.</p>

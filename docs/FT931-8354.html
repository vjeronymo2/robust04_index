			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Chelsea Building Society tumbles 49% THE IMPACT of the slump in the south of England housing market on southern-based building societies was shown yesterday when Chelsea Building Society disclosed a 49 per cent fall to Pounds 4.1m in pre-tax profits for 1992. The society's results are expected to be among the worst reported for last year, although large falls are also expected to be disclosed by the Bristol &amp; West and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester societies over the next month. Chelsea's fall in profits, from Pounds 8.1m in 1991, was caused by a 60 per cent increase to Pounds 37m (Pounds 23.1m) in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Its gross provisions are now set at 2.9 per cent of gross commercial assets. Operating profits rose 29 per cent to Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 31.2m), partly because of the widening of margins between savings and lending products in the last quarter of the year. The ratio of costs to income fell to 38.7 per cent (44.2 per cent). Chelsea - the 17th biggest society with assets of Pounds 2.29bn - emphasised that efforts to reduce arrears had led to a 20 per cent cut in borrowers over six months in arrears. It predicted that provisions would be 'substantially reduced' in 1993. Mr Peter Walsh, director and general manager, said Chelsea's provisioning policy had been 'very prudent'.</p>

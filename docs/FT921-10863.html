			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Israeli hawk quits Knessetas dove MR Ezer Weizman, one of Israel's most colourful politicians, who helped negotiate the 1979 Camp David peace accords with Egypt, announced yesterday that he would retire from parliament at the general election in June. Mr Weizman is a rare example of a once passionate 'hawk' who over the years has turned into an equally passionate 'dove', accepting that Israel must concede a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip if it is to achieve peace with the Arabs. Lately an MP for the opposition Labour party, Mr Weizman, aged 67, was once a defence minister for the ruling Likud party. Now he warns that Likud's hardline positions under Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, will undermine the current Middle East peace talks and lead instead to war. Mr Weizman is a nephew of Chaim Weizman, Israel's first president. As commander of the Israeli Air Force, he devised and ordered the devastating pre-emptive air strikes on Egypt that largely won Israel the 1967 Six Day War. At that time he was a full-blooded believer in Israel's claim to rule the West Bank and Gaza. But his Camp David experience, and the deep respect it engendered in him for Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and his colleagues, set him on a different political path. He left the Likud in 1980, joining Labour six years later after a failed attempt to build a mainstream party of his own. His articulate, no-nonsense style - in private often riotously foul-mouthed - endeared him to many. He summed up his 1984 switch: 'We of the military raised an entire generation to be fighters. The generations to come will have to educate the people of Israel. . .to believe in the necessity of peace agreements between us and the Arabs. That's a lot harder than doing battle.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondents Nestor D. Escobar Franco and </F> Eduardo Franco]    [Text] During his address on 14 June to the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy demanded a  more tolerant attitude toward Paraguay's position regarding its  outlet to the sea. He appealed to Argentina and Uruguay for a  smoother policy for Paraguayan access to the sea. He questioned  the freight surcharges that make national products more  expensive, and asked the Ibero-American community for forthright  solidarity in facing unemployment and deprivation. He also  called for "a more socially just, more economically free, and  more politically democratic Ibero-America." Venezuelan  President Rafael Caldera asked his colleagues to formulate more  than a rhetorical condemnation of corruption and asked for  exemplary punishment of those corrupt people who stuff their  pockets with public money.    Wasmosy maintained that it is of vital importance that  Paraguay's products have an easy outlet to the sea. He pointed  out that despite Paraguay's efforts to reach the sea "we run  into difficulties in Argentina and Uruguay." In this respect he  noted that such difficulties concern freight surcharges that  make national products more expensive.    Wasmosy insisted that the efforts being made by his  government to improve the economic and social situation are  being hampered by Paraguay's landlocked situation. "When using  our outlets to the sea, whether by river or by land, we run into  such difficulties as freight surcharges that make our products  more expensive, and the same happens with the products that we  import," he said.    He added: "In this respect we appeal to the solidarity of  the countries through which we must transit, and ask them to  offer an easier policy. Often the maritime countries do not  understand what it is to be a landlocked country, and what this  implies."    In another passage of his address, Wasmosy called for  gradual  integration "to unite a socially more just Ibero-America. [no  closing quotation marks as published] He said that "under the  banner of democracy the postponed needs of the people become  very genuine demands that our mandates cannot ignore."    He highlighted the fact that most of the American countries  have democratic systems that must be strengthened. "We must  debate the social problems during this summit, as it is a topic  that concerns all of us who are participating in this forum, and  we want to seek solutions so that our people can enjoy better  welfare and better living conditions."    Wasmosy stated that there are many needs that must be  satisfied, such as health conditions, education, employment,  housing, equal opportunities, and the pressing need for social  justice.    He indicated that in these new times significant problems  have also emerged due to the increase in crime and drug  trafficking, which result from economic and social difficulties  and from the existing imbalances within societies. "In order to  resolve these social and economic problems, within the framework  of democracy, we must seek improved distribution of wealth while  increasing resources on the basis of greater production and  better quality for all agricultural and industrial products."    The president asked "that a frontal attack be made on  deprivation and misery with an accelerated increase in economic  and social development, within the framework of inter-American  solidarity, in order to overcome the deficiencies that show up  on our social gauges."    Wasmosy also indicated that through a social market economy,  but always respecting individual freedom and through common  efforts, an improvement in the conditions of life can be  achieved. "In order to achieve this we must achieve a constant  and firm economic integration, a goal that will be achieved  gradually in several stages, including free trade zones."    He maintained that the reform of the state demands much more  economic support. "We need greater financial resources, the  incorporation of new technologies and, I would even dare to say,  greater international solidarity," he stressed.    He emphasized that he will continue with the reform of the  state. Wasmosy indicated that in seeking to change the structure  of the state he has sent several bills to Congress with the  objective of modifying the financial system, the business  system, and others.</p>

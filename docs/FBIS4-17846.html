			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and U.S.  Defense secretary William Perry approved of the idea of holding  a meeting between the leaders of Russia, the U.S., NATO and  other parties concerned with the settlement of the crisis in  Bosnia during their telephone conversation today. The  conversation was initiated by the U.S.    An aide of the Russian Defense Minister, Yelena Agapova,  told  Interfax that Grachev had confirmed his position on NATO air  attacks against the Serb positions in Gorazde considering them  unreasonable. Grachev stressed that the civilian population  would suffer the most during such actions.    Grachev put forward several proposals concerning a  settlement  in Bosnia. In particular, he considered it necessary to refrain  from any more air attacks since this could make the conflict  uncontrollable and lead to a deterioration in the situation.    Grachev proposed to strengthen the UN peacekeeping  contingency in Gorazde and to take measures in order to prevent  arms deliveries to the conflicting parties. He emphasized that  the population must be regularly provided with humanitarian aid.</p>

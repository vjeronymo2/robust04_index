			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Letter: Children's charity fears about World Bank priority for poorest (2) Sir, Your leader on the World Bank's World Development Report ('Development and the environment', May 18) is generally perceptive and well taken. There is however one jarring note. Speaking of environment problems you say: 'Fortunately, their solution does not require a global compact; it requires, first more development ..' The implication is that 'more development' does not require a global compact. I think on reflection you will agree this would be thoroughly wrong. Even if one accepts that 'more development' is to a large extent the responsibility of the developing countries, the history of the past two decades shows only too clearly that the lack of a global compact and of effective global economic management has had a great deal to do with the setbacks to development which many developing countries have experienced. 'More development' in an unfavourable international environment is a near-impossible task. I very much doubt that the World Bank's report would support this implication of your article.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F> domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in  Manila -- live; passages in brackets in Tagalog]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ramos] I also have a  statement in regard to the Korean peninsula nuclear issue. You  will recall, ladies and gentlemen, that I made a statement on  this just four days ago. But of course there are now new  developments.    This is in regard to the still unconfirmed reports -- these  are still unconfirmed -- that Pyongyang intends to withdraw from  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. And if that step  has not yet been officially taken by North Korea, we urge North  Korea to remain in the IAEA so that an early and peaceful  resolution through patient negotiation and creative diplomacy  can be found to resolve this issue.    Our concern here stems from the possibility of nuclear  proliferation, because such proliferation is a destabilizing  factor for global and regional security, and in turn will derail  and disturb and possibly [word indistinct] normal economic  growth and sustained development in our part of the world, if  not in the entire globe itself. And as a developing country,  certainly, we want to move our economic, social, and political  development forward without disturbances of this nature.    I also have a statement in regard to the reported testing by  China four days ago, or 10 June, where a nuclear test was  reportedly undertaken at its testing site at Lop Nur. And as  you all know, as a signatory of the United Nations treaty on  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, the Philippines is strongly  against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and this includes  observance of a testing moratorium. So that in the end we hope  that all of these tests will stop through a -- or be made to  cease -- through a comprehensive test-ban treaty. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent Manny Mogato] With Pyongyang ominously  sounding the war drums and with Seoul (?gearing) to dance to the  same music, in case of actual conflict between the two Koreas,  the United States -- being committed to the defense of South  Korea -- will certainly be drawn into the war. Mr. President,  will the Philippines be also drawn into the same conflict by  virtue of our mutual defense treaty with the United States?    [Ramos] No, that's very, very farfetched. You will recall  that the Philippines joined in the so-called police action on  the Korean peninsula -- which was occasioned by the invasion by  North Korea of South Korea across the 38th parallel -- because  of a UN Security Council resolution, not a defense treaty with  any country. But before we could send our troops there, a law  had to be passed, and this was Republic Act 573, the so-called  Peptok Law, passed by Congress in September 1950. So, it's not  automatic that the Philippines rushes into the fray. After all,  we are not the policeman of the world. But we have expressed  our concern.    In my statement four days ago I cited five major reasons:    -- Because of our nonnuclear provisions in the  Constitution, in the basic law;    -- Our membership in the IAEA board of governors, that is,  Ambassador Rey Arcilla, who is based in Austria;    -- Our proximity to the Korean peninsula. We are close  enough, we are much closer than the United States;    -- The some 13 -- to maybe more -- thousand Filipinos in  South Korea; and;    -- I mentioned it a while ago, the possible crippling and  paralysis of economic activity in our part of the world.    In which, again, [developing countries will become such a  pity. The developed countries might benefit because of the war.]  What about us? Those are my concerns.    So, we have called for patient negotiation, consultation,  and  creative diplomacy so that perhaps we can find the acceptable  solutions before sanctions are applied.    [Mogato] Follow-up, Mr. President. As member of the ASEAN,  what do you think will be the role of the ASEAN in diffusing the  threats of war in the Korean peninsula?    [Ramos] Well, certainly the ASEAN-member countries can take  positions as we have done on a national basis. We are of course  always in consultation within ASEAN with our sister countries.  But as far as I know, ASEAN as a bloc has not yet come up with  a position. Although in the recent senior officers' meeting of  the ASEAN Regional Forum which deals with security and defense  matters, there was already at that level -- this is a lower  level -- expressed the concerns of the ASEAN countries about the  proliferation of nuclear weapons.    Of course, I think you are aware of the initiatives of  Russia  to convoke an international conference that will involve now the  principal negotiators with the two Koreas. I hope that  something will come out of this, because this is really in the  realm of creative diplomacy and patient negotiation. [passage  omitted]</p>

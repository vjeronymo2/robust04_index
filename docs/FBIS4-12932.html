			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Yasir 'Arafat, head of the Palestinian Government </F> and PLO chairman, in Strasbourg on 13 April -- read by announcer]    [Text] Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, members of the  European parliament, sincere greetings. On this occasion, I  would like to express my happiness at meeting you and at the  opportunity you have given me to speak before you and address  you.    From this platform, please allow me to convey to you  greetings from our Palestinian people; on its behalf and on  behalf of brother- members of the PLO Executive Committee, and  on behalf of the Palestinian national authority, I would like to  express my extreme thanks and gratitude for the continuous  support and backing from your respected council for the just  struggle of our people to achieve a just and comprehensive peace  in our region and in Palestine, the land of peace, amity and  tolerance.    Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, we are meeting you today,  13 April, when our first entitlement under the declaration of  principles agreement should have been fulfilled with the  withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho as  laid down in this agreement, which received your support, the  support of the whole international community, and all those who  love freedom, justice, and peace in the world.    Eight months have passed since the signing of the agreement  in the U.S. White House, and the Declaration of Principles  agreement signed between us and the Israeli Government was  supposed to be carried out and the Israeli withdrawal completed.  I was supposed to come to you here from Jericho, and I believe  that this was present in your minds when you sent us the  invitation to address your venerable council. But the hopes we  have all built since the signing of the agreement in Washington  on 13 September 1993 have not materialized along what had been  agreed upon as a result of Israeli procrastination and slowness  when it comes to commitment and implementation. More still, in  the course of this delay, our people were subjected to two  large-scale massacres in al-Khalil and Gaza, which led to more  than 90 martyrs and about 800 injured. All this was at the  expense of peace.    I am saying to you truthfully and frankly: Were it not for  our eagerness for and adherence to peace, to our pledges to our  people and to the international community, the last massacres  were enough to abort the peace process as a whole. Because the  delay in carrying out what we agreed upon in the U.S. White  House on 13 September 1993 has permitted all the extremist  forces to engage in this frenzied and grave escalation. Just  like what happened in 'Afula recently, perpetrated by  Palestinian extremists, these acts regrettably were aimed at  hitting Palestinian and Israeli innocent people as well as  dealing a blow to the peace process.    Since the beginning of the peace process in Madrid in  October  1991, we, on our side, have made all efforts that could  facilitate and push forward the process. We have showed the  required flexibility, the patience, and the commitment to the  peace process out of our belief in and desire for a just peace  that would put an end to long decades of bloody wars and  conflicts in our region and provide all its peoples and states  with security, stability, and peace.    Faced with the new dealing, with the peace content and its  ensuing outcome, and to consolidate trust-building measures and  cooperation, we have, since the signature of the Declaration of  Principles agreements, set up a number of national bodies that  would be able to play their role in building a free, civil, and  democratic Palestinian society and establish foundations of  peace and genuine cooperation among the peoples of the region.    Mr. President, please allow me to state here that we were  expecting, and we were hoping, that the Israeli Government,  which came to power on the strength of its declared elections  program that was based on the establishment of peace, to take  the necessary and the apprriate steps to rebuild the trust  between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. We were expecting  the Israeli Government to turn the page of the armed occupation  by putting an end to everything that represented a humiliation  to human achievements, international charters, treaties, and UN  resolutions.    Mr. President, we were also hoping that the Israeli  Government would have worked for the realization of peace,  rather than just take measures that guarantee living in peace,  because nobody can live in peace as long as peace has not been  achieved in all sectors and at all levels.    However, the experience of the past eight months since the  signing of the Declaration of The principles agreements in  Washington was disappointing and discouraging. This is because  the Israeli Government has continued its policy of mass killing;  arrests; imposition of curfews; the siege on towns, especially  the town of Jerusalem; the confiscation of land; the  continuation of the economic embargo; and the support for and  encouragement of settlers to continue committing the most  horrible operations of killing and aggression against the lives,  liberties, and property of the Palestinian people.    These actions made possible the perpetration of the vile  massacre of Hebron in its holiest place, the most valued and  secure of its temples, and the purest of its victims by armed  Israeli settlers with the involvement of some units of the  Israeli Army. That was similar to what was faced by our brothers  in Algeria from the secret organization in the French Army in  cooperation with French settlers.    Bloody incidents followed persistently, during which the  Israeli Government punished the innocent sons of the Palestinian  people by killing and detaining them, by curfew, and economic  and trade siege. Furthermore, there were regrettable and  rejected reactions by some Palestinian extremists against  Israeli civilians, as was the case in Afula.    Mr. President, what took place in Hebron and before that in  al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Gaza, Nablus, and other  places was the result of the deliberate negligence and  disgraceful collusion by some Israeli Army units with the  extremist and racist settlers whose expatriation from their  original country was facilitated by the Israeli Government,  which also contributed toward training, arming, financing, and  encouraging them to settle in Palestinian territory and in the  center of Palestinian towns, until they became another army of  occupation and armed groups that are not subject to any law or  convention and protected by the guns of the occupation soldiers.  These were demonstrated clearly by the results of the  investigation carried out by the Israeli judicial authorities.    Mr. President, filled with feelings of responsibility,  sorrow, and sadness, I warn that letting matters proceed as they  have been since last September will lead us all to a disaster  that will end whatever hope, trust, and credibility that is left  among our Palestinian people, the Arab nation, and peace-loving  people in the peace process itself, and in the ability, honesty,  and seriousness of the international community in helping to  achieve and implement it.    Mr. President, ladies, and gentlemen! On the basis of their  understanding of the persistent pain and suffering of our  people, the European countries have played a leading, effective,  and prominent role in the international efforts to pass UN  Security Council Resolution 904 in order to secure international  protection for our people, continue the efforts to revitalize  the peace process, and call for the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles that was signed between the government  of Israel and the PLO on 13 September 1993 at the White House in  Washington.    On the basis of this and after the passing of the  resolution,  we turn to you and to the international community as a whole to  do your utmost to bring about the implementation of the clauses  of the resolution expeditiously, particularly with regards to  securing and deployment of international protection for our  Palestinian people in Hebron and throughout occupied Palestinian  territories, the implementation of what was agreed in Cairo two  weeks ago, and ensuring the success of this experiment by  applying it in all the towns and villages of Palestine in order  to ensure a solid start to the final stage and to prevent  further killings during the transitional period. The  translation of the clauses of the UN Security Council Resolution  904 into reality and swift progress in the implementation of the  agreements signed with the Israeli Government will bring peace  of mind to our people and strengthen their trust and feeling of  security, which will make them continue to support the peace  process in order to achieve the sought after just peace.    Mr. President, previously, and on many occasions at  international and regional gatherings, and during successive  visits I have paid to many European capitals we have talked and  exchanged views about the urgent and necessary requirements to  commence the building of the Palestinian national economy and  the Palestinian national authority institutions, particularly  since we will be starting from nothing in the process of  building and construction of the infrastructure and vital  installations. The enormity of the destruction and the problems  experienced by our people as a result of long years of Israeli  occupation makes it necessary to begin the building process  expeditiously and puts great responsibilities on and challenges  to the Palestinian national authority in making up for the  destruction inflicted on the Palestinian economy and our  people's social structure by that long and bitter occupation.    In order for the Palestinian national authority to be able  to  deal with these challenges successfully, it has to be given the  opportunity to assume responsibility for receiving international  aid and support, and to direct, invest, and exploit them in a  way that will ensure changing the painful reality of our people,  raising their living standard, and solving many accumulating  economic, social, health, educational, and institutional  problems.    What we aspire for and desire is to see this international  support materialize in a collective and bilateral cooperation,  which stems from relations existing between us. The development  and backing for these relations will strongly enhance our  ability of movement and activity to confront various problems  that might hamper the operation of reconstruction and building  in the way that we aspire and wish for.    It is no secret for you to realize that our people boasts  human capabilities that have positively contributed toward the  building of some of the best aspects of modern architecture in  the Middle East. Our people will also continue their innovation  and use of their capabilities through the edification of our  civil and democratic society and our free economic and complete  social institutions, which will form the basis for peace, future  co-existence, and cooperation in the region.    Our people are able to undertake reconstruction and  rebuilding on the best technical and legal conditions, openness,  seriousness, and competence in the shadow of a parliamentary and  democratic system based on freedom of expression, freedom to  form parties, protection of minority rights, and the minority's  respect for the majority's decisions. It is a system based on  social justice; equality; non-discrimination regardless of sex,  race, religion, or color; and on the foundation of a full pledge  to Palestine's spiritual and civil heritage based on tolerance  and co-existence between religions throughout the centuries.    We are talking to you in full frankness about our concerns,  and as our exceptional relations have accustomed us, this will  make you help us build the future and avert failure, which will  have a negative impact on the whole peace process. This help  will be through the provision of all methods of the required  support.    Also, I am addressing you to ask you to make an urgent  decision to provide appropriate financial help in the form of  either a gift or loan, which should be put at the disposal of  the Palestinian national authority to deal with the urgent needs  of Palestinian life and to help meet the costs of establishing  Palestinian authority, institutions, and commitments.    Europe has a fundamental role in achieving peace and  consolidating its foundations in the region. It also has a role  in supporting development in its widest meaning, either through  governmental backing or through boosting of the private sector,  on which we attach a great importance in all our projects and  plans out of our faith and conviction in the role of the private  sector and its capability to create jobs, transfer technology,  stimulate the economy, and foster bilateral cooperation.    Mr. President, ladies and gentlmen. As you can see, we now  live in a time when distances have been condensed thanks to a  considerable technological and scientific revolution that is  being witnessed by the last quarter of this century. This  revolution is ushering us into the future and into all its  challenges. Despite all the injustices, oppression, and  sufferings that have befallen our people, it possesses enough  capabilities, resources, and innovative abilities to enable it  to face up to the challenges of the coming phase, in full  self-confidence and using full participation, not only in  building and developing society, but also in contributing  towards the construction, progress, and the prosperity of the  Middle East region and human civilization. This will strengthen  and consolidate the foundations of security and peace in this  important and sensitive region of the world.    It is everybody's duty to contribute to the making of this  future that will guarantee for our generations security,  stability, and a future. We aspire for your support and help to  turn the page of the past with all its pains and tragedies, and  open a new page of peaceful coexistence, understanding,  cooperation, solving disagreements peacefully with dialogue and  arbitration.    Mr. President, once again I am addressing you from this  rostrum, you who represent Europe, to help us save the peace  process and save our hopes. I am addressing you to help us  preserve the peace process and to implement what we have agreed  and (?signed) together with the Israeli Government in the form  of the declaration of principles in Washington, and the annexes  we have agreed upon in Oslo, Davos, Paris, and Cairo. These  agreements have not been implemented so far, despite the passing  of the defined and agreed schedules to implement them, which is  a serious and fundamental matter not only for the Middle East,  but for the whole world.    The peace of the brave is in need of your support and  backing  because we are currently going through a dangerous turning point  where the process seems to be at a standstill, which is  weakening the speedy implementation of it. Yes, we need your  support, efforts, and endeavors to implement what we have agreed  on paper and turn it into tangible facts on the ground, so that  we do not give the opportunity to the extremists, whatever their  identity, to destroy it or hamper its progress for the sake of  our and their children, for the sake of a Middle East where  peoples and nations live in brotherly and constructive peaceful  coexistence away from the pains and effects of the past, for the  sake of a new Middle East based on love, good, and rising hope,  for the sake of a true peace in the land of peace, the sacred  land of Palestine, the land of the three heavenly messages. No  voice should rise higher than that of peace, no interest should  overcome that of the peace, no effort should be spared to  achieve peace.    We are all now shouldering a momentous historic  responsibility. I pray to God Almighty to guide and help us, to  give us wisdom and patience to shoulder this responsibility, and  firmly establish peace, the peace of the brave. Once again, I  would like to express my gratitude and thanks for giving me this  nice opportunity to address you. Thank you.</p>

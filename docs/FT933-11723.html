			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Privatisation can improve forest management Sir, James Buxton's article on forest privatisation ('When money grows on trees', July 20) concludes that privatisation may be no more successful than the Forestry Commission at 'balancing commercial needs with environmental and leisure interests'. Although it is wrong to imply that environmental and leisure interests cannot be commercial, there are certainly conflicting interests to balance. However, both reason and experience suggest strongly that privatisation would indeed be more successful. Briefly, public sector management is a zero sum game in which opposing political 'constituents' and lobbyists are appeased or otherwise. Private sector management replaces conflict by co-operation and cost sharing. The largest private landowner in the US, the International Paper Company, not only practices commercial lumbering but also runs profitable wild life and recreation programmes in many states, leasing more than 1m acres in the southern states for such purposes.

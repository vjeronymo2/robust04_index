			<p>BFN     [Text] Zheng Zengmao, provincial party committee standing  committee member and higher people's court president, delivered  a speech at a provincial court work conference that wound up  yesterday.    Zheng Zengmao emphatically stated in his speech: The  people's courts at all levels across the province should  strengthen their determination to tackle difficult cases,  strictly enforce the law, and resolutely implement court  decisions so as to safeguard social order and maintain political  stability.    Zheng Zengmao noted: Over the past year, by negotiating all  sorts of difficulties, courts at all levels across the province  have placed on file for investigation and prosecution a total of  more than 52,000 cases involving more than 529 million yuan.  Moreover, courts at all levels across the province have also  assisted courts of other provinces and regions in handling more  than 2,600 cases and directly handled a total of 685 cases on  behalf of those courts, thus pushing ahead with Henan's economic  growth and safeguarding Henan's image.    Zheng Zengmao pointed out: There are still more than 15,000  court decisions awaiting implementation across the province at  the moment. The slow pace of implementing court decisions has  hindered courts at all levels across the province from serving  economic construction and safeguarding social stability. In  view of this situation, courts at all levels across the province  should actively take measures to improve and strengthen court  work and resolutely implement court decisions regarding anyone  irrespective of his position, rank, or personal influence.</p>

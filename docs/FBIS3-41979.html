Military papers found in the possession of a  dead Iraqi officer authorised the use of chemical weapons "as a  last resort."    Pressure for the United Nations to investigate alleged gas  attacks in the marshes of southern Iraq grew yesterday as Dr  Hussein Sharistani, once Iraq's leading nuclear scientist,  arrived in Britain with details of a month-long inquiry into  allegations that Saddam Hussein had again used chemical weapons  against his own people.    The allegations of the attack on the Hammar marshes coincide  with reports that President Saddam has begun draining the most  populous part of the marshlands, the north-eastern region. The  memory of massacres is so vivid there that the Iraqi opposition  has for the first time instructed local people not to offer  resistance.    Since the attack on the Hammar marshes at the end of  September, Gulf War Victims, an independent research group  founded by Dr Sharistani and his Canadian wife, Bernice, has  interviewed "practically every man who witnessed the battle."    This evidence, and other information collected from the  marsh  region, will be presented to the Foreign Office this week in the  hope that Britain will press for a full investigation.    Although Gulf War Victims has been unable to confirm the  exact nature of the gas used, it has pieced together a detailed  picture of the attack and the events that followed it. Dr  Sharistani, held in solitary confinement for 10 years before  being released from jail in 1991, is confident that UN  investigators can be led to the spot where hundreds of people  were reported to have died from shells that killed without  wounding.    "Everyone we have spoken to agreed these projectiles were  unlike any others they had seen," Dr Sharistani said yesterday.  "They were liquid and made little noise when they exploded. The  smell was different from other shells; there wasn't the usual  burning smell."    Witnesses said the attack on the Hor Alawi area on the  eastern edge of the Hammar marshes began early on September 26,  when dozens of armoured vehicles advanced with artillery. The  attack was beaten off by resistance fighters, who had occupied  Hor Alawi after the drainage of the Amara marshes flooded the  area north of the Euphrates.    "The resistance captured six armoured vehicles," Dr  Sharistani said. "In one of them they discovered a briefcase  with a notebook containing the minutes of a meeting. The third  point in these minutes said that if they could not dislodge the  rebels from the area, they should use chemical weapons as a last  resort."    Survivors said shells fired by the Iraqis emitted a thick,  white, ball-shaped gas cloud that hung a few yards above the  ground for about an hour, causing breathing difficulties.    Some said there was a smell of rotten apples -- a smell  Iraqis associate with chemical weapons used during the war with  Iran. All said the Iraqi soldiers carried gas masks and filters  attached to chest straps.    The resistance abandoned Hor Alawi at nightfall after  running  out of ammunition. As they retreated, Dr Sharistani said, they  fired shells captured during the battle. Two or three days  later, informers in the marshes said hundreds of Iraqi troops  had been killed. The bodies had no visible wounds, but were  blistered and discoloured.    The informers said army casualties had filled military  hospitals in Basra, Qurna and Medainah. Local people reported  numerous mourning ceremonies in the days after the attack, and  said Iraqi troops took the unusual step of burning the bodies of  dead civilians.    Iraqi diplomats in New York have denied the use of chemical  weapons. UN officials are seeking access to the marshes to  ascertain whether chemicals or a combination of other lethal  agents were used.    COPYRIGHT: Guardian Newspapers Limited, November 8, 1993</p>

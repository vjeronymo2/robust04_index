			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese couples who  cohabit before the legal "marriageable age" will be separated  and the marriage will not be protected by law, under a new  marriage registration regulation.    The text of the new government regulation was promulgated on  February 1.    The new regulation is expected to curb "early marriages and  births," and is conducive to the nation's goal of controlling  its already large population, said Yang Jianchang, spokesman for  the Ministry of Civil Affairs, at a press conference here today.    China's marriage law stipulates that men are not allowed to  marry until 22, and women until 20.    Every year there are two million illegal marriages out of a  total ten million marriages, the spokesman said. The illegal  ones include 1.6 million so-called "early marriages."    According to the new regulation, China is continuing to  combat arranged and mercenary marriages, marriages between close  relatives and bigamous marriages. All these are still  widespread in some parts of China.    The spokesman said that the new regulation will be "a  forceful legal means" for the civil affairs bodies to administer  the marriage registration process.    The new rules stated that legally marriageable couples who  simply do not go to the government marriage registration agency  will be criticised and have to register within a certain period  of time.    Marriages based on certificates obtained through fraud and  deception will be declared null and void, the certificates will  be withdrawn and the couples fined up to 200 yuan (about 23 U.S.  dollars), according to the text.    The regulation gives couples getting married the right to  bring charges against any officials or organisations trying to  impose illegal fees or engaged in other corruptive practices in  marriage registration.    The regulation also specifies the rights and duties of  people  wanting to divorce. The spokesman said that divorces have been  increasing annually. The latest statistics show that 310,000  couples divorced in 1992, compare with 190,000 couples in 1979.    Existing regulations for marriages of Chinese people to  foreigners, or to Overseas Chinese people, or to residents of  Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan, are not replaced by the new decree.</p>

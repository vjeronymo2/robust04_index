			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHER RATES PAID ON SOME OUT-OF-STATE BANK ACCOUNTS  </P> <P> California consumers earn less interest on certain kinds of bank accounts than  consumers nationally, Federal Reserve economists confirmed Tuesday.  </P> <P> After a monthlong review of interest rates and other factors, the federal bank  economists said they found that the lower deposit rates are mainly limited to  accounts with costly transaction charges, such as money market deposit  accounts.  </P> <P> The lower rates paid on some accounts do not necessarily prove or disprove a  lack of competition, the economists said in a report issued by the Federal  Reserve Bank of San Francisco in a weekly newsletter.  </P> <P> But they said the lower rates may stem from the high cost of providing special  services and maintaining an extensive branch banking system, rather than a lack  of competition.  </P> <P> After adjusting for loan losses, they also found that California banks' profits  paralleled the average profits of banks across the country during the past five  years.  </P> <P> "Overhead expenses are substantially higher in California than in other  populous states and in the U.S. as a whole," the economists said. "This could  suggest that California banks, operating in a less competitive market, are not  forced to operate as efficiently as are banks elsewhere."  </P> <P> Last fall, several consumer groups, led by Consumers Union, demanded that Gov.  George Deukmejian and the state attorney general investigate an apparent lack  of competition among California banks. The groups also wanted to know why  interest rates paid by California banks on some deposits are lower than in  other states.  </P> <P> There are more than 5,000 bank branches in California and the state's five  largest banks operate about half of them, the report said. In contrast, banks  in New York and Illinois operate far fewer branches and offer limited retail  customer services, according to the report.  </P> <P> "It's very disappointing to say Californians have to pay more (for loans) and  earn less money because California banks have such a high overhead," said Harry  Snyder, West Coast regional director of Consumers Union in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Snyder said his organization's demand for an inquiry stemmed from a weekly  review of interest rates paid by banks across the country.  </P> <P> "I found that California banks on average are charging more than 4.5% more for  consumer loans and paying a point and a half less on deposits," Snyder said.  </P> <P> Snyder said he was disappointed at the Federal Reserve Bank economists'  conclusions.  </P> <P> "We are hoping that John Van de Kamp, state attorney general, will take a  harder, more critical look at this," Snyder said.  </P> <P> Jonathan Neuberger, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank, said the first  part of the study dealt with interest rates paid on deposits. Next, the  economists plan to study the rates charged for bank loans. He cautioned that  the report only presents preliminary conclusions.  </P></p>

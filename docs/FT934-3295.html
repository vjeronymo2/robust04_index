			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Alchem helps Utd Drug achieve 11% increase United Drug, the Irish pharmaceutical distributor, reported an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 3.44m (Pounds 3.3m) on turnover up 79 per cent to IPounds 136m for the year ending September 30. The result included a first-time contribution from Alchem, Northern Ireland's largest pharmaceutical distributor, which was bought for IPounds 5.16m a year ago in a 13-for-8 share swap offer, which brokers anticipated would result in a combined turnover of about IPounds 110m and a pre-tax profit of IPounds 4m for a full year. Mr Jerry Liston, chief executive, said turmoil in the Irish financial markets in the last quarter of 1992 'contributed to a general lack of consumer confidence . . . and impacted on the slack trading conditions experienced in our consumer products division.' He said that government restraints on healthcare spending, reduction in pharmaceutical prices which became effective in August 1993, and a 'highly competitive marketplace' also affected the result. Net interest charges were IPounds 888,000, but following a rights issue last June, the group 'returned to a positive net cash position at year-end.' Diluted earnings were 16.54p (17.2p) and a final dividend of 4.8p makes a total of 7p (6.7p).</p>

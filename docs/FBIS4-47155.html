			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Baranovskiy: "President of the Russian </F> Federation Has Been Mindful of Geology Problems: Head of State  Believes That the Condition of the Mineral-Raw Material Base Is  Not Only an Economic Matter but Also a Geopolitical One";  Vladimir Orlov later referred to as Viktor Orlov]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin discussed prospects for the  development of Russia's mineral-raw materials base and problems  of the country's geological service with the chairman of the  Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of  Mineral Resources, Vladimir Orlov, for an hour on 25 May.    Vladimir Orlov, in an interview with a SEGODNYA  correspondent, explained what prompted his meeting with the  president and its possible consequences.    According to the chairman of the Russian Federation State  Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources,  economically useful minerals and products from the primary  processing of these minerals are, and will remain for the  foreseeable future, the basic source of foreign exchange  receipts for the state treasury. Thus, if all of Russia's  material assets now being used are estimated at about $2  trillion, then proven economically useful mineral reserves that  have been entered on the state balance sheet equal about $28  trillion. According to calculations of experts, all the free  capital on the planet is not enough to master Russian fields.    At present, according to all parameters of per capita  consumption of basic strategic forms of resources, Russia lags  behind the West by two to five times. Thus, according to the  president, it is necessary not to take the path of reducing  consumption of resources, but to qualitatively change the  structure of consumption. And, the market will force, and is  already forcing, conservation of resources, in terms of use per  unit of national product. A reduction of the entire mining and  mineral extraction complex is now taking place, necessitating in  the current period the activization of a purposeful state policy  with respect to this issue.    Weak spots in the development of Russia's raw materials base  and ways of overcoming them were discussed in the conversation.  The president emphasized in the first place that Russia, as a  great power, should and does have "raw materials" interests not  only in the countries of the CIS but in the whole world as well,  including the world's oceans (in particular, the president, in  the course of the discussion, repeatedly showed interest in the  development of technology and equipment for underwater  extraction of economically useful minerals). In other words,  problems in developing Russia's mineral-raw materials base have  a geopolitical as well as an economic character.    Boris Yeltsin was interested in the reasons for the decline  in oil and gold extraction, and the state of affairs with  respect to other strategic forms of raw materials, especially  those that have remained outside Russia. Of particular concern  to him was how quickly and at what cost the problem could be  solved. In this respect, the president expressed understanding  of the fact that geologists' work yields a return in 10 to 15  years and that the euphoria over the so-called "excess of proven  reserves" of mineral resources is quickly passing. Meanwhile,  investments in the mining and extraction industry yield a  sufficiently rapid return. For example, in explored fields, it  is possible to begin industrial extraction of oil in 1.5 to  three years, scattered gold--in 1.5 to two years, and gold  ore--in four to five years (at most seven years).    In connection with this, variants for attracting additional  investment, including by the state, were examined, as was the  question about what is blocking the attraction of domestic and  foreign investment in the country's mining and mineral  extraction complex.    A second set of questions concerned the organization of the  geological service in Russia, which recently has undergone major  changes and, as a result, has broken up into two components. The  smaller of these (15 percent of overall expenditures in geology)  is linked to providing for Federation-wide needs, including  defense, and is financed through the budget. Included here are  drilling of very deep wells, space programs, drawing geological  maps on a small and intermediate scale, predictions of  earthquakes, work in the world's oceans and the antarctic. Work  of this kind is financed through the state budget in practically  all countries in the world.    The remaining 85 percent of geological expenditures go to  providing for current requirements in mining and mineral  extraction, and related branches. These expenditures are  financed through clients' funds.    Measures for state support of the development of Russia's  mineral-raw materials base and geological service will be  discussed on 7 June at a meeting of the commission for  operational questions in the government. In this connection, the  chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology  and the Use of Mineral Resources noted that geologists were less  in need of new budget infusions than of a resolution of the  nonpayments problem.    In accordance with the system introduced as of 1 January  this  year, all payments for utilization of mineral resources and  taxes remain with regional geological enterprises. However, this  has not substantially affected their financial position. By way  of an example, Viktor Orlov [name as published] showed the  correspondent from the newspaper SEGODNYA a letter from the  general director of the association Tomskneftegazgeologiya, Mr.  Frinovskiy, saying that Tomsk oil workers had not paid R6.3  billion for work carried out in 1993. They had only given the  geologists the right to sell part of the oil extracted for R4  billion and to keep the money for themselves. According to the  chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology  and the Use of Mineral Resources, if the nonpayment problem is  solved, then the mechanism developed by the geologists for  fulfilling the work on Federation-wide and commercial orders  will function properly.    Viktor Orlov touched on the possible consequences of  abolishing quotas and licenses in exporting oil. In his opinion,  the consequences of this act will probably turn out to be very  unfortunate for the geologists, who last year extracted about 3  million tonnes of oil and exported practically all of it. In  connection with the reduction in budgetary allocations of almost  90 percent, income from oil exports allowed the geologists only  to support social welfare activities. And, in recent years,  about 30 percent of all expenditures in geology have gone to  these. And, this in spite of the fact that the excise tax rate  for geologists was the very highest--24 percent. Taking into  account that geologists extract oil in absolutely uninhabited  places, where there are no pipelines and the extracted oil has  to be shipped in gasoline tankers and mainly on winter roads,  the imposition of a customs duty of 30 ECUs per tonne can  completely undermine the social welfare sphere. Thus, one of the  questions to be examined by the commission for operational  questions on 7 June will be the abolition of excise taxes. For  now, Viktor Orlov is not taking it upon himself to predict how  the question will be decided.    Work abroad on a commercial basis has become another avenue  for obtaining additional funds for geologists. At present, at  least 10 agreements have been concluded with countries in which  during the USSR era geological exploration work was conducted.  But, geologists then worked using state credits. The new  agreements create not only new working places, but also a base  for supplying Russia with economically useful minerals that are  now in short supply for the national economy. (A classic example  is bauxite, large reserves of which have not been found on  Russian territory for over 60 years.) For at least another 15  years, the country will import certain mineral raw materials.  And, even after that, imports of mineral raw materials could  increase.    In concluding the interview with the SEGODNYA correspondent,  Viktor Orlov pointed to the growing interest in mineral  resources on the part of all regimes. If success is reached in  resolving the nonpayments problem and in adopting the package of  documents talked about above, then the volume of geological  exploration work will achieve the optimal level, which will  constitute half of the most that was achieved in the 1980's.

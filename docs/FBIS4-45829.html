			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang  is the country's top province as far as environmental protection  goes.    It tops the list when it comes to environmental quality, and  its forest coverage rate is 46 percent, also one of the highest  rates in China, according to an appraisal of environmental  quality made by the ecologic research institute of the Chinese  academy of sciences.    In recent years, with the development of township  enterprises, environment pollution has increased accordingly,  and the provincial government has formulated regulations to deal  with the problem, according to a recent forum to mark world  environment day sponsored by the provincial environment  protection bureau.    For example, while promoting silkworm breeding and fruit  production, the provincial government decreed regulations  concerning fluorine pollution. In addition, to ensure the  purity of the water used in making the famous local Shaoxing  rice wine the provincial legislature enacted a set of  regulations to protect Jianhu Lake.    The local government has also emphasized controlling the  pollution caused by township enterprises engaged in printing,  dyeing, tanning, chemical engineering and papermaking.    The province has set up various kinds of nature reserves and  scenic resort areas to protect rare animals and plants, natural  scenery, water, and cultural relics.</p>

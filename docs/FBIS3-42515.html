Mozgov; UDC 523.165;538.561;551.593] </F>   [Abstract] A great deal of practical value attaches to the  study of the propagation in the Earth's atmosphere of x-ray  emissions from deep-space nuclear explosions and the secondary  physical phenomena produced by such explosions. This paper  examines the possibility of ground-based recording of uneven  light emissions excited in the Earth's atmosphere by an x-ray  beam whose parameters are typical of an x-ray laser with pumping  from a nuclear explosion. Since uneven light emissions in the  atmosphere are isotropic, they can be recorded at great  distances from the beam axis. The researchers here examine the  process associated with the light signal generation and  calculate the amplitude-time characteristics of a light signal  that comes about when an x-ray beam from a cosmic source  interacts with the atmosphere. The light emissions achieve  maximum intensity within 10[.sup]-8[/]-10[.sup]-5[/] sec.  That time is a function of the position of the recording site:  the farther the site is from the beam, the greater the time.  Pulse width is also a function of recording-site position: the  closer the site is to the beam, the faster the intensity grows  (10[.sup]-5[/]-10[.sup]-4[/] sec).

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Observer: Hanson goes exploring Rarely does a humble hack get to fly in one of Lord Hanson's helicopter fleet. But yesterday Observer temporarily joined the elite, visiting Air Hanson's swish base in Surrey, for the launch of a new and rather special McDonnell Douglas chopper. A technologically impressive beast, the MD Explorer will be distributed in the UK and elsewhere by Air Hanson. Its big novelty is the lack of a tail-rotor. Given that 20 per cent of helicopter accidents are caused by the tail-rotor, which is also a very noisy component, it should be a big selling point. With no tail-rotor, US police and military can sneak up on the bad guys, at a price-they-like, with running costs of Dollars 375 per hour against a minimum of Dollars 500 for tail-rotor competitors. How come nobody has thought of it before? Ah, but they have: 'I saw some photos of a Russian trial version back in the 70's, but nothing since then,' says an MD executive. Of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Sadly, Observer can't tell you just how quiet the Explorer is since yesterday's chopper flight was grounded, thanks to a missing vital part. However, McDonnell Douglas has promised Hanson that the rogue item will be found in time for next week's international air show at Farnborough.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Argentina's currency continued to plunge against the U.S. dollar in an 11-week  slide that has driven up inflation and threated to kick off social unrest. The  country is undergoing an "unprecedented emergency," said Saul Ubaldini, the  general secretary of the four million-member General Labor Confederation, as  inflation neared a record 40% this month. At mid-day Tuesday, Argentines paid  102 australs for each dollar, a 19% devaluation from the previous day. Interest  rates paid by banks reached 80% a month as financial institutions tried  desperately to keep investors from removing deposits.  </P></p>

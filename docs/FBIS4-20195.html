			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [SN, APA report: "Austria Was Involved More Strongly in </F> Trade With Far East in 1993"]    [Text] Vienna -- The extraordinarily rapid economic  development of the Far East states made these countries one of  the most promising markets for Austrian business. In 1993  domestic exports to Japan, China, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and  Singapore rose by 10.5 percent to 18.7 billion schillings (4  percent of overall exports). These were set off by a volume of  imports that had increased by 4.1 percent to 46 billion  schillings (8.2 percent of overall imports).    Trade with China increased sharply. According to trade  delegate Ernst Laschan, exports were expanded by 41 percent to  3.7 billion schillings; imports rose by 30 percent to 7.8  billion schillings. The most important export goods were  machines "made in Austria." This provided about 69 percent of  export revenues. However, the future lies not so much in direct  exports but in joint ventures, Laschan said. At the moment  there are fewer than 10 of these joint ventures; by the end of  the year another five are to be added, however.    In 1993 Austria registered a record growth of exports to  Korea: They rose by 50 percent to 2.2 billion schillings. Trade  delegate Gerhard Meschke sees "excellent export prospects also  for the future." Korea is in the process of developing from a  low-wage country to a highly technicized industrial state. This  increasingly gives rise to a demand for high-technology  solutions to problems.    The second most important overseas market after the United  States was and is Japan. However, because of the current  weakness of its economy and the resulting weak demand, in 1993  exports to Japan declined by 4.3 percent to 7.2 billion  schillings. "Still, Austrian exporters have mastered the crisis  of the Japanese economy better than expected," Wolfgang Kueng,  trade delegate in Japan, stresses. In 1994 exports to Japan are  expected to rise again. The strong yen will force Japanese  industry to buy more products abroad, which will primarily  benefit domestic subcontractors for the automobile industry.  [passage omitted]</p>

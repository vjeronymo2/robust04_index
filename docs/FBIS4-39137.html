			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Vyacheslav Kebich, one of the six contestants to the  presidency at elections on 23 June, has outlined at a meeting  with workers of the Minsk margarine factory five basic  principles he intends to follow if he wins:    -- A mutually advantageous union with Russia, and  prospectively - an alliance of the three Slav states;    -- The building of an independent Belarusian state through  economic expansion and the restoration of broken ties;    -- Market relations through economic reform with producers  rather than brokers at the center;    -- Merciless fight against crime and corruption;    -- The spread of Christian morality and such Belarusian  moral  values as diligence, kindness, mutual respect, and restraint.    As Kebich emphasized, "a reliable, firm, and equal union  with  Russia is the goal of the policy I pursue." In his words, "the  first nine points of a treaty "on the unification of the  monetary systems of Belarus and Russia" have already taken  effect. [quotation marks as received] "The abolition of custom  duties alone has dropped the prices of Belarussian TV sets and  fridges by 15-20 percent. This means that these goods will be  increasingly pervading the Russian and other markets, and  profits and state revenues will go up," he said.    Custom-free bilateral trade has brought the tariffs on fuel  from Russia down as of 1 June. As Kebich disclosed at a meeting  with Minsk tube builders recently, "one tonne of oil purchased  in Russia will cost much less than the $85 the Republic pays for  it today." In his words, "the price of Russian fuel will be  formed thus: The world price minus a 40 percent custom duty."  IF Note: The Russian-Belarusian Monetary Integration Agreement  provided for such a trade status as of 1 May. However, it has  actually been in effect only since 1 June.    According to a poll by Eridan, a republican center for  political studies, Kebich's popularity as a candidate to the  presidential office has doubled in the last six weeks. He tops  the list of officially registered contestants with 372,000  signatures in his support. (Down at the bottom is ex-speaker  Stanislav Shushkevich with 123,000 signatures, and the leader of  the Agrarian Party Aleksndr Dubko with 117,000 signatures -- IF).    The popularity of other candidates, among them the former  leader of the Interim Parliamentary Anticorruption Commission  Aleksandr Lukashenko, the Communist Party's Secretary Vasiliy  Novikov, and Dubko has risen since April from two to four  percent while Shushkevich's rating has shrunk from nearly 10  down to seven percent and that of the Popular Front's leader  Zenon Poznyak has dwindled from 5 to 4 percent.    Nearly 60 percent of respondents favour monetary integration  with Russia, and more than 77 percent would welcome a fiscal  union with Russia.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVOLVING DOOR AT KTTV TO SPIN OFF 2 ANCHORS  </P> <P> The revolving door to the Fox-owned KTTV Channel 11 newsroom is spinning once  again. Both anchors of the station's 10 p.m. news, Dennis Morgino and Pat  Lalama, will be removed from their positions to make way for new news  personalities in the next month or two, the station confirmed Monday.  </P> <P> A KTTV spokeswoman said that both Morgino and Lalama, who served as reporters  at the station before moving "temporarily" to the anchor desk, will be asked to  stay on at the station. She said KTTV has been shopping around for new anchors  and hopes to announce at least one new hire by the end of the week. The station  also plans to make several other on-air changes in coming months, she said.  </P> <P> Since Fox bought KTTV four years ago, change has been nothing new to the  Channel 11 newsroom. Longtime local anchors Marcia Brandwynne and Tony Cox left  in the summer of 1987. Network news reporters Bill Redeker and Andrea Naversen  replaced them; Naversen's contract was bought out after only six months. KNBC  Channel 4 anchor Kirstie Wilde was lured to KTTV in 1988; she left the station  on a maternity leave about a year later but did not return. Lalama took over in  her absence. Then Redeker decided to return to network news last fall. Karl  Brown held down the weekday job for a few months before giving way to Morgino  last December.  </P> <P> Changes in news management at the Fox station have also been frequent during  the last several years. The station has had five news directors since 1987,  including Joe Saitta, former KCBS Channel 2 news boss Erik Sorenson, Steve  Blue, Joseph Barnes and Dick Tuininga, who has held the job since May. There  have also been several managing editors and executive producers during the same  time period as well as three station chiefs -- Bill White, Robert Morse and  current chief Greg Nathanson, who has been on the job since October, 1988. Joel  Cheatwood, KTTV vice president of news and programming, was hired to oversee  the news operation last February.  </P> <P> Since the Fox takeover, despite the reported active involvement of Fox chairman  Barry Diller, the station has failed to achieve Diller's stated goal of  becoming the No. 1 news operation in the Los Angeles market. In the most recent  ratings period last May, Channel 11 finished a distant second at 10 p.m., a  good 115,000 homes a night behind longtime independent news champ KTLA Channel  5.  </P> <P> The ongoing instability at the station has caused newsroom morale to sink, some  station employees said. Other recent changes include the departures of weekend  sports anchor Tom Nettles, executive producer Tom Moo, planning director Betsy  Bates and field producer Stephanie Seldin. A new weatherman, Mark Thompson, is  scheduled to begin work in about a month. Last summer, in a controversial move,  the station bought out the contracts of 11 veteran news writers, producers and  directors.  </P> <P> Tuininga held a recent staff meeting to assure current news staffers that there  would be no further dismissals, but since then two more news employees have  lost their jobs, said a KTTV news employee, who asked not to be identified.  Some staffers are also unhappy with recent directions in the station's news  content.  </P> <P> "No one feels particularly safe," the employee said. "Everybody's been told to  take a step back to a kind of keep-it-simple, stupid attitude about (our  newscasts), which has got everyone feeling offended. The place has been a  beacon of instability and remains so."  </P></p>

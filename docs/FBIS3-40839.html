The Congress  (I) leaders have accused Chief Minister Jayalalitha of being a  rebel and a dictator, while her supporters have accused Governor  Reddy to running a parallel government in the state.    Chief Minister Jayalalitha started a new dispute recently.  This fight will now not limited to Tamil Nadu; it will effect  other states also. Governor Reddy is also playing a role in this  dispute, however, this is the first time that the governors are  feeling that chief ministers may try to undermine their  authority.    According to tradition, the governor of a state is the  ex-officio chancellor of the state university, and he has the  right to appoint chancellors and deputy chancellors to the  university. He also presides over the university's graduation  ceremonies. A while back, when the position of chancellor at  Madras University was vacated, names of three persons were sent  to Governor Channa Reddy. Mr. Reddy rejected the three names.  Chief Minister Jayalalitha made this minor incident a case of  prestige and dispute and presented a controversial legislation  in the vidhan sabha. This legislation asks for transferring the  rights as the chancellor from the governor to the chief  minister. It is important to mention here that the prime  minister and not the governor will be the ex-officio chancellor  according to the proposed legislation, and vice chancellors of  the 13 universities in the state would be appointed by the chief  minister on recommendation by a three-member committee. One of  the three members would be appointed by the chief minister as  the ex-officio chancellor. The state education minister would be  the vice chancellor of nine of the state universities. The  health minister would be the vice chancellor of the state  medical college, and the agricultural minister and the animal  husbandry minister will be the vice chancellors of the  agricultural college and veterinary science college  respectively. Thus, to avenge the rejection of the names  proposed by her, Jayalalitha is trying to change the  Constitution.    It is a well-known fact that the dispute between the two  started the day Dr. Channa Reddy arrived in Tamil Nadu as the  governor. Although the governor is a senior Congress (I) leader,  Ms. Jayalalitha is very apprehensive of him. Chief Minister  Jayalalitha was not worried while she worked with the former  Tamil Nadu governor, Bhisham Narayan Singh. At this time,  Jayalalitha's star in Tamil Nadu politics is on the rise. Both  opposition parties in Tamil Nadu are in bad shape. The Pradesh  Congress (I) is weak because of the internal strife in it, and  DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam], her major opponent party, has  also split in to two factions. The Congress (I) and DMK are so  weak in Tamil Nadu that they are trying to save their existence.  As the result of all these developments, Jayalalitha and her  party have become stronger than ever.    However, by starting this fight with Dr. Channa Reddy,  Jayalalitha has initiated a new dispute. Recently, a  representative of Jayalalitha had accused Governor Reddy in  Delhi of running a parallel government in the state. She accused  that Dr. Reddy had taken steps to question various decisions  made by the elected ADMK [Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]  government. He is also accused of delaying the session of the  vidhan sabha for two months. He had called the vidhan sabha only  after the state had the prime minister and the president  interfere. The governor delayed a file requesting extension of  the chief secretary's appointment, and instigated the  Jayalalitha government by rejecting the proposed names for the  position of vice chancellors. She further accused him of  breaking rules by establishing a relief fund for the Maharashtra  earthquake victims. A traditional relief fund under the chief  minister is already there.    Meanwhile the Tamil Nadu Congress (I) Committee has accused  Jayalalitha of treason and has demanded her dismissal. Mr. K.  Ramamurthy, the state Congress (I) president, says that the ADMK  government is acting as if Tamil Nadu was a separate island and  not a part of the Indian Union. He said that the government was  trying hard to insult the position of the governor. He also said  that the governor's photograph was deliberately removed from the  state vidhan sabha diary. This is the first time when the state  Congress (I) president has openly demanded dismissal of  Jayalalitha's government. Jayalalitha is suffering all these  problems because of her support for the no-confidence motion in  the Lok Sabha against the prime minister last year. However, the  situation of Tamil Nadu's Congress (I) Party and the DMK party  is very weak. There is no political power in Tamil Nadu to  challenge Jayalalitha until the next election.</p>

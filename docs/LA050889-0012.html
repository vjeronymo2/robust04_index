			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAMUELSON ON ADOLESCENCE  </P> <P> The column of Robert J. Samuelson ("Our Style of Adolescence Is Now a Type of  Curse," Op-Ed Page, April 21) covers the declining level of the public schools  in this country.  </P> <P> Very interesting is the fact that Samuelson is writing not as a teacher, a  member of a board of education, an interested parent or a politician, but as a  columnist who writes about economic issues.  </P> <P> The magic word, which I noticed he mentioned three times in his column, a word  that I never read in the writings by members of the school system, is  "homework": apparently high school students do less than one hour a day of home  assignments.  </P> <P> There are about six to eight hours between the time schools send the pupils on  their merry way and bedtime (I don't dare to mention the weekend period) and  what do the nice children do? Apparently the majority of them do nothing to  further their education.  </P> <P> Please, parents and educators, make them study, make them read, do it for the  nation, and even more for the benefit of the children.  </P> <P> After all, educated and knowledgeable children are the greatest heritage we can  leave to our country.  </P> <P> FABIO MARCOTULLI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] THE Cabinet yesterday endorsed a proposal to  establish an Intellectual Property [IPR] and International Trade  Court to improve intellectual property protection.    The court will oversee cases concerning violations of  intellectual property rights in both the criminal and civil  courts.    It will also help to speed up judiciary proceedings as it  will rule on cases within one week of receiving testimony. The  entire process will take six months.    The establishment of the new court under the Justice  Ministry  now only needs ministerial approval.    Among ways to speed up the judicial process in the proposed  court are:    -- Sending a court notice through the post, which will be 20  days faster than by handing it over by a limited team of  messengers.    -- The court will have witnesses testifying every day  instead  of postponing cases.    The committee working on the new court is at present  studying  the process and the types of cases to come under the new court's  jurisdiction. The qualifications of the judges are also being  considered.    The Justice Ministry has already created a new division to  oversee intellectual property rights cases.</p>

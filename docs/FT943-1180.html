			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Sale of Swans' assets speeds up The first shipbuilding-related asset of Swan Hunter to be sold by receivers Price Waterhouse has been bought by a German shipbuilder. The intellectual property rights of Swan Hunter Singapore have been acquired by Lurssen for SDollars 200,000 (Pounds 87,000). Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said the Singapore IPR package was the result of a 'tidying up' to split the intellectual property assets of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure, from its Singapore subsidiary. The Singapore IPR consisted of old designs, he said, but was useful to Lurssen for its logistic support and supply services in the Far East. Swan Hunter's main IPR package has already attracted bidders, believed to include Lurssen's UK-based rival Vosper Thornycroft. The main IPR package is certain to command a much higher price than the Singapore deal, especially if, as seems likely, it includes the Swan Hunter name. If it does, the name could go abroad, while the 134-year-old company would disappear from Tyneside. Until the IPR deal, which was concluded earlier this month but not made public at the time, the receivers had concentrated on disposal of non-shipbuilding assets. Their main sale so far has been a large employee car park at Wallsend, already redeveloped as a Jobcentre and discount supermarket. This week marks an acceleration in Swans' rundown and the sale of assets. Unions expect to hear today of about 200 redundancies, including almost all the last 100 designers. Their loss ends hopes of a going-concern sale. Without them, Swans cannot tender for work. Organisation Management and Survey, based in Manchester, is heading a consortium hoping to bid for Swans in its entirety, but this would be an asset sale only, and time is running out. Mr Horsfield said: 'If we don't get a firm funded offer by the end of the month we will go ahead with piecemeal sales.'</p>

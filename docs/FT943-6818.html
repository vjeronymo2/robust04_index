			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: NEC closer to IBM standard NEC, the Japanese electronics company, is considering introducing IBM-compatible machines in its domestic computer range for the first time. The move highlights the growing influence of IBM's standard in the Japanese market. NEC said that it was looking into the possibility of introducing IBM-compatible high-end servers based on the Pentium microprocessor made by Intel. Servers are the machines which store data that can be shared among several computers and link them in a network. It is an important shift in NEC's strategy for the domestic market, where its proprietary PCs have more than a 50 per cent share of all installed machines. NEC has jealously guarded the turf won by its proprietary PCs, refusing to introduce IBM-compatible PCs in Japan even while other Japanese competitors, with their own proprietary machines, have done so one by one. NEC said it was considering the introduction of IBM-compatible high-end servers in order to meet the needs of its customers. These servers would be aimed at companies wanting to link up 20 or more computers in the office. Office servers can cost anywhere from Y1m to hundreds of millions of yen, and the Japanese market for high-end servers amounted to Y508bn (Dollars 5.16bn) last year. The shift in NEC's strategy reflects the spreading acceptance in Japan of IBM's architecture, which is a de facto standard in the rest of the world but has been slow to catch on in Japan where Japanese computer companies have promoted their own proprietary standards. The company emphasised, however, that it had no plans to introduce IBM-compatible PC servers.</p>

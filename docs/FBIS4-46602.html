			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed item: "Ukrainian Land Is Not Up for Auction!"] </F>   [Text] So says a statement from the "State Independence of  Ukraine," an all-Ukrainian political association.    The Sevastopol City Council, pursuing anti-state activity  aimed at the departure of Crimea from Ukraine and the  dissolution of Ukrainian statehood, resolved to conduct a poll  on June 26 with the question, "Do you favor the status of the  city of Sevastopol as the main base for the Black Sea Fleet of  the Russian Federation in accordance with the Russian-Ukrainian  protocol of September 1993?" It simultaneously proposes the  redeployment of the Ukrainian Navy from Sevastopol to some other  city. "We feel that such appeals are anti-state. The City  Council does not have the right to assume the functions of the  Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The population does not have the  right to determine the basing location of the Black Sea Fleet  through a poll," indicates the statement.</p>

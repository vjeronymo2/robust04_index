			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The formula that Russia is imposing on us,  according to which we would join the START treaty before it  comes into force, is unacceptable -- not to mention that it has  a tinge of political pressure; this was declared today by  Oleksandr Shevtsov, executive director of the National Strategic  Research Institute, in an interview to HOLOS YKRAYINY. In this  context, the U.S. Senate resolution on the ratification of START  I is more comprehensive and prescient. However, given the  present situation of Ukraine, Oleksandr Shevtsov emphasized, it  would be the most realistic thing if the nonproliferation treaty  implementation had the following sequence: Meeting conditions  that are included in the treaty so that START I obtains  validity, exchanging ratification instruments, and then  commencing the treaty's practical implementation, which would  result in the complete removal of nuclear weapons from our  territory.</p>

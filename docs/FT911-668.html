			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Iraq rejects UN police force to protect Kurds IRAQ HAS rejected the idea of a United Nations police force to replace allied troops now in the northern part of the country protecting the Kurds, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations secretary-general, said yesterday. Speaking at the White House as he met President George Bush, Mr Perez de Cuellar said he had just received 'a very clear rejection from the Iraqi government. They do not want a United Nations police presence.' He noted that both the US and the UN wanted to get all US forces out of Iraq soon, but warned that everyone involved might have to be patient. On Wednesday, Mr Bush said he hoped the UN could do in northern Iraq what it was doing in the south where a peacekeeping force has replaced US and other allied troops, though this is limited to a nine-mile wide demilitarised zone along the Iraq/Kuwait border. The US has backed the UK proposal for a UN civilian police force in northern Iraq to help protect displaced Kurds. This would be civilian rather than the military force in the south. Mr Perez de Cuellar said he had not made up his mind on the proposal. The US believes such a UN force to take over from US and allied troops could be set up without either Baghdad's permission or further UN action. But Mr John Bolton, assistant secretary for international organisations, said last night that Mr Perez de Cuellar's 'thought on a peacekeeping force was that another resolution was necessary. That's something we're going to have to discuss further.' Meanwhile, Iraq has moved special forces into the northern town of Dahuk, a provincial capital which US marines are poised to add to the 'safe haven' for Kurdish refugees, a marine officer said yesterday . The new presence could complicate any plan to send in US troops and coax hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees out of the mountains on the Iraqi-Turkish border back to their homes. The officer's estimate of Iraqi troop deployments in Dahuk, 50km from the border, was in stark contrast to that of the allied command, which earlier said Iraqi forces were withdrawing from the town and had dwindled to around 100.</p>

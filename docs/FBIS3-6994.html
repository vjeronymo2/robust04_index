			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Warmonger's Peace Gibberish"] </F>   [Text] The saying, "A blackhearted person insists he does  not have one," applies to South Korea's traitor Kim Yong-sam.    He, dining with stooges of a unit of the puppet Army on 19  March, raved that only power can preserve peace, that they  should not slacken their vigilance even for a minute, and so  forth. This can only be called an absurd trick of a civilian  warmonger.    The entire world knows that the puppets, under the sign  board  of peace, last year brought the situation on the Korean  peninsula to the brink of war by running amok in war exercises  and military buildup aimed at a Northward invasion.    Not long ago, puppet Kim Yong-sam has wandered South Korean  military academies with the military chieftains, and enumerated  bellicose outbursts, such as stressing the need to boost the  combat capacity of the puppet Army to the greatest extent and on  the ultra-modern weapons. Therefore, the peace the puppets are  raving about is in fact a war. In this perspective, the rascal's  trick that peace can only be preserved when there is peace is an  open incitement of confrontation and agitation of war fever.    The fact that the puppets deliberately ruptured the  working-level contacts for the exchange of high-level special  envoys speaks well of their bellicose nature. From the  beginning, they refused to accept our proposal on exchanging  special envoys. What is more, they, after having reluctantly  come out to the working-level delegates contact due to the  public sentiment at home and abroad, created an artificial  barrier to dialogues and hindered them with every means possible.    During the meeting they opposed our constructive and  reasonable proposals without any reason and, behind the scene of  dialogue, staged war exercises in the sky, on the ground, and on  the sea almost every day. In doing so, they threw a cold  blanket over the North-South talks and further aggravated  North-South relations.    In particular, the puppets held a so-called strategic  meeting  of high-level ministers concerned and decided to toughen its  stand against us. They even made severe outbursts that they  would resume Team Spirit war exercise, bring in Patriot  missiles, and join in sanctions against us. It goes without  saying that this is a declaration of refusal of the exchange of  special envoys, a declaration of an all-out confrontation and  war with us.    The puppets are talking about peace, reunification, and so  forth. However, in effect, they do not want either of them. The  only intention they have is unleashing a new war by stepping up  war preparations for a Northward invasion. If that is not the  case, why would the Kim Yong-sam clique keep pushing for the  military buildup and expedite the development of nuclear weapons  by going against the world trend of arms reduction? In  addition, why would they, in collaboration with the outside  forces, take the road of war by shaking off the fellow  countrymen's hands, and brutally suppress patriotic students who  oppose war and strive for peace and reunification?    Confrontation and peace cannot go together. Confrontation  will eventually lead to a collision and a collision will  escalate to a war. No matter how many times the Kim Yong-sam  puppet ring makes a peace gibberish, it would not be able to  hide the ugly color of civilian warmonger who heightened the  tension on the Korean peninsula and cast a somber cloud of war.  As long as the Kim Yong- sam clique remains intact, our nation  will not be able to evade suffering from the ravages of war.    The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique, which is confronting the  fellow countrymen's desire for peace and reunification and  running amok in the North-South confrontation and maneuvers to  unleash a war, would not be able to avoid the stern judgment of  the history and the people.</p>

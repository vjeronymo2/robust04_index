			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on the National Assembly debate on the cabinet </F> motion to allow the passage of UN military equipment convoy for  the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in Sofia -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] As we have already reported, at a  midnight session last night the Council of Ministers prepared a  draft resolution by means of which parliament is to permit the  transit passage through Bulgarian territory of property and  equipment for the preventative operations of the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM]. At the moment the members of parliament  are discussing the submitted draft resolution. Here is a report  from Vladislav Stoychev in our studio at the National Assembly.    [Stoychev] During the debate the parliamentary groups  expressed the following basic views on the issue. The NSD [New  Alliance for Democracy], Independence Parliamentary Group, and  the Movement for Rights and Freedoms unconditionally supported  the government's proposal. The SDS [Union of Democratic Forces]  linked its support to criticism of the government for the manner  in which it acted yesterday, circumventing parliament and  becoming embroiled in a chaos of contradictions.    The BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] motivated its negative  stance with the following arguments. By citing the  Constitution, the government acknowledged that the matter  concerns foreign troops. According to the BSP, this runs counter  to Bulgaria's decision of 19 April 1993 on nonintervention in  conflicts in former Yugoslavia. The view of the BSP reminds  parliament of Bulgaria's respect for the United Nations, the  losses from the embargo, and the obligations of the United  Nations and the UN Sanctions Committee toward Bulgaria.  Incidentally, the issues of respect for the United Nations and  the efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflicts  figured prominently in the stated viewpoints of all the  parliamentary groups.    Gincho Pavlov of the Fatherland Party of Labor declared that  the UN request has no other meaning in practice than a desire to  create a precedent for the subsequent passage of Turkish blue  helmets through Bulgarian territory. The BSP position was  sharply criticized in the last statement that was made a short  time ago, by SDS leader Filip Dimitrov. The debate continues.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Observer: Mint Kendall Yesterday's ships-for-pizzas deal between PepsiCo and Ukraine, bears all the hallmarks of 71-year-old Donald Kendall, one of the grand old men of US barter trade with the eastern bloc. Kendall, who stepped down as Pepsi chairman six years ago, still remembers with pride Soviet prime minister Nikita Khruschev holding a bottle of Pepsi while engaging in his famous 'kitchen debate' with US vice-president Richard Nixon in 1959. The incident marked the start of a long relationship between Pepsi and the Soviet Union. He has known Nikolay Kulinich, head of Ukraine's state foodstuffs committee, for 20 years, while shipping magnate Per Arneberg, who will sell the Ukrainian-made vessels, is a neighbour in Greenwich, Connecticut.</p>

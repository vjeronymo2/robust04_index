			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VISUAL ARTS / LEAH OLLMAN;  </P> <P> SOVIET FESTIVAL ASIDE, S. D. WILL OFFER DIVERSITY IN '89  </P> <P> With or without a mayoral proclamation, 1989 is shaping up to be a bountiful  year for the visual arts in San Diego. The Soviet Arts Festival, scheduled for  October and November, will undoubtedly get the heaviest dose of hype of any  local art event this year. In terms of visual art offerings, however, the  festival promises to be mostly bark and very little bite.  </P> <P> The rich and diverse programming that has quietly slipped onto the books of  local museums and galleries for the year attests to both the city's potential  and its accomplishment much more convincingly than any of the spectacles  planned by the mayor. Exhibitions organized by major institutions across the  country will be stopping in San Diego for a spell this year and, more  important, local art museums will be spreading their wealth as well.  </P> <P> The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art continues to lead the pack in this  regard, this year initiating two touring exhibitions, beginning with the first  comprehensive museum retrospective of the work of Vernon Fisher, a Texas-based  artist known for his complex and often obtuse narrative works. After its La  Jolla debut (Feb. 3-April 2), the show will travel to the Albright-Knox Gallery  in Buffalo, New York, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston and other  distinguished venues. Later in the year, the museum will exhibit the work of  designer Emilio Ambasz (June 9-Aug. 6). The show will explore Ambasz's  contribution to architecture, industrial design and graphic arts, and will also  be seen in Montreal and several other American cities.  </P> <P> The San Diego Museum of Art, hardly a vigorous exporter of its creative  products, will travel only one of its exhibitions this year, a retrospective of  the Spanish Impressionist painter, Joaquin Sorolla (Sept. 16-Oct. 28),  co-organized with the Institute of Modern Art in Valencia. The museum's  schedule for the year, however, does reflect a more adventurous importing  policy than usual.  </P> <P> Its show, "Art For the Public: New Collaborations" (March 1-April 9), from the  Dayton Art Institute, offers an educational perspective on the highly  provocative arena of public art, through plans and models of seven projects  throughout the country. The Bronx Museum of the Arts will be sending "Latin  American Presence in the United States, 1920-1970" (May 22-July 16), which  focuses on how the U.S. has acted as "stimulus, source, haven, receptor or  locus" in the work of artists from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries.  </P> <P> The museum's sporadic steps into contemporary art and art linked to other  cultures touch on firmer ground this year with these two shows as well as an  exhibition featuring the paintings of Li Huai. Trained in Beijing and now  living in San Diego, Huai explores the experience of working in such disparate  milieus in her show, "An Artist in Two Cultures" (June 10-July 23).  </P> <P> With the demise of most of the city's serious contemporary galleries in the  past few years, local artists have seen their home-based opportunities dwindle.  Of the galleries that remain (or have newly opened), only the Dietrich Jenny  Gallery maintains a strong and consistent commitment to local artists. This  year the gallery will show work by Steven Criqui and Michael Cuddington (Jan.  5-Feb. 4), Amanda Farber (Feb. 9-March 11), Ernest Silva (April 20-May 20) and  Wick Alexander (May 25-June 24).  </P> <P> Local artists will have a chance to respond directly to one another's work in  Installation Gallery's new "Hothouse" program. Each month, a different artist  will make his or her mark on an appointed section of the gallery, modifying the  work of the previous month's creator and setting the stage for the next. The  gallery will also spotlight the downtown art scene once again with its annual  Artwalk (April 22-23), a weekend of open studios, galleries and special  exhibitions. Sushi Gallery's annual "Streetseries" presentation of art in  public spaces (Feb.10-March 11) promises to ignite the city as well, in its own  surreptitious and subversive ways.  </P> <P> Other stimulating experiences in store for the year include the "Rosenberg Era  Art Project," a traveling show of historic and contemporary work along the  themes of patriotism and the Rosenberg trial itself (at Installation and the La  Jolla Museum Downtown, Sept. 8-Oct. 21), the Thomas Babeor Gallery's exhibition  of work by the elusive Surrealist Joseph Cornell (March 17-April 16), and the  San Diego State University Art Gallery's sponsorship of a site-specific  collaboration by New York artists Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler (April 21-May  24).  </P> <P> While the mayor's decision to bypass the city's natural links to Latino culture  and concentrate its first international arts festival instead on the remote  expressions of the Soviet Union generated a measurable amount of flak, that  bond will not go unexplored this year. In addition to the SDMA's "Latin  American Presence" exhibition, three promising shows are scheduled at four  different venues. "Young Mexican Painters" will be shared between the Mesa  College Art Gallery and Palomar College's Boehm Gallery (March 17-April 27),  and will be accompanied by a symposium on Mexican and Chicano art.  </P> <P> Sushi Gallery will organize a show of work by Hispanic women from Tijuana and  San Diego (March 17-April 15), and the Centro Cultural de la Raza, which faces  the challenge this year of sustaining its momentum through a change in  leadership, will present a show of photographs by Latina women that was curated  in New York.  </P> <P> If the efforts of a consortium of contemporary art venues -- LJMCA, UC San  Diego's Mandeville Gallery, SDSU's Art Gallery, Installation, the Centro and  Sushi -- materialize, a group of Soviet artists will be brought to San Diego as  artists-in-residence in the fall. Then, perhaps, the Soviet Arts Festival will  elicit as much vitality and energy as the city's arts institutions strive for  all year, every year.  </P></p>

Her body was found about 9:50 p.m. Thursday in the trunk of her car  parked in a residential neighborhood at 25th Street and Fashion Avenue.  </P> <P> Chee's husband reported her missing Thursday morning when she did not return  home. About 30 family members and friends searched for Chee on Thursday before  her brother spotted her Mercedes, Pavek said.  </P> <P> Pavek said Chee had probably been shot sometime before Wednesday night. Her  purse was missing, but detectives do not believe that robbery was a motive  because her jewelry was found still on her.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nestor Martinez] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, in a unanimous vote, the Senate  authorized the executive branch to acquire up to $4.279 million  in International Financial Corporation [IFC] shares. The  purchase will be made through the Bank of Mexico, bringing the  country's total shares to a maximum of 27,589. The IFC is a  division of the World Bank.    The Senate also approved the second issuance of the new,  silver 5-peso coin commemorating the quincentennial of the  discovery of America. The issuance was reportedly authorized as  an incentive for national producers and as a means for the  executive branch to help strengthen the mining industry, which  is currently experiencing a serious crisis.    Porfirio Munoz Ledo, president of the Party of the  Democratic  Revolution, made a short statement to say the transaction with  the IFC was "positive" as it calls for an additional  disbursement of more than $4 million, which will strengthen the  Bank of Mexico and increase the country's participation.    Munoz highlighted the fact that the loans were to come from  international financial organizations. Mexico urgently needs  assistance to reconstruct its productive economy, increase  employment, and funnel all possible funds, especially those  coming from multilateral loans, toward developing small and  medium enterprises, decentralizing the economy, and increasing  production.    Jesus Rodriguez y Rodriguez, president of the Senate  Treasury  Commission, said "the transaction is, of course, advantageous.  He added that "our dealings with that organization have been  beneficial as we have received $100 in loans for every $1  invested." He said such loans have been granted on excellent  terms and under superb time conditions.</p>

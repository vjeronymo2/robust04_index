			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar shares jump on labour estimate Shares in Caterpillar jumped sharply yesterday when the US heavy equipment maker said increased demand for its products would require it to hire more workers than previously forecast. The stock gained Dollars 3 1/4 to close at a 52-week high of Dollars 119 1/2 . Caterpillar, the world's largest supplier of earth-moving equipment, said that by the end of May its workforce would have grown by 1,000 from about 51,000 in late 1993. It was the second time the company had lifted its labour estimate since November.</p>

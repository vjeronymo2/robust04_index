			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Montedison taken to task The European Commission said yesterday that Montedison, the Italian chemical giant, broke EC rules by preventing customers from shopping across borders for cheaper weedkiller, AP reports from Brussels. It imposed no fine, but ruled that companies could not carve up markets for a product by marketing slightly different versions in different countries. Between 1983 and 1988, Montedison marketed in Germany a slightly different, and more expensive, version of its Italian product and prevented consumers buying the cheaper Italian version.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (8): Accent on quality controls - Operators are now seeking qualification for standard approval INCREASING demand from manufacturers and retailers for all suppliers to achieve recognised quality standards is now clearly reflected in the distribution services sector. Contract logistics organisations, road hauliers, freight forwarders, express delivery companies and other distribution service providers are all seeking qualification for British Standards BS 5750, the International Standard ISO 9000 or the European Standard EN 29000. But while few if any distribution companies of significant size are now prepared to opt out of chasing such formal recognition, debate continues over the real merits of achieving and maintaining BS 5750 or similar standards. 'In a service industry like transport and distribution, the meaning and value of a concept like 'service quality' is still, to a large extent, in the process of being defined and there are strongly opposing views on the value of BS 5750,' acknowledges Mr Len Davis, personnel director of BS 5750-accredited third party contract distribution company Applied Distribution Limited (ADL). 'At the one extreme, you have people who will insist that every one of their suppliers must have approval. At the other extreme there are those who dismiss it as irrelevant.' Another BS 5750-qualified company, TNT Contract Distribution, agrees some operators are questioning whether the level of investment in manpower and money needed to maintain BS 5750 accreditation is justified in terms of business growth. 'But we believe the cost can be justified by the continuing improvements in the quality and consistency of service provided and the significant volumes of new business won,' adds a TNT spokesman. Mr Philip Honor, managing director of Transport Development Group logistics company Williams Distribution, which also recently gained BS 5750 accreditation, emphasises that there are internal as well as external benefits to be gained. 'We have found the process extremely useful. Whether or not it results in a direct increase in our customer base remains to be seen,' he adds. On the international distribution side, Mr Gerry Burgin, managing director of freight forwarder Trans Global Air, the first UK top 10 forwarder to gain BS 5750 accreditation, is even more emphatic about the merits of such recognition. 'This is without question the way forward in our industry. BS 5750 is a guarantee of quality and excellence in service delivery which more and more importing and exporting businesses require from their freight distribution partners.' Adding weight to that argument, Mr Duncan McWilliam, group quality and customer service manager for TNT Express Worldwide, says there are now more than 7,000 companies in Continental Europe approved to BS 5750/ISO 9000 standards and some 13,000 in the UK 'and they are demanding that their suppliers be quality approved'. Pointing out that various parts of the TNT Express international and UK domestic organisation are already accredited with BS 5750, he says benefits include the fact that 'it requires the development of an infrastructure within an organisation that is able to take corrective action when things go wrong so that the mistake or problem is not repeated'. Some companies use specialist outside consultants to help them qualify for quality standards recognition while others have undertaken the work in-house. The former LEP Group UK contract distribution company Swift Transport Services, for example, chose the latter course. Swift, which was sold by LEP earlier this year to a holding company led by its senior management, recruited a full-time team from within the company. That was followed by a thorough audit of existing operational systems to identify the best methods, and a survey into the attitudes and motivation of employees towards quality improvement. Initial demand for distribution service companies to achieve BS 5750 or similar accreditation came mainly from manufacturing companies, particularly multinationals in the higher technology sectors. Their interest stemmed from a growing awareness that having implemented sophisticated manufacturing controls, the majority of remaining quality issues were arising after the end of the production line - for example, delays in the arrival of goods or variability in delivery. Manufacturers' efforts to establish product quality have generally focused on monitoring production processes through systems such as Statistical Process Control (SPC). If that control is established, runs the theory, then there is no need to worry about measuring the output because it will be exactly as required. Increasingly, the same thinking is being applied in the area of distribution and logistics, says Mr Martin Christopher, professor of marketing and logistics at the Cranfield School of Management. 'If you have got your logistics system under control, in other words you are monitoring and managing the key points along the way, then the output, which is customer service if you like, will meet the customer service levels you want to achieve.' In the past, says Mr Christopher, people used to think of 100 per cent delivery reliability as impossible. But, he points out, 100 per cent is achieved all the time in some areas of activity. If it was not, how many days a year would people be without electricity, how many days a year would the tap water be undrinkable? Other logistics industry experts point out that if a manufacturer wants to be a single source supplier to a leading automotive industry company, for example, it is taken for granted that it will meet the product specifications or he would not even have been invited to tender. But the only thing which is going to keep that company there as a preferred single source supplier is the fact it delivers the quantity and quality required, on time, to the point of use on the production line. However, those same sources also point out that gaining BS 5750 or similar accreditation does not ensure a distribution company will meet all its customers' needs. Rather, say supporters of the concept, such standards are likely in future to be seen as simply a starting point, a basic criteria they will have to subscribe to. 'Simply having a BS 5750 certificate on the wall does not create a quality company. The only guarantee it makes is that the company concerned has the systems and procedures required to deliver the agreed service,' says ADL's Mr Davis. 'Cost-effectiveness, for example, is considered by most customers to be an essential part of service quality. However, BS 5750 has nothing to say about the value-for-money of service provided by an approved company - that judgment is left entirely to the customer.' A similar point is made by a leading international distribution industry executive, Mr John Boyce, chairman of the British Shippers' Council air transport committee. He is a 'reasonable supporter' of quality assurance standards. 'But I have to say that achieving such standards will not in itself improve service quality for the shipper. You may get people achieving 100 per cent compliance with the prescribed standard but if that standard is not what the shipper wants, what is the point?'</p>

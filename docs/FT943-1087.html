			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Benfield proves exception to the rule London's insurance and reinsurance brokers have not performed well over the last couple of years, but Benfield Group, the reinsurance broker which has announced its full year results, is a notable and striking exception. Benfield, which is not listed on the stock market, continues to make annual profits equal to nearly three quarters of its operating income, and its senior executives are among the best paid in the insurance industry. The marginal fall in pre-tax profits in the year to June 30 from Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 29.2m, was principally due to falls in interest rates and currency losses. Mr Matthew Harding, the chairman, already a multi-millionaire with substantial interests in Chelsea Football Club, saw his remuneration package  -excluding pension contribution - fall only slightly to Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 2.45m). One other director also earned more than Pounds 1m in the year. Yet Benfield has significantly increased its financial strength, boosting shareholders' funds to Pounds 50.7m (Pounds 30.2m). An extra Pounds 12.5m in equity was raised earlier this year to capitalise a new reinsurance company, Benfield Re. Mr Harding is also well known as a fierce critic of the price-driven approach to broking favoured by many in the market in the 1980s, which helped depress reinsurance rates to unsustainably low levels. He has introduced a number of innovative elements into reinsurance contracts, mainly designed to prevent underwriters being able to underwrite business while retaining little or no risk on their own accounts.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / A town like Kokstad Nelson Mandela made racial reconciliation the top priority of his first 100 days in office. And in the streets of the Natal town of Kokstad - preposterously wide and scrupulously clean, like the streets of almost every other white dorp (town) in South Africa - his crusade has made its mark. In the hospital and the library, the hotels and the shops, change is subtly apparent. Eager or suspicious, reluctant or resigned, the people of Kokstad are struggling to assume the new identity thrust on them by the constitution: as equal citizens of one non-racial nation. In the elegant Cape Dutch town hall building which serves as library, librarian Heather Blackway can no longer pretend to herself - as so many whites have done for so many decades - that she does not live in Africa. White hegemony established Kokstad (which, ironically, was founded by native Griqua tribesmen in the late 19th century) as a small corner of Europe in Africa. 'Now we are an African dorp, no doubt about it,' Mrs Blackway comments wistfully, noting that she can never be sure of finding garlic in the local greengrocer's - because, she says, blacks eat cabbage and most consumers are now black - and lamenting the fact that 'African time is part of our everyday existence now'. The library has been transformed: April's elections triggered a flood of new black members, who now outnumber the whites. For though the library has been open to all races for some time, Africans were reluctant to demand their municipal rights until a black government was in place. Mrs Blackway welcomes this, but cannot help complaining of the cultural changes it has wrought. 'They all talk so loud,' she says, while another librarian comments that whites no longer linger for a (quiet) chat at the check-out desk, as in the old South Africa. Mrs Blackway is clearly suffering a crisis of identity in her native land. Like most white Kokstad residents, she finds it hard to relate to its new symbols: the multicoloured flag, which one white town councillor dismisses as 'a jockstrap up a flagpole'; the new national anthem, Nkosi sikele i'Africa (God Bless Africa), which has joined the Afrikaans anthem Die Stem; even the new president. For while Mr Mandela is universally popular among both blacks and whites, Mrs Blackway and most others say he is not 'our president' - he is president of one section of a still-divided nation, not yet the national leader. But if some of Kokstad's whites are none too keen on the new South Africa - local blacks say they are regularly confronted by the taunt 'Go and ask Mandela' when looking for a job - others focus on the fact that, whatever the current uncertainties, things could have been so much worse. Athena Fawcett and her husband Paul farm dairy and beef cattle near the border with the former black homeland of Transkei, where several white motorists and farmers were murdered before the elections. Athena points to the spot just outside her home where an armoured car used to mount a daily roadblock; now life is peaceful again, neighbours travel to Transkei resorts for holidays, and Athena says she is 'totally relaxed'. She thinks President Mandela is a 'saint on earth', and her husband concurs. Mayor Bevan Gattrell also agrees. 'The election came and within days you would have sworn you were in a different country. All of a sudden we were all part of the same country.' The poll lifted a weight from his shoulders. 'Now we can also say: this bloody government,' says Mr Gattrell, noting that the town was one of the first to set up an ad hoc multiracial local council to run Kokstad (population 5,000 whites and 5,000 coloureds) and the black township of Bhongweni (population 18,000 blacks) until local elections next year. Residents of Bhongweni, like their white counterparts, reflect a variety of views. Elderly nurse Elsina Masizana says race relations were transformed by the election. 'Whites used to nurse the whites and blacks used to nurse the blacks. Now we are working hand in hand together.' Fellow nurse Rosemary Mapekula is less sanguine. 'Sometimes I come across whites and they are nice. Other times I think these people are not yet in the mood,' she says. Young Simon Zondi, local political activist and chairman of the Bhongweni Civic Association, is more forthright. 'Whites are saying that (blacks can take over) at national level 'but not in my house, not where I work, I am still a white man and he is a black man'.' But even Mr Zondi, who is impatient for change not just in race relations but in economic development, acknowledges 'it's not an easy thing. You don't just wake up and things have changed. 'If it happens in three months, it won't be real,' he concludes. The honeymoon is over; now the real work of nation-building can begin.</p>

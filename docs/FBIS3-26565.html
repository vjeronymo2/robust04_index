			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Local Areas Given More Taxing Power"] </F>   [Text] China abolished five old tax items yesterday to  smooth the way for its new and simplified tax system.    The State Council, China's cabinet also decided to delegate  more power to local governments for taxing animal slaughter and  banquets.    The five obsolete items had covered trade fairs, livestock  trading, salary adjustments, bonuses and oil burning.    China introduced the bonus tax in the early 1980s to prevent  inflation.    The country's economy at that time was just lifting from a  decade-long low, and enterprises were paying more to their  employees because of improved efficiencies.    In particular, managers of State run enterprises, who were  able to control their ventures for a designated period of time  on a contractual basis, tried to win the support of employees by  lining their wallets.    Caught off guard by the freewheeling bonus-giving, the State  Council created the bonus tax on enterprises in 1984.    The provision stipulated that a State-run industrial or  commercial enterprise was subject to taxation if its annual  bonuses to employees exceeded an amount equal to their standard  salaries for two and a half months.    The bonus tax rate could be as high as 300 per cent.    The tax successfully curbed the practice of raising bonus  levels, thereby easing the country's inflationary pressures.  But that was only one side of the coin. The bonus tax also  hampered a quick increase of individual incomes in China.    The new individual income tax law took effect at the  beginning of this year, replacing the old bonus (and salary  adjustment) tax.    Under the new system, enterprises find it easier to raise  the  employees' income levels. However now the individuals, not the  units must pay the tax for their extra income, including bonuses.    The emphasis on individual rights and obligations comes  closer to international practice and effectively relieves the  enterprises' burden, while steering away from possible  inflationary hikes.    Chinese individuals are now liable for taxation if their  monthly income (including bonuses) surpasses 800 yuan ($92).    The ceiling will be higher for taxable foreigners, but the  amount is still to be decided by the State Council.    Economists said the structural reform of China's tax system  will not cause a heavier burden on tax payers.    China will tax only 18 items, compared with more than 30 in  the past decades.    Yesterday's announcement reflects the State's consideration  to strike a virtual balance between the revenues of central and  local governments.</p>

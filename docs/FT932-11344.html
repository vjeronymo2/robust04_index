			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Determined proponent of water privatisation / Obituary of Sir Roy Watts SIR ROY WATTS, chairman of Thames Water since 1983, was one of the driving forces behind the water industry's controversial 1989 privatisation. Much of the water industry, unconvinced of his views at the time, grew to share his belief that long-neglected modernisation would have been impossible without privatisation. In a Financial Times interview last November he said that in government hands, Thames would have had no chance of financing the ambitious Pounds 250m Ring Main, the watercourse encircling London, for which tunnelling was completed early this year. He was adamant, too, that customers should be put first, although modernisation meant that bills had to rise. He said Thames regarded hosepipe bans as a failure, and was proud that it sent out the lowest bills of the largest 10 water companies. He felt it was the industry's misfortune, however, that improvements tended to remain 'unseen and unsung'. Sir Roy was criticised 18 months after privatisation when his remuneration doubled to Pounds 155,000. He responded that he was 'worth every penny'. Although he took a pay cut last summer when bonuses were squeezed, controversy flared again when Thames revealed that it had donated Pounds 50,000 to the Conservative party before the general election because 'the return of a Conservative government was in the interests of the company and its shareholders'. Fellow water chairmen, who remember his competitiveness and fierce pursuit of efficiency with respect, also describe him as a private and thoughtful man. Sir Michael Straker, chairman of Northumbrian Water, said: 'He didn't easily come out of his business shell, but although he had a very serious face he had a twinkle in his eye. He was very tough and determined, but a very lovable man, gentle and quietly spoken.' He was widely regarded as the most senior of the water chairmen, both because Thames is the largest company and because of his considerable experience outside the industry. Sir Roy was born on August 17 1925 in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, and educated at Doncaster Grammar School and Edinburgh University. He served in the 8th Royal Tank Regiment from 1943 to 1947 in Europe and Palestine, and entered local government as an accountant before joining British European Airways in 1955. He became British Airways' chief executive in 1979 and joint deputy chairman in 1980. While at BA he helped launch the UK shuttle services. He said then that airlines should fit their timetables around customers' needs, not the other way around. He left BA two years after Lord King was appointed chairman. Former colleagues say that he had hoped to be chairman, and although he had initiated some efficiency measures he had felt squeezed out as one of the 'old guard' when the King-inspired transformation of BA took hold. After moving to Thames he held a number of other chairmanships: he led Armstrong Equipment, the automotive company, from 1986 until it was taken over three years later, and Lowndes Lambert Group, the insurance broker, from 1988 to 1992. From 1991 he was also chairman of IBC, the publishing and conference group, and of Frank Graham Group, consulting engineers. He received the CBE in 1978 and a knighthood last year. According to industry colleagues he had been depressed since he was diagnosed as having Parkinson's Disease two months ago. He had also been deeply upset, they said, by the death on April 6 of Mr Charles Stuart, who had been a close friend as well as a long-standing colleague. Sir Roy married Jean Rosaline in 1951; they had three children.</p>

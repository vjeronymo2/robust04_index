			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Struggle at the airport gates: The row over state aid for airlines ahead of the complete opening of Europe's skies in 1997 Europe's airline barons are putting up a fight. The loss-making flag carriers, and the states that own them, are proving as determined to protect themselves from market forces as the European Commission is to unravel the closed and subsidised airline industry. The result is a game of ploy and counterploy, as governments try to delay the introduction of competition and extend the life and amount of state subsidies, ahead of the complete opening of European skies in 1997. The Commission launched its three-stage liberalisation policy in 1986, forcing European governments to abandon the heavy regulation that had protected their carriers from competition, but kept many air fares artificially high. When deregulation is completed in three years time, all EU airlines will be able to fly wherever they choose within the single European market, and operate internal services in other EU countries. The Commission is also proposing to break up the ground handling monopolies at many European airports. For the Commission, the challenge has been to resist pressure from governments to approve large subsidies for ailing national carriers to help them cope with liberalisation. The Commission agreed this year that financially troubled flag carriers should be allowed one last injection of state funds only where it was tied to a meaningful restructuring programme. But Brussels since appears to have capitulated to the big state carriers and their government owners. In July alone, the Commission approved state aid totalling Dollars 7.1bn to three airlines including Air France, TAP of Portugal and Olympic Airways of Greece. These aids were equivalent to 45 per cent of the total losses of Dollars 15.6bn that western airlines have accumulated on their international scheduled services in the past four years. Seven airlines - British Airways, KLM, SAS, Air UK, Maersk, TAT and British Midland - and the British government are now contesting the Commission's approval of a FFr20bn state aid package for Air France. The subsidy is 'grotesque', says Sir Michael Bishop, the British Midland chairman. 'It is almost equal to the entire losses made by world airlines last year'. But subsidies are not the only source of friction. There has been a bush war in France over the opening to competition of Orly airport, south of Paris. The French transport ministry, last month, limited the total number of take-offs and landings from the airport, which is a stronghold of Air France and its domestic partner airline, Air Inter, to the current level of 200,000 flights a year, on environmental grounds. Many in the industry suspected the motive was to prevent any rapid expansion of competition at Orly. The European Court of Justice recently ordered the French government to allow other airlines immediate access to the lucrative domestic routes to Toulouse and Marseilles that have long been the monopoly of Air Inter. The transport ministry responded by announcing that competing services could only start in January. In June, the French government was forced to grant rights to British Airways and its French affiliate, TAT, to start flying between Orly and London. This dispute almost blew up into an all-out confrontation with the British government and the European Commission. And even after reluctantly agreeing to the Orly flights to London, the French government imposed a cap of four daily services on the route. Undeterred by these setbacks, the government this month frustrated KLM's plans to start services between Amsterdam and Orly by refusing to grant the Dutch carrier landing rights, prompting KLM to ask the European Commission to intervene. The French transport ministry says its aim is to achieve fair and healthy competition, but concedes that competition on these routes would cut Air Inter's market share and aggravate losses at the airline. Last month, Air Inter warned of expected losses of about FFr100m this year. Its partner, Air France, is engaged in a restructuring plan to cut losses of FFr8.5bn last year and return the group to profit by 1997. 'The problem is not technical, but political, in the sense that every French minister of transport has for so long considered himself the minister of Air France,' said Mr Lofti Belhassine, president of the small French independent carrier Air Liberte. 'The French government has no right to impose additional hardship on its citizens by avoiding competition, which is here to stay. There is still a feudal system in France, but the writing is now on the wall.' The stakes are high not just for Air France and other state-owned carriers, but also for the European Commission and its efforts to liberalise European air transport. There has been a rush of alliances and partnerships between large and small carriers in Europe to strengthen their hand in a deregulated market. But many governments are proving reluctant to give up sovereignty over their airspace while they are funding inefficient national carriers, which are important sources of employment and political patronage. In addition, government subsidies to European national carriers are running at Dollars 10m a day, according to Mr Herman De Croo, chairman of the European Commission's independent committee of 'wise men'. Set up last year, the committee's brief is to draw up recommendations on the future of the European airline industry. 'The tragedy of it all is that when the economy is improving, air transport is on the upswing, and most big airlines are finally making money, a hard core of state-owned majors appear unable to take any medicine at all,' notes Mr De Croo. The danger is that a two-class airline industry will emerge in Europe. 'The first involves airlines which have had to solve their problems on their own: the second includes airlines which continue to defy the laws of economics and have enjoyed a bumper year for subsidies,' says Mr Robert Ayling, managing director of British Airways. For the BA executive, state aid is a test that the Commission has so far 'dramatically failed and done lasting damage to its reputation'. A Cranfield University study on airline efficiency confirms that privately or partially privately owned carriers are performing best in Europe while state-owned carriers are at the bottom of the league. In his legal challenge against the Air France subsidy, Mr Brian Mawhinney, the UK transport secretary, emphasised that government handouts removed the incentive for state-owned airlines to become efficient and adopt a sound commercial approach. Even if the European Court action does not succeed in overturning the Commission's approval of the Air France subsidy, it has unsettled the regulators. 'If nothing else, this legal challenge is likely to stiffen the Commission's spine and toughen its attitude over future applications for state aid,' one Brussels official said. The consumer is also emerging as a force for change in European air travel. 'We used to think that liberalisation would create the environment to change,' said one airline executive . 'We now believe the customer will. The customer has less loyalty to flag-carriers than governments have.' And despite the last ditch resistance from the barons, the industry does seem, finally, to be getting the message. As Mr Pierre Jeanniot, the director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), told last week's annual meeting of the 222 member airline trade organisation: 'The need for profitability is paramount. Without it air transport will either die, as did maritime passenger transport, or become a political football in a game of subsidies, as with the railways.'</p>

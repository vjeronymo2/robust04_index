			<p>BFN     [Text] Upon visiting several labor centers in Santiago de  Cuba and learning about the principal problems and objectives in  each workplace, Politburo member Carlos Lage Davila granted an  exclusive interview to this station during which he assessed the  final stage of the harvest.    [Begin Lage recording] We can say that the harvest is going  through a very difficult, tense situation. In Santiago de Cuba  and other provinces as well, the harvest is behind schedule,  perhaps because of rains and other factors. The conditions under  which the harvest had to be prepared were very difficult. [end  recording]    For this reason it has been decided to continue the  harvesting activities until May. We must get ready to conclude  the harvest under the abnormal conditions of rain and humidity.  After more than three months of harvesting, breakdowns are  reasonably expected to increase, and so we must look for rapid  solutions. However, notwithstanding the inclement weather or  material failures, Lage trusts that the workers' spirit will not  decline:    [Begin Lage recording] The leaders and workers who are  engaged in this harvest have not shown any sign of weariness,  although some of these groups have been working for more than  140 days and still need to continue working through the month of  April, and perhaps even some days in May. [end recording]    Despite the difficulties, Santiago de Cuba seems to be  determined to fullfill its objective. According to the latest  assessment, the conditions are appropriate to achieve these  objectives, but as in any endeavor to reach the final goal, a  greater effort is demanded.</p>

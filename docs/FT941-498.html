			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / City expresses doubts on golden handcuffs scheme The City reacted with some scepticism yesterday to the decision by Smith New Court, the securities house, to develop a staff bonus scheme with golden handcuffs attached. The firm wants to allocate a proportion of its annual bonuses to staff in the form of its own shares. These would be held in trust and only handed over three years later to those still working for the firm. The personnel manager of one competitor said yesterday: 'Smith New Court is taking a calculated risk. This may make it more difficult for them recruit staff. It may also up the bids and add to labour costs. The only winners will be the recruitment consultants.' A headhunting firm said the scheme reflected increasing concern about poaching of top employees. 'We are finding that forms of deferred compensation are proving popular,' it said. 'Increasingly people are getting paid a good proportion of their bonus in terms of shares.' In the secretive world of City securities houses few are willing to comment publicly on remuneration which is often high and sometimes structured to avoid tax payments. However, a number of securities houses have introduced some element of compensation designed to generate staff loyalty, including deferred cash bonuses and share options. Most differentiate between current-year bonuses and long-term share option plans designed to boost loyalty. The Smith New Court proposals stand out because they: link the two elements; use existing shares rather than new equity; involve a high proportion of total equity - up to 15 per cent; and will be used with a relatively large number of employees - perhaps 15 per cent of the total. The concept is less surprising to US firms, which were largely de-regulated in the early 1970s. Merrill Lynch pays some senior staff a proportion of bonus in shares. Lehman Brothers is believed to offer staff compensation deferred over three years. Salomon Brothers, the securities arm of Salomon, has been paying some staff a proportion of their bonuses in shares for about three years so that 19 per cent of equity is now held by staff. Shares are held in trust for five years during which time they cannot be traded. Thereafter they are redeemable whether or not the employee has left the company. Some firms, such as Goldman Sachs, have been able to retain staff loyalty because bonuses are paid in the form of equity stakes that cannot be cashed without considerable difficulty. In the UK, some argue that high staff turnover and low loyalty began with de-regulation of the City's financial institutions in 1986. Until then, brokers were traditionally privately held partnerships whose staff held shares. As the organisations obtained stock market quotations, this loyalty through ownership was lost. Ironically, the firms said still to be among the most profitable are those which retained the more traditional ownership structure with their shares held privately, including Cazenove, based in the UK, and Goldman Sachs.

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Letter: Too few share vision of good practice Sir, I was one of the thousand or more international business leaders who attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, and was a participant in a private session of the Prince of Wales's Business Leaders Forum. I, and many of my fellow chairmen present, were therefore surprised at the tone of your leader, 'Princely Capitalism' (February 5). It certainly did not reflect the warmth and enthusiasm shown towards the prince for his bold vision for business. Why is his view of the business world 'idiosyncratic'? As one of a growing number of companies which give practical effect to the principles of good corporate citizenship, my own company has supported and encouraged the Prince of Wales in acting as an ambassador for the values of 'business stewardship'. While you rightly state that the prince was urging what we all regard as good practice, we share his view that too few companies around the world have as yet fully recognised social and environmental responsibility as an integral aspect of their business operations. Nor was the prince advocating this approach, nor partnership with local communities, as a prescription for an economic miracle as you implied. He was quite rightly putting the case that business cannot be competitive in the long run, unless it is more responsive to pressing social and environmental issues faced by communities in their international markets. His position may be privileged, but this has not stopped him earning his credibility from direct experience of working with business leaders in practical solutions to these problems in many parts of the world. Surely, the prince's message that talking and thinking is not enough to match the tough challenges of illiteracy, hunger or environmental degradation - and that international business has a key part to play in action to address these issues which directly affect our stakeholders - deserves even greater attention.

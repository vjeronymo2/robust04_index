			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 9 (TANJUG) -- Romanian delegation  chief Theodore Mircea said Monday in Belgrade that his  government had already drawn up agreements on the strengthening  of economic cooperation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  (F.R.Y.) once the U.N. sanctions are lifted.    These agreements are aimed at putting right the present  injustice and giving to the F.R.Y. the status of principal  Romania's economic partner, Mircea told Serbian Government  Minister Dragan Tomic during their meeting, Serbian Information  Ministry has announced.    Even in the present situation, Romania has strived through  allowed activities to maintain cooperation with Yugoslavia.  During one year, it addressed to the sanctions committee one  thousand requests for humanitarian exports to the F.R.Y., but  only 334 of these requests worth 456 million dollars were  granted. The Romanian Government believes that authorizations  for humanitarian exports to the F.R.Y. should from now on be  granted more speedily and frequently, and will persevere in its  requests to this end, the ministry communique says.    Tomic said that his talks with the Romanian delegation,  which  comprises government repgesentatives, businessmen and experts in  economic development, were paving the way for a more fruitful  economic cooperation in all fields in the joint interest, as  soon as sanctions are lifted. The cooperation continues even in  conditions of international embargo, which is causing great  losses to Yugoslav and Romanian economies, he added.    The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions on  Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) on May 31, 1992 because of Yugoslavia's  alleged military involvement in the civil war in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The arrival of the Romanian delegation for a several-day  visit to Serbia was agreed at the highest state level during  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's visit to Romania last  month. During that visit, the two sides had expressed interest  in market transformation, privatization and economic integration  in the Balkans, especially as the united Europe is now  finalizing its own integration process, the communique said.</p>

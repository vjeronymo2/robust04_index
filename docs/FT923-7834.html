			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Boris Yeltsin's troublesome deputy waits serenely for call to power: Alexander Rutskoi explains his broadsides against radical reforms to Leyla Boulton RUSSIA'S Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi displays the serene self-confidence of a man whose time has finally come. Delivering the benefits of eight months of sniping at the government's radical economic reforms, a recent opinion poll suggested for the first time last month that he had become more popular than President Boris Yeltsin. As the fate of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, hangs in the balance, he and the 'constructive' Civic Union opposition group he backs are certain their calls for a new cabinet and more gradual reform will soon prevail. But this Afghan war hero with a taste for sculpture says that at 44, he is in no hurry to replace Mr Yeltsin, who has already declared he will stand down at the end of his current presidential term. 'If I serve two terms with President Yeltsin, I will be 53 years old. What's that for a politician?' he told the FT this week. His airy Kremlin office features a bust of Peter the Great, the great reforming Tsar, a row of model Soviet airplanes and a Sotheby's catalogue - reflecting the eclectic tastes of the air force general who is in charge of reforming Russian agriculture. His motto of 'liberal reform and strong rule' inspired by Pyotr Stolypin, the great Tsarist prime minister who combined strong-arm rule with ambitious land reform, Mr Rutskoi claims Mr Gaidar's 'shock therapy' is leading Russia to revolution and disaster. He believes Russia must abandon financial austerity policies agreed with the International Monetary Fund and rely more on its own resources if it cannot get unconditional help from the west. 'Dancing for the IMF has buried our investment-credit policy,' he charges. By way of argument, he rattles off a host of figures on the fall in production. Asked why he favours the appointment of a new cabinet (an aide claims this is just a matter of weeks away), he picks up a weekly report on inflation by Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister. 'I am going to invite Nechayev here and give him 335 roubles to see if he can buy a week's shopping as this report claims it is possible to do.' The flaws in his arguments appear only when he is challenged on how he would deliver alternatives. He advocates either methods from the past which have already proven to be inadequate (planning the distribution of natural resources) or remedies which the new government is already trying (such as attracting foreign investment). 'He is so simplistic, a typical military man,' said one foreign diplomat with experience of military regimes. His extravagant criticisms - typical of many ambitious Russian politicians who are free from real responsibility - have in themselves done much to undermine the present government. His aides argue, however, that he has done President Yeltsin a favour by chanelling public discontent away from the extreme neo-communists and fascists who find so much in common in post-communist Russia. From his military past, when he flew missions in Afghanistan and was eventually taken prisoner by mujahideen guerrillas, the dapper vice-president believes in working out a clear cut strategy and marching towards it. For this reason, he argues that Mr Yeltsin must have more power to pursue reforms - a path which the president has already tried without going as far as abolishing the backward parliament which has stood in his way. Although no easy task in a country where the vice-president can tell the nation that the government is committing 'economic genocide', Mr Rutskoi is probably also right about the need for more 'ideological work' to explain market reforms to the people. 'Everybody must know what they are going to get out of reforms,' says this former communist who is now honorary chairman of his social-democratic Free Russia Party - now one of the biggest of Russia's fledgling parties. He speaks effortlessly in the theatrical cadences and soothing tones of a populist leader as if he had been groomed for this role all his life ('the Russians are a patient people, a courageous people and a good people but their patience is not unlimited'). 'This is a new kind of 'popular politics' - talking to the people in language they understand,' explains one of his aides who says the next task is building the vice-president's image in the west. Although he enthuses about the need to co-operate with the west, Mr Rutskoi also successfully seizes on a popular perception that the west has let Russia down with help for its reforms. 'Today everybody claps Russia on the back and says 'come on come on'. All right, but help us then. I'm sincerely grateful to those who give humanitarian aid but it is peanuts. We need help, but for concrete projects so that western taxpayers can see where the help is going. Like if you build a baby-food factory, you can solve the baby-food problem.' In contrast, he becomes visibly angry when he talks about the former Soviet republics. He says that Russia must act from a position of force in order to ensure they respect the 'human rights' of Russian minorities. He claims that it is precisely his sabre-rattling which has helped warring parties come to the negotiating table in Moldova and South Ossetia. 'No idea is worth a child's tears,' he says, quoting Dostoevsky to condemn what he calls 'nationalist-chauvinistic' policies pursued by newly independent republics - such as laws in Estonia depriving Russians of the vote or requiring that they learn the local language to hold government office. Similarly he argues that Russia should cut off deliveries of cheap energy to the Baltic republics if they continue to insist on the immediate withdrawal of Russian army units. 'They say housing for them is our problem but if it is our problem let's export those energy supplies for hard currency and build flats with the proceeds.' Just like the young academic, Mr Gaidar, whose team he branded as 'little boys in pink shorts', he has matured a lot since coming to power, making a host of mistakes on the way. In February for instance, a brief flirtation with the far right won him the opprobrium of his own party. Until December he was close to General Alexander Sterligov, a hardline neo-communist KGB officer. Now he is open to exploitation by other forces in the Civic Union alliance, including Mr Arkady Volsky, the wily chief of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs who also has ambitions for high office. Although President Yeltsin is by no means on the ropes, Mr Rutskoi offers a package which the fickle and long-suffering Russian public seems increasingly willing to embrace.

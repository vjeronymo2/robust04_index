			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi April 1 TASS -- The Georgian parliament  adopted a resolution on Friday concerning an incident which took  place in the parliamentary building on Thursday, when the former  chief of the Tbilisi police, assisted by his colleagues,  attempted to thwart a procedure of endorsing the Georgian  defence minister to his post.    The document adopted by the Georgian parliament qualified  actions by Mayor-General David Zeikidze as an attempt to topple  the parliament by force.    It was pointed out that as a result of clashes, a member of  the government and a member of the Georgian leader's staff were  seriously injured.    The parliament took into account that criminal proceedings  had been instituted on this incident and instructed the Georgian  Interior Ministry to take necessary measures to "restore order  in the city police department."</p>

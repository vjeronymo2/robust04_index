			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by S. Pyrozhkov, director of the National Institute </F> of Strategic Studies: "The Crimea and Ukraine: Problems of  Mutual Relations"]    [Text] Developments in and around the Crimean Republic are  becoming a more and more important factor in all-Ukrainian  political life and an object of careful attention at the  interregional and international levels. Before our very eyes,  the situation in the Crimea (so far only in terms of politics)  is gaining more and more symptoms of a strategic problem, the  resolution of which may turn out to be a tough challenge, not  only for Ukraine and its neighbors, but also for the world  community.    One can often hear complaints against the fatal mistake,  which was, in the opinion of certain politicians and analysts,  the restoration of Crimean autonomy. It is deemed as a  concealed betrayal of Ukrainian statehood, as well as a result  of a nomenklatura plot. It would be, however, hardly correct to  boil down the restoration of Crimean autonomy to highhandedness  and shortsightedness of certain politicians. It must be kept in  mind that at that time, in early-1991, Ukraine's leadership was  facing two problems.    First, an all-Crimean referendum was held in January 1991,  which precisely defined the Crimeans' positive attitude toward  the very idea of autonomy. This had to be taken into account,  at least on the eve of the March all-Soviet referendum and  all-Ukrainian poll. The Ukrainian Supreme Council, headed by  Leonid Kravchuk, was trying to ensure the broadest possible  social basis to preserve its political influence on the  situation all over Ukraine, preventing a loss of control over  the situation to Moscow politicians.    Second, Ukrainian politicians understood that if they were  not able to reach a quick compromise, first of all with the  Crimea, Soviet structures would interfere in the developments,  and then, Ukraine's territorial integrity, which had been  recently confirmed by the Declaration of State Sovereignty,  would undoubtedly be threatened.    The adoption of the Constitution by the Crimean Supreme  Council in May 1992 and the appointment of the all-Crimean  referendum became the apotheosis of confrontation. The decisive  resistance of the Ukrainian leadership on the one hand, and the  pressure of the pro-Russian Republican Movement of Crimea on the  other, called forth a great probability of social conflict. It  was the weighed position of the Crimean Supreme Council  Presidium and its Chairman Mykola Bahrov which made it possible  to put the resolution of the problem on a negotiating process,  which resulted in a moratorium on the referendum and the  adoption of the Ukrainian law "On Division of Powers Between the  State Authorities of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic."    The Crimean Constitution, altered in accordance with this  legislation, was adopted on 25 August 1992. At that very time,  a certain political intrigue was devised around the question of  whether legislation on the division of powers was in force or  not. On the one hand, the Ukrainian Supreme Council did not  return to the question of adherence of the Crimean Constitution  to the Ukrainian one. On the other hand, the Ukrainian  president stated twice in the Supreme Council that legislation  on the division of powers was in force. The Ukrainian  Constitutional Court, which would have had to deal with this  issue, had not yet been established at that time.    Thus, the development of state authorities in the Crimea was  proceeding along these lines. Even though it was the very  August Constitution that envisioned the office of Crimean  president, the question of whether its provisions conform to the  Ukrainian fundamental law was only readdressed 15 months later,  when the presidential campaign in the Crimea was already in full  swing. This confirmed, in my opinion, that the state leadership  was trying to maintain the freedom of political and judicial  maneuvers in the event of unconstitutional, extremist actions of  the Crimean ruling structures. On the other hand, Kiev saw  Mykola Bahrov as a moderate politician willing to accept  reasonable compromises and able to keep the situation in the  Crimea under control.    Mykola Bahrov consistently pursued the line toward expanding  Crimea's economic powers, unconditionally regarding it as an  integral part of Ukraine. He understood that proceeding on the  path of economic reforms:     -  Would provide for the Crimeans a real confirmation of the  advantage of Crimea's autonomous status;    -  Would politically  isolate extremist forces in the Crimea of any geopolitical  orientation;    -  Would ease pressure on the Ukrainian president and  Crimea on the part of Ukraine's national-radical forces, which  display very suspicious attitudes toward developments in the  Crimea.    The June 1993 Ukrainian president's decree and the August  1993 protocol on introducing the so-called open economy regime  on the territory of the Crimean Republic were aimed at this very  goal. Based on these documents, worked out was a whole range of  fundamental socioeconomic documents which significantly expanded  Crimean powers within Ukraine. Unfortunately, however, they did  not become an impulse to action, due to their contradictions  with legislation already in force. The Ukrainian Supreme  Council's consideration of the documents concerning the  "Europe-center" free economic zone showed that the idea of  decentralizing economic responsibility would not be supported by  a majority of deputies, who had already joined the election  marathon, in which it would be the most dangerous thing to be  accused of having an inefficient dose of old-fashioned  patriotism.    In this way, Mykola Bahrov ended up in front of his voters  with the collapsing Crimean economy, unimplemented programs for  economic reforms, and in the crossfire of Crimean and Ukrainian  "patriots," who have finally achieved their goals: The former  have obtained a president sharing their political views; the  latter will continue to consider themselves defenders of the  nation, since in the Crimea, power was apparently assumed by an  opponent of Ukrainian statehood and dangerous challenger to  Ukraine's integrity.    It is doubtful that the situation will be changed by the 24  February 1994 Ukrainian Supreme Council resolution which, a year  and a half after the adoption of the Crimean Constitution, dared  to consider a whole range of its provision contradictory to the  Ukrainian Constitution. The same can also be said about an  appeal by Supreme Council deputies to the Ukrainian president  demanding the implementation of the Ukrainian law "On Ukrainian  President's Representation in the Crimean Republic," which was  only voiced several weeks after the adoption of a fundamental  resolution on liquidating the office of presidential  representatives for the issue of holding the following elections  for local authorities and self-governments.    What is next? Apparently, Kiev has been left without any  interlocutor in the political dialogue with the Crimea since  Mykola Bahrov left the political scene. Is this true however?    The Crimea is currently represented by Yuriy Meshkov. It is  interesting that his first visit in this office was to Kiev.  There was nothing new, however, in his proposals: As a matter  of fact, they included an appeal to continue the dialogue on  economic issues, primarily, on implementing the important  agreements which had previously been reached with Mykola Bahrov.    Actually, what can be seen in the actions of the newly  elected president is succession. Although his campaign rhetoric  and slogans still stand due to their inertia, the common wisdom  saying that it is easier to win power than preserve it becomes  more and more evident. In our hard times, it is possible to  preserve power by only taking positive steps toward  stabilization of the economy. One could assume, of course, that  Yuriy Meshkov regards such developments as a coerced, temporary  compromise on the path to real independence for the Crimea.  There is no doubt, however, that there is an objective need to  take into account the economic situation, the improvement of  which obviously depends on Crimea's economic integration with  Ukraine.    Undoubtedly, the social basis supporting Yuriy Meshkov's  most  radical steps will diminish, as changes for the better appear in  the Crimean economy, since the majority of those who voted for  Yuriy Meshkov did so basically because they expected changes for  the better in the socioeconomic sphere.    The invitation of Yevhen Saburov to assume the office of  Crimean deputy prime minister confirms that the Crimean  president is reasonable enough in making the most responsible  decisions. The well-known Russian economist-marketeer, who was  born in Yalta, is probably the optimal candidate for this high  office. He has the image of a man who deals exclusively with  issues of economic transformations, reducing personal political  ambitions to requirements essential for ensuring conditions for  reforms. It would be very appropriate if Yevhen Saburov managed  to carry out his plans in the Crimea, because the peninsula's  positive experience could be used in other regions of Ukraine.    It should be noted that Yevhen Saburov, as early as on the  first day of his appointment by the Crimean Supreme Council,  announced that political stability is needed to accomplish his  mission. He also emphasized that, in his opinion, Ukraine's  borders must remain unviolated. By the way, the new Crimean  deputy prime minister asked the then Ukrainian president to  grant him Ukrainian citizenship.    A poll conducted in the Crimea in March 1994 showed that  Yevhen Saburov's nomination to the office of deputy prime  minister was fully supported by 77 percent of those surveyed,  partially -- by 9.4 percent, and not supported -- only by 3.9  percent, which means that the new deputy prime minister's  ratings are very high.    Gradually, a situation is evolving in which Yevhen Saburov  may become a compromising figure in the dialogue between  representatives of both old and new political elites of the  Crimea, as well as between Simferopol and Kiev. This provides  for all participants in the political process substantial  chances of reaching accord, as well as of saving political face  in the eyes of their supporters.    As everybody knows, on 10 March 1994, Yuriy Meshkov issued  the well-known decree on holding a poll. The following detail  is very interesting. Few people paid attention to the fact that  the main demand included in his political program -- the  annulment of the moratorium on a referendum regarding the fate  of the Crimean Republic -- was replaced with merely a poll in  the form resembling a referendum. Also interesting is that when  the issue of annulling the moratorium was put on the Crimean  Supreme Council agenda, it got stuck in the procedural maze and  was not even discussed, at the quiet consent of Yuriy Meshkov.    For his part, the Ukrainian president reacted quite  operatively to the Crimean president's decree, annulling two out  of three questions that were to be included on the poll, and  which would require rather a consultative referendum, which the  Crimean president does not have the right to approve. However,  there were no objections to the poll (in a limited version),  meaning that the Crimeans can absolutely legitimately put in  force Yuriy Meshkov's decrees which have not yet been regulated  by the legislation of the Crimean Republic. This is what Yevhen  Saburov's team needs most, in terms of organization, to quickly  implement reforms.    The U.S. Department of State has emphasized in this regard  that Ukraine has demonstrated restraint since the new Crimean  president was elected in January, and that the new Crimean  leadership also wants to ease the confrontation, and that it has  hinted that it does not demand that Crimea's status be changed.  In the background remains the question of why were similar  activities by the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast Councils, which  scheduled their own polls, not met by an adequate reaction on  the part of the Ukrainian leadership. This once again shows  that the Crimean problem is becoming a part of a broader  problem, such as mutual relations between the center and the  regions, or the administrative-territorial system of our country.    It is quite possible that if local elections are held in  June  1994 and heads of oblast councils are elected by the people,  Ukraine will obtain 25 "regional presidents" who will wage a  fierce battle to expand their own powers. Taking this into  account, it is currently expedient to concentrate on resolving  the most fundamental issues concerning the state system, as well  as on preserving the initiative with the central authorities.    The situation in the Crimea requires weighed actions on the  part of both Simferopol and Kiev. It is important to understand  that Russia is currently not able to incorporate the Crimea,  either in terms of politics or economics. Unquestionably,  political pressure from Russia is possible. One must take into  account, however, the fact that this would be hampered by the  tripartite declaration of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia  on nuclear weapons and security guarantees for Ukraine, the  Helsinki Act, the negative attitude of many neighboring  countries toward Crimea's secession, and finally Russia's  unstable domestic situation.    The point is not to aggravate relations between Kiev and  Simferopol, just on the contrary, it is to arrange them in a  civilized manner. It is therefore expedient to hold  negotiations with the new Crimean Government, as represented by  Yevhen Saburov, to improve mutual relations between Ukraine and  the Crimea. Working out concepts and programs for an open  economy regime may become a foundation for this.    The options provided by legislation "On Division of Powers  Between the State Authorities of Ukraine and the Crimean  Republic" should be used more efficiently. This requires a new  normative-legal mechanism for regulating the status of the  Crimea, which would eliminate contradictions and consequences of  actions of any state authorities. Such a mechanism could be  defined by a normative document between the state authorities of  Ukraine and the Crimean Republic on dividing subjects of  authority and delegating powers while resolving social,  economic, and property issues. Naturally, foreign policy of the  Crimea must not contradict Ukraine's Constitution or  international commitments. In particular, this actually means  that the Crimean Republic cannot be considered a subject to  international law. It is unquestionable that Ukraine must act  as a guarantor of the rights of all nations and ethnic groups  living in the Crimea, and it must not allow itself to assume a  dominating position toward any of them, developing direct ties  with all civil organizations of deported nations, including the  Majlis of the Crimean Tatar population.    Delaying the resolution of the Black Sea Fleet and  Sevastopol  problem is becoming more and more dangerous. The Massandra  agreements (despite the ambiguous stance of all parities' toward  them) opened a possibility to resolve the problem by means of  negotiations, and they provide a chance to resolve a whole range  of military, property, and financial issues. Kiev's loss of  initiative is leading to an interference of other entities in  this process, and this particularly relates to the Sevastopol  City Council and officers of the Black Sea Fleet, which  apparently only destabilizes the situation surrounding the fleet  and the city.    Ukrainian state authorities must primarily take into account  the fact that, from an economic point of view, Sevastopol cannot  exist as only a part of the Crimean Republic. The city's future  is connected with preserving its status of a city subordinated  to the center, which allows to resolve economic, financial, and  social problems much more efficiently. It would therefore be  expedient to adopt legislation on the status of Sevastopol city  (there are currently two draft laws worked out respectively by a  group of Kiev specialists and the city administration).    The nomination of the Ukrainian president's representative  to  the Crimean Republic was an important step. Currently on the  agenda, in my opinion, should be the drafting of an agreement  between the Sevastopol City Council and Administration on the  one hand, and the Crimean Supreme Council and Government on the  other, which is provided by Article 7 (Paragraph 3, Part 2) of  the Crimean Constitution. This would allow to conclude the  establishment of the judicial triangle: Kiev -- Simferopol --  Sevastopol, and its strength would guarantee, to a considerable  degree, an optimal resolution of any possible problems.    Ukraine and the Crimea have yet to encounter serious  challenges in the economic, political, and social spheres. The  latest developments on the peninsula have shown that there is no  other way to untangle taut knots than through dialogue and  negotiations. Only common sense, political responsibility for  the lives of millions of people, understanding of current  realities, and good will in suppressing personal passions and  needless ambitions are a trustworthy beacon for all who are  involved in problems of the Crimea and sovereign Ukraine as a  whole.</p>

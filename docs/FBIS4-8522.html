			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (TANJUG) -- Following a Gorazde  attack, NATO had already made plans to attack Bosnian Serb  command posts, bridges on the Drina (eastern Bosnia), supply  routes and even Pale, the administrative centre of the Bosnian  Serb republic (S.R.), said Obrad Kesic, an expert on Balkan  policy, who is close to Washington circles.    Speaking for the Belgrade evening paper VECERNJE NOVOSTI on  Wednesday, Kesic said that a very powerful group of anti-Serb  inclined Washington officials, having realized that Washington's  peace initiative for Bosnia-Herzegovina had collapsed and  fearing the reaction of the public opinion and media, were  plotting to continue the aggression against the Bosnian Serbs.    He said that the group, which had already made plans of  attacks on Bosnian Serbs, was headed by Anthony Lake, President  Clinton's national security advisor, and added that it was  especially influenced by Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador  to the United Nations.    Kesic said that the world power wielders had gone so far now  that they had to launch airstrikes to prove their effectiveness.  They were now, however, trying to find a way out of the  horrible situation they had created themselves, knowing that if  they backed up now the media would tear them apart. Kesic said  that a continued aggression against the Serbs was very likely,  which is supported by the fact that plans to that effect had  already been made.    The bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde is  a  hot issue in Washington because the U.S. public initially backs  U.S. military actions, but as soon as problems arise, it turns  to fierce criticisms, Kesic said in conclusion.    U.N.-sponsored American warplanes within 24 hours (on Sunday  and Monday) launched two air raids on Bosnian Serb positions  around Gorazde (a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia), just as the  Serb forces were about to crush a Moslem offensive, launched  from Gorazde, a U.N.-designated "safe area", which should have  been demilitarized back in 1993.    The anti-Serb lobby in Washington is preparing fresh attacks  on the Bosnian Serb republic because it has realized that, after  the failure of the U.S. peace initiative, Russia would become  more engaged in helping settle the Yugoslav crisis and Europe  would urge that the peace initiative for the former Yugoslavia  be returned to Geneva.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Balladur plans review of white-collar crime probes Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has begun a review of the legal process for investigating white-collar crime following the recent wave of probes into prominent industrialists. The premier, speaking on television yesterday, said the recent spate of highly-publicised investigations had been 'no good for democracy, for the economy or for the companies themselves'. He did not envisage launching an Italian-style 'clean hands' operation but said he was anxious to ensure that the legal system was working efficiently. Last week, a French magistrate opened an investigation into Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of the Saint-Gobain glass group, as part of a probe into alleged illicit political funding, and a Brussels judge issued an international warrant for the arrest of Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of the Schneider electrical engineering company. At least another 100 heads of businesses are currently under investigation. A poll published last week in Le Monde found that two-thirds of company chairmen believed corruption was rife in the corporate sector. Mr Balladur said last night that he believed 'none should be above the law'. However, the government is understood to be concerned about the impact of the investigations into confidence in the companies and their share prices. Mr Francois Ceyrac, former chairman of the Patronnat, the employer's association, and Mr Andre Bergeron, former director of the Force Ouvriere trade union, will conduct the review. The prime minister also announced that he plans next month to launch a new series of initiatives to help young people following the completion of a government survey of French youth triggered by this winter's youth riots. He said he was also considering proposals to tackle long-term unemployment. These initiatives come at a time when Mr Balladur is gaining ground in the opinion polls in the run-up to next spring's presidential elections. He topped a poll in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche as the most popular presidential choice with 19 per cent of the votes, ahead of Mr Jacques Delors, the leading left-wing contender, with 17 per cent. Mr Jacques Chirac, the prime minister's rival for the centre-right ticket, scored 13 per cent. Mr Balladur's popularity has been boosted by the withdrawal from public life of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the socialist president, following prostate surgery earlier this summer. The prime minister has since been able to adopt a presidential role, notably in foreign affairs. However, Mr Mitterrand last week criticised Mr Balladur for trying to usurp him. The president, dogged by controversy over a book revealing his youthful links with Nazi collaborators, is this evening expected to try to reassert his authority when interviewed on television.</p>

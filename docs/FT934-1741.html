			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Major lauds 'whole host of improvements' The prime minister yesterday set the scene for better political fortunes by outlining prospects for a sharp improvement in the British economy. Mr John Major told MPs his government had recently pulled off a string of successes that would put British industry in a strong position in the new year. He said: 'The government has got interest rates at the lowest level for 20 years, unemployment falling while it is rising everywhere else in Europe, growth faster than in any other country in Europe, a Gatt deal for industry, retail sales up and a whole host of other improvements.' Mr Major said that the Gatt agreement could add up to 4 per cent to Britain's national output, generating 400,000 extra jobs in the next decade. Mr John Smith, opposition leader, pressed home Labour's claim that the government misled voters at the last general election by promising not to increase taxes. But Mr Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, repeatedly dismissed the attack. Mr Clarke gave one of the most optimistic assessments since he became chancellor, suggesting that unemployment could fall 'month after month after month' because of the tax and spending decisions outlined in his recent Budget. He said: 'It is the first time since 1960 that inflation has been below 2 per cent for consecutive months in the year.' On trade, however, Mr Clarke warned that rising demand in Britain meant that there were greater opportunities for European countries to sell goods to the UK. 'But otherwise,' he said, 'I think our trade figures are extremely good.' Meanwhile, a Mori poll published in The Times today shows that the November 30 Budget was the most unpopular since the mid-1970s, apart from Mr Norman Lamont's final Budget last March. Mori interviewed 1,738 adults last weekend. Order books in manufacturing have improved but expectations about output have slipped, says a Confederation of British Industry survey published today. Export orders are still ranked below normal by a third of companies, but are still at their highest level for six months. Inflationary pressures continue to be extremely weak, with more manufacturers expecting to cut domestic prices in the next four months than to raise them. The results from the CBI's latest poll of manufacturers indicate that output should continue its recent slow and patchy rise in the next few months. The survey covered 1,383 companies across 50 industries. It was conducted between November 26 and December 14, with most of the replies coming after the Budget. Overall orders covering both the UK and export markets were ranked below normal by 37 per cent of companies, with 18 per cent saying they were above normal. The 19 percentage point difference establishes an improving trend compared with the corresponding negative balances of 23 points and 31 points in the CBI's November and October surveys.</p>

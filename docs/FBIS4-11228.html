			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Cripton" newscast] </F>   [Text] Indignation is growing in our country in the face of  statements by drug trafficker Gabriel Taboada to a U.S.  congressional commission meeting summoned by Democratic  politician John Kerry. Taboada said every area of Colombian life  has been infiltrated by drug trafficking. Let us hear some  reactions:    [Begin recording] [General Hernan Guzman, Army commander, in  progress] ...our country, and thus, completely loses the  outlook of his country. Therefore, to think that this has....  [pauses] it is inappropriate to give a certain credence to the  statements of this individual.    [Gen. Octavio Vargas, National Police director] It is unfair  to attack the dignity of people who are working courageously,  honestly, and morally.    [Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, presidential candidate] It is  urgent to clarify this to stop the stigmatization of Colombia  and avert unpredictable consequences.    [Unidentified reporter] Is this an affront to the country,  Mr. President?    [President Cesar Gaviria] Yes, we have publicly stated, and  in a very detailed manner, Colombia's position on this issue.  We have demanded a sensible stand from the U.S. Government and  the American people toward the efforts that our nation has made.    [Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana, in progress] ...and  know about money used in political campaigns in Colombia, must  denounce it.    [Vice Presidential candidate Humberto de la Calle] This is  not a narco-democracy; Rodrigo Lara, Luis Carlos Galan, Carlos  Mauro Hoyos, Guillermo Cano, journalists, and magistrates died  here. We are fighting drug trafficking here; we must reject  such claims that are unfair and constitute an insult to Colombia.    [Presidential candidate Enrique Parejo] The government must  demand the evidence from the United States that serves as the  basis for the offensive that you talked about, or the testimony  of Senator Kerry, or the testimony of this drug trafficker.    [Presidential candidate Ernesto Samper] He must demonstrate  that. I think that one cannot toss accusations into the air.  There must be proof and certainty. The world must understand  that we are not the drug traffickers but the main victims of  trafficking. I was one of them. [end recording]</p>

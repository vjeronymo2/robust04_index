			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Carter starts peace mission Former US president Jimmy Carter yesterday began his peace mission to Bosnia to try to break the diplomatic deadlock among the warring parties. As his visit got under way, defeated Bosnian-government troops were withdrawing from Velika Kladusa, a strategic town in the north-western Bihac pocket which fell to Serb and renegade Moslem forces. After meeting President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, and UN officials, in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Mr Carter left for Sarajevo amid tight security. Earlier yesterday four rocket-propelled grenades exploded near a UN anti-sniping team in the city centre, slightly wounding a peacekeeper and a civilian. Today Mr Carter is to meet Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, in Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold above Sarajevo.</p>

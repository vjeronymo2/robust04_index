			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Taxes on a gift house MY PARENTS and I jointly own, in equal shares, two properties neither of which we live in. If we each make a gift of our respective halves to each other, thus having a house each, solely owned, will we be liable for any capital gains tax there may be on the value of the half-interest transferred? Would the tax on such gains have to be paid as soon as possible after the gifts had been made? You will be taxed as though you had disposed of your respective interests at their current market value. Since you will be exchanging interest of (presumably) more or less equal value, there will be no element of gift in fact. That being so, the CGT will be payable on December after the end of the tax year in which the exchange takes place. So the middle of next April might be suitable time to do the swap. The timing depends upon your other chargeable gains for 1992-93 and 1993-94 and the size of the potential chargeable gain arising from the exchange. The solicitor who prepares the conveyance for you will be able to help you with the tax implications. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

But  the meeting between Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev,  Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Border Troops, and Azerbaijani  President Geydar Aliyev introduced some new nuances.    When we were driving into Kaspiysk I read the following  slogan in a prominent place: "The friendship of the USSR's  peoples is inviolable!" And nearby, in a tourist center, the  41st Makhachkala Border Detachment was settling in.    That's a sign of the times, G. Gereykhanov, the detachment's  Acting Deputy Commander, sighed; we used to guard the border  with Turkey and Iran in Nakhichevan, but the local branch of the  Azerbaijani People's Front [APF] made our job intolerable.  Bloodshed was just a step away -- officers were barely able to  restrain their subordinates in the face of the constant threats  and insults directed at them. In October 1992 the detachment  was withdrawn from there, but without hardware and ammunition,  with just its uniforms. The APF members did not even allow the  Border Troops to conduct a military ritual, that is, leave with  a color platoon. "Take your flag and beat it," they were told.  Now the border with Turkey and Iran is virtually open here.    Nor did other regions treat the Russian Border Troops with  excessive consideration during the sovereignty bandwagon. Last  February a border detachment was withdrawn from Lenkoran to  Vladikavkaz. Again with just their passports, you know. But  let us go back to the Makhachkala detachment. There is no  heating at the tourist center and it is damp. The local  population gave the strangers in green a cool reception. That  may be why there is still less than half the full complement of  officers here. The Lezgins' "Sadval" national-patriotic  movement is campaigning to set up an independent state of  Lezgistan in the area of Dagestan where they have compact  communities and opposes the erection of internal borders between  Russia and Azerbaijan. Recently a sentry was killed right at  his post in the detachment. I saw from conversations with the  Border Troops that they are impatient for a final political  decision from Moscow on whether there should or should not be an  internal border. However, that decision cannot be adopted  without the sides' mutual participation.    Col-Gen Andrey Nikolayev, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian  Federation Border Troops, met with Azerbaijani President Geydar  Aliyev in Baku on 3 January. He spoke briefly about the results  of the meeting:    "For two years there had been no serious contacts with the  Azerbaijani leadership on border issues. Today the other side  takes an understanding view of these issues and agrees to  consider our proposals. I think that we will reach  agreement...."    And agreement is needed. The external border with Turkey and  Iran is guarded worse now that it was under the Russian Border  Troops owing to poor technical equipment and inadequate cadre  training. The upshot is that drugs, contraband, and weapons are  being smuggled across the border. If you consider that Turks  can enter this friendly republic without visas and then "pass"  into Russia, there is no option but to put up a barrier. But  who benefits from this?    Today Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev enjoys great prestige  among his own people. He is above all respected for his  commonsense approach to politics. The state's entry into the  CIS is evidence of that.    He is also respected for his firmness. When mass desertion  from the army began, it is said that the shooting of two  deserters and a promise not to punish those who voluntarily  returned to their troop units made people see sense -- lines  formed up outside military commissariats to return to bases.    People in the Republic are now saying that the two power  ministries -- the Defense Ministry and the National Security  Committee [NSC] -- are opposing Aliyev. It is said that the  President is not that young and it is time to share power. And  a struggle for power has developed between the Defense Ministry  and the NSC. Their methods include the following: They claim  that the introduction of Russian Border troops on the external  border marks a threat to Azerbaijan's sovereignty. The card of  the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is also played.    During conversations with ordinary Baku people I often heard  the following: There is nothing for us to share with Armenia,  no one wants the the war (the surprising thing is that  Azerbaijan and Armenia have not declared war on one another and  are members of the CIS and the Commonwealth collective security  system), it is those people who are fighting for power who want  it. And one young Azerbaijani officer accompanying us admitted  frankly that he is still meeting an Armenian girl living in Baku.    What about the Russian Border Troops? Should they be in  Azerbaijan? If so, what kind of presence should it be? Only  time will provide the answers to these questions. But in our  view, the role of the Border Troops has sharply increased since  the Russian Ministry of Security was abolished. Along with  guarding borders, the Russian Federal Border Service has begun  implementing Russia's foreign policy in nearby foreign countries.    "Russia is the place to which integration forces are looking  today," Andrey Nikolayev told your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  correspondent.    "You might say that the turning point was last September,  when the CIS economic union was formed. We want to strengthen  the Commonwealth of Independent States -- states with equal  rights and duties. By closing external borders, the Border  troops are helping to open up internal borders for the  development of economic ties within the CIS."    Asked what the Russian Federation will spend on guarding  external CIS borders, A. Nikolayev replied:    "In Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan Russian  Border Troops operate in conjunction with these states' subunits  under the combined command of the Russian Federation Border  Troops. Expenditure is split equally. In Turkmenistan  expenditure will depend on the extent to which Russian Border  Troops participate in guarding the border. We will cooperate  with Kazakhstan and Belarus in providing troops with technical  equipment and training cadres. The Russian Federation's national  interests will not be infringed. We espouse the idea that there  are CIS external borders which must be guarded together.    "We must move on from a system of mutual rights to a system  of mutual obligations."</p>

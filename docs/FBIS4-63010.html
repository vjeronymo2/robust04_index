			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy (and former Finance Minister) </F> Boris Fedorov: "Economy in Wake of Accord Treaty"]    [Text] The recent signing of the Accord Treaty, in which  many political groups did not participate for different reasons,  while others cast doubts on its effectiveness, has prompted some  sad thoughts about the fate of economic reform.    The actual signing confirmed yet again that there was never  any confrontation in Russia between reformers and antireformers,  as was often suggested to the uninitiated. The struggle for  power does not always mean the same thing as the struggle for  reform.    If we think about it, economic reform in the USSR and Russia  in recent years came about more in spite of rather than thanks  to the ruling groups. Specific economic interests have to be  sought for everything, and real reforms always lead to a loss of  administrative power for nomenklaturas of any stripe.    The economic reforms in Russia today have run ahead of  society's political maturity, which at a certain phase  inevitably leads to equilibrium being restored through a serious  crisis. It is no accident that the "Chinese experience" is so  popular in certain circles -- everyone thinks of its economic  side, when what they really mean is the political side.    Meanwhile Russian statehood is under deadly threat from the  crisis of central power, the destructive activity of a number of  regional elites, and the criminalization of society. And the  interests of our statehood are being sacrificed for the sake of  the struggle for an increasingly ephemeral power. All this  inevitably leads to the appearance of phenomena such as V.  Zhirinovskiy.    Another factor in instability is the damage being done to  the  democratic movement in Russia in the broad sense of the word.  Every second person is a presidential contender, and the rest  are geniuses. The evolution of political and economic views on  the part of a number of leading democratic politicians is  striking, and there is no limit to their personal ambition.    Is there any real possibility of some kind of peace? In my  view, we must agree with G. Yavlinskiy: If illegal or simply  violent methods are used, then this is a matter for the  law-enforcement organs. If these are legitimate measures in the  political struggle, then no accords will help. Political  opponents are hardly likely to give up the struggle for power.    What are the prospects for economic reform in this context?  To my mind, signing or failure to sign will not affect the  reforms, since the treaty's provisions are vague in the extreme  and are not aimed at accelerating reform. Equally, it is time  we recognized that reforms are never carried out anywhere with  the consent of all and sundry. That is a fairytale. Somebody  has to take responsibility.    This responsibility lies primarily with the executive and  the  president. Parliament, with its current factionalism and the  executive's attitude toward it, is incapable of making the  breakthrough.    The loyalty shown by flexible ministers is rewarded by  awarding them extraordinary vice premier titles; for signing the  treaty some (like Travkin) have received ministerial portfolios,  while others have obtained trillions under a "clarified" budget.  Where is the reform in that?    Nonetheless, I remain convinced that this time too it is  worth voting for the budget along with the happy Agrarians and  Communists, but without the Gaydar Democrats. But for a  different and simpler reason.    Yes, the budget is bad and absolutely unrealistic. Yes, the  actual deficit will be nearer 50 percent of budget expenditure  than 36 percent.    But this budget is at least not the disaster which sectoral  lobbyists were ready to organize at any minute. It would be  hard to expect anything better from the current government. We  will probably have a new wave of inflation in three months'  time, but, I trust, it will not be an explosion.    But the most important thing is that the government's hands  are bound by legislative fetters and it will be very easy to  verify its fulfillment of its obligations. Any expenditure  decision over and above the budget will be illegal. The  government itself, if it wants to retain its freedom of action,  will find it advantageous to reject the budget. It will now be  impossible for agrarian and other lobbyists to demand any  further increase in appropriations.    God willing, what has been submitted will be fulfilled. In a  few months' time everything will be clear, and it will be  possible to pass a verdict of confidence or no-confidence in the  government.</p>

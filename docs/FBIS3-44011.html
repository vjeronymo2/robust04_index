Analysts  say the talks may face some difficulties, because rumors are  going around that UNITA intends to derail the negotiation  process. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in the Zambian capital,  is on the telephone to give us more details:    [Begin Ligio recording] It is three days now since  Mulungushi  Conference Hall has seen any activity in connection with the  Angolan peace process. UN Special Representative Alioune  Blondin Beye closed the hall's doors and left for Luanda on yet  another charity mission. However, his absence has not meant  that the government and UNITA teams have been idle. Instead,  they have been working at finding consensus concerning the  operation of the future National Police. To keep the talks  going, before leaving, the UN special representative handed over  to the negotiators the theoretical formulas that are contained  in a document regarded as the final draft in a bid to reduce the  gap between the two sides.    Without meetings and without Blondin Beye constantly  summoning them, the two sides now have more time to learn about  the general situation (?in Angola), where the specter of war  continues to loom large. Within this context, reports have been  reaching Lusaka about certain developments on the battlefield.  The effect of those reports has been to undermine the optimism  that had marked these talks at one stage.    It is known that the UNITA leader has called an emergency  meeting of the UNITA Political Commission. That meeting began  on 21 January and it is not being attended by any of the  officials in the team to the Lusaka peace talks. (?He) has also  issued a communique in which Cubans and Russians are accused of  holding talks with the Angolan Government concerning a return of  Cuban military forces to Angola. That communique adds that UNITA  will not make any concessions in connection with the Riot Police  issue. Such developments are in clear contrast with what a  reliable source in the Black Cockerel movement has said: He  asked journalists here in Lusaka not to mix the country's  internal developments with developments at the talks. According  to that source, the main obstacles concerning the specific  principles that will govern the future National Police have been  overcome and the next 24 working hours could see an end to the  existing deadlock over the percentages of men from both sides  that will join the Riot Police. Should this be true, it will  signal the end of discussions relating to point one in the  second round of the Lusaka peace talks.    The UNITA communique came as no surprise to the Angolan  Government team, whose officials believe that UNITA constantly  resorts to such ploys when discussions concerning a point on the  agenda are drawing to a close, particularly if the mediator is  absent.    When asked whether the talks might break down as a result of  these new developments, officials on both sides said they did  not believe that would happen. Nevertheless, UN Special  Representative Blondin Beye will have to work very hard to  restore optimism to the talks, when he comes back. [end  recording]</p>

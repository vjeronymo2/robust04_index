			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors Wednesday indicted three more people on drug-related  charges stemming from an undercover drug buy that went awry and led to a  shoot-out with federal agents last October in Pacific Beach.  </P> <P> Named in the new indictment were Stephen G. Kiba, 32; his wife, Kathleeen  Robecca Kiba, 25, and Leroy Turner, 31, all of San Diego, federal prosecutors  said.  </P> <P> Richard David Gold, 32, of San Diego, was indicted last November on charges of  attempted murder and five other counts. Two others -- Michael J. Clapp, 31, and  William B. Chambers, 30, both of San Diego -- were also indicted last November,  each on two drug-related charges.  </P> <P> The investigation that led to the indictment of all six was triggered last Oct.  30, when Gold allegedly offered to sell 4 pounds of methamphetamine for $30,000  to an undercover agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration in a Pacific  Beach parking lot.  </P> <P> When agents moved in to arrest Gold, he tried to flee in a car and shot at a  DEA agent, who shot back, shattering a window whose shards wounded Gold,  according to Assistant U.S. Atty. D. Thomas Ferraro.  </P> <P> An investigation of the shooting led to Clapp and Chambers, then to the Kibas  and Turner, Ferraro said. The most recent indictment includes a variety of  charges. All six are charged with conspiracy to make and possess  methamphetamine, Ferraro said.  </P></p>

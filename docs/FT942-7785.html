			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bulgaria - the worst starting point Sir, Your article on Bulgaria ('Bulgarian capitalism boosts ex-communists', May 10) states that it is difficult to come across dynamic professional Bulgarians without a communist background. This is hardly surprising in a country that had more than 1m communist party members only a few years ago. It is also true that foreigners regard the Bulgarian commercial environment as hostile and the local business community as unreliable. The two business 'scams' you have described, however, are hardly particular to Bulgaria. 'Overcharging and buying cheaply from state companies' is a worldwide phenomenon and one of the strongest arguments for privatisation, while minimising tax exposure in a country with an underdeveloped tax regime is obviously easier than in the west, where it is called tax optimisation and is the speciality of an army of consultants. Your story would have gained in credibility if the name of the principal protagonist had not been mistakenly given as Ivan, not Ilya. This is rather like a Bulgarian daily publishing an article on 'Tony' Rowland. The disappearance of most foreign markets, the large foreign debt and the unfavourable (both in terms of access and resources) geographical position are significantly more important and explain much better the difficulties of privatisation and the low level of foreign investment. John Wilton, head of the World Bank mission in Sofia, calls this the worst starting point of all the countries in eastern Europe. Martin Zaimov, 20 av des Ternes, 75017 Paris, France</p>

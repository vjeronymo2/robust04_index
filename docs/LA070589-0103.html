			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO JURISDICTION RULING IN ROSE CASE TILL JULY 17  </P> <P> A federal judge today said he will not decide until at least July 17 whether to  move Pete Rose's lawsuit against baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti  from state to federal court.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge John D. Holschuh met with lawyers for both sides this  afternoon and set a timetable for deciding jurisdiction for the lawsuit that  will delay a decision for nearly two more weeks.  </P> <P> Holschuh gave baseball's lawyers until July 12 to file papers arguing that the  case should be taken from Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel.  Rose's lawyers will then have until July 17 to file their response.  </P> <P> Holschuh's ruling means that a hearing for a preliminary injunction scheduled  by Nadel for Thursday in Cincinnati cannot be held.  </P> <P> Nadel has granted Rose a temporary restraining order that prevents Giamatti  from deciding the Cincinnati Reds manager's fate. The order protects Rose from  suspension or firing, and those protections will remain in effect while  Holschuh considers the jurisdictional question.  </P> <P> Rose wants to keep his lawsuit in the state court in Cincinnati. But baseball  argues that it should be moved to the federal court.  </P> <P> The question of which court gets to handle Rose's lawsuit could be pivotal in  deciding the outcome. Federal courts have repeatedly upheld the sweeping powers  of the baseball commissioner, while Nadel has shown a willingness to go into  what he described as "uncharted waters" in handling the lawsuit.  </P> <P> "Federal courts are much more aware of the needs of baseball and much more  willing to accept the authority of baseball and the commissioner," baseball  lawyer Louis Hoynes Jr. said.  </P> <P> Rose's lawyers had expected baseball to try to change the courtroom in which  the lawsuit will be heard. They argue that the matter belongs in the state  courts.  </P> <P> "Federal court has no jurisdiction over this case," Robert Stachler, one of  Rose's lawyers, said.  </P></p>

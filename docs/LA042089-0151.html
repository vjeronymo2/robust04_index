			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEA VIEW LEAGUE;  </P> <P> ESTANCIA HAS TUSTIN'S NUMBER, 1-0  </P> <P> According to Gary Burrows, the No. 9 hitter in Estancia High School's batting  order, there's really no secret to hitting Tustin's ace pitcher, Monte Jones.  </P> <P> "He throws the ball with an even rotation," Burrows said. "I like hitting  against him because you can see the pitch right off his hand."  </P> <P> Burrows showed just how to hit Jones in the bottom of the seventh inning on  Wednesday, lining a one-out single that scored teammate Mark Hartley to give  Estancia a 1-0 victory in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The victory moved Estancia (13-5, 6-2) into a first-place tie with Tustin  (11-7, 6-2) in the Sea View League and avenged an earlier 1-0 loss to Jones  &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Estancia's Gabe Javage (6-1) allowed five hits and gave up only a intentional  walk. Jones (6-1), the county's strikeout leader, walked five and struck out  seven.  </P> <P> Jones had allowed only two hits entering the seventh when Hartley reached on an  error by Tustin second baseman Chris Varvarinecz with one out. Hartley stole  second and then moved to third on a wild pitch by Jones.  </P> <P> Burrows worked Jones to a 3-2 count and then lined a fastball to the gap in  left-center field that easily scored Hartley for the winning run. Burrows had  two of Estancia's three hits, matching his output the last time he faced Jones.  </P> <P> "I like hitting against him. . . . I like hitting against Tustin," Burrows  said. "He threw me a fastball right down the middle. I guess he didn't want to  walk me and load the bases."  </P> <P> Vince Brown, Tustin's coach, said he called for a fastball, admitting he didn't  want to walk Estancia's No. 9 hitter to load the bases with the leadoff hitter  coming to the plate.  </P> <P> "I was hoping to get him out with a fastball," Brown said. "Monte struggled  today. I think we was pressing and trying to be too fine. You just saw two  teams who wanted to get the win real badly."  </P> <P> Tustin blew its best scoring opportunity in the top of the seventh. First  baseman Erik Grove led off the inning with a base hit and was replaced by pinch  runner Kevin Jurkowski.  </P> <P> Jurkowski moved to second on a sacrifice and then went to third on a passed  ball. But Jurkowski was left stranded at third when Varvarinecz struck out and  teammate Bill Filbert grounded out on a fine play by Estancia shortstop Jason  White.  </P> <P> In another Sea View League game:  </P> <P> Saddleback 6, University 3 -- Mike Arroyos (4-3) pitched six innings and Frank  Fonseca worked the final inning for the save for host Saddleback (5-3, 9-8).  J.J. Fejeran had three hits and scored two runs, and Jeff Blanco had two hits  and four RBIs including a three-run double in the sixth, for Saddleback.  </P></p>

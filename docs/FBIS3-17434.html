He said that in  1991, during the existence of the Soviet Union, executives at  all levels had numbered 715,000, while now there were 921,000  state employees in the Russian Federation. There were 350,000  bureaucrats in the district administrative team alone. Viktor  Chernomyrdin criticized the Ministry of Finance which had  complied with requests from the regions to finance the bloated  adminstrative bodies.</p>

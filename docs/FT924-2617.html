			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Compass makes Pounds 35m despite recession THE COMPASS Group increased pre-tax profits by 9 per cent in spite of the effect of recession on both its healthcare and contract catering businesses. The group, which failed to buy rival Gardner Merchant from Forte in the summer, also signalled that it had its hands full attacking the UK catering market and would only consider a move into Europe in the medium term. Pre-tax profits in the year to September 27 1992 rose from Pounds 32m to Pounds 34.9m on sales up 7 per cent, from Pounds 321m to Pounds 345m. Earnings per share rose 9 per cent to 34.7p (31.9p) and the total dividend is increased to 12.3p (11.4p) via a final of 8.11p. A net Pounds 2.3m extraordinary charge covered the costs of the failed purchase of Gardner Merchant. Debt was reduced by Pounds 3.1m during the period from cash flow, but has since risen to Pounds 72m as a result of the acquisitions of Travellers Fare and Letherby and Christopher, the events catering business. Operating profits from the contract catering business rose 4.5 per cent to Pounds 27.6m. Margins slipped from 10.1 per cent to 9.7 per cent, partly because larger contracts were secured at lower margins. New business helped sales increase by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 285.8m, in spite of the higher number of business failures which meant there were fewer people on site. The Healthcare division increased margins to 21.5 per cent and operating profits to Pounds 12.3m, in spite of a low occupancy rate and reduced demand from self-pay or 'uninsured' patients. Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said the National Health Service reforms continued to move the market in Compass's direction and provided significant opportunities. He also laid out a strategy to focus the company's attack on the Pounds 6bn UK catering market. The business is being split into seven discreet marketing operations. These will cover workplaces, educational establishments, prestige sites, boardrooms, travel outlets, shops and hospital catering. COMMENT July's failure to secure the purchase of Gardner Merchant cost the company kudos as much as the Pounds 3.1m of lawyers and advisers' fees. Yesterday's results suggest the group may be leaving that substantially behind. Operationally, its success in moving profits ahead, in spite of tough markets, is impressive. What is more, the company's confirmation that Europe is again on the back burner, and with it any threat of an imminent rights issue, should encourage nervous shareholders. Interest cover remains high, even though gearing is starting to take on a 1980s look, but this has much to do with the small size of the balance sheet. Even though Compass has had a good run, a pre-tax forecast of Pounds 37.5m, giving earnings of 37.2p, means an undemanding prospective multiple of 13.3, cheap relative to the market and even cheaper against comparable companies.</p>

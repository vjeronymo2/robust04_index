			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Tofas public offer withdrawn The Turkish government has cancelled plans for a Dollars 550m public offer on the New York Stock Exchange of its 21 per cent shareholding in Tofas, Turkey's largest carmaker. It has done so after objections from Fiat which owns 42 per cent of Tofas. The Italian motor group is understood to have opposed the full SEC listing on legal and disclosure grounds. Turkish officials confirmed that Shearson Lehman Bros and J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the banks mandated to sell the government's shares, were preparing a more restricted private placement with US institutional investors. The Public Participation Administration, the government agency handling state asset sales, is due to meet the company in Istanbul today. It hopes to conclude the Tofas share sale by the end of March. Koc Holding, Turkey's largest industrial conglomerate, holds 34 per cent of Tofas. Tofas would have been the first full registration of Turkish stock with the SEC. Bankers say Fiat was concerned that the offering could expose the company to potentially costly legal disputes with individual shareholders. Brokers point out that by restricting the sale to big institutions, Fiat will be in a better position if at some future date it decides to seek majority control of Tofas. The decision is a setback for the PPA, at a time when it is trying to revive the government privatisation effort. A World Bank team is due back in Ankara on Monday to conclude negotiations on a Dollars 30m loan to support privatisation. The government is poised to award a mandate to implement the sale of Tupras, the state refineries concern and Petrol Ofisi, the petrol retail arm. The government is planning to sell its 18 per cent stake in Tofas Otomobil Ticaret, the retailer.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFEREES AGREE TO BAN FUNDING FOR 'OBSCENE' ART  </P> <P> Senate and House negotiators agreed Friday on a compromise that would prohibit  federal funding of "obscene" art but would reject a much broader ban covering  works deemed "indecent" or "denigrating."  </P> <P> Leaders were uncertain whether the full membership of the House and the Senate  would accept the proposal, which scaled down substantially a Senate-passed ban  sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).  </P> <P> Some thought that the compromise might go through next week, while others said  they expect further controversy over the issue.  </P> <P> The new plan emerged hours after the Senate had dealt a pair of resounding  setbacks to Helms, a maverick whose disruptive tactics have annoyed many  colleagues, although gaining him a wide following among ultraconservatives.  </P> <P> Helms, riding a wave of grass-roots protests against funding of works by Robert  Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano, had won Senate adoption two months ago of an  amendment placing broad restrictions on arts funding by the National Endowment  for the Arts.  </P> <P> The amendment would have blocked spending for "obscene or indecent" materials  depicting sexual activity or the exploitation of children, materials that  "denigrate" a particular religion or nonreligion and material that "denigrates,  debases or reviles" persons on the basis of race, creed, sex, handicap, age or  national origin.  </P> <P> But early Friday, the Senate rejected, 62 to 35, Helms' attempt to pressure  Senate negotiators to back the amendment.  </P> <P> When Helms sought later to pare the ban to cover "obscene" or "indecent" works,  the Senate voted, 65 to 31, to embrace a substitute offered by Sens. Wyche  Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.) and Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.) that would prohibit funding  only of "obscene" art.  </P> <P> Helms complained that dropping the word "indecent" would leave "a loophole to  people who want to continue to abuse" the use of tax dollars. Fowler countered  that "indecent" was unconstitutionally vague and that his language adhered to a  U.S. Supreme Court decision banning obscenity.  </P> <P> Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, said in interviews that they reversed  field and scaled down the original Helms amendment for several reasons:  </P> <P>  -- An unusually informative and well-attended debate persuaded them that the  comprehensive ban went too far in restricting citizens' First Amendment rights  to free speech.  </P> <P>  -- Helms' middle-of-the-night attempt to pressure Senate conferees was an  insulting challenge to their judgment.  </P> <P>  -- It was an irresistible opportunity to take a swipe at Helms, whose national  political organization has used many Senate votes on moral and patriotic issues  as ammunition in election campaigns.  </P> <P> At the same time, some senators who voted to throw out the entire Helms  amendment acknowledged that they had felt politically obliged to vote later for  the Fowler-Rudman ban on "obscene" art. That way, they hoped to be able to  please a wide range of voters back home -- supporting free speech on the one  hand while opposing pornography on the other.  </P> <P> Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) was scornful of the Fowler-Rudman plan, which he  voted against as too limited. "It was supposed to provide some political cover  for people who voted no (on the Helms amendment), lest they be accused of  promoting obscenity and sexual exploitation of children in the guise of art."  </P> <P> Asked if he agreed with that assessment, Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who  supported Fowler-Rudman as an alternative to Helms, smiled and said: "Yes."  </P> <P> Fowler said the debate Friday, which included attacks on the Helms amendment by  Republican moderates John C. Danforth of Missouri, Slade Gorton of Washington  and Rudman, "really showed that an attempt to ban depictions offensive to a  religion or non-religion were not only constitutionally vague but could have  unintended consequences. It could have affected books on Judaism offensive to  Christians and vice versa."  </P> <P> Moreover, he contended, Helms' proposed ban on "denigrating" materials based on  gender "knocks out all literature. Not a book has been written that is not  offensive to somebody."  </P> <P> A Democratic senator who asked not to be identified said that "we really rolled  Jesse. I didn't think we would have the courage to say no to him, but we just  got tired of these votes that are designed for TV spots and campaign  materials."  </P> <P> A Republican senator who also requested anonymity said: "This had to do with  Jesse's style and history of mischief. If somebody else had proposed the broad  ban, there would have been a very different result."  </P> <P> Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) said he and others voted to cut back the Helms  ban because parts of it were "too vague to be enforced. They would create a  great deal of controversy and many court challenges. Obscenity is clearly  defined (by the Supreme Court) as being outside of community standards."  </P> <P> Sen. Terry Sanford (D-N.C.) said Helms had been defeated in part because his  effort to pressure conferees "went against the Senate's long-standing procedure  of having confidence in its conferees. You've got to give them freedom."  </P> <P> Besides narrowing the ban, the conference agreement chastised the NEA for  funding the Mapplethorpe and Serrano works. It also called for a commission to  study how federal arts aid is distributed and whether new standards should be  set for works to qualify for government funds.  </P> <P> A series of photographs by Mapplethorpe depicted homoerotic and sadomasochistic  acts. A photo by Serrano depicted a crucifix in a bottle of urine.  </P> <P> Anne C. Murphy, lobbying against a funding ban on behalf of writers and  artists, said that her American Arts Alliance reluctantly supported the  compromise. It is not what she wanted, she said, "but my name is not Dorothy  and I'm not in Oz. I have to deal with the reality of all these worlds."  </P> <P> In a related development, the Senate confirmed on a unanimous voice vote the  nomination of Portland, Ore., attorney John E. Frohnmayer as new chairman of  the National Endowment of the Arts. Frohnmayer, who is expected to take over  his new duties within the next two weeks, will be in Washington on Tuesday for  a White House lunch with President Bush.  </P></p>

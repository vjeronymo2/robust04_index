			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Allure of dollar and D-Mark underlined ATTENTION fell on the performance of the UK government's Dollars 3bn Eurobond yesterday. The 10-year issue continued to trade at its launch spread of 22 basis points over US Treasuries, proving, said traders, that the borrower had got the pricing right. The day's new issues helped to underline the attractions of the US dollar and the D-Mark at a time of currency uncertainty. Defying the sceptics who believe the market has had its fill of such instruments, Kidder Peabody said its Dollars 100m 10-year collared floater for GECC enjoyed good sales in continental Europe, especially in Switzerland. Kidder Peabody's Dollars 200m five-year floating rate note for Nacional Financiera, the Mexican government agency, uses a guaranteed pass-though structure. It is guaranteed by Nafinsa and has the additional security of loans from Nafinsa to 18 other Mexican banks. Nafinsa will use the repayments of these loans to retire the debt, giving it a short, 2 1/2  year, average life. The yield to average life is 260 basis points over Libor. Confirming the demand for D-Marks, Lehman Brothers said the DM100m five-year issue it launched for SBAB, the Swedish National Mortgage Housing Association, was driven by a lead institutional order. It was issued under the borrower's existing medium-term note programme and targetted at German institutions. Swiss Bank Corporation in Germany increased another GECC issue after strong demand, raising to DM300m from DM250m the seven-year bonds launched a day earlier. Rabobank Nederland brought the Bank for Dutch Municipalities to market with a Fls 1bn 12-year issue targetted at retail investors and small portfolio managers.</p>

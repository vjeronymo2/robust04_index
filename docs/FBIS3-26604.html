			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By corrrespondent Dong Huifeng (5516 2585 1496) ] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 5 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--In a recent  interview given to a ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE correspondent, Wang  Qiren, the newly appointed president of the Bank of China,  thanked people from different Hong Kong and Macao circles for  their care for him, saying he missed all his Hong Kong and Macao  friends and he had had a good time with them over the last two  years.    Wang Qiren, who resigned earlier as deputy director of the  State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said he was  touched by the massive New Year's greeting cards and letters of  congratulations he received from his Hong Kong and Macao  friends. He asked the correspondent to express his regards and  wish them all a happy new year for him.    He said: The important thing in dealing with Hong Kong and  Macao compatriots is sincerity and serving them well according  to relevant central policies in order to increase their sense of  belonging and make them feel that we are all Chinese and Chinese  government officials are their friends. He said many Hong Kong  and Macao friends he came in contact with were patriotic and  loved Hong Kong and Macao, which is the foundation for achieving  one country, two systems, and maintaining long-term prosperity  and stability in Hong Kong and Macao.    Wang Qiren pointed out that 1997 is only three years away  and  there are many specific tasks to do, such as actively  propagating and popularizing the Basic Law to make it known to  everybody, working hard to maintain the stability and prosperity  of Hong Kong's economy, despite Britain's noncooperation, and  various tasks for Hong Kong's transition toward 1997. This will  turn the attention of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots to the  motherland and make them work in concerted effort for the return  of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland. Only thus can we face  the 5,000-year civilized Chinese race, history, and our  descendants with a clear conscience.    In the two-and-a-half hour interview, the former State  Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office deputy director said  more than once that the Bank of China has a close relationship  with Hong Kong and Macao; that he will continue to serve Hong  Kong and Macao compatriots in his work and in his participation  in the Preliminary Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee  for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p>

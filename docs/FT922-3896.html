			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: BioChem Pharma defers 3.5m share offering BIOCHEM Pharma, Glaxo's Canadian partner in the development of the 3TC treatment for the Aids disease, has withdrawn its first international equity offering of 3.5m new shares because of a sharp drop last week in the market value of its existing stock. The company said it could not explain the drop in the share price from a 52-week high of CDollars 35 to below CDollars 20 in North American markets. Clinical trials of 3TC, conducted by Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, are 'progressing well' and preliminary information is scheduled to be released at next month's International Aids Conference in Amsterdam. BioChem maintained that its financial position was strong, with net cash exceeding CDollars 30m (USDollars 25.2m). This position is expected to be enhanced by new capital from warrant, option and equity subscriptions amounting to around CDollars 40m during the rest of the company's financial year. British and continental European interest exceeded the target 1.75m new shares that were to be sold in Europe. BioChem will proceed with full listing on the London Stock Exchange later this year, and Kleinwort Benson has been named its global financial adviser. BioChem is working on a number of new products for detection, prevention and treatment of diseases. The company also makes vaccines and diagnostic kits. Magna International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, is raising a further CDollars 103m in new equity by a public issue of subordinated voting shares at CDollars 32.25 each. The proceeds of the issue will be used to reduce debt.</p>

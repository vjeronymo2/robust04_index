			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 27 (XINHUA) -- A top Bosnian  Serb military leader said today that Serbs do not agree with a  UN decision to open a key bridge in Sarajevo.    Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of the general staff of the Serb  forces, described as "not allowable" and "one-sided" a decision  made by Michael Rose, commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in  Bosnia to open the bridge "brotherhood and unity" beginning  Monday [28 February] noon.    "If needed, we will resort to military means" to prevent the  opening, he said in a statement issued this evening.    He pointed out that the bridge should be opened under an  agreement to be signed by Serbs and Muslims, with the mediation  of UN special envoy in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi.    According to a UN plan to restore peace in Sarajevo, the  bridge will be open on Monday and so will be the roads linking  the city with the outside.    Opening of the bridge "brotherhood and unity" would connect  the Muslim-dominated inner-city area in Sarajevo with the part  held by Serbs for the first time since the Bosnian capital came  under siege in April 1992.    Earlier reports reaching here said the United Nations  expected the bridge to be guarded by UN peacekeepers and Serb  and Muslim troops.    Meanwhile, Milovanovic also said Serbs neither agreed with  the UN-announced new ways for humanitarian relief operations.    He was referring to Sunday's decision by the United Nations  to move relief convoys through Bosnia without asking for  permission from the warring factions.    The Serb general stressed that any relief convoy and other  UN  vehicles should not move through Serb-held territory without  permission, warning that otherwise, serbs will "prevent their  movement with weapons."    He accused UN peacekeepers of having shipped weapons and  ammunition to Muslims in the past and added that no humanitarian  worker has been killed on Bosnian Serb territory.    Earlier reports said that a relief convoy will be heading  for  Sarajevo Monday, moving through lands controlled by Muslims,  Croats and Serbs without asking for permission as expected by  the United Nations.    Under Rose's order, the convoy will be escorted by UN troops  and the aircraft of the north atlantic treaty organization will  provide air cover and use arms if it is intercepted.</p>

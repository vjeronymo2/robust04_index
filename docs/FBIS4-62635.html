			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Robert Serebrennikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 22 TASS -- The Russian Government pledged  to see to it that agreements with "De Beers" international  diamond giant are observed and no unauthorized shipments of  Russian diamonds to the world market are made, according to a  joint communique on the first round of Russian-De Beers talks  forwarded to BUSINESS-TASS on Wednesday.    Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and "De Beers"  chairman of the central selling organisation Nicky Oppenheimer  also agreed after two-day talks which ended on Wednesday to  abide in their cooperation by the agreement which expires in the  end of 1995.    Russia wanted to change the agreement which envisages that  95  per cent of its diamonds are marketed through "De Beers" and  five per cent independently. It strives to increase the  independent share.    "Until the moment when any changes are agreed the sides  remain adherent to the terms of the agreement which is valid  until the end of 1995. Both sides pledge to adopt the necessary  measures to cease shipments of Russian jewellery diamonds to the  world market by bypassing the existing agreements on the sales  of the products", according to the communique.    The sides also pledged their mutual responsibility for the  fate of the world diamond market and the well-being of all  diamond producers. They expressed hope that a new series of  talks would restore the stable basis for future cooperation and  thus will create guarantees for a further development of the  diamond business for the benefit of both sides and the world  diamond industry.</p>

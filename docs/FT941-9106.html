			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Armitage Bros shows advance to Pounds 810,000 Shares in Armitage Brothers, the pet products manufacturer, yesterday rose 35p to 215p as the company reported a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 715,000 to Pounds 810,000 for the 28 weeks to December 12. The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 13.4m which was, said Mr Russell Taylor, chief executive, the result of new business rather than sales price increases. He said that while the economic situation remained fragile the company was continuing to put money into marketing and product development in the UK and overseas, hoping to build on the successes of the past few years. Earnings per share came out at 13.5p (11.9p). The interim dividend is raised from 2.6p to 2.7p.</p>

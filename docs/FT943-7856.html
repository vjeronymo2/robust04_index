			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Highland Gold hit by lower production Highland Gold, the Papua New Guinea-based mining company controlled by Queensland's MIM group, said profits in the year to end-June fell to K21.6m (Dollars 22.9m), compared with K26.3m in the previous year, reports Nikki Tait. The downturn was largely blamed on lower production from the large Porgera gold mine, in PNG's Enga province, in which Highlands has a one-quarter interest. Higher production costs there also contributed to the fall. Highlands' revenues in the year amounted to K107.5m. Its share of Porgera gold production was 294,417 ounces at an average realised price of USDollars 369 per oz. There were no abnormal items, either in 1993-94 or 1992-93, and operating profits last year stood at K35.8m kina against K49.9m.</p>

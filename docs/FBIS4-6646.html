			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, who is head of the key coalition party Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], on Thursday urged the coalition's biggest group,  the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], to come  closer to other parties over policy affairs. Hata, who is  widely expected to be picked as a successor to outgoing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, told reporters that the SDP should  make a decision in order to maintain the coalition government.    The SDP has threatened to secede from the coalition because  of differences with other parties on tax reform and Japan's  response to North Korea's suspected nuclear development program.    Hata said some SDP members are making endeavors to keep the  coalition together. He said the ruling parties should debate  policies thoroughly, noting that such discussions would later  help the new government.    The coalition has failed to pick a successor to Hosokawa for  nearly two weeks since Hosokawa announced his resignation on  April 8.</p>

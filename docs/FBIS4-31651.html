			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Cangova: "The Census Within the Deadline"] </F>   [Text] The preparations must be completed for the census  in the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] from 21 June to 5 July according to  schedule. All the deadlines for this major statistical survey  have been met and there is no reason to suspect that anything  will go wrong. This was stated at yesterday's news conference  organized by the State Census Commission to report on the  progress of work on the census. Namely, it was emphasized that  the appointment of the communal census commissions had been  completed, that they had been constituted, and that they had  started work. On these commissions 356 members have been  elected, of which there are 34 (including three Albanians)  presidents, 102 specialists, and 222 basically elected on a  national basis, so the legal criteria have been respected. Of  the 222 members on the communal census commissions 50.4 percent  are Macedonians, 15.32 Albanians, 11.26 Turks, 9.46 Romanies,  1.35 Vlachs, 5.41 Serbs, 2.7 Muslims, 1.32 Egyptians, and 2.7  percent other nationalities.    We were informed by President of the State Census Commission  Risto Ivanov that the criterion for appointing members to the  communal census commissions from the nationalities has been  respected. Disagreements about Article 24 of the Census Law  related to these appointments did not arise in the State Census  Commission, but in the communal assemblies, where the article  was differently interpreted. Ivanov emphasized that it is  legally clear that the national structure has to be respected  only for the members that are appointed from the nationalities,  while those members -- such as specialists in statistics,  urbanism, geodesy, and demography -- do not have to belong to  particular nationalities. The criterion on which the national  structure was determined was based on the last census in 1991,  and wherever there was over 1 percent of a certain nationality,  at least one member of that nationality was appointed. According  to these criteria, 110 people have been appointed to the  communal census commissions, of whom 34 are Albanians, 24 Turks,  21 Romanies, 3 Vlachs, 12 Serbs, 6 Muslims, 3 Egyptians, and 6  other nationalities.    As for remarks on the structure of the personnel carrying  out  the census, this was not defined according to the structure of  the population in a commune or a locality, but depended on  whether in a census area a certain nationality participates with  50, that is 20 percent of the whole population structure, which  is the condition for selecting a person from that nationality.  [sentence as published] In order to ensure people's right to  use the language of their nationality, that is Albanian,  Turkish, Vlach, Romany, or Serbian, those who know that language  must be selected, regardless of their nationality. Selections  are also made regardless of nationality in cases where there are  no candidates of a particular nationality who meet the  conditions.    President of the State Census Commission Risto Ivanov  pointed  out that in the first stage there were 10,000 applicants to be  census officials and communal instructors, which was not  sufficient, and in the second 11,000, which was sufficient for  testing the candidates. If we do not obtain people with the  necessary language abilities, there will probably be another  round of testing. Yesterday, Ivanov denied that these "census  takers" will not be paid, because, as he said, there was a book  of payment regulations. He also denied that this was the reason  that a large number of applicants had refused the testing.    Concerning the citizenship regulation, it was stated that  this was a matter for the Interior Ministry. According to the  State Census Commission's information, around 94 percent of the  citizens in the state have been officially sent citizenship  certificates, one of several identification papers acceptable in  the census. The full situation will be known in the course of  the day, and by 15 June all those meeting the conditions for  citizenship will possess adequate documents. Until 5 June the  Interior Ministry was officially sending information by mail,  and since then citizens have been able to appeal to regional  offices for such documents.    During the census there will be around 100 organizations  present in the country, which will have the opportunity to  monitor the development of the statistical survey, and it is up  to the European Commission to decide which countries they will  come from. As Svetlana Antonovska, director of the Republican  Statistical Department, said, at the moment work is being done  on applications from observers and representatives of  international organizations and statistical departments from  other countries, and so far there are representatives of the  National Institute for Statistics of Bulgaria, the Council of  Europe, and the CSCE, who have confirmed that they will be  present.</p>

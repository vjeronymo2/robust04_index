			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Ireland in turmoil as Reynolds steps down: High Court president resigns - Doubts raised over pace of Ulster peace talks Ireland was pitched into a fresh political crisis last night after the prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, and his Fianna Fail cabinet colleagues resigned. Their decision, which could result in a lengthy phase of political instability in the republic, raises concerns about the momentum of the Northern Ireland peace process. The resignations were followed later in the day by that of Mr Harry Whelehan as president of the High Court. He said he was quitting because 'the judiciary must enjoy total and unquestioning public respect'. Mr Reynolds, in his resignation speech, told the parliament: 'You win some - and you lose some. But, above all, throughout my life I have been delighted to have been a risk-taker.' Former attorney-general Mr Whelehan's judicial appointment triggered the collapse of the 22-month old coalition on Wednesday. Labour had accused Mr Reynolds of misleading parliament over the delayed extradition to Northern Ireland of a Catholic priest, later convicted of child abuse. Mr Whelehan's resignation introduced an unexpected twist to a day of high political drama in Dublin, raising the prospect that Mr Reynolds might try to hang on to the party leadership. Last night his position as party leader was still unclear after it emerged that a meeting of the Fianna Fail parliamentary party had not accepted his resignation. A meeting to resolve the party leadership issue is expected to be held tomorrow. Two candidates last night declared their intention to fight for the leadership. Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the justice minister, said that she would be offering her candidacy if Mr Reynolds were to step down. Mr Bertie Ahern, until yesterday the finance minister, also announced he planned to stand. Ireland, for the time being, is in the hands of a caretaker government. With little prospect of an early resolution to the crisis, there are growing doubts about the pace of talks between Dublin and London on the vital framework document for a constitutional settlement to Northern Ireland's political problems. In London, Mr John Major, who was informed of Mr Reynolds' resignation during a morning cabinet meeting, wrote to thank him for his contribution to the peace process. Downing Street said the prime minister was sorry that his 'extremely good' working relationship with his former Irish counterpart was at an end. He intended to speak to Mr Reynolds before the end of the week. But as Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, used a visit to London to accuse Britain of dragging its feet on efforts to forge a lasting settlement in Ulster, senior UK ministers insisted that the peace process would continue. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told parliament the process did not 'depend on any individual'. The government would 'press ahead' with exploratory talks with Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives next month. Downing Street said the two governments were 'close to agreement' on the framework document which would form the basis of future talks involving Ulster's main political parties. Mr Adams appeared sceptical. The process of trying to reach agreement had been going on 'for months and months', he said. The prospect of a protracted search for a new Irish government - and possibly an early general election - could dangerously delay the joint framework document. In the confusion generated by the day's resignations, however, it was not clear that a new general election would even be necessary. Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, said he had 'an open mind' on all possibilities for forming another coalition.

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOURISTS GET SPRAYED  </P> <P> Caroline Taylor (Letters, April 1) quite correctly insists that the state  should require that hotels/motels notify their guests at registration when  spraying is scheduled.  </P> <P> The position taken by the (state) Department of Agriculture is that they see no  need for the state to require hotels/motels to notify their guests.  </P> <P> However, the Department of Health Services takes the position of advising  residents of communities to be sprayed that they should take some simple  general precautions to reduce avoidable exposure to any potentially hazardous  chemical. They ask you to stay indoors (great for tourists who have limited  time and budget), remove clothing from outdoor lines and cover playground  facilities. They should also be cautioning hotels to cover their swimming  pools.  </P> <P> So, why aren't tourists being warned? Their physiology is the same as ours. No  doubt because it's bad for business, and the last thing the state wants is any  more unfavorable publicity. The bottom line is that, once again, dollars are  valued more than people as we slip further into moral bankruptcy.  </P> <P> PHILLIP CUTLER  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy commentary: "Partnership Dialogue </F> between Russia and Britain"]    [Text] In at least one thing British Prime Prime Minister  John Major has a head start on virtually any European or indeed  transl-Atlantic politician -- scarcely anyone will be able to  match him regarding the breadth and charm of his smile, and this  regardless of the problems confronting Her Majesty's  Conservative Government headed by John Major. There are enough  of these problems: the split within the ruling party which is  gradually coming to a head plus the opposition's attacks on the  government's domestic economic positions.    Nevertheless, John Major is not downcast and he has arrived  in Russia full, as always, of self-confidence and with a radiant  smile. The official visit by the head of the British government  is both symbolic and completely practical in nature.    Problems of bilateral relations between Russia and Great  Britain were discussed during the meeting between President  Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister John Major in the Kremlin on  the morning of 15 February and also during talks with an  enlarged delegation in attendance. Other items also figured on  the agenda: the general situation in Europe, the CIS, and the  other states of the former Soviet Union; joint efforts to combat  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and so forth.    As was to be expexcted, special attention was paid to the  Yugoslav crisis during these top-level talks. Our countries'  concern over the situation in former Yugoslavia and in Bosnia  and Herzegovina, in particular, is understandable. Common  historical interests, traditional links, and influence in the  Balkans draw Russia to this region gripped by civil war.  However, Great Britain too has just as much interest in peace  in former Yugoslavia. The 1st Motorized Infantry Battalion of  the Cheshire Infantry Regiment and other subunits, numbering  around 1,500 men, form part of the Blue Beret contingent in  Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, since last month the command  of the UN Forces in Bosnia has been in the hands of a British  general. A very great deal regarding the current situation in  both Sarajevo and the republic as a whole depends on the way  that Lieutenant General Michael Rose sees the situation and ways  of overcoming the conflict.    The Russian and British leaders acknowledge that we have a  common main goal: the earliest possible end to bloodshed, the  achievement of a just peace, and a politoical settlement of the  crisis. However, there are also differences in the sides'  approaches to the means of achieving that earliest possible end  to bloodshed. Russia does not regard the NATO decision on the  possibility of air strikes against Serbian ground positions as  ideal. Nevertheless, despite all the reservations, there is in  general a recognition of a lack of will or ability on the part  of the United Nations to achieve success in the Yugoslav  settlement, although it is premature to put this down to  impotence.    It is important that our dialogue -- equal, mutually  respectful dialogue between partners -- continue, and not just  with the United States but also with traditional European states  friendly toward Russia, in whose ranks Great Britain rightly  belongs.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Greycoat The rescue package for Greycoat may not be voted through this week if the entrenched growls coming from both Postel and the company's preference shareholders are any guide. A complex balance between different groups of creditors will make adjustments to the basic deal difficult unless Postel is prepared to sweeten the deal for preference shareholders itself. Yet that would leave it open to further pressure from other groups. Since the alternative to accepting Postel's offer is probably putting Greycoat into administration, the company's management is naturally enthusiastic. Preference shareholders may only be bluffing in their resistance to the Greycoat plan, but they have to balance a number of competing factors. While they would not have to cede any value to ordinary shareholders if the company were wound up, neither would they benefit from the interest concessions offered by the banks as part of the Postel scheme. Then there is the valuation of Greycoat's properties. The current renaissance in property is largely confined to assets with cast-iron cash flows. Most of Greycoat's portfolio arguably fits into that category, so that the preference holders might decide it was worth hanging on. Then again there is the danger that delay will impose its own cost. As Alistair Ross Goobey, Postel's chief executive, has committed himself to standing pat he may feel he cannot move now. The preference shareholders may crumble, but in such a game of bluff that will not be until the last. And the 75 per cent of acceptances needed hardly helps Postel's cause.</p>

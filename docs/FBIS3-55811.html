Estonia should get back Ivangorod, the area around the Narva  river, and Pechory. But the majority of Estonians hope that a  solution will be found which is acceptable to both states. The  newspaper POSTIMEES drew this conclusion on the basis of a  sociological poll carried out by the "Emor" company.  Specialists questioned 1,000 people. These were on the whole  young Estonians (16-24 years of age) and elderly Estonians  (65-74 years of age), who stated that it is necessary to  reinstate the Tartu (Yuryev) Peace Agreement and the border  between the countries which it established. According to the  paper, those with a low level of education favor the prewar  border. Estonians with higher education and Estonians living in  the republic's northeast come out in favor of a compromise  solution for the border problem.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Archer to acquire rival agency Archer Group, the Lloyd's agency, is to acquire Cox Group, a rival agency. Cox's principal operating subsidiary is the Cox Tudsbery &amp; Wills members' agency. The acquisition is one of a number of takeovers by bigger agents at the insurance market, which has been hard hit by five years of heavy losses. Under the proposal, Archer, which has a market capitalisation of about Pounds 19m, will issue to Cox shareholders new shares equal to approximately 5 per cent of Archer's outstanding equity. Subject to regulatory approval the deal will be completed during October.</p>

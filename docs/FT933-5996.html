			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (15): Chips oust snakes - Electronics in Penang / The state which claims to be the world's top supplier of semiconductors B BRAUN, the US medical manufacturer, already had four plants in Penang when it chose to build another next to an ancient temple seething with snakes. It was the land scarcity born of economic success that prompted the choice, but it paid off. Eighteen months later the snakes have gone, with the jungle that they came from, and B Braun is thriving. But then, to thrive in Penang is not exceptional. The state claims it is the world's leading exporter of semiconductors, with the list of companies operating on the island reading like a roll call of the world's electronics and electrical industry. It is also poised to assume pole position in the disk drive industry, as companies relocate from Singapore and local industry expands. Growth has been rapid, with expansion in textile and food manufacturing following hard on the heels of the electronics sector. Manufacturing accounted for just 12.7 per cent of the state's GDP in 1970. Twenty years later, that share had risen to 46 per cent. In 1992, Penang's GDP growth is estimated to have been around 11.8 per cent, with the manufacturing sector expanding by more than 15 per cent. The state's chief minister, Mr Koh Tsu Koon, argues that even this figure may be an underestimate. However, Mr Koh concedes that the last two years have seen something of a slowdown. The Penang Development Corporation (PDC), long the facilitator of growth in Penang, says land sales to companies setting up in the state have fallen in the last two years. But the PDC argues that the recession in the global electronics industry has served to enhance the state's appeal further as companies, often already based in more costly Singapore, search for further savings. Conner of the US already had a plant in Singapore when it set up its volume producer in Penang in 1989. 'We reckon to save from Dollars 10 to Dollars 12 on every disk drive that we produce in Penang, over what it would have cost us in Singapore,' says Mr Patrick Yeo, Conner's local managing director. But relocating is a costly business and companies that make the leap are not protected from disappointing sales. Conner admits to being one of many Penang companies operating at well below capacity in the face of a world recession. Penang remains very much the junior partner compared with Singapore. But it has started to bite into its southern neighbour's industrial base. A well developed infrastructure, the capabilities that have come with its prominence in semiconductors, and strong communications links have enhanced Penang's standing in the electronics sector. But Penang's real edge over Singapore is its relative freedom from Singapore's greatest problems: shortages of land and labour. Penang has also had its problems in these areas, but they are less acute, and the scope for their solution seems to be greater. The state's response to a land shortage that finally hit in 1992 was an accelerated programme of land reclamation and great development of state land on peninsular Malaysia - linked to the island by Asia's longest bridge. The problem of labour shortages has been more difficult to solve. Not so long ago unemployment was a serious problem in Penang. Now there are shortages at virtually every level with companies reporting employee turnover in some sectors of 7 to 8 per cent a month. The competition for workers means that Penang can no longer boast cheap workers as one of its selling points. But Mr Noor Ahmad Moktar Haniff, general manager of the PDC, points out that at around MDollars 18 (Dollars 7) a day for semi-skilled labour, 'Penang's labour is not expensive either'. The PDC is firing on all cylinders in its efforts to find more workers. The PDC is trying to persuade Penang graduates, who went abroad to find work in the days before the state's industrialisation, to come back home. Women, just 44 per cent of whom participate in the labour force, have been targeted, with the state encouraging both the development of child-care facilities and the return to work of older women. 'We are also looking at foreign workers as a possible temporary solution, although we are wary of the social problems that this could bring,' says Mr Noor. Workers must also be taught new skills to cater to the changing needs of industry. 'In an area of rapidly developing technology there is the risk of the workforce becoming redundant,' says Mr Boonler Somchit, executive director of a special skills centre in Penang. 'We cannot allow that to happen. We cannot afford to leave people marking time.' The centre, a privately funded organisation set up in 1989, offers facilities to Penang's companies to re-train their workers. 'We aim to train operators to be technicians, technicians to be engineers, and release engineers into research and development,' says a PDC executive. 'The point is, there is a place in the sun for everyone.' The labour shortage has, however, brought a change of direction in the state's industrial strategy. Mr Koh, the chief minister, says that Penang would rather not have labour intensive industries. 'We would rather see a situation where Penang is the centre for technology, the centre for operational headquarters, for research and development, and for higher-end production. And the neighbouring states or regions are areas for more labour intensive production, so that there can be linkages.' Penang is now trying to market itself and its surrounding states in the north of peninsular Malaysia as a single, diverse, resource-rich investment area, and lobbying the federal government for infrastructure and other investments. On a grander scale, the states are part of a recently agreed upon 'growth triangle' linking north Sumatra in Indonesia and the southern states of Thailand. Ministers from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have already agreed on the relocation of some of Penang's electronics components companies as the first stage in this project. In future, the main difficulty for Penang will not be in turning away labour-intensive investments, but in attracting higher technology producers. Mr Yeo of Conner says Penang is like a rare gem. 'The polishing is done, but the finer touches have yet to come.' 'At the end of the day, though, I am a businessman, and my vote is for this place.'</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Observer: Body count Political violence takes a terrible toll of South Africa's townships, but the country's roads are even more perilous. Over 9,500 people died in traffic accidents last year, nearly half of them pedestrians. That's as many as have been killed in Natal over a decade of political violence. Latest Easter weekend count: cars: 147; politics: 50.</p>

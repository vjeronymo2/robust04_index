			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> 11 DISABLED PUPILS CAMP OUT AT BEACH  </P> <P> For many Southern California junior high school students, Friday was just  another day at the beach. But for 11 severely handicapped students at Richard  B. Haydock Junior High, it was the chance to prove their independence.  </P> <P> The students, who suffer from severe physical and mental disabilities, were  allowed to participate Thursday and Friday in an overnight beach camp-out at  McGrath State Beach. Many of the children in the program have Down's syndrome  and are either blind or deaf, or both.  </P> <P> Norman Brekke, superintendent of the Oxnard Elementary School District, said it  was the first time the district took the students on an overnight camping trip.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt that because of its success it will become an annual event,"  Brekke said.  </P> <P> The daily curriculum in Beth Jacobs' class teaches the students how to handle  financial transactions, ride the bus, cook simple meals and many other skills  most people take for granted. "These programs emphasize students developing  their self-sufficiency and independence," Brekke said.  </P> <P> Teaching assistant and parent Connie Wilbur said the vocational training,  individualized treatment and attention the students receive make it possible  for them to overcome their disabilities and survive in the community.  </P> <P> The Oxnard Elementary School District has hired several graduates of the  program -- a gardener, an assistant cook and a teacher's aide.  </P> <P> "If these kids didn't have this program," Wilbur said, "they'd be in a state  institution."  </P> <P> The camp-out was the culmination of the curriculum, a chance for the students  to test themselves away from the familiar territories of home and school. The  children, who range in age from 12 to 14, saw two schools of dolphins offshore,  learned the "right" way to eat an Oreo cookie -- carefully twist the cookies  apart and then lick them -- and told ghost stories.  </P> <P> For some of them, the camping trip was a rare opportunity to get out. Student  Mara Davenport, of Oxnard has one parent who is confined to a wheelchair and  another who can barely walk. The family lives in a trailer.  </P> <P> Teaching Assistant Margie Banales, watching Mara run along the beach, said she  is "like a little bird set free . . . she is so motivated to learn and  experience new things."

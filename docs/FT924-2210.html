			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Economics Notebook: Blackout on trade figures at time of great import The blackout to be imposed on the UK's trade figures from January 28 is bound to lead to intense speculation on what is happening to the economy. A new set of figures will replace the old system in June, but by then a more-than-usually interesting period for UK import and export flows will have passed, much to the frustration of all those tracking the long-awaited economic recovery. Will the volume of UK exports to the EC be rising on the back of the devalued pound, or will recession in Germany spell gloom for UK and other European goods? Will the higher cost of imports push the visible trade deficit wider? And will a pick-up in consumer demand mean rising inflows of imports? Behind the loss of this important information lies Intrastat, the new system for collecting trade data to be adopted by each of the 12 member states of the EC in January. It was developed by the European Commission to tie in with the completion of the single market at the end of this year. Data on commerce with the rest of the world will still be available, but since more than 50 per cent of the UK's external trade is generated in the EC, these figures will provide only a patchy picture. The abolition of border requirements and formalities means that customs declarations, the current source of trade statistics, will no longer be required. To keep track of trade flows, Intrastat will require all businesses registered for VAT to fill in two extra boxes on their VAT forms showing the total value of exports to and imports from other member states. Bigger companies will also have to complete a monthly report. The introduction of any series of statistics is fraught with complications. 'We'll spend the first three months sending back forms to the hundreds of people who fill them in incorrectly,' said the CSO. This is why the agency has given itself a gap in which to get the series oiled before presenting the numbers to the public. Nonetheless, many are wondering why the new system was not introduced earlier to run alongside the old series. This would have avoided an interruption in the trade figures just when economists will be looking for the full effects of sterling's recent devaluation on the UK's trade position. Only the very cynical would suggest that the UK government had calculated the black-out, but the absence of sensitive trade figures for the first half of next year could turn out to be very convenient. 'This is a genuine loss of information at a time when most people are expecting the trade position to worsen,' says Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank in London. 'The trade figures are a vital piece of the jigsaw that tells us what is going on in the economy.' Without the data economists will probably fear the worst and speculate that the so-called J-curve effect - whereby import prices rise faster than export volumes - will force the deficit on the current account wider. This, in turn, could lead to selling pressure on the pound. The public will also have to wait to find out what one of the most important parts of the 1992 initiative - the abolition of customs frontiers - is doing for trade flows. The CSO says it decided against an overlap between the old and the new systems to avoid putting too heavy a burden on businesses. It also points out that other member states of the EC are facing similar problems and that their trade figures will also be subject to delay. Some continental officials are blaming Eurostat, the EC statistics office. The switch from one system of collecting the trade figures to another was always going to be arduous, but there is a feeling among observers that Eurostat took a rather cavalier attitude to Intrastat in the belief that a rapid move to monetary union would soon render intra-EC trade figures irrelevant. 'The EC gave the impression that they did not attach much importance to Intrastat,' said one senior European economics official. 'It would have been sound practice to have the new system running side by side with the old system in order to get feedback from one to the other.' Eurostat insists that running the two systems together would have been impractical. Furthermore, original plans for administering Intrastat had to be scrapped in 1989 when the Council of Ministers rejected plans for changing the way VAT is collected. But with only one month to go before the switch is made, there have been complaints from UK businesses that they have not received the information, paperwork and guidelines they need in order to comply with Intrastat's new, and legally binding, requirements. Spain, Italy and Portugal have allegedly not issued details of the procedures companies must follow. Other EC countries have not requested six months to rehearse the system before publication, but they too have their doubts about Eurostat's timetable which suggests the first sets of figures should be ready for publication by March. 'Statistical offices in countries like Germany and France will be under a lot of pressure from their big users if they do not provide information in the first three to four months,' said a Eurostat administrator. The Germans, sensitive to their trade position since unification wiped out a healthy surplus on their visible trade balance, say they will produce an estimate in April. 'This is our plan, but not our promise,' said a spokesman from the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden. In Denmark, they believe the official timetable is unrealistic. The statistical office said it did not expect to produce the results of Intrastat until June at the earliest. Given the likely sensitivity of intra-EC trade figures next year and the confusion that Intrastat appears to be generating in certain quarters, it could be that the UK approach of saying nothing will turn out to be the most prudent.</p>

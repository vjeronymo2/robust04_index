			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Car makers see 'win-win-win' in Nafta - Industry disputes the view that the trade pact will benefit Mexico at the expense of Canada and the US NORTH American vehicle makers dispute the conventional wisdom that the North American Free Trade Agreement will bring a surge of investment in the Mexican automotive industry at the expense of US and Canadian plants. Much more likely, they predict, is a rationalisation and integration of facilities in all three countries. 'Mexico will get its share of investment,' says Mr Mustafa Mohatarem, director of economics at General Motors. 'But to the extent that there's excess capacity in the US and Canada, you're not going to add on capacity in Mexico, especially in the short term.' The Mexican car market is growing by about 7 per cent a year. But the domestic car industry is expected to focus increasingly on the smaller models most popular with first-time buyers. Mr Mohatarem compares Mexico to Spain, which, since its accession to the European Community, has become a hub for small-car production. While growth in the US and Canadian markets is much slower and likely to remain so, the car companies are confident that Nafta will also benefit suppliers in those two countries. If all goes to plan, Nafta will stimulate trade between Mexico and its two northern neighbours in much the same way as the 1965 US-Canada automotive agreement led to a surge in trade between those two countries. The trend which has seen vehicle and parts makers treat the US and Canada as a single market for the past three decades is expected to extend gradually to Mexico. Nafta provides for duty-free trade among the US, Mexico and Canada within 10 years for parts and for vehicles which exceed 62.5 per cent North American origin. The threshold will rise from the 50 per cent level set by the 1965 US-Canada Autopact, to 56 per cent after five years and to 62.5 per cent. Nafta will have a tighter definition of North American content than the Autopact. At the same time, the local-content and trade-balancing requirements of Mexico's Automotive Decree will be phased out. The present 1-to-1 'trade-balancing' ratio between exports and imports will drop to 0.55-to-1 after 10 years. Mexico will cut its local-value-added content requirement immediately from 36 to 34 per cent, and by another one point a year after five years. The rule will be eliminated entirely after 10 years. The value-added threshold will only be 20 per cent for sales above those achieved just before the agreement is implemented. The Auto Decree forces foreign carmakers to assemble a wide range of vehicles in Mexico. Although some export-oriented plants are as efficient as any elsewhere on the continent, those centred on the local market have relatively small production runs and high costs. Ford's factory in Mexico City, for instance, turns out eight different models. Both GM and Ford intend to switch production of larger models now made in Mexico to under-used plants in the US or Canada. Ford, for instance, will probably move production of the 10,000 Thunderbirds now assembled each year in Mexico to an under-used plant in Ohio. GM sold only 1,805 US-assembled cars in Mexico last year. But the manufacturers are confident that the new trade-balancing ratios will be sufficient for their northern plants to compete for virtually the entire growth in the Mexican market. GM predicts that the US's automotive trade deficit with Mexico, now running at about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a year, will swing to a 'significant' surplus. Nafta's biggest boost to Mexican investment could come from manufacturers which do not yet have a presence there, but are keen to boost sales of economy-sized models in a fast-growing market. In particular, industry observers predict that Honda and Toyota will put up assembly plants in Mexico within the next few years to complement existing factories in the US and Canada. But foreign companies with only one plant in North America are more likely to pick a site closer to the main US markets than Mexico. BMW recently announced plans to build a plant in South Carolina. Two other German carmakers - Mercedes Benz and Audi - are also expected to opt for a US site. For the time being, transport costs will limit the appeal of investing in Mexico. Ford cites the example of its compact Escort and Tracer models. These cars are assembled at two plants in North America: Hermosillo in north-central Mexico and Wayne, Michigan, on the outskirts of Detroit. The Mexican factory has a Dollars 30-an-hour advantage in labour costs, which translates to about Dollars 450 per vehicle. But the further north cars are shipped from Mexico, the more this advantage is eroded by freight costs. Ford finds it economical to ship Mexican-assembled Escorts and Tracers within an arc covering only about one-third of the southern and south-west US. The Michigan plant continues to serve the big markets in the north-east US, as well as the whole of Canada. Its output remains about double that of Hermosillo. But differences in transport costs could narrow as Mexico's infrastructure improves and border procedures are streamlined. Even now, some Canadian parts suppliers ship to Mexico and vice versa. The Canadians are confident that - despite frequent complaints about high wages and taxes - they will continue to attract new investment under continental free trade. Chrysler, which produces about a third of its North American vehicles in Ontario, announced earlier this year that it was boosting capacity at its Bramalea plant outside Toronto. A boost to US and Canadian parts makers could come from the increase in the rule-of-origin threshold from 50 per cent to 62.5 per cent. Japanese and German 'transplants', most of which only just meet the 50 per cent target, have already begun raising the North American content of their vehicles. 'This formalises a level they were heading for anyway,' says a Canadian trade negotiator. The weakness of the US dollar against the yen gives foreign carmakers another incentive to lower their dependence on imports. But even with the 62.5 per cent threshold, they will be able to source almost all their high-value electronic, chassis and powertrain components abroad.</p>

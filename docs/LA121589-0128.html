			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> XEROX SUES APPLE OVER GRAPHICS SOFTWARE  </P> <P> Xerox slapped Apple Computer with a $150-million lawsuit on Thursday,  contending that Apple is illegally using the software that created the  revolutionary graphics display on its highly popular Macintosh personal  computer.  </P> <P> The suit, filed late Thursday in federal court in San Francisco, is a bizarre  turn in an already twisted tale surrounding the visual display currently used  in Apple's Macintosh models. The display resembles a desk top and allows a user  to manipulate data and issue instructions by using a set of pictures, or  "icons."  </P> <P> The Macintosh display, which has become an industry standard, is a key reason  for the machine's popularity since its introduction in early 1984. Last year,  Apple sued two computer industry heavyweights, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard,  for allegedly infringing on its copyrighted display.  </P> <P> However, Xerox claims in its suit that the Macintosh display "stems from work  originally done by Xerox" and has been used by Apple without Xerox permission.  The suit notes that the display was first used by Apple in its now discontinued  Lisa model introduced in 1982, as well in as the Macintosh.  </P> <P> Xerox said it has held a copyright on the display, which it first introduced on  its now discontinued Star computer system, since 1981.  </P> <P> A Xerox spokesman said the suit was filed now because recent changes in  software protection and intellectual property laws make it easier to assert its  position. He declined to specify those changes.  </P> <P> An Apple spokeswoman said the company believes that the suit is without merit  and that Xerox is attempting to assert its right to copyright an idea, rather  than merely an expression of an idea.  </P> <P> The spokeswoman said Apple has long acknowledged that its display was inspired  by work done by others in the computer industry. But, she said, Apple claims  that the display is its own through its investment of "time, people and effort"  to create the software.  </P> <P> Xerox said in the suit that Apple's use of the display and its licensing of it  to other computer companies has allowed Apple to "unjustly" receive royalties  and fees of more than $100 million. The suit also asks for at least another $50  million because Apple's actions constitute "unfair competition and unfair  business practices."  </P> <P> Xerox Chairman and Chief Executive David T. Kearns said efforts to reach an  amicable settlement, including a proposal for Apple to license the involved  software from Xerox, were rebuffed after Xerox approached Apple last week with  a proposal.  </P></p>

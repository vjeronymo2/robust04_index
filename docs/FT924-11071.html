			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / DTI energy-policy chief switches jobs THE civil servant responsible for overseeing the government's energy policy has been moved to a new post following last week's row over pit closures, the Department of Trade and Industry said last night. But the department denied that Mr Robert Priddle, a deputy secretary at the DTI, was taking the blame - rather than ministers - for the political embarrasment faced by the government when it was forced to backtrack over the proposals in the face of a Tory revolt. Mr Priddle has switched jobs with the head of the department's corporate and consumer affairs division - a job of equal rank. The DTI said it had been decided that, with the government committed to reviewing the pit closure programme, it was time for a 'fresh pair of hands' overseeing energy policy. Asked if Mr Priddle was being moved because of his performance in the job, the DTI said: 'We do not see it in that light.' By convention, civil servants are rarely blamed for policy failures.</p>

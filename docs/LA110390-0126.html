			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CALABASAS HANDS FILLMORE FIRST LOSS  </P> <P> Damon Riggins scored on a 14-yard run with 5 minutes 12 seconds left and  Calabasas High upset previously unbeaten Fillmore, 13-7, in a Frontier League  game Friday night at Calabasas.  </P> <P> Riggins, a senior tailback, rushed for 149 yards in 26 carries and also played  the entire game on defense.  </P> <P> In addition, he was the team's kicker and connected on one of two extra points.  Only 14 players suited up for Calabasas (3-6 overall, 1-2 in league play).  </P> <P> Fillmore (8-1, 2-1) took a 7-0 lead late in the first half on a 19-yard run by  Val Pillado, but Calabasas tied the score in the third quarter on a seven-yard  keeper by quarterback Ron Adelman.  </P> <P> Early in the fourth quarter, Mike Baron of Calabasas intercepted a pass and  returned the ball to the Fillmore 27-yard line. Calabasas drove to the 10, but  a fumble was recovered by Fillmore's Gabe Martinez.  </P> <P> Fillmore was forced to punt five plays later, however, and Calabasas began the  winning drive. Riggins broke over the left side for a 17-yard gain on the  second play, and four plays later he burst over the middle, shook off two  tacklers and romped into the end zone.  </P> <P> Adelman passed for 90 yards, completing nine of 13 passes. He also rushed for  42 yards and played the entire game as a defensive back.  </P> <P> Pillado finished with 48 rushing yards for Fillmore. Tailback Tory Cabral, who  has rushed for 978 yards this season, carried only three times for six yards.  NORM WEBER  </P></p>

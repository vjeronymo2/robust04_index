			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Civil Service catering agency to be privatised THE Treasury yesterday announced the privatisation of Forward Civil Service Catering, the troubled agency that supplies catering services to about 70 per cent of the Civil Service. Up to Pounds 400,000 is to be borrowed from the Contingencies Fund so that the privatisation can go ahead speedily, pending approval by parliament. The Commons public accounts committee is expected to publish a report shortly criticising Treasury management of the agency. Forward was converted to a commercial trading agency in 1991 as a prelude to privatisation. The National Audit Office last year revealed financial irregularities which led to the loss of up to Pounds 400,000, including 'significant weaknesses' in control of cash and stocks. The agency also faced an Inland Revenue bill of between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 450,000 for failure to deduct income tax and national insurance contributions from casual employees. Several Forward employees - including Mr Reg Wheeler, the chief executive - were suspended from duties pending the outcome of disciplinary charges over alleged breaches of purchasing rules and potential conflicts of interest over a planned management buy-out of the agency. Mr Wheeler has since returned to his duties, and will be retiring early. A senior Treasury official told the PAC in March that the department accepted responsibility for losses of between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m. One member of the PAC said taxpayers would wonder how the Treasury could manage the British economy when they could not run a tea-shop. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary, yesterday told MPs that Forward was now profitable and able to win business in open competition. Forward made a net profit in 1992-93 of Pounds 349,000 on a turnover of Pounds 30m. It has 500 full-time employees, with 600 full-time equivalents employed on an agency basis.</p>

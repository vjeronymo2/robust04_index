			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: WPP Group shares slip 3p to 99p Shares in WPP Group slipped 3p to 99p yesterday as the marketing services concern revealed at the annual meeting that 'worldwide revenues in constant currencies' had risen by more than 3 per cent during the first five months of the current year on a like-for-like basis. The operations in the UK, Asia Pacific and Latin America had turned in stronger performances than previously, though the reverse was true of the US and Canada. By type of operation, advertising revenues were 1 per cent ahead, market research grew 10 per cent, non-media activities advanced almost 7 per cent, and specialist communications rose more than 5 per cent. Public relations had been 'disappointing'. The chairman said that the group's trading margins had continued to improve in the five months - in line with the business plan which stipulates an increase of 1 per cent in operating margins in both 1994 and 1995 on a like-for-like basis. Debt averaged about Pounds 281m, against Pounds 323m. The Dollars 150m bridging facility had been repaid. WPP said it had delayed its decision on the flotation of its market research interests 'as a result of the volatility in the equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic'.</p>

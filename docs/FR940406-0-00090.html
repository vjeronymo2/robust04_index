			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using the classification criteria established at 52 FR 24672, EPA has preliminarily designated areas within each State as Group I, II, or III based upon an area's probability of attaining the PM&hyph;10 standard. The July 1, 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice requires State implementation plan (SIP) revisions for all classified Group I, II, and III areas and indicates the SIP revision requirements for each classification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 7, 1987, the State of Delaware was classified at 52 FR 29383 as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Group III_The entire State of Delaware. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments) did not affect the requirements established for Group III areas. The July 1, 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requires States to seek approval of SIP revisions as required under the preconstruction review program and to codify other minor regulatory changes as needed. It is presumed that the existing Delaware SIP is adequate to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in all Group III areas in the State. On April 26, 1988, the State of Delaware responded to the July, 1, 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by submitting four (4) regulations amended to reflect the revised particulate matter standards as a SIP revision. This SIP revision addresses Group III areas only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has evaluated Delaware's SIP revision request and concluded the following: (1) The amended regulations conform with the revised primary and secondary NAAQS for PM&hyph;10; (2) the amended regulations are clearly enforceable; and (3) the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 51 have been met. A more detailed evaluation is provided in the Technical Support Document available upon request from the Regional EPA office listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. These revisions to Delaware's regulations have been effective in the State since March 29, 1988. This action will be effective June 6, 1994 unless, by May 6, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on June 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is approving the four (4) regulations submitted by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control as a revision to the Delaware SIP. EPA's review of this material indicates that it conforms to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 51 and 52, and to the July 1, 1987 promulgation of NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the Federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

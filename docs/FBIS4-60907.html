			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Our correspondent report: "Financial Service Looks for </F> Ways of Armed Forces' Survival"]    [Text] On 27-28 April 1994, a meeting of the senior  personnel of the Russian Federation Armed Forces'  financial-economic service was held in Moscow. The meeting was  prompted by the extremely difficult financial situation in the  Army and the Navy, the need to look for extra ways to cut  military expenditures, to choose priorities in spending, and to  tighten economic austerity.    The meeting was attended by Army General P.S. Grachev,  Russian Federation defense minister; A.A. Kokoshin, his first  deputy; State Tax Service chief V.V. Gusev, and other senior  officials.    The defense minister pointed in his report to the financial-  economic service's considerable contribution to the organization  and preparation of new, highly efficient Armed Forces. At the  same time, he stressed that in current conditions one of the  main objective of commanders and chiefs of all ranks is the  search for ways to cut spending and to make sure that all money  appropriated for defense needs are spent efficiently. Given  drastic cuts in appropriations for Army and Navy equipment,  every ruble spent for these purposes should serve to strengthen  the Armed Forces as much as possible. At the same time, it was  noted that even in these difficult conditions concern for  servicemen, civilian personnel, Armed Forces veterans, and their  family members remains a priority objective.    The defense minister stressed that at a time of inflation  and  legislative confusion only the financial-economic service can  securely shield the army from those who would like to cash in at  its expense. Army Gen. Grachev said that financial staffers  should be the first to help commanders solve financial and  economic problems. Given that, the Defense Ministry leadership  will do its utmost to boost the prestige of the  financial-economic service and to enhance its status.    Participants in the meeting put a lot of questions to the  State Tax Service chief, because relations between the service  and the Armed Forces have yet to be fully straightened out.  Even the cost of meat produced on military units' own  subsidiary plots for the personnel mess list is often taxed  locally. The military have been fined for delaying payments to  the budget and pensions fund, which is absurd because the  nonpayments have been caused by the sluggish and incomplete  financing of the Armed Forces from the federal budget. The  State Tax Service chief promised that these matters would be  sorted out in the very near future.</p>

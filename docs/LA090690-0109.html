			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TUCSON ELECTRIC SUES EDISON OVER MERGER;  </P> <P> UTILITIES: THE AILING ARIZONA POWER COMPANY HOPED TO MERGE WITH SDG&amp;E  ITSELF. IT SEEKS DAMAGES BUT DOESN'T ASK TO BAR THE OTHER MARRIAGE.  </P> <P> Financially ailing Tucson Electric Power Co. on Wednesday filed a  multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Southern California Edison Co. in  connection with Edison's 1988 proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric  Co., a move that eventually derailed Tucson Electric's previously proposed  merger with SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> The suit seeks damages, interest payments and attorneys' fees that could total  "hundreds of millions of dollars," Tucson Electric spokesman Roger Yohem said.  But he said the suit, filed in San Diego Superior Court, does not attempt to  block Edison's pending merger with SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> "The suit is totally groundless and without merit," Edison spokesman Lew Phelps  said. "Tucson Electric Power, at the time that it agreed to terminate its  merger agreement with SDG&amp;E, indicated that it wasn't damaged as a  consequence of the termination."  </P> <P> Phelps added that Tucson Electric, "by its own admission, is in dire financial  health and they're apparently grasping at straws."  </P> <P> Industry observers said the unexpected suit could further complicate the  already complex and controversial $2.4-billion stock swap merger between  SDG&amp;E and Edison that is being reviewed by federal and state regulators. If  completed, the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger would create the nation's largest  investor-owned utility, with 4.8 million customers.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that the Tucson utility was weakened financially by  Edison's proposed merger with SDG&amp;E. Edison's intervention dashed Tucson  Electric's hope of spreading its excess power generation among the broadened  customer base that a merger with SDG&amp;E would have created.  </P> <P> "The plot thickens with this lawsuit," said Michael Shames, executive director  of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group that is  opposing Edison's proposed merger with SDG&amp;E. "If the (Tucson  Electric-SDG&amp;E) merger had gone through, Tucson would be in a lot better  position that it is now."  </P> <P> Tucson Electric's claim that Edison's uninvited bid for SDG&amp;E weakened the  Arizona utility financially "is accurate to a degree," according to Doug  Brooks, director of the Arizona Corporate Commission's Residential Utility  Consumers Office. However, "a lot has gone on with Tucson Electric Power other  than the failure of the merger agreement," Brooks said.  </P> <P> The Tucson-based utility "took some significant hits last October" when the  Arizona Corporations Commission ordered the utility's shareholders to absorb a  significant portion of costs associated with new coal-fired electrical  generating units, Brooks said.  </P> <P> Tucson Electric reported an $87.4-million net loss on $233 million in revenue  for the six-month period ended June 30. The utility reported a $41.4-million  net profit and $260 million in revenue for the like period a year earlier.  </P> <P> Tucson Electric's stock, which closed at $53 per share on July 26, 1988, the  day that Edison unveiled its uninvited merger with SDG&amp;E, has traded in  recent weeks at about $10 per share.  </P> <P> Tucson Electric's suit names both Edison and SCEcorp, its Rosemead-based  parent. SCEcorp hopes to merge SDG&amp;E into its Edison subsidiary.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP FACES: HUGH HARRIS IS BEYOND CATEGORY  </P> <P> "Black people hurt white people. . . . White people hurt black people. . . .  White people help black people. . . . Black people don't like white people. . .  . White people don't like black people. . . . And on and on."  </P> <P> English singer/songwriter Hugh Harris spat out those lines with increasing  speed and fury, like a rapper out of control.  </P> <P> Harris, who's of Jamacian ancestry, was making a point about daily life  festering with subtle racial tensions.  </P> <P> "I don't like them," said Harris, 25, whose first album, Capitol's "Words for  Our Years," is just out. "I don't let those tensions consume me. I don't write  a lot about race. That would be boring. But being aware of racial tensions  makes you sharp, it heightens your sensibilities."  </P> <P> Maybe that explains why his lyrics seem so full of insight and teem with such  passion. His music doesn't comfortably fit any category -- it's moody and  soulful, laced with rock and folk. His best songs, characterized by his  helter-skelter phrasing, are sad, somewhat bitter commentaries on the human  condition.  </P> <P> "I couldn't do music that can be easily categorized," he pointed out. "Where's  the challenge? I never want to do music that every one else is doing. I'd die  of boredom."  </P> <P> Capitol Records took quite a chance on Harris, who has been involved in music  only since the mid-'80s. It's the latest in a series of careers that Harris,  who's from east London, has dabbled in since he left school at 15.  </P> <P> "I've tried this and that but nothing seemed right," he said. "Music was just  something to do. I never planned a career. I had been writing stuff down as  songs since I was 20 but I'm not really a musician. But I gave myself a crash  course when I had to learn certain things about music. I play a little piano, a  little bass, a little guitar, but I'm not great at anything."  </P> <P> Despite his limited musical experience, Capitol, which signed him because of  his impressive songwriting, eventually let him co-produce his debut album. "I  wanted a hand in the production," he said. "I was afraid they might try to  commercialize my music and fit me in this black category."  </P> <P> To counter any preconceptions about his music, Harris didn't want his picture  on the album cover, which features just a silhouette of him. "If they see a  black face, they expect a certain kind of music," he explained. "If they see no  face, they'll take the music on its face value. I want people to listen to this  album without preconceptions."  </P> <P> Releasing a faceless album, however, is not a particularly wise marketing  strategy. "Who cares about marketing?," he said disdainfully. "If people like  the album, they like it. If they don't they don't. I don't worry about  marketing."  </P> <P> Harris doesn't worry about his music career either.  </P> <P> "If it doesn't work out I'll do something else," he said matter-of-factly. "I  just need to express myself creatively -- somehow. I know that about myself. I  don't have to be in the music business to do that. If I was never in the music  business ever again I'm not sure that I'd miss it." DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

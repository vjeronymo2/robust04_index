			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / DTI demands changes to pension scheme regulation The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday called for several changes to pension scheme regulation in its long-awaited report into the dealings of mini-conglomerate Bestwood. The company was wound up in June 1990 following the misappropriation of more than Pounds 700,000 by its former chairman and chief executive, Mr Tony Cole. Mr Cole also effected the removal of more than Pounds 900,000 from the pension scheme of a Bestwood subsidiary, British Drilling and Freezing, over several years. Most of that was eventually repaid although the scheme lost about Pounds 300,000. Most of the DTI's recommendations have also been suggested by a government panel which was set up following the collapse of the Maxwell pension schemes. In particular, the DTI urges restrictions on the level of employer-related investment by pension schemes. It also urges the appointment of at least one independent trustee to the trustee boards of occupational schemes, a recommendation rejected by the government's advisory panel. The DTI report, which covers events from 1985 to 1989, explains how Mr Cole and his associates were able to remove assets from the pension scheme and use them to invest in companies in which they had a personal interest. The removal of funds, says the report, was carried out through a Bestwood-controlled fund management company, Atlanta Fund Managers, which was the appointed investment manager for the pension scheme in June 1986. In its conclusions, the DTI says that Mr Cole acted improperly 'in causing AFM systematically to breach the restrictions laid down in relation to investments'. He also acted improperly in causing certain investments acquired by AFM from Glen International - the company controlled by financier Mr Terry Ramsden - to be put through to the BDF pension scheme, thus avoiding leaving AFM with losses. Also, he failed to see that trustees of the pension scheme were properly informed of the investments. Meanwhile, the two Best-wood directors who were pension scheme trustees  - Mr Charles Wilkinson and Mr Jeremy Colson, group finance director - were criticised 'for not ensuring that the abuse stopped'. Mr Colson 'wrongly persuaded the trustees to lend Pounds 600,000 to Bestwood at a time when he knew it was having difficulty in obtaining funds'. The DTI report notes that when Bestwood acquired the 75.4 per cent of BDF which it did not own in March 1986, the pension scheme's assets, at roughly Pounds 5m, were more than twice its liabilities. 'The purchase price took into account the surplus as a potential asset of Bestwood.' However the trustees were unable to extract cash from the scheme without the permission of the Superannuation Funds Office. They never formally sought permission to do so. Moreover, the DTI report explains how pension scheme assets were used to buy shares in companies in which Best-wood directors held direct interests although the employee trustees were never informed of these connections between the directors. By June 1988, the market value of the assets of the pension scheme had fallen to Pounds 2.8m from just under Pounds 6m in June 1986. Meanwhile, some assets disappeared from the pension scheme as loans. Some Pounds 300,000 went as loans to stockbrokers Guy Puckle with whom Mr Cole had an account. The loans were shown on the books of the pension scheme as 'cash on deposit'. By June 1988 a further Pounds 359,000 of scheme assets was in unit trusts managed by AFM. In turn, these unit trusts invested assets in other companies connected with Mr Cole or his associates, in violation of unit trust regulations. In addition, of the pension scheme's holdings in quoted UK equities, the largest portion was in shares of Bestwood itself or in the shares of other companies in which Mr Cole or his associates had an interest.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / JP Morgan's 48% rise sustains pace BUOYANT trading and corporate finance revenues helped New York banking group JP Morgan post a 48 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings to Dollars 468m yesterday. The results were better than most Wall Street analysts had expected. But some investors were disappointed at the modest decline in trading earnings from the record second quarter. Along with some profit-taking after the sector's strong run, this left the share price down Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 77 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday. Sir Dennis Weatherstone, the bank's chairman, remarked that 'the year so far has presented plentiful opportunities, and we've been prepared to capitalise on them around the world'. He was particularly pleased with the bank's return on equity, which rose to 23.9 per cent from 18.8 per cent a year ago. Trading revenues again made the biggest contribution to the bottom line. Although they failed to match the record Dollars 520m achieved in the second quarter, they remained strong at Dollars 464m, up 50 per cent from a year ago thanks to big returns from the trading of debt instruments, swaps and other interest rate contracts, particularly in Europe and emerging markets. Although trading remains at the core of JP Morgan's business, analysts said yesterday that they were impressed with the bank's efforts to boost earnings from other lines. In particular, they singled out the 14 per cent increase in corporate finance revenues to Dollars 140m. The improvement was due mostly to a rise in fees from the underwriting of securities issues. Other business segments also showed strong growth. Investment management fees rose 20 per cent to Dollars 116m, operational services fees (primarily from custody, clearing and brokerage services) climbed 14 per cent to Dollars 122m, and gains from investments in equity and fixed-income securities edged ahead to Dollars 98m. Other revenues soared to Dollars 179m, including a big gain on selling part of an investment in Hospital Corporation of America. Net interest income fell slightly to Dollars 439m. One area that may have concerned some investors was non-interest expenses, which rose 18 per cent to Dollars 882m during the quarter. The bulk of the increase, however, was attributable to higher profit-related payments to employees.</p>

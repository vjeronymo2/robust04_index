			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / EC will propose tariff cuts to break trade talks deadlock THE European Community is to propose cuts in tariff protection for manufactured goods in an attempt to break the deadlock in Uruguay round negotiations on global trade liberalisation. The initiative, announced by Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, came during a day of talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart. Mr Kantor said the proposed cuts were 'not yet satisfactory. We need more, not simply be-cause the US needs it, but be-cause we don't think other countries will improve their offers on tariff cuts until they see more movement'. But Mr Kantor praised Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who made a strong appeal in Paris yesterday for open markets during a meeting with Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister. The US trade representative said that 'increasing competition rather than building a wall around Europe' was an absolute necessity. Rejecting French demands for changes in the Blair House agreement between the US and the EC on limiting Europe's subsidised farm exports, Mr Kantor said: 'We are not going to reopen or renegotiate the Blair House agreement.' The EC initiative offering further tariff cuts comes in response to growing frustration that there is no detailed progress on market opening deals reached in Tokyo in July by leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers. Sir Leon called for a special ministerial meeting of the Quad - which groups Japan, Canada, the US and the EC - to resolve disagreements on the July commitments. Mr Kantor yesterday gave conditional support for the special Quad meeting, insisting that 'further progress' was needed in negotiations before such a meeting would be helpful. Talks with the EC continue today. The EC has held back its tariff offer in the hope of winning further market opening concessions from Japan and the US. As a result, it has faced a barrage of criticism from trading partners over the present paucity of its offer, which averages an estimated 26 per cent tariff cut. By comparison, Japan's current offer amounts to 60 per cent, Canada's to 50 per cent and the US to 37 per cent. An EC official said yesterday the new schedule of tariff cuts, to be proposed in Geneva tomorrow during an important stocktaking meeting of all Uruguay round participants, would raise the average EC cut above 33 per cent.

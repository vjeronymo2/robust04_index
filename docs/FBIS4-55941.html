			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 20 (CTK) -- Slovakia must make use  of the "big" money it put into nuclear energy production,  Premier Jozef Moravcik declared today. He said that the only  possibility of doing this and at the same time respecting the  opinion of neighbouring countries was to concentrate on the  safety of nuclear power plant operations. "The project for  completing the nuclear power plant in Mochovce, West Slovakia,  is safer than the European average," Moravcik said.    Cooperation with France provides the possibility for  securing  Slovakia's basic interests in the energy producing sector and  completing the Mochovce plant in a manner that would "serve as  an example" of a safe solution, Moravcik added.    He stressed that the participation of the French and banking  institutions in the Mochovce plant's completion was subject to  the condition that operations would be stopped in the first  reactor of another Slovak nuclear power plant located in  Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia. "The government has accepted  the obligation," Moravcik stressed.</p>

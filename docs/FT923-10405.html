			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Toyota signals end of a dynasty TOYOTA Motor yesterday signalled the end of Japan's most successful corporate dynasty when it appointed a president from within the founding Toyoda ( family, but said the next incumbent would probably come from the group at large. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, aged 63, inherits the job from his elder brother Shoichiro, 67, who becomes chairman. Mr Eiji Toyoda, their 79-year-old uncle, is relinquishing that post to become honorary chairman. Tatsuro, a New York University MBA graduate who in 1984 spearheaded the launch of Toyota's landmark US joint production venture with General Motors, is expected to bring a more international flavour to the job. He said yesterday that such a background had helped him win the post. He added, however, that the speed of technological change dictated that his presidency of the country's biggest car maker would not be nearly as long as Shoichiro's 10 years. When asked whether the company's next president would come from outside the family, he said: 'It is likely.' The complacent nature of family managements in some large companies is coming under increasing criticism as a domestic economic slowdown has put earnings growth into reverse. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, pointing out that the Toyodas were not represented in any other senior management levels below the presidency, held out the prospect of a more collegiate style. Saying that 'management should not depend on a single leader', he announced the appointment as vice-chairman of Mr Masami Iwasaki, who along with Mr Tatsuro Toyoda had been vice-president. Five other directors were made vice-presidents in their place. Industry analysts, while cautioning that any changes in strategy were likely to be modest, said Toyota had to find ways to get to grips with the fall-off in domestic demand. Mr Koji Endo, of S G Warburg Securities, described Tatsuro as 'a top-rated executive, even if he is a Toyoda anyway' and one of the most internationally minded at the company. However, Toyota has recently become markedly more bullish than its rivals on car sales in Japan in the rest of calendar 1992. It is predicting that the worst is over and, after a 4 per cent first-half fall, demand for Toyota models in the July to December period should be flat. Some industry watchers attribute the confidence to pending model launches, and others to aggressive pricing which will cost it earnings previously taken for granted. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda said the company was sticking to that forecast although 'recovery was a little lagging behind'.</p>

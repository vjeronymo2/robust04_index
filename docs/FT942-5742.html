			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Serbs learn to come to terms with sanctions: The United Nations trade ban has hurt but not changed many minds Serbia's leaders are in buoyant mood; the governor of the rump Yugoslavia's central bank says oil coming into the republic is being held up more by its own customs officials seeking tariffs on petrol imports than by any international officials policing sanctions; and President Slobodan Milosevic brags that Serbia could survive sanctions for a millennium. It is not all nationalistic blather. There are some statistics around that give it substance. Hyperinflation appears to have been defeated, industrial production is bottoming out and, on the ground, businessmen and entrepreneurs are telling stories about how they have little trouble, though some additional expense, exporting their wares. 'I have to pay DM3,000 (1,200) to the Bulgarian police and DM6,000 to international inspectors from the CSCE (Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe) or the UN on the border,' says Mr Miodrag Nikolic, owner of Feman, an electrical and machine tools company in Jagodina, central Serbia. 'But one lorry-load is worth half a million so it does not add too much to the price.' Mr Nikolic says his small business has actually benefited from sanctions, gaining access to markets usually reserved for Serbia's huge state companies. 'It sounds funny but sanctions gave us a chance to export,' he says of his company which in April had a turnover of DM850,000. Sanctions have even helped Feman seize control of the market in Macedonia, Serbia's small southern neighbour, which finds tools from western European, or even Slovenia, expensive, says Mr Nikolic. 'Our prices are 45 per cent below even after sanctions.' Sanctions were imposed on the rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) two years ago because of the Serbs' role in the bloody partition of Bosnia. 'Trade takes place but exports are 20 per cent cheaper and imports 20 per cent more expensive,' says Mr Ljubomir Madzar, professor of economics at Belgrade University. For some companies, however, the sanctions have not been so benign. 'We cannot smuggle out living room sets,' says Mr Slobodan Stojanovic, director of foreign trade for Simpo, once a Balkan giant in the furniture industry. 'The only way we have managed to keep our old partners', says Mr Vlastimir Kostic, representative of Metalprogres, a small socially-owned company which makes tools, 'is by selling to them at the lowest price. 'Our customers who risked trading with us during sanctions will be rewarded when they are lifted. We have made sacrifices in order to keep our customers,' who he says are from Italy and Egypt. Mr Kostic says production costs are up 30 per cent as a result of sanctions. 'In the long term sanctions have hurt us, making our goods non-competitive.' It is difficult to gauge the broader economic effects of the sanctions. The official figure is that they have cost the two rump Yugoslav states Dollars 45bn (Pounds 30bn). Industrial production has fallen to a third of its level in 1990. Factories are operating at below half capacity. Per capita gross national product has fallen to less than Dollars 1,000 from Dollars 2,148. Unemployment is running as high as 50 per cent if you include the hundreds of thousands of workers sent on 'forced holidays' over the past two years. However, Mr Madzar points out that sanctions alone cannot account for this. He cites the break-up of Yugoslavia, the interruption of trade and transport links among the country's former republics, the collapse of the socialist system, the cost of war, hyperinflation and 'horrible' mistakes in economic policies. There are, however, some signs of tentative improvement. While industrial production remains far below the pre-sanctions level, it has grown over the past four months, It rose by 3 per cent in April compared with March, though this followed a 24 per cent rise over the previous month, according to official statistics. Mr Ivan Vujacic, a Belgrade economist, says industrial growth can be expected in the aftermath of hyperinflation, but says it would be impossible to sustain an increase in production while sanctions are still in force. Meanwhile, Serbian officials say this year's harvest will be good. The republic has traditionally been self-sufficient in food, exporting wheat, meat, fruits and vegetables. The central bank governor, Mr Dragoslav Avramovic, architect of the economic programme that overnight in January brought inflation from 300m per cent to zero, says sanctions are no longer of crucial importance for Yugoslavia. President Milosevic thinks the economic situation has improved so much that he is no longer in a hurry to reach an agreement on Bosnia. Previously, he has appeared anxious to get an agreement in order to secure the lifting of sanctions. Indeed, western diplomats based in Belgrade say that they have never seen the Serbian leadership so self-confident since sanctions were imposed. 'If the goal was to punish Serbia, the target was hit,' says Mr Predrag Simic, director of the Belgrade Institute of International Politics and Economics. 'But it was missed if the aim was to push the voters in Serbia towards a change.' In the distorted political climate of Serbia, the reason for sanctions is unclear to most people. According to a recent poll in Nin, a Belgrade newsweekly, 42.5 per cent of the Serbian population does not know why sanctions were imposed or how they can be lifted. The next largest group, 19.5 per cent, is convinced that 'nothing can be done because the world hates us'. Mr Simic says people have adjusted to a drop in their living standards, blaming the west instead of the Belgrade leadership. In fact, nine out of 10 people, according to the survey in Nin, feel hardest hit by the ban on international sports competition rather than the economic situation. The severing of cultural, sports, and educational links have devastated Serbian society. Tens of thousands of educated people have emigrated in search of future prospects. Meanwhile, Serbia's geographical position undermines the sanctions. Despite its status as an international pariah, last month, Mr Milosevic was received in Romania with all the honours traditionally reserved for a head of state. 'Sanctions cost our neighbours. Even the rich countries do not have money to compensate these states. So the cheapest thing to do is lift sanctions,' says Mr Avramovic.</p>

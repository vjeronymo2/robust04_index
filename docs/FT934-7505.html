			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Technology: Getting in step with a softer heel - Worth Watching Walking the city streets is a wearing experience for the fittest, not to mention those with ailments which cause painful joints. James Taylor, of London, the bespoke shoemaker, has devised a shoe heel which the company believes greatly reduces the shock of heel strike while walking. The patented cantilever heel which can be fitted to all men's shoes and to ladies' shoes with wider heels, is made from hard-wearing moulded rubber with a semi-circular groove around the back of the heel. In the groove are nine small wedges, or cantilevers, each about half the depth of the groove, which prevent the foot from twisting. As the wearer moves, the air-filled groove acts as a cushion.

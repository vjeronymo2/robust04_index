			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INVOCATIONS AT MEETINGS REFLECT NATION'S TOLERANCE  </P> <P> In response to Walter Adams (March 11) of Orange who suggested that all who  love the Constitution should offer full support to Mayor Richard B. Edgar of  Tustin in his effort to "keep religion out of city government": If you really  love the Constitution, then sacrifice a little of your time to learn of its  background and why the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the practice of  legislative bodies opening their sessions with prayer.  </P> <P> You will be surprised to find that this practice has continued (without  interruption) for almost 200 years since Madison, Franklin and other men  drafted the Bill of Rights.  </P> <P> The Constitution makes room for a variety of beliefs/non-beliefs and sponsors  an attitude that shows no partiality to any one group but lets each flourish  according to the spiritual needs its members deem necessary. So don't try to  impose your personal unbeliefs on others by hiding behind your agnosticism.  Take the mayor's advice when he says it is prudent to be informed about the  law. If the members of the Tustin City Council feel the need for invocations,  they have that right.  </P> <P> GARY WAGNER  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

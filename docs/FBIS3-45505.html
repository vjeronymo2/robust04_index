While inspecting a steel-tube company, Zou stressed that in  addition to appropriate external conditions, enterprises should  take it as an essential point to expand the market share of  their products on the basis of fine quality, scheduled delivery  and good post-sales services.    At Tianjin port yesterday, Zou boarded the vessel "Zhenhe,"  China's first fourth-generation container ship, which was  heading for Europe.    He remarked that the vessel's virgin sail indicated that  China had become one of the countries leading the world in  container transport, and the port was to become one of the best  starting points in the "Eurasian bridge."    Port officials said that the vessel, equipped with  state-of-the-art satellite navigation, telecommunications, and  alarm and unmanned operation systems, is the most up-to-date  container vessel in the world.</p>

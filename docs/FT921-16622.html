			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Arts: The Nutcracker - Covent Garden For the second year running, a pair of principal dancers from the Dance Theatre of Harlem are appearing in the Royal Ballet's Nutcracker. The Royal Ballet has no black dancers, though it has a few Oriental ones, and few people in its Covent Garden audience are black. This gesture is welcome inasmuch as it lifts a colour bar that other British ballet companies have already been removing. This has just been a beginning. In January the Harlem prima ballerina, Virginia Johnson, dances Giselle with the Royal at Covent Garden. More important yet, the Royal and Harlem companies are working offstage in teaching ballet to London's black children. A black star is one thing - but one day we may see a black girl amid the corps de ballet of Snowflakes. I hope so, though I hope that when blacks dance in the Royal ranks they are chosen not for tokenism but for excellence. Judy Tyrus and Donald Williams, the current Sugar Plum couple, are very welcome. Both handsome, they have unusual glamour in Julia Trevelyan Oman's fussy-pretty costumes (the Prince's costume made even Anthony Dowell look like a Christmas cracker). Their dance style is not brilliant but is beautifully pure. I love their basic carriage, relaxed and radiant. Their waists glow, whereas this central area today is usually dead or strained with most Royal (and most European) ballet dancers. A few tiny smudges were surely attributable to nerves and did nothing to spoil their success. Their line is clear, their phrasing sure. I saw two Covent Garden Nutcrackers in a day. Mark Ermler conducted both performances. His account was more theatrical and conventional than his 1989 recording and less sonically artificial. But he is not a great dance accompanist, and he does not relish the score's warmth and lavish detail. The matinee Sugar Plum was Viviana Durante. The whole of her dancing is less the sum of its parts, but I certainly marvel at its many exquisite features. I hail, however, Bruce Sansom's performance as her cavalier. This dancer, returning to his native Royal amid a year with the San Francisco Ballet, has always shown more niceties of style than most men at the Royal, but it is only of late that he has begun to show the kind of firm purposefulness that makes real sense of ballet's princely roles. On this occasion he danced with a new calm and authority, and his partnering was glorious. San Francisco, where the great dancer Helgi Tomasson directs, is probably a good place for Sansom to grow further. Still, I hope he rejoins the Royal soon. The Sugar Plum pas de deux is the great event of Act Two, but in this staging the overwhelming moments are the scene-changes in Act One. The growth of the Christmas tree and toys to giant proportions - just what Tchaikovsky wanted here - is one of the marvels of Covent Garden, and a high point of Julia Trevelyan Oman's art. Almost as thrilling is the moment when a silk dropcurtain suddenly falls into the floor. I can't bear, however, the extent to which that Peter Wright (the producer) makes Drosselmayer the manipulator of the whole show from first to last. Little of this is in the music and, in the obsessive way Stephen Wicks plays the role, it is creepy. Jonathan Burrows, mercifully, gives the role more tenderness and fantasy. Among the many supporting dances, I single out Stuart Cassidy (always outstanding) and Fiona Brockway (reaching a new brightness as a soloist). The party includes some nicely Dickensian vignettes of character playing, and Anthony Bourne is especially fine in the title role - touching, droll, mini-heroic. But the freshest dancing and the most adorable performing are given by the children (Royal Ballet School). I am a sucker for good child performances, and little Hayley Discoll, as Clara, went straight to my heart. Her sincerity, vulnerability and joy are the best rebuke to everything this production gets wrong, the best sign of all its gets right, and the true heart of what The Nutcracker is all about.</p>

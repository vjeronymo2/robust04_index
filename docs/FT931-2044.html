			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: South African fruit industry faces tough year after crop setbacks THE SOUTH African deciduous fruit industry faces a tough year following damage caused to the crop by extreme heat and hail. The total crop will probably fall to 38m cartons - 5m below expectations - from 40m last year. Prices are also under pressure in Europe, the industry's largest market, owing to the twin effect of consumers trading down because of the recession and the large surplus from last year's huge northern hemisphere crop. Mr Louis Kriel, chief executive of Unifruco, the export marketing arm for deciduous fruit, said northern hemisphere stocks were about 40 per cent higher than during the previous season. South Africa has about 33 per cent of the southern hemisphere deciduous fruit market in Europe. After minerals and metals, deciduous fruit is its largest export industry and has shown impressive growth in recent years. Mr Kriel said a feature of the current season was that after 50 years of being South Africa's largest customer the UK would probably be supplanted this year by Germany. About 11m cartons are sold annually to each country.</p>

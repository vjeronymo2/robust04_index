			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / London to Dublin air service planned Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways is finalising an agreement with a new Irish airline to start a franchised service from London City Airport to Dublin, Paul Betts writes. Virgin yesterday said negotiations with a privately owned Irish carrier called Cityjet were 'very advanced' and that an agreement was likely this week. The Irish airline would operate British Aerospace 146 regional jets with Virgin licensed services. Under the franchising agreement the aircraft would be painted in Virgin's red livery and Mr Branson's airline would provide support for maintenance, catering, marketing, sales and training. The Irish carrier plans to operate up to five services a day between Dublin and the London City airport in Docklands. While Virgin intends to continue focusing on long-haul intercontinental routes, Mr Branson sees franchising as an opportunity to expand in the European market. London City airport yesterday announced the start of its first domestic service. In January VLM, a Belgian airline, will start a twice-daily link to Liverpool using a Fokker 50.</p>

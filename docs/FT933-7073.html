			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / MAN cuts payout on 45% fall MAN, the German trucks and engineering group, is to cut its dividend to DM8.50 from DM12 last time following a 45 per cent profits slump in the year to the end of June. Net earnings fell from a record DM418m (USDollars 261m) to a provisional DM230m on sales of DM19bn, down 1 per cent on the previous financial year, the group said in an interim report yesterday. There had been no improvement in business conditions since publication of the company's half-year report in February, it added. The backlog of outstanding orders totalled DM14bn at the end of the year under review, 15 per cent lower than in 1991-92. Incoming orders for the year were down 8 per cent at DM16.6bn. While foreign demand was up 2 per cent, domestic orders were 20 per cent lower at DM6.7bn. Although that suggests improvement from the first half, when total new business was down 14 per cent, the group showed few signs of optimism. However, it said, after climbing steadily through the year, incoming orders in the fourth quarter, at DM4.8bn, were 5 per cent above the last quarter of the previous year. MAN, Germany's second-biggest truck maker after Mercedes-Benz, said personnel cuts would have to continue, particularly in commercial vehicles and the MAN Roland printing machinery divisions. The group has shed nearly 6,000 workers, approximately 9 per cent of its payroll, since mid-1991. Profit figures for this year include provisions for 3,300 more job losses in the current year. Demand for commercial vehicles was down 13 per cent on the year, while orders for engineering products and plant were 6 per cent lower. An 11 per cent rise in turnover from trading activities helped offset a fall of 8 per cent in trucks and no change in engineering sales. Vehicles account for about 40 per cent of group sales and more than half of its annual earnings. German industry was still in deep recession, the report said, and capital investment was falling faster. Weaknesses in most European markets had been exacerbated by devaluations against the D-Mark, while improvements in the US economy had still not had any discernible effects on the group's business.</p>

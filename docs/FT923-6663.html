			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Nikkei surges 6.2% as buyers take heart from aid to banks A RETURN of confidence boosted Japanese shares yesterday, as investors responded to the government's efforts to support the country's ailing financial system and stock market. The Nikkei average of 225 leading stocks jumped 6.2 per cent, closing 949.12 higher at 16,216.88. This was the first close above 16,000 for nearly a month. The index, which plunged to a new six-year low on Tuesday, has rallied more than 1,900 points during the past three trading days. In addition to emergency support measures to help the beleaguered Japanese banks, investors were encouraged by reports that the government is likely to postpone the sale of a tranche of shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone scheduled for the current financial year. The slide in NTT shares, triggered by concerns over the impact on the market of the additional tranche, had dragged down the market during the past few weeks. NTT shares surged by 12.6 per cent yesterday, closing Y62,000 higher at Y555,000 (Pounds 2,284). Buyers included foreign investors, whose ownership of NTT was permitted at the beginning of this month. The government, which still owns two thirds of NTT, postponed sales of 500,000 shares last year because of sluggish market conditions. Mr Mamoru Ozaki, deputy finance minister, said that although no decision had been made, the ministry was discussing postponing share sales of NTT and of JR East, a railway operation of the former state-owned Japan National Railway. The market now awaits next week's announcement of the government's fiscal stimulus package, which will include a large-scale supplementary budget. Ahead of the announcement, Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren, the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, called for emergency economic measures. Early next week, Mr Nagano will present proposals to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, including a cut in the official discount rate, an additional Y10,000bn in public investment spending and the establishment of a joint fund to buy stocks to support the market.

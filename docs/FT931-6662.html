			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Books: The taming of the beast - Anthony Curtis reviews Brian Moore's latest novel NO OTHER LIFE by Brian Moore Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 216 pages WHAT DID Graham Greene really mean when he said that Brian Moore treated the novel like a wild beast and tamed it? Barely suppressed violence is a constant element in all Moore's novels, of which No Other Life is the 17th. The turmoil invariably erupts in some kind of bloodbath sustained over final purgatorial chapters with great narrative skill. In this one the underlying violence is that of the Duvalier 'Papa Doc' regime, and its legacy, in Haiti. The island, with its elite of mulattoes, its military junta, its terrible gangster police and its down-trodden black peasantry, appears here in fictional form as Ganae where the narrator has for many years been a Roman Catholic priest. Father Paul Michael looks back over his life on the island and the charismatic career of his native protege 'Jeannot' whom we see being recruited into his order. This character owes much to the young priest Fr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide of the order of St Francois de Sales, who in the late 1980s proclaimed from his pulpit that Haiti would never achieve democratic elections unless the government was overthrown. Aristide was one of those who, while inciting his flock to political action, found support for it in the Bible. 'Part of our mission,' he said, 'is to destroy the capitalist system. Socialism is closer to the gospel than either capitalism or communism'. It was Liberation Theology with a vengeance. Moore tackles it here head on, and with great understanding. We have been to Haiti before in a modern Catholic novel - in 1958 in Greene's The Comedians. But in Moore, unlike Greene, you do not have that deja vu feeling of familiar content being served up in a fresh setting. Every Moore novel is a new beginning. There is no such place as Mooreland. Wherever Moore's novels are set - Belfast, the South of France, Hollywood, a Californian campus, Toronto, Montreal - the characters are creatures of their environment, true natives, instantly recognisable as such. Moore has moved around the world a good deal since 1921 when he was born in Belfast to be educated at St Malachy's, a Catholic College, where he had his first experience of a violent disciplinary regime; it became the setting for his early novel The Feast of Lupercal. In 1948 Moore emigrated to Canada where he worked as a journalist. He eventually became a Canadian citizen, but one who lives now in Southern California. In his earlier books the battle-ground tended to be domestic and professional. He dramatised the power struggle as it affected relations between men and women at work as well as at home. As an artist Moore is equally accomplished in identifying with, and narrating through, people of either gender. Entire novels may be carried by larger than life heroines, starting with that superb creation, portrayed so memorably by Maggie Smith on screen, the alcoholic Belfast spinster Judith Hearne. But latterly Moore has turned from the contemplation of domestic disorders to forms of martyrdom - individuals forced to suffer from the pressure of history on account of their religious faith. Moore was born into a Catholic family and was from his cradle indoctrinated into the religion which he now says he uses in his books only as 'a metaphor'. But even if he has adopted an agnostic position in his own outlook, religious belief remains an essential ingredient in the Brian Moore fictional mix. In a study of a modern liberated woman, the chic neurotic New Yorker heroine of I Am Mary Dunne, there sounds a far away parental voice on the phone with timely reminders of the doctrine of sin and redemption. And there is just such a wise voice in this new novel; but this time it is the parent's function to put the alternative view from which the novel takes its negative title, that our present existence is the only one we have, and that there is 'no other life' to console us. If that is really true, it makes it so much harder for Father Michael to reconcile himself to the spectacle of corruption and exploitation, of abysmal poverty and cynical indifference to it by the ruling caste, that Moore evokes so powerfully in this short, explosive book. Moore brings this world pulsatingly to life through vivid descriptive writing and a series of beautifully accurate vignettes of the people surrounding his hero. He traces the steps through which Jeannot turns from a compassionate young acolyte into a clerical demagogue whose followers hail him as a saviour. Jeannot's moment of supreme power inaugurates a reign that is brief and ineffectual. It concludes with the dictator Jeannot's final appearance in front of massed crowds after which he mysteriously disappears, sucked back, as it were, into anonymity, into the sun-baked soil from which he first emerged. This movie-like finish ends an enthralling, thought-provoking tale. Once again the fictional beast has been well and truly tamed.</p>

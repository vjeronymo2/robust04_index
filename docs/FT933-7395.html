			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / GEC Althsom chosen for Seoul rail project: Anglo-French group in Pounds 1.6bn high-speed train deal A LONG-RUNNING battle for one of the world's biggest high-speed train projects was decided yesterday when the South Korean government chose GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French joint venture, to supply rolling stock and technology for its planned high-speed line. GEC Alsthom's Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) was selected ahead of Germany's Inter-City Express (ICE) and Japan's Shinkansen. The contract for the 400km line between Seoul and the southern port of Pusan is worth about Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.61bn). Negotiations on the details of the contract will now begin. GEC Alsthom said it expected the contract would be signed by the end of the year. The TGV was selected after six rounds of bids that began two years ago. Mr Lee Ke-ik, the transport minister, said the TGV was chosen because of its lower purchase and operating cost, although the ICE offered more advanced technology. GEC Alsthom's final Dollars 2.4bn bid was 40 per cent lower than its initial offer. Part of the reduction reflected the depreciation of the French franc against the US dollar during the past 18 months. Siemens said yesterday it regretted the South Korean government's decision but added it would remain committed to South Korea and hoped to win sub-contracting work on the project. The power and capacity of the TGV will be increased for South Korea. The Korean trains will each be able to carry 1,038 passengers, more than double the number on the Paris-Lyon line. Construction began last year on the Korean link, which is due to be opened in 2002. GEC Alsthom will supply a total of 46 trains - six carriages plus engines - with deliveries to be completed by 2001. They include 14 trains that will start operating in 1999 on the first segment of track between Seoul and Taejon in central Korea. Mr Pierre Bilger, chief executive of GEC Alsthom, said that half of the equipment for the South Korean trains and systems would be built locally and that Korean partners would receive all the technology necessary for the project. It is the first Asian train order for GEC Alsthom, which has already been selected to provide high-speed trains for the channel tunnel and Spain. A Korean high-speed train, first mooted in the late 1970s, is meant to help solve transport bottlenecks as the country's motorways become clogged with traffic. Traffic congestion is estimated to cost the country Dollars 6bn in lost output each year. World stocks, Page 19</p>

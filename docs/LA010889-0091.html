			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> D.C. JUDGE ORDERS MORE HOMELESS BEDS  </P> <P> About 300 homeless people stood in the courtroom and applauded for a full  minute when District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Harriett Taylor ordered  the city of Washington to provide an additional 620 beds for the homeless,  saying the district's existing shelter policy for an estimated 3,000 to 6,000  people is "inadequate and inept." The ruling was the result of a class action  lawsuit filed by Community for Creative Non-Violence that charged the city has  not provided adequate shelter for its homeless as required under the 1984 D.C.  Right to Shelter Act, a ballot initiative passed by city voters. The suit cited  crowding and poor conditions at shelters and charged people were turned away  from cramped facilities only to lose fingers or toes to frostbite after  sleeping on the street.  </P></p>

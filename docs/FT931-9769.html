			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Havas reveals surprise 24% drop HAVAS, one of France's most powerful media and leisure groups, yesterday revealed a surprise fall in net profits of 24 per cent to FFr820m (Dollars 150m) last year from FFr1.03bn in 1991. Havas, which owns a number of prominent French businesses including the Eurocom advertising group and a chain of regional newspapers, managed to lift sales by almost 6 per cent last year with turnover rising to FFr28bn from 26.4bn in 1991. Mr Pierre Dauzier, Havas's chairman, told shareholders in December that the group would produce static profits in 1992. Difficult economic conditions have affected Havas's travel interests as well as its advertising activities, which were destabilised by restructuring after a series of acquisitions and by the impact of le loi Sapin, the government's new legislation on media buying. In spite of the decline in its 1992 profits Havas has decided to maintain its dividend at FFr12 a share. It has agreed terms to extend the contracts between its Information et Publicite subsidiary and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Teleffusion, the broadcasting group in which it is indirectly a substantial shareholder, for a further five years.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / People: Turner replaces Maxwell at BPB BPB Industries has said goodbye to John Maxwell, its chief executive. He first joined the company on April 1 1992 as finance director and chief executive designate. Maxwell finally moved up to the chief executive post on November 25. His precipitate resignation has come after the company's chairman, Alan Turner, began to feel that 'his appointment was not proving suitable . . .although he was very popular'. Turner is once again taking up the newly vacated chief executive spot, having originally been appointed chief executive in 1978 and having held the same post from 1985 up to Maxwell's elevation. BPB Industries, predominantly known as a manufacturer of plasterboard, is facing tougher times in Europe, particularly in the important French, Italian and Spanish markets. 'Historically a monopoly company, it's now having to embrace a new competitive atmosphere on the continent of Europe,' says one analyst, who sees the departure of Maxwell as a reflection of disagreements over how best to tackle the price war now raging on the continent for BPB's types of product. 'There was no personality clash and nothing has happened which is going to affect the next set of results. As finance director, Maxwell did a wonderful job,' said a spokesman for BPB. Does Turner plan on staying on as chief executive for long, or is the company looking for a swift replacement? 'It's three years since we went outside for a chief executive and in that time the group's been through one hell of a rationalisation programme in the middle of a recession, in the face of intense competition and a price war. We have come through that and the management we have is pretty battle-hardened . . .I hope that we will find someone internally,' he says.</p>

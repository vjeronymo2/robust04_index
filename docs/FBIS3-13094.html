			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron,  committed by a group of Zionist settlers against worshipers and  the subsequent escalation of undeterred suppression and killing  of Palestinian citizens by the Israeli settlers and forces,  emphasized the futility of Israeli authorities' allegations  about the possibility of adopting measures that restrain--and we  do not say stop--the settlers' recklessness.    The full right given to the settlers by the Israeli  authorities to possess weapons and open fire at Palestinian  civilians whenever they are able to do so makes these  authorities officially responsible for all crimes and organized  killing of Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories.    The international consensus to denounce the crime and  condemn  its perpetrators and the influential officials within the  Israeli leadership who stand behind them showed--though with  different degrees, that securing international protection for  the Palestinian people under occupation has become a pressing  subject which needs urgent and immediate measures to deter the  unrestrained Zionist violence. The Zionist violence is  threatening--now more than ever-- to torpedo the peace process.  Peace cannot be realized in the absence of a reasonable degree  of security and peace. The Palestinian people, who have been  and are still the victims of Zionist massacres and the  continuation of the Zionist occupation of their homeland, have  the right to live in peace and to enjoy all their human and  national rights away from terrorism and the weapons and  repressive practices of the Israeli occupation.    The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, as called  for by the international norms and charters on human rights in  times of war, require relentless efforts by all international  forces concerned with peace to realize these rights. They  should not be satisfied with acquainting themselves with  observers reports that reject Israeli violations of these  rights. The world was already acquainted with many of these  violations, which are increasing daily as as a result of the  absence of any international deterrence and because  international legitimacy does not carry out its duties, does not  shoulder its responsibilities, and does not apply a single  yardstick toward the peoples' causes.    It a time for action because the explosive situation in  occupied Palestine requires a serious position from the  international community and the United States, in particular--a  position which contributes to dissipating the imminent Zionist  danger that exposes the whole peace process to deterioration and  setback.    The United States has announced more than once its eagerness  to render the peace process successful--the process for which  the United States is the main sponsor. The United States has  repeated this positions scores of times. So can the United  States prove the credibility of its ideas by forcing the Israeli  Government to accept practical measures that secure  international protection for the Palestinian people? The United  States should be aware that the Hebron massacre has not only  exposed the falsity of Israel's eagerness to realize peace, but  has also revealed the dangerousness of the continuation of this  situation--we mean the continuation of occupation and the  continuation of settlements and settlers. This question does  not go along with the peace process, peace spirit, and the  efforts to establish peace.    It is time for the United States to be aware that this stage  requires adding deeds to words, keeping away from ambiguity, and  resorting to clarity of positions--as they are and as they  should be--active positions against crimes, terrorism, and  occupation that deter the killers, provide protection for the  Palestinian people, and keep the road to peace open until its  noble objectives are realized.</p>

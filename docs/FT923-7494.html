			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Palestinian leader walks tightrope towards peace: The role of Faisal Husseini THEY slaughtered six sheep to honour the son of Abdel Kader and in the Bedouin tradition the men of the village of Sawahreh gathered to talk before their feast of mansaff - mounds of steamed lamb and rice. High in the stony hills of the West Bank of the River Jordan towards the little town of Bethlehem in the simple breeze-block house of Sheikh Kasem el Sourakhi they welcomed Abu Abed in the traditional way as a local statesman and tribal leader. Among the many who expressed greetings was an old man dressed in brown robes edged with gold thread who stepped forward and kissed the honoured guest on both cheeks, declaring: 'Ah, the loved one of the people.' The object of all this attention, better known to the world as Faisal Husseini, leader of the Palestinians under Israeli occupation, had come to the village of Sawahreh to burnish his support among a small, but important element of his constituency - the Bedouin tribesmen of the West Bank. Known affectionately in the Arab way as Abu Abed, literally 'father of Abed', Faisal Husseini has emerged as by far the most important Palestinian of the occupied territories, and the key figure in extremely delicate peace negotiations involving the Israelis, the Palestinians, and the Americans. As preparations go forward for the resumption of Middle East peace talks in Washington on August 24, Mr Husseini's importance is certain to grow. His is not an easy task, caught between old enemies and under pressure from all quarters. He likens his position to that of 'someone who is trying to walk on a wire between two high buildings'. Many, from both sides of the dispute and among American officials, will be praying that he manages to keep his balance, for he is perhaps the only figure capable of exerting a semblance of authority over the fractious Palestinians of the territories in the testing months ahead. Courteous and quietly spoken, the balding and slightly overweight Mr Husseini draws part of his authority from the fact that his father, Abdel Kader Husseini, who died in battle in 1948, endures in people's memories as perhaps the most authentic Palestinian hero of the independence struggle. Descendants of the Prophet Mohammed, the Husseinis are also the closest thing to nobility in status-conscious Palestinian society. As the heat of a mid-summer's day brought beads of perspiration to the brows of those present, Mr Husseini took calls on his cellular phone and fielded questions about progress towards peace, seeking to reassure his audience that the process seemed to be on the right track, and that Jewish settlements on Arab land were being curbed. He also gave the impression that Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the new Israeli leader, was someone he could do business with. 'The situation is better than it was before. . .' Mr Husseini told his audience, to which an old man interjected, somewhat sceptically, it seemed, 'Inshallah - God willing.' Mr Husseini felt obliged to correct one of his hosts who addressed him as the 'leading man of peace'. A ripple of polite laughter greeted his reply that 'first of all I am not the leading man of the peace process, the leading man is Abu Ammar (Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman)'. Faisal Husseini, now in his early 50s, formed his Arab Studies Society, a kind of political action group, in the late 1970s. Egypt and Israel had made peace in 1979; however, there seemed little chance that the rest of the Arab world would follow and the PLO was bitterly opposed to the Camp David agreement. But Mr Husseini has plugged on, enduring periods in jail and moments of despair, in his efforts to chart a political course for his people under occupation. All the while his stature grew in the towns, villages and hamlets of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He is regarded as much more than a political figure. In Palestinian eyes, he is a tribal chief, and would-be peacemaker not just with the Israelis, but between feuding Palestinians, as well. On a recent particularly hectic working day, no fewer than 430 people representing all strata of Palestinian society passed through his offices in Arab east Jerusalem, seeking his help as a counsellor, friend and arbiter of disputes ranging from marital problems to ancient feuds between families. Mr Mehdi Abdul Hadi, a prominent Palestinian academic and activist, said that Mr Husseini, with the 'blessing and encouragement' of the PLO, was exercising 'national authority' in the territories. He had become, Mr Hadi observed, the 'address for the Palestinian house'. In contrast to the severe constraints that the previous government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir sought to impose on Mr Husseini, the new administration is, for the time being, giving him room to move. He has been allowed, for example, to reopen the offices of his Arab Studies Society in an east Jerusalem hotel. A proposed amendment to Israel's 1986 anti-terrorism law, allowing Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza openly to meet Mr Arafat and other PLO officials will also enhance Mr Husseini's visibility. On the drive from Jerusalem to Sawahreh for the mansaff, Faisal Husseini had seemed preoccupied, for he has much on his plate at the moment. Among his main concerns is how to ensure Palestinian security, should an interim self rule agreement be reached with Israel, involving a pull-back of the Israeli military from Arab population centres. He has proposed a 20,000-strong 'police force' to guard security. He argues that it would be disastrous for the Palestinians if, having been granted autonomy, they were unable to provide a secure environment. He warns of threats from armed Jewish settlers and from a local 'mafia' of drug dealers and car thieves. One worry for Mr Husseini is fear of factional strife involving the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas, which opposes compromise with Israel. Mr Husseini is also being advised to take better care with his own security and fairly recently he acquired several bodyguards, who are not permitted by Israel law to carry arms. In his quiet way, Mr Husseini acknowledges the dangers. 'Now there is more risk,' he says. 'Yes, I must be more careful.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [HINA report: "Granic Is Not Going to Belgrade"] </F>   [Text] Dr. Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister of the Republic of Croatia, stated that Croatia would  persist on the position that the international sanctions against  the so-called FRY not be lifted or suspended unless the status  of the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] is resolved, and that he did  not intend to go to Belgrade for the time being.    Minister Granic said this on 17 May, in the introductory  speech at the session of the Foreign Policy Parliament  Committee, at which he spoke about the present foreign political  position of Croatia. Croatian ambassadors to the UN, the  European Union, the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and Belgium,  Germany, Turkey, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Slovenia also  participated in the Committee activities.    The main topics of the 15th Committee session, chaired by  Dr.  Zarko Domljan, were the international position of Croatia, the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the Washington and Vienna  agreements, and relations with the neighboring countries and  international superpowers.    "Croatia has never been in a better international position  than it is now," said Dr. Granic, adding that the procedure for  accepting Croatia in the Council of Europe has been restarted,  and that there have been announcements that economic  arrangements with international financial institutions will be  made.    Everybody present agreed that the main reasons for the  improvement of the position of Croatia were the agreements  between Croats and Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which, as Dr.  Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador to the UN in New York, said,  Croatia must strictly observe. He, like the other participants,  said that Croatia is still in a very difficult position, and  that the Bosniak- Croat federation is also a chance for Croatia  to get closer to Europe.    Nobilo also emphasized the importance of the "clear and  aggressive appearance" Croatia made before the international  forces with the aim of changing the UNPROFOR mandate, and to  channel the money spent on the "static preservation of the  situation" in the UNPA's to financing the return of the refugees  and the restoration of the country.</p>

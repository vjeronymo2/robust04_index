			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / BBC staff criticise bureaucracy BBC STAFF members believe the corporation still suffers from a high level of bureaucracy and red tape, and are critical of the organisation's management at all levels. The negative verdicts came in the most extensive sampling ever of BBC staff about their attitudes to work, the corporation and its management. Nearly 4,900 people - 55 per cent of those asked  - answered 150 questions in a survey that cost Pounds 85,000. Staff also made it clear they believed the BBC operated as 'a system of baronies and territories', had a 'centralised, top-down, controlling structure that hindered departmental co-operation', and people did not feel secure in their jobs. There was also an echo of support for the argument made by Mr Mark Tully, BBC South Asia correspondent, that there was an atmosphere of fear in the corporation with people wary of speaking their minds. Respondents to the questionnaire said that they did not think it 'safe to say what they feel' and did not believe what was communicated to them about the BBC. Staff were asked to respond to questions on a scale of one to five. Asked to what extent bureaucracy was minimised in the BBC, the average score was 1.7. There was also a much more positive side to the survey which showed that staff were very proud to work for the BBC (3.8), and believed it provided an excellent public service (4.0). Staff believed the BBC was a better place to work than elsewhere (3.4), although they did not think it operated with the full involvement of all staff (1.8). Ms Margaret Salmon, BBC director of personnel, said yesterday that such strong negative and positive results were not unusual in organisations going through a difficult period of change. Staff were also given the chance to say what single thing they would change if they were in charge of the corporation. Only 5 per cent elected to replace Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the chairman of the BBC's board of governors and Mr John Birt, the director-general. Three per cent wanted to abolish Producer Choice, the system of total costing which also gives producers the right to buy services from the outside market. Twenty per cent wanted to improve management communication, accessibility, responsiveness and credibility. A further 20 per cent wanted to see more staff involvement and responsibility. The third most popular suggestion came from the 18 per cent who wanted to thin the ranks of middle management and accountants. Ms Salmon said yesterday that mangers would now be meeting with staff to see what action could be taken to meet staff criticisms. A further survey is to be carried out next year to monitor any improvements. Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the broadcasting union, warned yesterday that the BBC was trying to suggest that the main problems were presentational. What staff were saying, Mr Lennon pointed out, was that they did not like what was being done to them.</p>

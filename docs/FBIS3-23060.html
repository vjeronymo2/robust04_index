			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Jijon, with information from Cristian </F> Zurita in Quito]    [Text] Described as a radical faction of the  Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (PCMLE), combined with  dissidents from Alfaro Lives [AVC] and Montoneras Free  Fatherland [MPL], "Red Sun" appears to be one of the two Shining  Path [SL] groups in South America outside Peru.    The first time that the words "Red Sun" appeared in the  Ecuadoran press was on 2 January 1992. Lost among the pages of  the Red columns, the newspapers published the report of a  dynamite attack on the Offices of the Supreme Electoral Court in  Quito, which occurred during the night of 31 December 1991. That  morning, a flyer had been circulating in the media editorial  rooms. In it, a certain "General Ruminahui Revolutionary  Commando" group took credit for the act. It also predicted the  resumption of the armed struggle during 1992, hailed  "Marxism-Leninism-Maoism," and called for a struggle on behalf  of "the Red Sun of liberation." No one paid much attention. Nor  had anyone done so in Lima 12 years earlier, when, during May  1980 (a day before the elections), five hooded persons entered  the electoral office in Chuschi, Ayacucho, tying up the official  in charge and burning the ballot boxes. It marked the beginning  of the Shining Path war, whose spread through Latin America  apparently is being attempted.    During 1992, at least 14 attacks claimed by "Red Sun" were  reported. Most of them were dynamite explosions in public  offices during the early morning hours, explained as a rejection  of the privatization plans of Sixto Duran Ballen's government.  By 1993 (after Abimael Guzman's capture), "Red Sun's" activity  had declined considerably: Only three attacks were reported, one  on the trans-Ecuadoran oil pipeline (causing only minor damage).  Although, last August, the defense minister, General (ret.) Jose  Gallardo, after admitting the existence of "Red Sun" to the  Congress, described it as "incipient and under control"; one  fact is true: a minuscule Maoist group with a clearly Shining  Path orientation has declared war against the Ecuadoran state.  According to Simon Strong, a British journalist and expert on  Shining Path, "The rebels have demonstrated that, once the phase  of embryonic entrenchment in one locality has been completed,  depending on the strategic circumstances, they will make their  power felt." Unlike the Peruvian forces of order, those of  Ecuador have one advantage: they have been warned.  <H5>  Who Are They, Where Are They? </H5>   What is known about "Red Sun"? Two years since the start of  its armed activities, the state intelligence services are able  to draw a profile: It is a small Maoist group (calling for the  prolonged people's war), consisting of approximately 50  militants (and some 300 sporadic sympathizers), operating  primarily in university environments. They are headed by a  central committee, consisting of five members whose names are  unknown, and which is structured in the form of regional and  base committees. For the present, the group's power appears very  slight, and its destiny, linked to the survival or nonsurvival  of Shining Path, on which it depends ideologically, financially,  and militarily. Its origin is not very clear: Police  intelligence attributes it to a meeting of dissidents from  Alfaro Lives and Montoneras Free Fatherland (held about 1990),  headed by Kleber Gia Bustamante. According to naval  intelligence, however, its origin lies in the breakoff of a  Maoist branch of the old Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of  Ecuador, which reportedly has made contact with the  International Revolutionary Movement, the Communist  International, over which Abimael Guzman wields an influence.    The police theory (pointing to Alfaro Lives dissidents)  agrees with the findings of the Peruvian police investigations.  In 1991, Victor Malca, the Peruvian interior minister, claimed  that Shining Path was possibly allied with a faction of Alfaro  Lives. He remarked: "They say that they have laid down their  arms, but there is a small group among them apparently linked  with Shining Path, and operating in the Piura sierra region,  near Huancabamba." Marco Troya, an AVC leader, denied the story,  asserting: "Although we respect Shining Path, we do not agree  with its methods." Edgar Frias, one of the two survivors of the  AVC central commando group, commented: "I was in Peru, but  Shining Path was something totally different; we had no  relationship whatsoever." Pedro Moncada, one of the high-ranking  cadres in AVC, which is currently attempting to become a legal  party, gave a forceful denial: "We do not know anything about  it."    Nevertheless, the Naval Intelligence Service has followed a  different path: Its members claim that "Red Sun" is the armed  representative of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Communist Party of  Ecuador (PCMLE-Maoist), a radical faction of the  Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador. They call it an  organization that has proposed the "armed struggle" since 1964,  when it broke off from the Communist Party, linked  internationally with Moscow.    Nicknamed "the Chinese," because it is identified with Mao  Tse-Tung's revolution and the People's Republic of China, the  PCMLE maintained a critical position toward the electoral  system. It developed mainly in university environments and in  the teachers' union organization, but became increasingly  distant from Beijing until about 1975, when its linkage with the  Communist Party of Albania began. In 1979, PCMLE militants  became established as a political party, taking as its name the  Democratic People's Movement [MPD].    Although it is denied officially, the MPD is considered the  legal and public representative of the PCMLE, operating in the  teachers' union through the National Union of Teachers, UNE, and  in university environments through the University Leftist  Revolutionary Front, FRIU.    Clandestine, and governed by a five-member central  committee,  the PCMLE reportedly received a delegation from the Shining Path  organization in Europe during 1989, to propose its affiliation  with the Peruvian revolution. The details are unknown, but the  central committee apparently refused to submit to "Gonzalo's  Thought" (as Abimael Guzman's philosophy is called). The  dissidents, who were expelled, became united in the  PCMLE-Maoist. According to naval intelligence, that same year  they reportedly joined with the dissidents from Alfaro Lives and  Montoneras Free Fatherland.  <H5>  From Mao to Guzman </H5>   "For 29 years, the PCMLE has preached armed struggle without  ever moving to action." This statement was made by an  "ex-Chinese" who was later a militant in Alfaro Lives. Now a  member of the group that surrendered its arms to the Rodrigo  Borja government, he is attempting to form a new political  party, Patriotic Union. He added: "That preaching of armed  struggle is the principal means of attracting members but, since  nothing ever happens, there is never a move to action. As soon  as they arrive, they leave. For that reason, if those dissidents  are involved, it is possible that a faction of the PCMLE has  succumbed to the influence of President Gonzalo" (the title by  which Abimael Guzman is known).    That preaching of armed struggle and the PCMLE's development  in university environments have prompted the state intelligence  services to discern a possible "Red Sun" stronghold at Guayaquil  University. They cite a student demonstration on the outskirts  of the university compound in September 1992, against the  government's economic measures. During it, slogans were chanted  calling for the release of Abimael Guzman, then recently  captured in Lima. They also cite the statements made by an  ex-FRIU militant, Joffre Macias, a student of obstetrics at  Guayaquil University. In September 1993, he assured the press  that "Red Sun" would have its base of operations at Guayaquil  University, and would be headed by the MPD.    Gabriel Cabrera, spokesman for the PCMLE in Guayas,  declared:  "I believe that `Red Sun' is a creation of naval intelligence,  and they want to implicate us, because we are the only ones  maintaining the basic principles of the revolution in this  country." Immediately after Joffre Macias's accusations, the  ex-MPD deputy, Jaime Hurtado, denied them; and the present  deputy and UNE leader, Juan Jose Castello, called the defense  minister to Congress. General (ret.) Jose Gallardo neither  confirmed nor denied anything. He commented: "Military  intelligence has not prepared any report intended to establish  the links that might exist between `Red Sun' and the MPD." He  also stated that "Red Sun" exists, and that its members have  been identified, as have the national and foreign organizations  with which they are connected.    Based on the statements of Jaime Cortez Pozo (a 19-year-old  Quito native and university student, the first one arrested on  charges of belonging to "Red Sun"), a November 1993 police  report cited Kleber Gia Bustamante as a member of the "Red Sun"  central committee. His present whereabouts are a mystery. His  father, Clemente Gia Gia, claims: "After 13 years of struggle he  obtained his release, and is now enjoying all his citizen's  rights. He is a scholar, an ideologue, who has been in Europe  for years, studying and working on research." If he has joined  the International Revolutionary Movement, as the security  services think, it is likely that we shall have more news about  him sooner or later.  <H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5> <H5>  Kleber Gia: In "Red Sun"? </H5>   Kleber Elias Gia Bustamante, accused by the police of being  a  member of the "Red Sun" central committee, has been living  clandestinely since his escape from the Garcia Moreno Prison,  where he was held accused of assassinating the industrialist,  Jose Antonio Briz Lopez. In October 1990, the third judge of  criminal proceedings in Pichincha, Gonzalo Falconi, pronounced  the invalidity of the process by prescription. Since then,  Kleber Gia has been legally free; however, his whereabouts are  unknown. According to his father, he is living in Europe, a  claim corroborated by his ex-comrades from M-19: "Kleber was  never a Maoist. His ideological training is incompatible with  Shining Path."</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Winners? They just lost less - Unit trust performance this year To speak of unit trust 'winners' since the UK market peak in February is to talk in entirely relative terms. The so-called winners have simply lost investors less money than other unit trusts. Since the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, raised short-term interest rates on February 4, the only sectors (see table at right) to have been profitable, on average, have been Japan and money markets. The Japanese market has turned since a period of decline, but analysts differ about how quickly it may recover. The markets of the Far East generally have been in decline since February, so Japan's performance helped to pull up the Far East (including Japan) sector compared with Far East (excluding Japan). Europe has been less of a disappointment than other parts of the world, with smaller companies delivering the stronger performance and a gradual fall in interest rates. The Fed's move was designed to pre-empt a rise in inflation, fuelled by the potential of a stronger than expected recovery, but it upset nervous US and UK markets. The Dow Jones index fell by 5 per cent between February 1 and June 1, recovering from a drop of almost 10 per cent at the beginning of April. The FT-SE-A All-Share fell by just under 15 per cent over the same period, after an extended period of strong performance. The bottom of the unit trust performance table is inhabited by UK funds, with the notable exception of UK smaller companies. The tables on the left list the performance of the top and bottom funds in each UK sector over the period. A cursory glance at the funds which are not preceded by a negative sign (UK Equity General and Gilt and Fixed Interest) shows some good gains, of up to 13.4 per cent. But a closer look reveals that all but one of these are reverse index or 'bear' funds, which use derivatives to deliver the opposite of an index. In the UK Equity Growth sector, a noticeable number of the better-performing funds are recovery trusts. These stocks usually do well when an economy is coming out of recession but are not usually associated with good performance in falling markets. But Mary Blair, Fidelity's product development director, believes the UK market has over-reacted in the degree to which it has dropped, and that recovery is still the dominant theme. 'The markets have gone down because of fears that interest rates will go up but, ironically, that fear is because it looks as if the economic recovery is happening,' she says. 'Small companies and recovery stocks are productive companies which benefit in a consumer recovery.' Some of the over-reaction could be due to the use of trading in derivatives. Since there are no futures contracts in smaller companies, the UK Smaller Companies sector has been insulated from the type of volatility associated with these instruments. George Luckraft, director at Carrington Pembroke (which changed its name recently from John Carrington &amp; Co.), believes that just as futures have helped to magnify falls in the UK market, they were also the driving force behind the strength of the market towards the end of last year. Two of the company's funds - Pembroke and Pembroke Balanced - appear among the winners in the UK Equity Growth and UK Equity General sectors. Luckraft says they have not done as badly as others as some of the smaller stocks in them have delivered good performance and also because some stocks were shifted into oils in the past few months. Integrated oil has been the best-performing UK sector since the market peak. Given the recent turbulence in the bond markets, it is no surprise to find that the international fixed-interest, UK gilt and fixed interest, and sectors exposed to holdings of bonds - such as the UK Balanced sector - are all down. Bond prices had begun to drop before the Fed's move and, as Graham Bowley explains on page V, the continued fall in bond prices indicates that inflationary fears are not yet over. But Luckraft believes that after the 15 per cent fall in equities prices in the UK, it is not a good time to sell UK unit trusts. 'It will be a quiet summer but, at the end of it, when interim results come through showing improved earnings, we could have a good end to the year.'

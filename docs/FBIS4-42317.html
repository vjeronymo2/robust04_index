			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ban"-signed report: "Number of Crimes in Germany </F> Increasing"]    [Text] Bonn, 30 May -- German police registered 6.75  million criminal offenses last year, that is some 2.7 percent  more than in 1992. This emerges from the 1993 "Police Criminal  Statistics" that were presented by Interior Minister Kanther  (Christian Democratic Union) and Brandenburg's Interior Minister  Ziel (Social Democratic Party of Germany -- SPD), the chairman  of the interior ministers' conference in Bonn on Monday [30  May]. Kanther said the latest developments are a cause for  concern. "Efforts at crime prevention must be significantly  increased at all levels." Legal and police measures are to be  adapted to the "criminal challenge." Ziel pointed out that crime  figures in eastern Germany have reached western German levels.  Offenses against property, border and transit crimes are  especially high in eastern Germany. Ziel said the reason for  this is the wide gap in prosperity between Germany and its  neighbors to the East.    The 1993 report is the first criminal statistics covering  all  of Germany. It is based on reports by police stations in the  laender and registers offenses and suspects, but not convictions.    Kanther announced that the coalition will present an  amendment to the Federal Criminal Law before the end of this  legislative term. He rejected Ziel's proposal to divide the  Crime Prevention Act that was adopted by the Bundestag recently  into controversial and undisputed sections and to pass these in  the Bundesrat. Kanther stressed that the package of laws is  "moderate" and not the "Union's doctrine." He rejected SPD  criticism of the key witness regulation for offenders involved  in organized crime, of the envisaged speeding up of procedures,  and the Federal Intelligence Service's new responsibilities. He  said that the latter must have the possibility of passing on  information that it comes across by coincidence. The package of  laws has to be adopted as an entity. Ziel criticized this  attitude. He called for talks. The Bundesrat's domestic  affairs committee last week rejected the coalition's bill by 10  votes to six.    The two ministers welcomed the fact that the detection rate  rose from an average 42.3 percent to 43.8 percent. In western  Germany it was even 46.5 percent. However, the detection rate  for murder and homicide cases decreased from 91.2 percent to  84.7 percent. By investigating some 2.96 million offenses, some  2.1 million suspects were tracked down in 1993. The damage  caused by crimes is almost 5 billion German marks. More than 50  percent of all offenses are thefts. There were above average  increases in offenses against the foreigner and asylum laws,  forgery of documents, theft from vending machines, and  pick-pocketing. Decreases were registered in handling stolen  goods, heroin trafficking, car thefts, and bicycle thefts.    Statistics on violent crimes present an irregular picture.  In western Germany it went up by 1.8 percent. The report does  not contain comparative figures for eastern Germany. Yet, at  198 in the whole of Germany, the rate of offenses per 100,000  inhabitants was lower than in the west German laender (203). A  total of 1,468 cases of murder and homicide were registered,  which is slightly more than in 1992.    Drug related crime decreased by 1.7 percent in the west  German laender. The number of deaths caused by drugs decreased  from 2,099 to 1,738. The number of "first consumers" of hard  drugs also went down -- from 14,346 in 1992 to 12,994 in 1993.  Accordingly, "direct procurement crimes" (such as burglaries in  chemists) sank by 1.9 percent. Of all crimes, 6.9 percent fell  under the category of "indirect procurement crimes"; in 1992 the  relevant figure was 7.8 percent.    Kanther pointed out that the number of suspects who are  Germans or have been living in Germany for a long time is going  down. The increasing number of foreigners among the suspects --  in western Germany the percentage rose from 32.2 percent to 36.2  percent, in Germany as a whole it is 33.6 percent -- are  foreigners who came to Germany only recently or who were here  temporarily. A total of 37 percent of all crimes committed by  foreigners were committed by asylum seekers. Kanther reported  that in 1993, 2,400 "touts" were detained. Fifty percent of all  asylum seekers were taken to Germany by these people under false  pretenses. That is why there is a link between border  protection and general crime prevention, Kanther said.</p>

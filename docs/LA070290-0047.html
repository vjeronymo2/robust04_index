			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CARDINALS' UNEARNED RUNS ENOUGH TO BEAT DODGERS, 6-5  </P> <P> Rex Hudler and Willie McGee scored on third baseman Mike Sharperson's error to  cap a four-run sixth inning as the St. Louis Cardinals rallied from a five-run  deficit to beat the Dodgers, 6-5, Sunday at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> The Cardinals' comeback spoiled Rick Dempsey's three-for-four day and Kirk  Gibson's two-hit, three-runs batted in performance.  </P> <P> The Dodgers grabbed a 5-0 lead after three innings. Gibson had two-run double  and Dempsey an RBI single in the first inning to get the Dodgers started.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive wild game between the two teams. The Cardinals  got 12 hits off four Dodger pitchers, and Los Angeles got 11 hits off fifth St.  Louis pitchers. On Saturday night, the Cardinals won, 6-5, as each team had 13  hits.  </P> <P> On Friday night, Fernando Valenzuela pitched a no-hitter while the Dodgers had  12 hits.  </P> <P> With the Cardinals trailing, 5-2, Jose Oquendo opened the sixth with a double  that chased starter Mike Morgan. Oquendo took third on Jim Poole's wild pitch  and scored on Ozzie Smith's groundout. Poole walked Tom Pagnozzi, threw two  pitches to Hudler and then left with an injury. Tim Crews (1-3) walked Hudler  and, with two out, gave up McGee's RBI double as St. Louis closed to within  5-4.  </P> <P> Terry Pendleton faked a squeeze bunt and Dempsey tried to pick Hudler off  third, but his throw got past Sharperson at third and sailed into left field.  Hudler scored, with the hard-charing McGee right behind.  </P> <P> At first Dempsey was charged with an error, but the scoring was changed after  the game.  </P> <P> Frank Dipino (4-1) pitched two shutout innings of relief and Lee Smith got the  last three outs to pick up his 10th save.  </P> <P> Morgan, who leads the majors with three shutouts, allowed four straight singles  with one out in the fourth. Oquendo and Pagnozzi each had an RBI in the inning.  </P> <P> The Cardinals' sixth inning took Scott Terry off the hook. Terry was making his  second start because Bryn Smith has a sore neck. Terry allowed seven hits in  three innings, and with four earned runs saw his earned-run average rise to  7.59.  </P></p>

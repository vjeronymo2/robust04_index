			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TITANS HAND UCI WOMEN 12TH CONSECUTIVE DEFEAT  </P> <P> The UC Irvine women's team lost its 12th game in a row Thursday, falling 67-46  to Cal State Fullerton in Titan Gym.  </P> <P> Irvine also learned that Yvonne Catala, a freshman forward who had been the  team's leading scorer, will be out the rest of the season. Catala injured her  knee against Nevada Las Vegas Saturday, but Coach Dean Andrea hoped she would  be able to return this season. But a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test showed a  cartilage tear, and Andrea said Catala will not be back.  </P> <P> The Anteaters (1-15, 0-7) fell behind by 18 points at halftime Thursday and  trailed by as many as 26.  </P> <P> "It's getting to be like the Navy," Andrea said. "Every day is an adventure."  </P> <P> Only two Irvine players -- Kathy Lizarraga and Kim Cox -- scored in double  figures. Both scored 11.  </P> <P> Fullerton (9-9, 4-5) has won three consecutive games after losing five in a  row.  </P> <P> Genia Miller scored 20 points and had 13 rebounds in the victory. Jill Matyuch  added 13 points and Kathy Werth had 12.  </P> <P> "We have a chance to dig ourselves out," Fullerton Coach Maryalyce Jeremiah  said. "But if we lose a game to any one other than the top three (Nevada Las  Vegas, Cal State Long Beach and Hawaii), that changes the perspective. . . .  We'd probably be very happy with a 15-win season. We'd have to win six of our  last nine, but it's possible." ROBYN NORWOOD In California Collegiate Athletic  Assn. women's basketball: Chapman 84, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 72 -- Julie King  scored a season-high 27, Bethel Trice had 22 and Jennifer Uecke added 20 for  Chapman (14-6, 2-3) at home. Chapman trailed, 40-37, at halftime, but King had  14 to lead the Chapman comeback. Vanessa Hornbuckle scored 15 for Cal Poly San  Luis Obispo (8-11, 2-3). In men's nonconference wrestling: Cal State Fullerton  30, Missouri 14 -- Scott Schumm scored a pin over Greg Warren 1:50 into the  match at 150 pounds to lead Fullerton at Central State in Edmond, Okla. Jeff  Maes of Cal State Fullerton won a 12-6 decision at 126 pounds and Ramon Diaz  won, 6-3, at 177 pounds. Nebraska 33, Cal State Fullerton 8 -- Only Lyndon  Campbell and Dan Henderson won decisions for Cal State Fullerton against No. 4  Nebraska. Campbell won a 7-3 decision over Dave Droegemueller in the 134-pound  class and Henderson defeated Tucker Thompson, 8-5, in the 167-pound class.  Fullerton also lost to Central State, 26-14.  </P></p>

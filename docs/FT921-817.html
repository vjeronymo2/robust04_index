			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Letter: Hands off the sumo wrestler Sir, You report that the Samoan wrestler Konishiki is set to become yet another cause celebre in the absurd skirmishing between Japan and the US ('US and Japan tussle over gentle giant from Hawaii', March 24). If the US senate does intend using Konishiki as a battering ram (for what, one may wonder), then it could usefully bear in mind one point that your correspondent, too, has overlooked. It is not disputed that some of those who govern sumo are nervous about a foreigner becoming yokozuna - in much the same way that people didn't like Kerry Packer's cricket. Whether these people are called purists or racists is a separate argument. However, the factors for promotion in sumo, in addition to the qualities of technique and character that your correspondent mentions (and admits that Konishiki lacks to a degree), include a clear guideline - that he win two consecutive tournaments, or achieve the same score as the eventual winner (this isn't as daft as it sounds). Konishiki has failed thus far to do either. Sumo's governing body has to deal with a number of problems in the sport, including the consequences of recently promoting several wrestlers to yokozuna who then failed miserably. They are keen to avoid this mistake again. Whatever the 'racist' views of the popular press in Japan, Konishiki will or won't become yokozuna in much the same way that all his Japanese predecessors have. US government, hands off. Paul Blamire, 1-2-12 Midorigaoka, Meguro-ku, 152 Tokyo, Japan</p>

Addressing the forum "Reality and Prospects for Russia's  Economic Development," he said that the Moscow administration  would work out a privatization program of its own. He accused  the Committee for State Property, led by Anatoliy Chubays, of  sacrificing economic results to politics and of squandering  state money.    He categorically disagrees with the Chubays-developed  program, according to which the privatization of enterprises in  1994 will be based on their balance cost in 1991 prices. The  1.5 Tn rubles at which the Committee for State Property  estimated the property to be privatized for vouchers will not  suffice even for maintaining this committee's bloated staff,  stated Luzhkov.    He also said that the idea of democratic privatization was a  failure and that the voucher funds will be a failure, too. The  privatization program violates the law on property, sets the  federation and its constituent members against each other, and  disregards local conditions and specific features of individual  branches and enterprises.    He emphasized that Moscow would be guided by its own  interests and by the need to replenish the state treasury and  stimulate industrial production. "If the Chubays program is not  revised, we'll have many troubles," he said.</p>

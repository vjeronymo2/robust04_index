			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Observer: Grecian 900 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, whose troops control about 70 per cent of Bosnia, is not a name usually identified with peace and ethnic harmony. So some surprise to see that the Greek Orthodox Church has appointed him a member of the 900-year-old Knights' order of the first rank of Saint Dionysius of Xanthe for 'his contribution to peace in the world'. However, the medal probably says more about the ever-blossoming Greco-Serbian alliance than Karadzic's contributions to humanity. Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, a close friend of Greek prime minister Mitsotakis, who has lobbied for his Slavic neighbour, is planning to visit Greece early next month.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen recaptures lost ground THE YEN yesterday recaptured some of the ground it had lost to the US dollar on Wednesday amid signs that US officials would still like to see the yen strengthen to reduce the Japanese trade surplus, writes James Blitz. Earlier in the week, the announcement of a Y13,200bn fiscal package to stimulate the Japanese economy appeared to have brought the upward march of the yen to a halt. In Thursday's Tokyo trading, the dollar strengthened against the Japanese currency and, at one stage, was even testing the Y114 level, having hit a new record low of Y112.58 on Monday. The situation changed in yesterday's European trading, however, as more detail became known about the US response to the fiscal package. There was a strong focus on a report in the Washington Post newspaper, suggested that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, might signal that Japan is prepared to let the yen rise following his meeting with President Bill Clinton today. This helped the yen back up to a London close last night of Y113.20 to the dollar, from a previous Y113.95. The yen was also stronger against the D-Mark, however, closing at Y70.62 from a previous Y71.66. Trading inside the European exchange rate mechanism was calm, in spite of what seemed rather hawkish comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president. Mr Schlesinger said that, if higher interest rates could not help relieve pressure on weaker ERM currencies, the only solution would be for them to devalue. He was also reported as saying that the Bundesbank would continue to lower its interest rates gradually. The comments had little impact on ERM currencies. There were rumours that the Bundesbank had announced a press conference to follow next Thursday's council meeting, but a Bundesbank spokesman said there were no such plans. The French franc closed a fraction stronger at FFr3.378 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.380. The peseta closed almost unchanged at Pta72.07 to the D-Mark. Sterling continued to strengthen against the D-Mark following this week's spate of good data. It closed  3/4 of a pfennig up on the day at DM2.4775. However, Mr Steve Hannah, director of IBJ International in London, said the Bundesbank president's comments might have an impact on the ERM grid in the longer term. 'We have to recognise that, if ERM pressures did re-emerge, the peer group of the system feels more-and-more that people should devalue currencies at an earlier stage,' he said. The dollar perked up against the D-Mark, helped by short-covering of the US currency following the recent sell-off. The weekly jobless figure was dollar positive, falling to 335,000 from a previous 373,000. The dollar closed at DM1.6025 from a previous DM1.5915.</p>

			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Christie steadies UK nerves - After the drugs fuss Britain's 100m victory was a tonic STRANGELY, one of the beneficiaries of British sprinter Jason Livingston's positive drugs test is his training partner, Linford Christie, whose victory in the Barcelona 100 metres on Saturday is being hailed as one of Britain's brightest-ever gold-medal performances. Livingston's disgrace has drawn attention to the number of random drugs tests British athletes have faced - at home under local jurisdiction and at international sports meetings. When it comes to samples, Christie has filled almost as many bottles over the last 12 months as a Coca-Cola plant - and every one of them free of artificial additives. The absence of Livingston and the presence of Canada's Ben Johnson in the first rounds of the 100m served as a reminder that no Olympic 100m medal these days comes without the tarnish of suspicion. Johnson won the Seoul 100m four years ago but was found to have taken drugs, and lost his medal. As Tony Ward of the British Athletic Federation said last week: 'No one could make any assurance that no other members of the (British) team are taking drugs.' By showing that, in Britain, some cheats are being caught, Livingston polished Christie's gold a little brighter. Christie won impressively. Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, who won the silver, and Bruny Surin of Canada (fourth) made better starts, though it is an illusion that sprinters accelerate through the race. Most runners stop accelerating at between 20m and 40m. Christie ran that stretch in 1.71 seconds to draw level with Fredericks. Subsequently, Christie alone held his speed while all around were losing theirs. He ran each of the last three 20m stages in 1.74sec. As Christie surged away from the field, the crowd's roar grew, for Christie has an appealing dignity and was a European breaking the US stranglehold on world sprinting. Christie's victory in the blue riband event relegated Spain's judo gold medal to the rank of front-page filler in Spain's Sunday papers. Vanguardia ran a huge colour picture over the headline 'The sprint returns to Europe', although by Page 2 Christie had become 'a Jamaican with a British passport'. It matters little. On Saturday he was the world's fastest man. By the standards of top-class 100m races, Christie's margin of victory - 0.06sec - was crushing. In Tokyo in the world championships last year, 0.06sec covered the first fourfinishers, with Christie in fourth. Christie ran 0.04sec faster that day than on Saturday, but in the Olympic final he beat two of the Americans who headed him then. After his win, Christie was asked repeatedly about the man who had won in Tokyo, but was not even entered in the Barcelona 100m: Olympic multi-gold winner Carl Lewis of the US. Christie merely smiled and shrugged. As Dennis Mitchell, the US winner of the Olympic 100m bronze, said when asked about his race: the 100m is a race of tiny margins; a runner has to be perfect to win. It is not Christie's fault that the US selection system doubles the number of times a sprinter must be perfect and spreads them over two months. Christie is 32 - 'going on 33', he remarked with relish. The next oldest finalist was Ray Stewart, 28. Christie is the oldest Olympic 100m champion and knows that at his age he was lucky that his body was in perfect shape at the right time. He also knows that Lewis was extremely lucky to win six consecutive world championship and Olympic 100m golds without once having an imperfect day. Following Tim Witherspoon's injury in the 100m semi-final, Lewis should now get a chance to appear next Saturday in the 4 x 100m relay. However, a row is simmering in the US team over whether its other dominant runner, Michael Johnson, will be allowed to bring down the curtain on the last full day of the Games in the 4 x 400m relay. Officials told Johnson that he would be picked for the relay even if he did not run in the 400m trial. Apparently no-one told the other triallists, who are not happy. Either way, Christie will be among Johnson's 200m rivals, though this event has always been Christie's second string. Just 36 hours after filling yet another bottle, his lust for victory may be pleasantly dulled.</p>

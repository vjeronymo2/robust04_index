			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Letter: Duty could pay for equity settlement system Sir, You suggest ('After Taurus, City lessons', March 23) that an equity market settlement system may not be a public good worthy of state attention, while previously saying the state is the only institution capable of overcoming the 'free rider' problem. According to the chancellor, the state will be raising about Pounds lbn during the 1993-94 financial year from stamp duty payable on the purchase of securities. This tax is paid by those who use the settlement system. The same groups would benefit from further investment in that system. Where is the conflict with the doctrine of 'public good' if this class of stamp duty were to be retained for just one more year, and the money raised thereby spent by the state on a new equity market settlement system? Despite the Treasury's traditional reluctance to link fund-raising and spending, there can seldom have been such a clear-cut case for making an exception - particularly in the light of the recent fiasco and its potential implications for London as a financial centre.

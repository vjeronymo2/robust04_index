			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Integrated Resources Inc.: The financial services firm announced a  second-quarter loss of $1.04 billion due to failing businesses and cheap asset  sales in a bid to avoid bankruptcy. In the same period a year ago, the New York  firm earned $12.8 million. Revenue in the current period totaled $70.6 million,  down 38% from last year. The company said the loss exceeded a previously  anticipated $600-million decline mainly because of substantially lower than  expected proceeds from the sale of its core businesses to Los Angeles-based  Broad Inc.  </P></p>

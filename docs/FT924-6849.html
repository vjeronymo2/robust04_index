			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television The BBC, bless its little cotton socks, is now providing two solid hours of comedy in the centre of Thursday evenings. Will this see off the ever popular Rumpole on ITV? Probably not. Today the old dear is very impressed by She Who Must Be Obeyed when she pursues a thief (9.00). BBC1 starts its comedy blitz at 8.30 with the first of a new series called Sitting Pretty, written by John Sullivan, author of 'Only Fools And Horses'. This new series centres upon a female character: Annie Briggs, known in the 60s, we are told, as 'the Jackie Onassis of Bethnal Green', now living in luxury and loneliness in the stockbroker belt. When that finishes at 9.00 you can switch to BBC2 for the second episode in Absolutely Fabulous, set in the fashion world, written by Jennifer Saunders, who also stars alongside Joanna Lumley. At 9.30 it's back to BBC1 for Smith And Jones who carry on much as they always have, with the repeat of One Foot In The Grave following at 10.00. C4 begins a five-part drama, The Big Battalions, shot in Britain, Ethiopia, Israel and Saudi Arabia, which 'expresses strong views on religion' (9.00).</p>

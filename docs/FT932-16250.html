			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Armenia battles on two fronts: Steve LeVine reports on the heavy burdens of conflict and economic collapse AS it fights Europe's 'other war', a five-year-old conflict with neighbouring Azerbaijan, Armenia has begun a politically risky programme to revive the ex-Soviet Union's worst economy. The draconian programme, coming during a second winter with no heating, little electricity and an all but paralysed industry, may be inviting trouble. Since the Soviet Union broke up a year ago, hostile crowds have already forced out the neighbouring governments of Azerbaijan and Georgia. But, says Armenia's 35-year-old prime minister, Mr Hrant Bagratian, 'there is no other way out. Otherwise, all the population is going to die. We are a bankrupt country.' While battling back from the same economic collapse that struck all 15 former Soviet republics after the empire's disintegration, Armenia faces an enormous additional problem. That is its undeclared war with Azerbaijan, a territorial dispute that, with some of the same brutality as former Yugoslavia, shows no sign of ending soon. Before the conflict, more than 80 per cent of Armenia's natural gas and other needs were sent through Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has since blockaded Armenia. Another route, through Georgia, has been interrupted by conflicts to the north. Efforts to find a Turkish route have been hampered by its long enmity with Armenia. The result has been almost a complete shutdown of Armenia's 450 factories. Homes are lit for just two hours a day, and the sole heat is produced by wood-burning stoves - tree stumps lining the highway into the capital of Yerevan testify to the population's desperate quest for warmth. Not that Armenian shelves are bare. If one has the money, Yerevan's private farmers' market has the best selection of vegetables and fruit in the region. A syndicate-run bistro that locals call the 'Mafia Restaurant' serves patrons grilled beef and sturgeon, brought fresh several times a week from the Caspian port of Astrakhan. And at the Georgian border, Armenian black marketeers buy natural gas or petrol from tankers with fuel from southern Russia, then sell it at a steep mark-up; 20 litres of petrol costing 4,500 roubles (Pounds 4.70) in Georgia bring 7,000 roubles and more in Yerevan. Mr Bagratian's economic programme is meant to normalise Armenia's economy, and bring fuel and food delicacies to the average home. Armenia possesses few resources, but does have a well-trained work force. And, though landlocked, it is well situated, at the crossroads of the Caspian Sea nations of Iran and Azerbaijan and the Black Sea countries of Turkey and Georgia. The roads go north to Russia, east to Central Asia and south to the Gulf. Mr Bagratian's prescription is to reopen factories quickly. The programme makes no apologies about ignoring Armenian households - Mr Bagratian admits he is betting that relief over returning to work will overshadow the continued discomfort of cold and dark days. In five years or so, when the war may be over, he hopes there will be plenty of light and heat, as well. Natural gas shipments of 1.5m cm a day resumed after the pipeline from Georgia - terrorists had blown it up for the fourth time in a month - was repaired. One-quarter of daily needs, the gas was enough to reopen 45 factories, or about 15 per cent of industrial capacity, the government says. The 1993 goal is to restart 55 per cent of industrial capacity. Comparisons are difficult to avoid between Mr Bagratian and Russia's former prime minister, the combative Mr Yegor Gaidar. With the support of Russia President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Gaidar embarked on a tough, ambitious economic programme that, in addition to antagonising conservative leaders, angered the public. In December, Mr Yeltsin finally jettisoned his economic pilot. Mr Bagratian, whose exacting and abrupt style contrasts sharply with Armenia's usual lax and emotional leadership, confronts at least as difficult a task as did Mr Gaidar. In looking to the long term, Armenia has almost concluded an Dollars 57.4m (Pounds 40.4m) agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to finish a 300 mw oil-and-gas-fired electricity unit at Harazdan, 25 miles from Yerevan, the government says. Even when the unit is completed, Mr Bagratian still faces a tremendous problem ' where will he get fuel to run it?</p>

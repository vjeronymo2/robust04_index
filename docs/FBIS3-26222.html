This title implies a  great price; it is a title formed by the blood of 84 young  working boys and girls. A big fire at Zhili Craft Manufacturing  Factory in Shenzhen's Kuiyong swallowed these young people.    The big fire, which broke out on 19 November 1993, caused  the  largest number of death by a fire in Guangdong in more than a  decade. The red flames have already burned everything to debris,  and the workers who were wronged and driven to death cannot live  again, while a series of problem caused by the big fire are far  from being over.    The big fire started at 1325 in a stack of cloth in a  workshop on the first floor of the factory, and it burned for  three hours. It was lunch time and some 300 workers were on  duty. Why did it turn into a tragedy which shocked people at  home and abroad? The investigation report by the relevant  department shows that it was a incident of serious  responsibility in which a Hong Kong investor ignored regulations  and the workers' safety, and made them work in risky conditions.  A newspaper in Hong Kong also commented: "The Hong Kong boss  cares about only earning money, not about the lives and safety  of workers," and "it was 10 percent a natural disaster, and 90  percent a misfortune created by man."    First, the Hong Kong businessman violated laws and  regulations in putting the production workshop and warehouse  together under the same roof of a factory building.    Second, he did not report the fire prevention plan of the  factory to Shenzhen's fire department. According to  information, the cargo elevator shaft originally designed by the  factory was an open style, which resembled a big chimney and  failed to meet the requirement of fire prevention; the fire  department rejected the plan after an examination and asked the  factory to come up with a new plan. But the boss did not  comply; he ignored the workers' safety, and built and used the  elevator without authorization. At the east and west ends on  the second and third floors of the factory were staircases,  which could be used to evacuate the workers in case of  emergency, but the boss blocked these exists with sliding doors  which he locked in order to supervise workers and safeguard  stockpiles. Only the staircase at the west end was left open  for use; among the four exits on the first floor, three were  locked, and only the one facing the west was left unlocked for  use. Therefore, when the fire broke out on the first floor, in  just a few minutes the poisonous gases caused by the burning of  polyurethane foam, acrylic fiber, and cotton flannel, were  sufficient to poison and suffocate the workers who tried to  escape through a crowded long and narrow passage which was only  0.8 meter wide.    Third, as early as 9 March last year, the city's fire  department issued a notice to the factory reminding it of the  serious potential fire hazards inside the factory, and  suggesting 13 improvement measures, which the notice said should  be implemented in one month's time. The Hong Kong businessman  implemented only six of the measures, and used improper means to  acquire a qualifying certificate which said the factory met the  standards upon examination of possible fire hazards. He just  stalled. The Chinese factory manager, who was responsible for  supervisory duties including fire prevention, not only failed to  stop the law-breaking behavior of the Hong Kong businessman, but  helped him to acquire the qualifying certificate through  trickery. The governor of the town also came out personally to  "say some good words," exerting pressure on the fire department.    Just these three points are sufficient to cause many doubts  which puzzle the people and provoke thought. Why did the Hong  Kong businessman dare to turn a blind eye to the government's  laws and regulations? What was the reason for the Hong Kong  businessman to consistently ignore the safety of the workers?  For what reasons did the Chinese manager of the factory help  the Hong Kong businessman to practice fraud and the governor of  Kuiyong to "say some good words" for him? Has criminal  responsibility of the fire been looked into? Have problems  relating to the relevant Chinese personnel been looked into?  Should the local government department and trade union be held  responsible? What is the lesson to be learned? How should we  manage foreign-funded enterprises according to law? How can the  rights and interests of workers in foreign-funded enterprises be  protected? Questions such as these show that there are a lot of  things we should do but have not done. The lesson is a long  story.    What must be noted is that the big fire at this craft  factory  was not an isolated phenomenon. Before that, fires had broken  out in foreign-funded enterprises in Shenzhen, Fuzhou, Dongguan,  and other places, causing deaths and serious injuries. In  addition, according to the investigation by a relevant  department, within foreign-funded enterprises, there have often  been serious infringements upon the legitimate rights and  interests of workers, such as lack of the minimum safety and  work protection equipment in workplaces, frequent industrial  accidents, insulting and swearing at staff and workers,  compulsory overtime work, and random deduction and embezzlement  of workers' wages. All these incidents are calling: It is time  to pay attention to strengthening management of foreign-funded  enterprises.    The open-door policy is a long-term policy in our country.  In more than a decade, our country has opened the door widely,  and eagerly welcomed investors from outside the border to  establish enterprises on the mainland; the country has also  diligently improved the investment environment and provided  convenient conditions, and treated investors with courtesy.  However, foreign businessmen must abide by China's laws and  regulations, including the laws and regulations on labor safety,  and operate according to law, then they can be protected. If  they turn a blind eye to China's laws and regulations, ignore  workers' safety, and even do whatever they want to the extent of  causing serious incidents, then the persons to be held  responsible can hardly avoid being blamed. When Chinese staff  and workers work in foreign-funded enterprises, their political  and economic rights and interests are protected by our country's  constitution and laws; showing respect to the legitimate rights  and interests and social status of Chinese staff and workers  according to law is the wise and correct choice to be made by  investors from outside the border.</p>

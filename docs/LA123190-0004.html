			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TAGGER ARREST'  </P> <P> In response to Robert A. Jones' column "Requiem for Chake" (Part A, Dec.18):  </P> <P> It was irresponsible for The Times to publish Jones' inane accolade to a  "tagger." There is a nauseating attitude of understanding in the article as  Jones describes this graffiti writer as a sweet boy, with a great affection for  his skateboard, whose acts of stealing paint have a "comic" aspect, and who is  absorbed by a "quest."  </P> <P> Perhaps, if the buildings in which Jones and his friends live and work were  subjected to these acts of vandalisn, he might not have written this maudlin  tribute to the destructive scrawlings of a teen-ager.  </P> <P> MEL STUART, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: International Wheat Council says ex-Soviet republics seeking to expand use of barter Russia and other former Soviet republics in difficulty with grain payments are seeking to expand the use of barter, according to the International Wheat Council, writes David Blackwell. Sales have already been fixed under the US Export Enhancement Program (EEP) - mostly in exchange for cotton from Uzbekistan. Australia, Canada, Finland and Turkey are thought to have held talks on barter deals, the IWC says in its latest grain market report. The Australians are believed to have been offered 40,000 tonnes of aluminium in exchange for wheat. However, with the exception of the US, the parties concerned 'are reluctant to reveal details of any possible arrangements' as they involve price exposure on both sides of a transaction. Traders need to cover themselves for commodities that they are unfamiliar with. The fact that most commodities are in plentiful supply on the international market at relatively low prices further complicates any attempts to expand barter trade, the IWC suggests.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the comments received in response to the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, the Department has decided to issue a final rule addressing all aspects of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  remand other than the assessment of lost nonuse values. The Department is considering revising the type B rule to include certain standards to improve the reliability of CV when used to calculate lost nonuse values. In order to ensure that interested parties have an adequate opportunity for review and comment, the Department will soon publish the standards in a notice of proposed rulemaking. Pending completion of that rulemaking, the Department is temporarily leaving unchanged the remanded language of the original type B rule concerning assessment of lost nonuse values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Rulemakings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CERCLA mandates biennial review and revision, as appropriate, of the natural resource damage assessment regulations. The Department plans to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to begin the biennial update of the type B rule in July 1994. All aspects of the administrative process and the type B rule will be subject to review during that update. During the biennial review, the Department will consider ways of ensuring the greatest possible consistency between its damage assessment regulations and the damage assessment regulations being developed by NOAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the Department plans to publish a proposed rule to revise the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments in compliance with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Colorado <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in November 1994. The Department is also developing an additional type A procedure for assessing damages in the Great Lakes. Like the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments, the type A procedure for the Great Lakes will incorporate a computer model. The Department expects to publish a proposed rule for the type A procedure for the Great Lakes in August 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Overview of This Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Measure of Damages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The type B rule as originally published on August 1, 1986, provided that damages consisted of the lesser of the cost of restoring the injured resources or the diminution in the value of the injured resources without restoration. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the court ordered the Department to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs as the measure of natural resource damages. CERCLA provides that sums recovered in natural resource damage actions may be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. The court used the simple term ``restoration'' costs as shorthand for the cost of performing any of these actions. 880 F.2d at 441. In many cases, trustee officials will likely use damage awards to fund some combination of these actions, rather than only one. Therefore, the final rule allows trustee officials to recover the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources in all cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Rev. Timothy S. Healy, who has led Georgetown University for 13 years,  announced his resignation to become president and chief executive officer of  the New York Public Library. Healy, 65, will become head of one of the world's  largest research libraries, as well as a library system that operates 82  branches around New York City. He succeeds Vartan Gregorian, 54, who will  become president of Brown University. In letters to Georgetown faculty, Healy  said he had decided to resign at the end of the university's bicentennial  celebrations in the fall, believing that Georgetown "would benefit from a new  and younger imagination."  </P></p>

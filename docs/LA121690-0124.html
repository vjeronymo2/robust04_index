			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAY SOMETHING NICE  </P> <P> Four years ago, my husband and I decided to leave behind the hassles of Los  Angeles living and move to Leucadia.  </P> <P> Having come from a small town originally, North County seemed to fulfill our  dreams of returning to a simpler life. We purchased a small motel on Highway  101 and started a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day commitment to transforming a  roadside location into a full-scale, country-style inn.  </P> <P> Our mission was not easy, but has been accomplished through diligent patience  and perseverance.  </P> <P> For this and many other reasons, I found it not only distressing, but  infuriating, to see John Glionna's recent article, "On Road to Change" (Dec. 2)  churning out gems like "riffraff motels reincarnated from some spooky old  Hitchcock thriller."  </P> <P> We are the new blood in Leucadia, the young investors who came to town not to  build strip shopping centers but to take existing properties and enhance the  charm of a seaside community. There are young families investing in real  estate, investors starting their own businesses, people looking for an  opportunity to build a life and a community away from the maddening crowd.  </P> <P> Yet, the media continually choose to downgrade and destroy the whole population  of this town based on a few isolated problems, which every community copes  with.  </P> <P> The idea that you can walk into any shop in town and people are friendly and  they know your name is something we take for granted. That you know your  neighbors and can count on them to pick up a shovel and rebuild stairs to the  beach when the city turns its back on you.  </P> <P> Leucadia is a good city with a spirit and a good future. How about spending  half as much time bashing the problems and a little more time supporting the  potential of the last of the great California surfing towns?  </P> <P> We're on our way up, with or without the press knocking us to our knees.  </P> <P> SUZAN KALVODA, Innkeeper, Pacific Surf Inn, Leucadia  </P></p>

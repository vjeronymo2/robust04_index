			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Belgians press for areturn to orthodoxy BELGIUM will restrict televised sessions of EC ministers when it starts its six-month presidency of the European Community on July 1, Mr Willie Claes, foreign minister, said yesterday. Mr Claes made clear that Belgium had no desire to emulate the Danish presidency which has so far this year won reluctant agreement to allow television cameras into eight ministerial debates. At the Edinburgh summit in December, the Twelve decided unanimously that important policy debates and new legislative proposals should be televised. Mr Claes said Belgium would be sticking 'strictly' to the Edinburgh terms. Mr Claes also unveiled the new Belgian logo for its Presidency - a tricolour 'B' inside a blue circle of 12 stars representing the 12 EC members. The early launch raised eyebrows among Brussels diplomats, though they conceded that the UK presidency was also fast off the mark last year. Federalist-minded Belgian officials have scarcely hidden their frustration with Danish and British delays in ratifying the Maastricht treaty and are pressing for a return to orthodoxy. Mr Claes said yesterday he was unconvinced that greater transparency through five-minute ministerial sound-bites was the best formula for restoring EC credibility.</p>

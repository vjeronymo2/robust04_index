			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Utilities Investors traditionally view British utilities as bond surrogates. As gilt yields have shot up this year, so have utility yields. The rise in utility yields of 1.02 percentage points is sharper than the 0.54 points rise in the yield on the all-share index. Another way of looking at the same phenomenon is provided in the accompanying chart. It shows a marked correspondence in movements in utility yields relative to the market and shifts in the gilt/equity yield ratio. This habit of treating utilities as bond surrogates is odd. True, utilities' income streams are relatively predictable. But there the correspondence with bonds ends. Gilt yields have risen this year because of higher real interest rates and increased inflationary expectations. The utilities, by contrast, are effective hedges against increases in both real interest rates and inflation. The real interest rate hedge stems from the way that utility regulators decide permitted profitability levels. Their starting point is to determine a utility's cost of capital, which is calculated by taking real interest rates and adding a company-specific risk premium. So if real interest rates rise, the company's permitted profitability goes up too - albeit with a lag, as price caps are reviewed only every four or five years. The inflation hedge also stems from the regulatory system. Price caps are explicitly related to the retail price index. Higher inflation means higher revenues and higher profits. One cannot say the same for an ordinary bond.</p>

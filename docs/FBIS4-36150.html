			<p>BFN     [Text] At a ceremony in Karachi, the country's indigenously  built warship PNS [Pakistan Naval Ship] Larkana was inducted in  the Pakistan Navy fleet today. Speaking on the occasion, the  chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Saeed M. Khan, said the  building of PNS Larkana at Pakistan Navy Dockyard is a small  beginning, but not an ordinary achievement. The warship has  been designed and built by the engineers, architects, and  workers of Pakistan Navy. Paying compliments to naval  personnel, the naval chief said the induction of the homemade  warship is a beginning of a long journey in raising a sound  infrastructure of the Pakistan Navy.    The chief of Naval Dockyard explained the overall technical  and professional capabilities of PNS Larkana. Later, the chief  of the Naval Staff formally inducted the warship PNS Larkana in  the Pakistan Navy.    The building of the patrol craft indigenously by Pakistan  Navy is the first step toward self-reliance of designing and  building of warships in the country. The ship has a speed of 24  knots per hour with three mounted antiaircraft guns. The ship  is also equipped with depth charge capabilities which could be  used for antisubmarine operations.</p>

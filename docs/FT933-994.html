			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Travel: Shaken, and stirred, in Marseilles - Two nights and a day are just not enough in France's city of anti-legend, says self-confessed Dumas junkie Nigel Andrews MARSEILLES is one of those cities that exist in anti-legend: fogged by folklore and apocryphal fame, but all of a faintly dubious kind. Smugglers, drug-dealers, the Mafia. Corsican brotherhoods, impossible fish stews, bad Humphrey Bogart movies. Not to mention - but we will - all those interminable low-life stories by Pagnol where men in striped sweaters throw oeillades at the daughters of the dockworld. On my first stopover in France's second largest city, I made the inevitable finding. All of this and none of this is true. The most famous landmark is the Vieux Port, hitherto stamped on my retina by films like French Connection 2 where the villain was chased over slippery quaysides by Gene Hackman, or Hackman's fitter double. On inspection, the Old Port is a place for moody visceral chase scenes. But it is also an architectural-archaeological jewel: centrepiece in a town where a lustrous, laid-back joie de vivre seems just as prevalent as the swarthy, laconic mood the place is supposed to enjoy. (Note in part-explanation of the joie de vivre: Marseilles won the European Cup just after I got there). A visitor feels like a native as soon as he arrives. The airport taxi flails through traffic while the driver talks of his joys and sorrows. Then one comes to an emergency stop outside the chosen hotel. Mine is the Sofitel. I get out shaken and am soon strangely stirred. The hotel has a magnificent view: it stands on a headland at the harbour mouth and surveys the whole port, with its sparkling water, bristling yacht-masts and sunset-pink walls, towers and fortresses of ancient brick. For - yes - Marseilles dates back to the year 600 BC when, my guidebook informs me, Phoenician galleys slipped into the inlet which is now the Vieux Port and founded a place called Massalia. This became Greek, later allied itself with Rome, finally pronounced itself French. As for the anthem that became France's battle hymn of the republique, it was composed by a young French soldier in 1792. Popularised at a banquet for 500 volunteers in Marseilles, it was then sung all across France as the men marched to Paris. By the time it reached the capital the Marseillaise had won the Eurovision Song Contest, or its dix-huitieme siecle equivalent, several times over. Two nights and a day in this town are not enough, but they concentrate one's mind and delight in the place. In the morning, wander round the fish market on the Quai des Belges. Le tout Marseilles is out and about, assessing the eels while the eels assess them back. (Do not wait for the nasty chop of the vendor's cleaver). Then have a cafe creme and flaky croissant in a waterside bar, surrounded by the usual central casting crowd of blue-and-white-sweatered mariners. After that, board the boat for the town's offshore piece de resistance, the Chateau d'If. I must disclose an interest. As a child I was an Alexandre Dumas junkie. Not so much The Three Musketeers with its dandyish threesome - foursome, actually - shooting their lace cuffs as they helped Milady So-and-So fight Cardinal Such-and-Such. No, rather the Gothic shivers, dripping rocks and elegantly calcinated prose of The Count Of The Monte Cristo. As the boat leaves Marseilles and bumps across the silver strait beyond the harbour mouth, the castle-island swells from a floating chess piece to a craggy fortress. Having taken the first morning boat, one is alone with the shrieking gulls and beetling cliff of wall. A short climb, an archway - then the sullen, bearded doorkeeper relieves you of your valuables (FFr10, Pounds 1.13) in return for a small ticket. Un-jangling his keys, he pushes you into the courtyard. Around this tall, dank well are three grim storeys. Arched doorways are surmounted with Gothic name-signs: 'Edmond Dantes, Comte de Monte Cristo', 'L'Homme au Masque de Fer' (yes, he too), and dear 'Abbe Faria', Dantes' neighbour, friend and sacrificial ally in flight. Inside the cells, some things surprise. That of Dantes has some wall-scratched messages that seem to be distinctly post-19th century in origin. And Faria's cell has a wide-open door, a pleasant view through a hole in the rock and a TV screen set into the wall. (This, I learn, is for a coming art exhibition). But such things fail to distract. If you close your eyes the castle still has the smell of fear; touch the walls, the texture of decay. If you climb the pitch-black spiral steps in an outer keep to the castle's roof, you can survey the terror of the jagged rocks and cold sea Dantes fought before reaching safety and riches. (It should only occur to one after wandering round this place - why spoil your fun during? - that Dumas's characters were fictional and that the Man in the Iron Mask was accommodated not here but at the Bastille in Paris). Back on main land, it is time for lunch. It must be bouillabaisse. I order at an outside table in a small dockside restaurant. With a good Marseilles bouillabaisse you first get a bowl of spiced and succulent fish soup with bits of browned bread and garlic relish. I was given a fork, not a spoon, with the all-liquid soup, and assuming this to be an old Marseilles custom battled away for several minutes dredging the un-dredgeable. Then the waiter, noticing my discomfort, realised his mistake and replaced it with a spoon. Then followed the fish stew itself: heaven in a serving bowl. Self-warnings about the state of Mediterranean seafood are suspended as the fishy fragments in stock-rich gravy - here a mussel, there a piece of loup de mer, now some lobster - are fetched up with accompanying nuggets of potato, carrot or courgette. Bouillabaisse is essentially a fish couscous. Recipe: throw in absolutely everything, followed by most of the stocks and spices of the Mediterranean. There is more Marseilles for the afternoon. The two churches you should visit are the 11th century Saint-Victor, a crenellated gem overlooking the port with a crypt containing an earlier 5th century basilica as well as a collection of early Christian sarcophagi; and Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde, a 19th century folly in Roman-Byzantine style whose hilltop position affords the most spectacular views in town. Now return to the Old Port, go back a street and relax in the Jardin des Vestiges (Garden of Ruins). Here, just behind the stock exchange, you will discover the vertebrae of history. The bones and stones of ancient Marseilles stick spine-like from the green sward. Here a fragment of Greek fortification, there a 4th century entrance into town; and clambering around and over the building-blocks of the old port - this is the really old port - are children of the gipsy and Moorish families who make this park their afternoon relaxation point. My own relaxation point is back in my room. I sit at the window in the evening mesmerised by the colour changes in water and sky, the double-imaged yachts, the lights blinking on round the harbour and cueing their reflections in the starry night sky. Here is perfect, sense-filling peace. And if, when you are finally thrown out of the Sofitel by a restless management, you cannot bear the prospect of returning to the old life and old cares, you can always knock at the fortified gate of the large stone building next door. 'Legion Etrangere', says the grim, forbidding, irresistible sign: 'Recrutement Jour et Nuit.'</p>

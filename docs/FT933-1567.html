			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Nafta passage in peril LAST WEEK President Bill Clinton launched his campaign for ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), with a finely choreographed event involving three ex-presidents and a speech that rose magnificently to the occasion. Here was a Democratic president, leader of the party within which most resistance to the agreement can be found, setting out firmly and clearly the reasons why that resistance is so utterly wrong-headed. At last, one felt listening to him, the administration is going to give this issue the priority it needs. Yet by the end of the week the presidential propaganda machine had already moved on to beat the drums for healthcare reform. That is an important issue, but unlikely to reach decision point before mid-1994 at the earliest. By contrast a decision on Nafta is needed by the end of this year, and as things stand the decision is more than likely to go against it. One speech is certainly not enough to undo the damage done by Mr Ross Perot in whipping up hysteria on the issue. Precious time was lost between Mr Clinton's inauguration last January and the signing in mid-August of 'side agreements' on labour and the environment, which he had promised to secure during his election campaign. From a strict free trade point of view, these agreements actually reduce the attraction of Nafta, since they forbid further unilateral deregulation in these areas by any of the three signatories (Canada, Mexico and the US). Worrying parallels The object of the side agreements is, of course, to pacify powerful lobbies in the US, whose anxieties Mr Clinton shares or at least claims to share. The exercise is similar to the 'clarification' of the Blair House agreement on agricultural trade, which the EC has now agreed to seek in order to save the French government from the wrath of its farm lobby. Indeed there is a worrying parallelism between the US attitude to Nafta and the French attitude to Blair House: both have come to be seen as symbolising all the demons that threaten national living standards and a cherished way of life, although in both cases the likely economic effect is quite small. It would be helpful if all discussion of Nafta in the US began with a reminder that the whole Mexican economy is no bigger than the amount by which the US economy grows in two average years, and then proceeded to point out that US imports from Mexico are already virtually unrestricted. The next point to note is that, even without Nafta, deregulation in Mexico has already turned a US deficit on bilateral trade of Dollars 5.7bn in 1987 into a Dollars 5.6bn US surplus in 1992. The 'giant sucking sound' of jobs moving south, with which Mr Perot has terrorised American workers, should be drowned, in any rational universe, by the noise of new factories being built in the US to supply the Mexican market. Strategic centrepiece Nafta is not a zero-sum game. It should result in a net increase in employment on both sides of the Rio Grande (and indeed of the 49th parallel). But, while the short-term gains might well be greater in the US, the agreement's political importance to Mexico can hardly be exaggerated. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has made Nafta the centrepiece of his liberalising strategy, which reverses all 20th-century Mexican traditions and is still bitterly contested both outside and (more discreetly but also more dangerously) inside the ruling party. US rejection is likely to derail this strategy. That should be a matter of acute concern to Americans, right across the political spectrum. The last thing the US needs is a southern neighbour sinking back into economic stagnation and political instability, from which ever growing numbers would flee northward. Republican congressmen and senators should not let partisan feeling, or dislike of the side agreements, dissuade them from voting for an agreement which remains a great achievement of their party. Mr Clinton, for his part, must not fall into the trap of thinking that, having at last made his own position clear, he can now afford to move on to other issues. This one requires all his persuasive powers, and if it goes wrong it will be a sad victory for the forces of irrationalism, leaving little hope that the US will grasp the more difficult nettles of freer trade with Europe and Asia.</p>

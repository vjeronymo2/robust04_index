			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By the "Political Desk"] </F>   [Text] China yesterday dispelled fears that judges on the  controversial Court of Final Appeal would have to be ethnic  Chinese.    Only the chief justice would have to be a Chinese national  without the right of abode overseas, said senior official Lu  Ping.    His disclosure drew a mixed response from the legal  profession which, along with legislators, rejected the 1991  Sino-British deal on the court which is to replace the Privy  Council after 1997.    The agreement said the court would consist of five judges in  any one sitting the chief justice, three local Judges and one  overseas judge. The legal profession believed more than one  overseas judge was needed to ensure the court's independence  under Chinese rule.    Law Society chairman Roderick Woo Bun said last night that  he  now accepted the "four-to-one" formula. But Simon Ip Sik-on,  the lawyers' representative in Legco, said Mr Lu's clarification  did not allay his fears.    Mr Lu was speaking after meeting the third batch of Hong  Kong  affairs advisers formally appointed in Beijing yesterday. Some  had raised fears that there might not be enough qualified ethnic  Chinese to sit on the court.    Mr Lu, the head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,  said: "According to the Basic Law, only the chief justice of the  court should be a Chinese citizen without foreign right of  abode. "There is no nationality requirement for other judges,  not even the requirement of Hong Kong permanent residents."    There had been fears that China would propose restrictions  on  the "local" judges, saying they should be permanent residents of  Hong Kong without foreign nationality. But Mr Lu said: "There  are (now) no ethnic Chinese sitting on the Court of Appeal. If  it is stipulated that only ethnic Chinese can sit on the court,  the existing expatriate judges may feel there is no future for  them and may take early retirement. This may undermine the  retention of talent." He said China had taken into account the  shortage of Chinese judges in the territory when drafting the  Basic Law provisions.    Last night, the Bar Association vice-chairman Gladys Li QC,  said although Mr Lu had clarified some uncertainties in the 1991  agreement, the makeup of the court was still unacceptable  because it did not allow flexibility. This would deprive the  court of the right to choose its own judges, Ms Li said which  was inherent in the Joint Declaration.    Mr Ip said Mr Lu's comments helped clarify the situation,  but  would not be enough to win support from legislators. Their  concern on the restriction of overseas judges serving each trial  had not been addressed, he said. "There is never any doubt in  my mind that the three permanent judges need not be Chinese  nationals or Hong Kong permanent residents," he said.    Senior law lecturer of the University of Hong Kong, Johannes  Chan, said the legal sector believed overseas judges should be  invited to sit on the court whenever the need arose. "It simply  could not work if you had to have all the expatriate judges  barred from the court of final appeal. There is not enough  expertise among the local legal profession," Mr Chan said.  "What we are concerned about is that, when there is a need to  bring in overseas judges from other Commonwealth jurisdictions,  will we be able to do it flexibly?"    Mr Woo said he personally accepted the four-to-one formula  after Mr Lu's clarification. Permanent judges from overseas  jurisdictions could be appointed and that would enable more  expatriate judges to sit in each trial. "It is tantamount to  imposing no restrictions on overseas judges," Mr Woo said.    The Assistant Director of Administration, Annie Tam Kam-lan,  said Mr Lu's remarks were in line with the Government's  understanding. A draft bill on setting up the court had been  submitted to China, but no response had been received. "As it  is a very complex bill, I think it is reasonable to give the  Chinese side a considerable amount of time to study it," Ms Tam  said. The Government had told China it wanted the court to be  set up by mid-1996.    A deputy director of XINHUA (the New China News Agency),  Zhang Junsheng, said the setting up of the court had been  delayed by the lack of initiative from Britain.    "The fact is that we have had an agreement ready on the  table  since 1991 and it is the British side which does not take it  seriously."</p>

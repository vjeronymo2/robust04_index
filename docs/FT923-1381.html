			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Core activities shore up Hays HAYS, the business services group, saw pre-tax profits edge ahead by 1 per cent to Pounds 57.4m in a year which it said had seen no measurable sign of improvement in the British economy. Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman, gave yesterday's base rate reduction a cautious welcome: 'It will obviously help, but recovery is not going to happen overnight - people will be cautious for some time.' The group said strong performances by its core distribution and commercial activities in the year to June 30 had offset a further fall in profits suffered by the personnel business, which specialises in recruiting accountancy staff. The personnel division's operating profits fell from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 4.8m and accounted for only 8 per cent of total operating profit, compared with 20 per cent last year. The distribution businesses increased overall operating profits by 16 per cent to Pounds 33.5m. New business with large retailers helped increase contract distribution's profits by 64 per cent. However, the recession's effect on high street sales cut profits from the removal and home delivery operations. Hays Chemical Distribution increased operating profits by 9 per cent. Mr Frost said that reflected the impact of management changes and a new computer system, which had improved stock controls and enhanced margins. The commercial businesses, providing office support services, increased operating profits by 25 per cent to Pounds 20.8m. Hays said Britdoc and Data Express, its overnight mail services and parcel delivery companies, performed well against strong competition. The group spent Pounds 52.3m on acquisitions, the biggest being its purchase in June of FRIL, a French food and drinks distributor. Mr Frost said: 'We are actively looking for further acquisitions in continental Europe and the UK.' Hays generated Pounds 24.7m in cash and raised Pounds 34.6m from the placing of 19m shares at the time of the FRIL deal. In spite of investing Pounds 28m in a dedicated distribution complex being developed for Waitrose at Milton Keynes, gearing fell from 22 to 21 per cent. In April the group sold Traveldoc, a document delivery service aimed at the travel industry, because of continuing uncertainty about the European regulatory environment. The disposal accounted for most of an extraordinary item of Pounds 1.3m, the rest being associated with the sale of a stationery company. Earnings per share rose to 10.33p (10p). A final dividend of 3.1p makes a 4.6p (4p) total. COMMENT The Hays business philosophy - of its distribution, commercial and personnel businesses comprising a three-legged stool - is looking a little lopsided after the toll which recession has taken of the recruitment market. However, the plunge in personnel operating profits from Pounds 19m to Pounds 4.8m in just two years also gives some measure of the scope for recovery. The performance of the commercial and distribution activities continues to impress in the flat domestic market and Mr Frost is confident that the French acquisition will enhance earnings. Forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds 72m put the shares, down  1/2 p yesterday at 184p, on a prospective multiple of just over 15. At that level they look a sound long-term recovery play.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Leading Article: New agenda in Germany NOT FOR the first time in the saga of German unity, a compromise has been reached - this time over the pay dispute in the east German metal industry - which brings relief, but no joy. An accord at the end of last week provides a formula for ending a fortnight-old strike, the first prolonged stoppage in eastern Germany for more than 60 years. It postpones equal wages in the east and west German engineering industry for two years until 1996. But it does little to head off the risk that the region east of the Elbe will become permanently dependent on funding and favours from the west. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the leader of the IG Metall trade union, is right to say the accord has implications for the whole of Germany. The agreement may not however live up to Mr Steinkuhler's claim that it will 'strengthen confidence in (German) unity'. Unless his country can adjust quickly and decisively to the economic consequences, the deal carries the risk of further undermining the chances of making German unification a success. The bitterness of the dispute has been increased by government promises in 1990 to bring easterners speedily to west German living standards. Politically, an agreement was necessary to avoid perpetuating east Germans' status as second class citizens. From an economic point of view, however, the accord is not justifiable. Employers have secured the conditional right to 'opt-out' clauses for enterprises which cannot afford officially-sanctioned pay increases. The effective east German unemployment rate is already, however, about 30 per cent. Struggling with burdens inherited both from communist central planning and (in milder form) from mistakes in Bonn's unity policies, east German enterprises are grossly uncompetitive at present pay and productivity levels. By winning a 1993 pay increase of about 15 per cent - compared with the employers' offer of 9 per cent and the 26 per cent due under a flawed 1991 agreement - many east German workers know they are pricing themselves out of jobs. The west must pay a price, too. Partly because of the desire to prevent large westward migration, west Germans have, in effect, undertaken to underwrite large financial transfers to their eastern brethren at least until the end of the century. The cost of financing these transfers will be bearable only if west Germans rise to the challenge of increasing the dynamism and efficiency of their own economic arrangements. To help job creation, west German employees will have to accept cuts in real earnings both this year and next. Further cuts in social spending, already presaged by latest news of recession-induced shortfalls in tax receipts, are badly needed. By promoting the 'opt-out' possibilities now agreed in eastern collective bargaining, the government should push employers and trade unions towards much greater wage flexibility in the west as well. Additionally, the country badly needs longer working hours - both per week and over the whole of an individual's life - to tackle acute financing problems in the health and pensions systems. Germany's deep recession is probably not the best time to push through much-needed reforms. But at least now there are no illusions about quick or easy solutions. The agenda has been made lengthier, and more difficult, by the errors in dealing with German reunification. The penalty for inaction is considerable; but so will be the reward for eventual success.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Police say mortars meant to cause harm Scotland Yard said yesterday that it was 'quite inconceivable' that the IRA carried out attacks on Heathrow without the intention to 'kill or maim'. 'The devices were loaded with high explosives and contained detonators; they were carefully constructed,' a Yard spokesman said. But, in the absence of official clarification on whether the detonators were primed to explode, some anti-terrorist experts believe mechanical 'failure' of IRA mortars used at Heathrow was a deliberate ploy to generate maximum publicity while minimising casualties. Major John Wyatt, a bomb disposal expert with long experience of IRA operations, believes the most likely explanation is that the mortars were 'fixed' not to detonate, but did not rule out the possibility that equipment was drawn from old stock and was faulty. 'Technically it is very easy to ensure that the mortars do not detonate on impact,' he said. 'Politically I think they (IRA) knew they didn't need to explode to cause widespread disruption, and illustrate their ability to carry out random attacks without getting caught,' he said yesterday. Professor Paul Wilkinson of St Andrews University, another specialist in counter terrorism, said it was inconceivable that the IRA would have risked large-scale casualties among US tourists by hitting an aircraft or terminal. He also discounted suggestions that attacks on Heathrow had involved double agents supplying the IRA with defective military equipment.</p>

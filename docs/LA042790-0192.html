			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DICKERSON MIGHT COME BACK  </P> <P> Eric Dickerson, the NFL's seventh all-time leading rusher with 11,226 yards,  may not be retiring despite threats to the contrary, an adviser to the  Indianapolis Colts' running back said Thursday.  </P> <P> "I think Eric really wants to play football again," said Daryl Henry,  Dickerson's close friend.  </P> <P> "He just doesn't want to play in Indianapolis."  </P> <P> Last month, Dickerson said in an interview WFYI-TV in Indianapolis that he was  "through with football."  </P> <P> Aaron Pryor  </P> <P> But Dickerson has softened his position, Henry said in an article in the  Indianapolis Star. "As far as playing football in Indianapolis, that is a dead  issue," Henry said.  </P> <P> Dickerson is under contract with the Colts to play next season for $1.45  million, the final year of the contract he signed following his trade to  Indianapolis by the Los Angeles Rams in 1987.  </P> <P> The Colts hold a minicamp next week, in which veterans are required to attend.  "He won't be there," Henry said.  </P></p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Letter: Manufacturing disability Sir, Commenting on Ford's evolving policy in Britain ('Developing cars across borders', February 27) you missed an opportunity to relate Germany's natural (sic]) advantage in respect of development engineers with two pages of newly qualified chartered accountants who will doubtless spread across British industry to join their brethren under Mr P A Davis's (Letters February 2)guiding hand. There has to be some rational explanation for our overall manufacturing disability. Perhaps we suffer from some natural dis-advantage to which you might address your attention. D A A Fagandini, 6 Alleyn Park, Dulwich, London SE21 8AE</p>

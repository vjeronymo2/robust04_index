			<p>BFN     [Text] Bushehr--JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI correspondent: We have  begun to build the Bushehr Power Plant.    An informed source at the Bushehr Power Plant said this to  our correspondent, adding that following initial agreements with  the Russians a few months ago, their experts began working on  the first unit of the Bushehr Power Plant early this [Iranian]  year [beginning 21 March 1994]. This unit is to be completed in  four years, and will have a 1,000-megawatt output.    He added: So far 30,000 tonnes of the power plant's main  parts have been brought into the country from Germany and are  being kept in suitable storage areas. About 7,000 tonnes of the  main parts of the power plant, which have been paid for and  legally belong to the Islamic Republic of Iran, have been packed  and sent to ports, and are ready for shipment to Iran, but  regrettably they are being held up because the German Government  will not issue an export permit on the basis of empty pretexts.    He added that unfortunately there is no information on what  state these parts are in.    The informed source said that fortunately 90 percent of the  damage inflicted during the imposed war has been repaired by the  able hands of Iranian experts and the remaining 10 percent is  currently being repaired.    It should be noted that the agreement for the construction  of  the Bushehr Power Plant was signed on 10 Tir 1355 [1 July 1976]  between the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization [IAEO] and  Kraftwerk Union of Germany for 7.8 billion DM [German marks].  On the basis of this agreement, the German company was to build  a nuclear power plant approximately 18 km southwest of Bushehr,  consisting of two pressurized light water units, each with an  output of 3765 thermal megawatts and 1296 megawatts. Of the  aforementioned amount, Iran has paid 5.8 billion DM. In  addition, separate agreements for supplying the necessary fuel  and 200,000 cubic meters of pure water needed by the power plant  were signed. Thus, a total of 137,394,000 DM and $43 million  has been paid by the IAEO to Germany.    According to the same report, so far progress has been made  on about 85 percent of the construction works, and about 65  percent of the mechanical and electrical works in the power  plant.</p>

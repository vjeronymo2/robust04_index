			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Jobless total falls but engineers warn of shake-out: Hopes of a sustained recovery marred by renewed fears on inflation CONFUSION ABOUT the strength of the UK recovery grew yesterday as news of a surprise fall in unemployment last month coincided with predictions of thousands of engineering redundancies and a British Aerospace announcement of 1,000 planned job cuts. The 13,600 drop in the seasonally adjusted jobless total to 2.908m in September was the sixth monthly fall so far this year and took unemployment to its lowest level since October 1992. But the upbeat message of the figures was overshadowed by renewed fears of inflationary pressures in the economy, with Department of Employment figures indicating that the rate of growth in average earnings has not much further to fall. Yesterday's news rounded off a week of dismal economic figures - including a drop in manufacturing output over the summer - which cast doubt on the robustness of the recovery. Together they may add to pressure on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to avoid sharp tax increases in the November Budget and sanction an early cut in interest rates. Despite the drop in the jobless total, the Engineering Employers Federation warned that the recovery in engineering output had halted and that a further 60,000 jobs were yet to be lost. The federation, which represents 4,800 companies, accused the Treasury of being 'isolated from the real world' and said there were no prospects of a strong recovery in west European markets until 1995. BAe announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs across four plants in England and Scotland, reflecting its difficulties in depressed world markets for aircraft and defence equipment. The problems facing the manufacturing sector were highlighted in the official unemployment figures which showed that in spite of the overall fall in the jobless total, manufacturing employment dropped a seasonally adjusted 24,000 in August, following July's fall of 11,000. However, the chancellor's room for manoeuvre on interest rates may be curtailed by signs that inflation is creeping up. Mixed news on earnings growth yesterday added to these worries. Average earnings rose an underlying 3.5 per cent in the year to August, still the slowest rate for 25 years. But earnings for manufacturing are rising faster than other sectors even though it suffered heavy job losses in July and August. In the year to August, average earnings in manufacturing rose 4.75 per cent compared with 2.75 per cent for the service sector. The Department of Employment believes earnings for the whole economy - dragged down by the 1.5 per cent pay settlement imposed on the public sector  -have hit bottom. The latest labour market figures also show a drop in productivity growth, reflecting the fall in manufacturing output over the summer. Output per head grew 5.1 per cent in the three months to August, compared with the previous three months, down from 6.7 per cent in July. Unit wage costs - which fell sharply until April - registered their smallest fall so far this year, dropping 0.6 per cent in the three months to August against a fall of 1.8 per cent in July. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, pointed out that the number of people out of work and claiming benefit had fallen by 84,000 this year. 'This welcome news confirms the underlying strength of the UK economy,' he said. 'Inflation is under control, earnings growth continues to moderate, productivity is at record levels and the UK's flexible, deregulated labour market is now bringing unemployment down.' Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, said a long-term commitment to full employment was needed.

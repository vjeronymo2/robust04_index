			<p>BFN     [Text] Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud arrived in Morocco this evening  carrying a letter from the custodian of the two holy mosques,  King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al-Sa'ud, to his brother King Hassan  II. The Saudi minister made the following statement on arrival  at King Mohamed V International Airport:    [Al-Faysal] In fact I am carrying a message from the  Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques to His Majesty King Hassan II.  As the practice has always been between the two leaders,  consultation on all issues related to Arab issues becomes a  duty, particularly when important issues are raised in the Arab  arena. I will, God willing, be honored by meeting His Majesty  the King to convey this message to him. I hope that the efforts  of our two leaders in both countries play an influential role in  keeping the peace and the security of our Arab nation and our  two brotherly peoples.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Gas spot market to meet operational needs Sir, With reference to your articles regarding the spot gas market ('Spot lights way to futures' and 'Proposals drawn up for 'spot' market on gas prices', August 15), we would like to make a few points which we hope will help you fully understand our proposal. The proposed market is an operational market, first and foremost. The need for the market arises from the requirement to create an on-the-day system balancing structure to ensure that British Gas's National Transmission System is operationally secure. The EMMS proposed market or a similar one is necessary even if no short-term commercial transactions occur. The EMMS market bears little similarity to either the US spot market or the UK Electricity Pool, because the market's primary purpose is operationally to balance the system, not conduct commercial trans-actions, although we recognise that such transactions may occur. Regardless of the type of market used to balance the system on the day, British Gas will undoubtedly ensure that safety standards remain at their current high level. The probability of customers being cut off or explosions occurring is no greater than at present, and their safety will not be compromised. British Gas has done an exceptional job to ensure customer safety and security and will, we presume, continue to do so, regardless of how the gas industry evolves. The proposal attributed to Morgan Stanley was in fact co-written by Eastern Natural Gas (the gas business of Eastern Electricity), Manweb Gas and Morgan Stanley (the 'EMMS' group). All three companies contributed equally to the structure and mechanics of the proposed market. Your correspondent correctly stated that Morgan Stanley was involved in the creation of the Natural Gas Clearinghouse, but we sold all interest in the Natural Gas Clearinghouse in 1988. Morgan Stanley is neither proposing nor advocating that Natural Gas Clearinghouse or the IPE operates any structure relating to an operational balancing or 'spot' market. Such a decision, if taken, would be made by the gas industry as a whole. Colin Bryce, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co International, London E14 4QA</p>

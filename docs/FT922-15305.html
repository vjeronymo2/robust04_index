			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory makes attack on party election campaign A SENIOR Tory figure in the north-west has made a coded attack on Conservative Central Office over the party's election campaign, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. Mr Andrew Pearce, who is fighting the marginal seat of Ellesmere Port and Neston, said yesterday that candidates were looking for 'some zing and zap' from the leadership to turn the campaign. He wanted more vision displayed, harder attacks on Mr Neil Kinnock and the union card played strongly. The former Euro-MP also wants Labour's attitude to asylum for refugees questioned. 'We don't want a great flood of extra immigrants into this country. I'm very sorry if people are having a hard time in their own countries, but they are not our problem.' Mr Pearce refused to directly criticise Central Office, but added: 'Michael Heseltine has been forgiven for challenging Mrs Thatcher and he should be used to the full. I also want to see Norman Tebbit and David Mellor savaging Labour and particularly Kinnock.'</p>

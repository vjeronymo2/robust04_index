			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Bundesbank to be agent for state bond issue THE German federal state of Lower Saxony will shortly issue bonds through the state central bank of Bremen, Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, the Bundesbank's regional branch in Hanover. It is the first time the Bundesbank will act as an issuing agent for a state. The Landeszentralbank will auction the bonds for Lower Saxony on October 5. They are likely to have a 10-year maturity and will be listed on the Hanover and Frankfurt stock exchanges, where the Bundesbank will engage in market-smoothing operations. They will also be listed on the electronic Ibis trading system, the state's finance ministry said. It is hoped the issue, which is targeted at a wide range of investors, will raise between DM1.5bn and DM2bn, said Mr Holger Kordt, a Treasury official at the finance ministry. Lower Saxony has a borrowing requirement of some DM10bn this year, about half of which has already been raised. Most of it is being used to refinance old debt. Until now, Lower Saxony has issued Schuldscheine, or negotiated promissory notes, and less liquid bonds, which are not actively traded and whose prices are not usually tended by the central bank. 'We are hoping to offer investors an instrument that has high liquidity and a government name,' said Mr Kordt. Lower Saxony planned to become a regular borrower. 'This is not just a one-off issue; we hope to begin a steady flow of issuance via the Bundesbank,' he said Nevertheless, the bonds will be less liquid than bunds or Treuhand bonds, whose issue size average about DM10bn. Nor will they be deliverable into the bund futures traded in Frankfurt and London. Dealers expect them to yield between 15 and 25 basis points over 10-year government bonds. 'I think it will remain largely domestic paper - it will be too small to arouse big international demand,' said a Frankfurt analyst.</p>

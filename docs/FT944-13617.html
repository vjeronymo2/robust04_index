			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Airlines resume flights to India Eleven airlines yesterday announced resumed flights to India after the World Health Organisation declared most of the country plague-free. Air India, the international carrier, has been allowed to resume its services to Dubai and Doha, while Emirates (Dubai's airline), Gulf Air and Kuwait Airways have also resumed their Indian services after nearly a month. But Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and other members of the United Arab Emirates, as well as Pakistan, Bangladesh and some Russian and central Asian countries, have yet to lift the ban on flights. The Indian government expressed relief when a team of WHO experts indicated no evidence existed that plague had been transmitted in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras or Delhi, and these cities could be considered plague-free. But the UN organisation has recommended continued precautions while travelling to Surat in Gujarat and Beed in Maharashtra. The government has confirmed only 55 plague deaths, but health organisations hope authorities will heed it as a warning to improve India's inadequate health system. Worst hit by the plague panic are exports of fresh food. Officials admit that exports of perishables have fallen sharply, though no figures are yet available. India depends on the Gulf countries for 70 per cent of its exports of fruit, vegetables, meat, and seafood, which last year totalled Dollars 177m (Pounds 118m), and were expected to reach Dollars 200m this year. One estimate calculates the ban by Gulf countries has cost India more than Dollars 6m a day. Last year, trade between the Gulf states and India exceeded Dollars 3bn, including Dollars 2bn-worth of Indian exports. 'We have lost over a month of business due to the plague scare,' says Mr Bilal Lone, who imports non-ferrous metal scrap from the Gulf to India. The Indian Commerce ministry is optimistic that trade with the Middle East will return to normal with the restored air and sea links. 'The specific impact of the plague scare on trade will be clear when the figures for October are released next month,' a ministry official said. Travel experts estimate cancellations of up to 40 per cent of tourism arrivals this year, the plague scare having coincided with the peak tourist season. 'India's plans to increase tourism arrivals from 1.82m in 1993 to 5m by the year 2000 have been badly hit,' a tourism ministry official said.</p>

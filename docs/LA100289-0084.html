			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOEING MACHINISTS CONTRACT TALKS BOG DOWN  </P> <P> With a strike deadline approaching, contract talks bogged down Sunday between  Boeing Co. and the machinists union, which wants a share of the aerospace  firm's bulging profits.  </P> <P> The approximately 60 negotiators who have been meeting since Sept. 21 moved to  round-the-clock talks over the weekend. The workers' three-year contract  expires at midnight Tuesday.  </P> <P> Union spokesman Jack Daniels said talks reached "a point of no movement" and  the parties took an unspecified break to call in a federal mediator, Douglas P.  Hammond, who met with both sides on Sunday.  </P> <P> Boeing's 57,000 union machinists in the Seattle area, Portland, Ore., and  Wichita, Kan., have voted to strike if an acceptable contract is not reached by  the end of the day Tuesday.  </P> <P> In 1986, negotiators agreed to extend a strike deadline, but Daniels said it  would be "pure guesswork" to say whether that would happen again. The last  machinists strike against Boeing, in 1977, lasted two months.  </P> <P> Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft builder, is enjoying its fifth  straight year of record jetliner orders. So far this year, carriers have  ordered 736 Boeing jets worth $38.5 billion.  </P> <P> Though Pentagon cutbacks have subdued military business, Boeing Commercial  Airplanes has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth roughly $70 billion, with  deliveries set for well into the mid-1990s.  </P> <P> Some industry analysts, as well as some Boeing employees, doubt that a strike  is likely, given the pressure on Boeing to deliver a full order book of  commercial jets.  </P> <P> "Based on history, the union and Boeing have usually had a pretty good  relationship," said William Whitlow, an analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc. in  Seattle. "I think there is room for compromise."  </P> <P> But Daniels said there had been little movement on such key issues as a pay  increase, whether the money will come as a wage hike or a bonus, retirement  benefits and overtime.  </P> <P> Boeing officials declined to say what the company's plans would be in case of a  strike or to comment on negotiations.  </P> <P> The machinists have agreements that members of other unions will not do their  work in the event of a strike, but other Boeing unions have no-strike clauses  in their contracts.  </P> <P> For the first half of 1989, Boeing had net earnings of $356 million on sales of  $9.07 billion. For 1988, profits were $614 million on $16.96 billion in sales.  </P></p>

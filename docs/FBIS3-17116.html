The EC expert group at the negotiations was led by  Fikion Fotiadis, who heads the directorate for relations with  newly independent nations other than Russia.    Mr. Makarenko told journalists that as a result of the  negotiations Ukraine's agreement with the EC was finalized and  coordinated with European Commission experts. According to him,  the initialling of this agreement signifies a practical step by  Ukraine toward integration in the EC. He said that the success  of the negotiations was helped by the extension of the European  Commission's mandate for negotiations with Ukraine approved by  the EC Council of Ministers on 7 March. The draft agreement was  technically initialled at the level of experts on 18 March, Mr.  Makarenko said. It is due to be officially initialled on 23  March, during Anatoliy Zlenko's visit to Brussels. It is  planned that the agreement will be signed by the president of  Ukraine in May-June this year.    The agreement is a detailed, comprehensive document  stipulating the conditions for political, economic, trade, and  humanitarian cooperation between Ukraine and the EEC. As soon  as it takes effect, Ukraine will be exempt from quantitative  trade restrictions (except for textiles, metallurgical products,  and nuclear components). Under the agreement, Ukraine  undertakes certain obligations, such as to pursue market  reforms. The participants at the briefing stressed that the  content of the document puts to shame those who said Europe does  not need Ukraine.    Oleksandr Makarenko said that Ukraine and the European  Commission will start talks in 1998 on including Ukraine in the  free trade zone.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER FINED FOR BUILDING VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> Developer Abby Sher has pleaded no contest to one count of violating Santa  Monica building codes and paid a $562 fine. Another 14 counts against her were  dismissed.  </P> <P> Sher's legal troubles stemmed from her controversial Edgemar complex on Santa  Monica's Main Street, built to house shops, a restaurant and the private Santa  Monica Museum of Art. City prosecutors accused Sher of allowing the complex to  be used for art shows and other events before obtaining proper permits.  </P> <P> In her plea, filed this week in Municipal Court, Sher did not contest one count  that she improperly allowed a UCLA program to use the building last June. Sher  also agreed to provide all lessees in the complex with written copies of the  city's noise ordinance.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIZONA LAWSUIT COULD AFFECT FATE OF PHOTO RADAR  </P> <P> An angry Arizona motorist and the American Civil Liberties Union are  challenging the use of photo radar in a plea to the Arizona Supreme Court that  could be a harbinger of similar challenges in Pasadena.  </P> <P> A petition was filed by Phoenix resident Roseanne Cortright, who was  photographed by the device as she drove through nearby Paradise Valley, Ariz.,  the only other city in the United States to use the machine.  </P> <P> Aided by five attorneys from the Phoenix area who have donated their services,  Cortright is arguing that use of photo radar is illegal and unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The court is tentatively scheduled to decide on Feb. 15 whether to hear the  case. If it does, it would be the first case in the country involving photo  radar to reach the appellate level.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We're Going to Fight'  </P> <P> "Do we want robocop? Do we want a country where machines decide if we're  driving reasonably?" asked David D. White, the lead attorney in the case.  "We're going to fight this to the end."  </P> <P> The resolution of the case in Arizona will probably have a limited effect on  the legal debate over the use of photo radar in Pasadena because an Arizona  court decision would have no legal bearing in California, said Thomas D. Hogue,  an attorney who successfully argued a photo radar case in Pasadena.  </P> <P> But he said an affirmative decision in Arizona could help by outlining a legal  strategy that could be used in Pasadena. It could also act to encourage or  discourage more legal challenges here.  </P> <P> Photo radar is a device that combines a camera, microcomputer and traffic radar  to monitor the speed of traffic. It automatically snaps a picture of any  vehicle traveling faster than a pre-set speed limit.  </P> <P> The photograph, which includes the vehicle's license plate number and the  driver's face, is used to produce a speeding ticket that is later mailed to the  registered owner of the car.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used in Europe, Asia  </P> <P> The Swiss-built device has been used for years in Europe and Asia, but it has  appeared in the United States in the last year and a half.  </P> <P> In that period, it has issued more than 14,300 speeding tickets in Pasadena and  Paradise Valley, and inspired a steady stream of controversy.  </P> <P> A number of Pasadena motorists have challenged their tickets in court, but the  only major victory came in a case argued by Hogue. The judge ruled that the  police car containing the photo radar was painted the wrong color. The ruling  resulted in the dismissal of more than 900 tickets and the car has since been  repainted to comply with state requirements.  </P> <P> Despite the controversy, Pasadena officials have been pleased with photo radar  and began tests last week of a similar photo device to catch motorists who run  red lights.  </P> <P> Paradise Valley was the first city in the country to use the photo radar to  catch speeders, beginning in October, 1987.  </P> <P> There have been nearly 100 trials in disputes over photo radar tickets at the  local court level in Paradise Valley, with most motorists losing their cases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $60 Speeding Ticket  </P> <P> Cortright, a law firm receptionist, was photographed by the machine last August  and received a $60 speeding ticket in the mail a few weeks later.  </P> <P> But unlike most drivers who simply paid their fines, Cortright decided to  fight.  </P> <P> She asked White to be her attorney, and he was soon joined by other irate  lawyers and the ACLU. Efforts to reach ACLU officials in Arizona were  unsuccessful, but White said the group is involved in the case because of  concerns over the photo radar's infringement of individual rights.  </P> <P> Cortright is challenging the use of the machine on grounds that it is a  violation of an individual's constitutional right to due process.  </P> <P> Unlike an ordinary speeding ticket in which drivers are stopped by an officer,  photo radar citations are mailed to the registered owner of the car days and  even weeks after the incident has occurred.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adequate Defense  </P> <P> White said the result is that drivers may not remember the circumstances of the  incident and would be deprived of the ability to mount an adequate defense.  </P> <P> The circumstances are important because in Arizona, as well as Pasadena,  drivers can only be convicted of speeding if they exceed what is considered a  "reasonable and prudent" speed. In both states, drivers are allowed to go above  or below the posted speed limit, depending on road conditions.  </P> <P> For example, on foggy days with very poor visibility, a driver could be cited  for speeding even though he did not exceed the posted speed limit. Similarly, a  driver could exceed the limit if visibility is good and there are no other  vehicles on the road.  </P> <P> "How can you prepare a defense if you can't remember what happened?" White  asked.  </P> <P> He said use of the photo radar is also unconstitutional because the registered  owner of the vehicle is held responsible, even though someone else may have  been driving the car.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Innocent Until Guilty  </P> <P> Registered owners in both cities can have photo radar tickets dismissed by  proving they are not the driver in the photograph.  </P> <P> But White said the city has no legal right to cite the registered owner in the  first place.  </P> <P> "In this country, we're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty," he said.  </P> <P> Charles G. Ollinger, town attorney in Paradise Valley, rejected White's  arguments as unfounded.  </P> <P> He said mailing tickets after an incident has occurred does not deprive drivers  of the chance to defend themselves. For example, he said, robbery suspects are  routinely arrested weeks or even months after a crime has occurred.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Trivial' Infringement  </P> <P> He added that holding the registered owner of a car responsible for a ticket is  no different than the way parking tickets are handled.  </P> <P> Ollinger said that even if there was some infringement of an individual's  rights, it would be "so trivial compared to the interests of the people of the  state in enforcing traffic rules."  </P></p>

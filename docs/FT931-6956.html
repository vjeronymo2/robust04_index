			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais tightens BfG link CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state-controlled banking group, has strengthened its position at BfG, the German bank in which it recently acquired a majority shareholding, by securing an agreement that gives it the right to intervene in the running of the bank. BfG is in the throes of a rationalisation programme to reduce its 5,100-strong workforce to 4,400 over the next two years. Credit Lyonnais in November ended a five year campaign to expand into Germany by buying 50.1 per cent of BfG for DM1.42bn. The French bank yesterday also announced it was expanding its domestic interests by raising its stake in SDR Expanso, a Bordeaux-based regional development agency, by 5 per cent leaving it with a total holding of 5.8 per cent.</p>

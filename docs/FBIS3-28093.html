			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- Korean shipping lines are  enabled to obtain large specialized vessels or container ships  through their locally incorporated firms abroad effective April  this year. The Maritime and Port Administration reported on  Thursday it had decided to permit shipping firms to build these  vessels with foreign financial funds obtained in the name of  their locally incorporated companies.    The decision is to help the maritime industry secure vessels  more easily and alleviate their taxational burdens, an official  at the administration said. He explained that Korean shipping  firms will be allowed to obtain shipbuilding loans abroad  without regard to whether the vessels to be built would be  registered in Korea or elsewhere. This means that ships thus  obtained could be registered in third countries, instead of  Korea, where ship-related tax rates are lower.    In the initial stage, shipping lines will be permitted to  obtain only large specialized vessels like crude oil, coal and  iron ore carriers and container vessels because an overall  permission would obviously lead to a rush to overseas vessel  procurement, the official said.    Presently shipping lines obtain vessels with either  shipbuilding loans from domestic banks or foreign capital  introduced under the condition of registering new-built vessels  in the country. But, domestic loans carry high interest rates  while introduction of foreign capital has to go through rigid  government control.</p>

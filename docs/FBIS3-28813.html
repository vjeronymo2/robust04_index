			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta, Feb 11 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Several foreign  ministers from the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) meeting here  expressed their concern over a number of unsettled conflicts in  parts of the world including Bosnia, Somalia and the Middle  East. At the consultative meeting of NAM foreign ministers that  ended on Thursday, they uged the international community to take  serious steps in stopping the human tragedies that have claimed  thousand of innocent lives.    With regard to the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  ministers agreed to seek the implementation of resolutions by  the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) including enforcing  "safe areas" and limited air strikes on the Serbian troops in  Bosnia. [passage omitted]    Another human tragedy that was called to attention during  the  meeting was the protracted conflict that spawned famine, anarchy  and massive loss of lives in Somalia.    Foreign Minister Alatas said that the problem today was made  more complicated by the intended pullout of US, French, Italian  and Turkish troops that formed the bulk of UN peacekeeping  forces in Somalia. The withdrawal of the troops, he said, would  aggravate problems in the region since NAM's troops from India,  Pakistan and Malaysia would be caught between the warring  factions.    "An undermaned and underarmed UN force may not be able to  forestall renewed factional fighting," Alatas stressed. He also  assured NAM's continued support for the UN effort by offering  meeting places for constructive consultations among the politcal  factions in Somalia to achieve a comprehensive solution.    "It is up to Somali people and their leaders to bring their  country out of the abyss, but we remain hopeful that they will  respond positively to the declaration issued last December by  the 4th coordinating meeting for the establishment of a  committee to launch the reconciliation process," Alatas said.    On the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Alatas said that  NAM welcomed the sigming of the declaration of principles on  interim self-government arrangements between the PLO  [Palestinian Liberation Organization] and Israel. Alatas said  the peace accord, together with the mutual recognition by the  PLO and Israel, constitutad the first essential step in tha long  journey toward a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict.    "Since then, however, there has been a significant measure  of  disillusionment as further negotiations to flesh out its basic  provisions have encouraged numerous obstacles," he added. He  said the remaining obstacles to end the conflict were mainly  inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the declaration.    "We are deeply concerned that the terms of Israeli  withdrawal  to designed areas by December 13, 1993 set up during the  September peace accord has not yet materialised," Alatas said.  Every effort, according to the minister, must be exerted to  ensure Israel's compliance with the previsions of the September  agreement which constituted the first step toward a  comprehensive solution which involve the withdrawal of Israeli  troops from all Palestinian and Arab territories.</p>

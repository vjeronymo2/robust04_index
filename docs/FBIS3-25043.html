			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Port Elizabeth Feb 7 SAPA -- Democratic Party [DP]  defence spokesman Gen Bob Rogers says members of the fledgling  National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] must be placed under existing  military discipline codes as there is no time to draw up a new  code.    Reacting on Monday [7 February] to the reported shambolic  situation at the NPKF's [Orange] Free State training camp, Gen  Rogers said those involved in the reported ill-discipline and  those in command should be condemned in the strongest terms. "A  question which needs to be answered is where the force  commander, Brigadier (Gabriel) Ramushwana, was during the events  described."    Gen Rogers said discipline was an essential factor in any  military or police force and especially so in one which had been  tasked to keep the peace in the run-up to the April election.    "Members must be placed under some existing form of military  or police discipline code as time does not allow a new code to  be drawn up."</p>

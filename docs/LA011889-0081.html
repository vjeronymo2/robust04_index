			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT OSTLER: HE IS POSITIVE THAT NEGATIVE IS WAY TO GO  </P> <P> Ask Mr. Negative, to whom every cloud has a silver lining, no doubt due to  atmospheric pollution or radioactive fallout. Or maybe because his eyes are  going bad from staring at this damn word-processor screen . . .  </P> <P> </P> <P> When Gaylord Perry missed being voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, winding  up 34 votes shy of the 336 needed for enshrinement, were you disappointed?  </P> <P> Heartbroken. I thought he should have missed by 336 votes. This guy loaded so  much junk on the baseball it floated up to the plate looking like a hot-fudge  sundae. This is known as creativity and gamesmanship. It is also known as  cheating.  </P> <P> Enshrinement? How about incarceration? Your momma could win 300 games with  Perry's bag o' tricks.  </P> <P> You're not supposed to be able to drool your way into the Hall of Fame. Perry  deserves his own special niche, though. Bestow on him the title Sultan of  Saliva, present him with a gold-plated tube of K-Y Jelly (hold the peanut  butter) and give him an Academy Award for special effects.  </P> <P>  What's the news on the Southern Methodist football scene?  </P> <P> </P> <P> A return to life, a renewed pride for the Mustangs' program, which was found  guilty of every rule infraction but loading up the football with K-Y Jelly.  Around Dallas there is a proliferation of bumper stickers bragging: "SMU  football: Integrity since 1989."  </P> <P> That's old news, though, since those bumper stickers started appearing a year  ago.  </P> <P>  On a recent halftime interview, Pat Riley told Chick Hearn, "There's been a  lot of speculation, undue criticism directed at Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) about his  performance." Do you agree?  </P> <P> I think what Riley meant to say was "overdue," in which case I agree.  </P> <P> If the criticism was undue, it's curious that Riley would put Kareem on a  2-week probation. What did Riley tell Kareem? "If this town's sportswriters  don't shape up soon, you'll be benched."?  </P> <P> Interestingly, most of the undue criticism of Kareem has come from Kareem.  </P> <P> The media criticism, Riley said, "created a burden on our club." Solving the  Lakers' problems should be simple, then. Just cancel the players' -- and  coach's -- newspaper subscriptions.  </P> <P>  What do you think of the book, "Personal Foul: The Broken Promises and  Shattered Dreams of Big Money Basketball at Jim Valvano's North Carolina  State"?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Riveting. I couldn't put it down. I read the entire title in one sitting.  </P> <P>  I read where Lloyd Moseby is disappointed because he's about to be traded by  the Toronto Blue Jays, just when they're about to get new uniforms and move to  a new ballpark. He said, "For 9 years I've played in pajamas, in the worst  ballpark in baseball." Do you sympathize?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Does a bear install plumbing in the woods? You think I'm called Mr. Negative  because I hang out in photo darkrooms?  </P> <P> I think Mr. Moseby should be re-assigned to a new occupation featuring  dignified clothing and pleasant working conditions. Coal mining comes to mind.  </P> <P> To be fair, though, I guess it wouldn't be much fun to be in a line of work  where you're forced to wear a silly cap, funny underwear and flip-down  sunglasses. No wonder the players are threatening to strike.  </P> <P>  NBC's Bob Trumpy made an on-the-air reference to Miami football Coach Jimmy  Johnson having a reputation as "a used-car salesman." Was that a low blow?  </P> <P> </P> <P> The lowest, an unprovoked cheap shot at used-car salesmen.  </P> <P> Most used-car salesmen, in fact, are former college coaches and alumni athletic  boosters who had conscience attacks and decided to go straight, but couldn't do  it cold turkey.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  Do you personally refer to the Forum as the Great Western Forum? After all,  Great Western Bank did kick in a lot of money for arena improvements in  exchange for linking its name with that of the Forum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> I think it would be unfair to single out one sponsor to have its name attached  to this great arena. Several other corporations generously donate money to the  Forum in exchange for hanging their name or logo inside the building.  </P> <P> Therefore, I always refer to this grand arena by its full and proper name: The  Toyota Kenwood Prime Ticket Budweiser Michelin RC Cola Continental Airlines  Sharp Copiers Centinela Hospital KLSX Radio Labatt's Blue Discount Tire Center  Bud Light Northwest Airlines Gatorade Amtrak Lite Beer From Miller Canon EOS  Marlboro Emergency Exit Only Forum.  </P></p>

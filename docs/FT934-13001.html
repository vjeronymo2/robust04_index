			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms busy More volatile moves in the telecoms sector provoked a variety of stories, but dealers said that most of the action was down to a simple bout of profit-taking. SG Warburg was one of a number of brokers advising a pause for breath on the sector, although remaining fundamentally positive. Telecoms stocks have zoomed forward in recent weeks as several bullish factors have come into play, including the proposed Dollars 22bn takeover by Bell Atlantic of Tele-Communications Inc, the rating applied to the flotation of Singapore Telecom and the video on demand potential linked to BT. Cable and Wireless was among the worst hit, the shares tumbling 17 to 946p. BT also slipped back, its shares ending 6 adrift at 467p. Vodafone bounced from initial weakness to close 2 up at 563p. The week's burst of activity in international markets turned the spotlight on the merchant banks, sending the shares sharply ahead. Kleinwort Benson moved 13 ahead to 514p, while SG Warburg gained 23 to 902p. The rest of the investment sector was not to be left behind and M&amp;G Group blasted through the Pounds 10 barrier. Mercury Asset Management improved 8 to 714p. Elsewhere in financials, talk that several influential brokers were set to come out with buy recommendations for National Westminster helped fuel the day's advance in the shares. They closed 12 up at 585p, in trade of 3.3m. A stock overhang depressed Abbey National and the shares bucked the market trend to close 6 lighter at 415p. A recommendation from Strauss Turnbull following a visit to Standard Chartered boosted the banking group's shares sending them 21 ahead to 1036p. Drugs stocks continued to enjoy investor interest, with Wellcome especially ending the week with a flourish. The stock, which has been buoyed by an upbeat US conference, moved ahead 22 1/2 to reach 845 1/2 p. After US interest boosted the stock in the previous session, the buying was thought to have spread out to be more general yesterday and was sustained through most of the day. SmithKline A pushed up 13 1/2 to 448p and Zeneca added 14 to 797 1/2 p. Running against the trend was Glaxo which gave up 7 1/2 to close at 715 1/2 p. The stock, which has been at the forefront of the drugs' charge, fell back as investors switched into its rivals. On its last day of trading, Rothmans 'B' put on 5 to 626p, as turnover reached 6.4m. The company is being restructured into two separate groups with effect from Monday. However, a Stock Exchange ruling means that the new shares issued by Rothmans and Vendome, after the reorganisation of the tobacco and luxury goods group, will not be included in the UK stock market indices. Rothmans is to be replaced by Southern Electricity in the list of FT-SE 100 companies, that fact boosting its shares 18 1/2 to 624 1/2 p ahead of its debut, in trade of 1.1m. Speculation about boardroom changes hung around Lasmo and the stock saw active trade of 6.6m. Market rumours about the future of the finance chief refuse to die down. The shares finished the session ahead 3 at 143 1/2 p. Stores stocks enjoyed another good session as a mixture of interest rate hopes and this week's retail figures sustained investor attention. Argos continued to climb, the shares adding 5 to 353p, as did Body Shop, up 6 at 215p. Upbeat remarks by Bass executives over Holiday Inns helped the shares add 4 to 495p. The division's chairman was reportedly telling a conference that margins were hardening as the market recovered. Fears of a cut in defence expenditure in next month's Budget continued to overhang several defence related stocks. Shares in GEC eased 6 to 346p, with Smith New Court reported to have been the day's main sellers. Volume at the close was 6.7m. A confident statement to accompany better than expected figures from Pratt and Witney, a US competitor to Rolls-Royce, led to demand for stock in the the UK aero-engine maker. The shares gained 4 1/2 to 155p, on turnover of 12m. Shares in engineering group Meggitt eased a penny to 100p after a substantial trade in the shares. Smith New Court was said to have bought a block of around 4.3m shares (around 2.1 per cent of the group's shares) at 96 1/2 p, and sold around 2.8m of the holding in a flurry of activity at 98p.</p>

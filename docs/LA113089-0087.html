			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK / SEAN WATERS;  </P> <P> LOSS STIRS PLEASANT MEMORIES IN GARNER  </P> <P> Eleven years ago, a Culver City tailback named Rob Garner ran behind two  behemoth linemen and carried the Centaurs to a 13-0 record and a Northwestern  Conference championship.  </P> <P> Fillmore Coach Curtis Garner remembers that season well. He began his coaching  career as the Centaurs' assistant line and special-team's coach.  </P> <P> And that unstoppable force was his younger brother, Rob, currently a Fillmore  assistant.  </P> <P> Last Friday in the Southern Section Division IX football quarterfinals, the  Garners watched their defense get dragged across the field by two freight  trains named Sparks and Jones.  </P> <P> Derek Sparks had 241 yards of total offense and four touchdowns and Michael  Jones rushed for 134 yards to give Montclair Prep a 35-8 victory.  </P> <P> "We ran into a good team with two potential Division I players," Garner said.  "We thought we did a good job preparing our players. We had Montclair Prep's  offense down cold."  </P> <P> "It was pretty frustrating," he added. "We would penetrate past their offensive  line and they would run you down."  </P> <P> But Montclair Prep's offense was one-dimensional.  </P> <P> "It was very predictable what they did," Garner said. "One ran right off guard,  the other left. It was no great mystery. It was a matter of trying to stop  them."  </P> <P> Frontier Flashes: The Tri-Valley League doesn't have to worry about the  resurgence of the Fillmore program because the Flashes will move to the  Frontier League next season.  </P> <P> That means Garner will spend more time watching game films and urging players  to participate in off-season weight programs and passing leagues.  </P> <P> "My wife knows she'll be seeing less of me," Garner said. "We don't belong in  the Frontier League. Obviously, the level of competition is much higher.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, more kids will get excited about playing football at Fillmore after  the success we had this season."  </P> <P> Bowling: Whereas bowl games generate thousands of dollars for Division I  schools, junior college bowl games are -- not surprisingly -- often billed as a  learning experience. In that vein, Ventura College (7-3) will get a course in  budgeting on a shoestring when it travels to San Diego to meet Palomar (6-4) in  the Hall of Fame Bowl on Saturday.  </P> <P> Ventura is hoping to break even on its expenses for the trip, which involves a  bus ride and overnight stay. Ventura Athletic Director Jerry Dunlap said it  will cost the athletic department between $3,000-4,000 for transportation, food  and lodging for the players and coaches.  </P> <P> "We hope to break even," Dunlap said. "If we weren't staying the night, we  might make some money."  </P> <P> Sixty percent of the gate receipts go directly to the athletic committee  sponsoring the game and the remaining 40% will be divided between the two  schools. Between 2-5,000 fans are expected to attend.  </P> <P> Add bowling: Ventura is one of five Western State Conference teams that will  compete in area bowl games.  </P> <P> Bakersfield (8-0-2) will meet Taft (8-0-1) in the Shrine Potato Bowl; L. A.  Southwest (7-2-1) will meet College of the Desert (8-2) in the Southern  California Bowl; Valley (5-5) will play Santa Barbara (6-4) in the Western  State Conference Bowl; and the Orange County Classic will feature Moorpark  (9-1) and Rancho Santiago (9-1).  </P> <P> "I think it's a sign that our conference is tough," Ventura Coach Phil Passno  said. "It's coming close to being one of the strongest in the state."  </P> <P> Football honors: Tom Briggs of Moorpark College has been named a first-team J.  C. Grid-Wire All-America at linebacker. One of three linebackers selected,  Briggs, a 6-foot-6, 230-pound sophomore from Liverpool, N.Y., led Moorpark with  19 1/2 sacks and an additional 16 1/2 behind-the-line tackles.  </P> <P> Moorpark running back Freddie Bradley was selected to the second team in what  Grid Wire publisher Hank Ives called a remarkably deep year for running backs.  A Hueneme High graduate, Bradley (6-1, 205) led the state in scoring and rushed  for 1,266 yards.  </P> <P> Ventura's Kyron Johnson (5-9, 174) a sophomore defensive back from Ventura  High, was an honorable-mention choice.  </P> <P> Basketball blitz: The 21st Moorpark College basketball tournament will be held  at Moorpark, beginning today and running through Saturday. Moorpark (4-2) will  open against Rio Hondo College tonight at 7. Oxnard College plays San Jose City  College at 5 p.m., and Ventura plays Pasadena at 9 p.m.  </P> <P> The championship game will be Saturday at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Coaching change: Scott Randles has been hired to run the Oak Park High baseball  program, filling a vacancy created when Ron Veres resigned in September.  </P> <P> The vacancy was created when Veres resigned as football and baseball coach  Sept. 6, citing philosophical differences with the administration.  </P> <P> Add coaching: Moorpark High Athletic Director Rich Uphoff will coach the boys'  wrestling team this season after failing to find a successor to Fred Fredette.  </P> <P> Moorpark begins the season with an overnight trip to the Oceanside tournament  beginning Friday.  </P> <P> Jeff Riley and staff writer Brendan Healey contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

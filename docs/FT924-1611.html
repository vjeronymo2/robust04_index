			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Submarine dockyard allegation is dropped BACKERS OF the campaign to secure vital submarine work for Plymouth's Devonport dockyard yesterday withdrew allegations that details of a dock project were leaked from the Ministry of Defence to the rival yard at Rosyth in Fife, David White writes. Mr Gary Streeter, Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton, said he accepted the ministry's assurances that no leak had taken place. Mr Mike Leece, managing director of Devonport Management, the yard's operator, said he had received similar assurances in writing from consulting engineers on the rival projects, on which several thousand jobs are at stake. He added: 'We were suspicious that anyone could put forward a scheme very similar to ours without a leak taking place.' The two yards are competing for the contract to refit the UK's latest Trident ballistic-missile submarines, which cannot be accommodated in existing dock facilities. Both consider the contract vital to their survival.</p>

He  stressed that a company like this would not be able to function  without major capital investment from Russia.    According to Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Russian  Federation military space forces, Baykonur has received this  year only about 2 billion rubles of the 6 billion rubles that  Kazakhstan was to allocate to fund the cosmodrome. Russia has  to pay more than 30 billion rubles to maintain Baykonur.  According to available information, construction and  maintenance building work is currently under way at the  cosmodrome, but the staffing levels in the space units are  running at only 53 percent.</p>

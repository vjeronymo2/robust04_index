			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- With the "Green Round"  multilateral talks just around the corner, the South Korean  Government decided Monday to play an active part in global  environmental activities and adopt world environmental standards  in industry.    After a meeting of environment-related ministers presided  over by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, the government said it  would adopt as the Korean Standard (KS) to the norms on  environmental management of the International Standardization  Organization (ISO) which will be completed by 1996.    The government also decided to join the convention on  biological diversity which has been in effect since last  December, the Montreal Protocol and the Copenhagen Protocol or  the Amendment to the Montreal protocol in the first half of this  year.    The ministers said the country should join by May 15 the  second term (July 1994-June 1997) Global Environment Facility  (GEF), which was established with the aim of preventing global  warming, protecting the ozone layer and world water resources,  and preserving the diversity of species.    To that end, the government decided to contribute 5.6  million  dollars to the GEF.    In another effort to prepare for the upcoming Green Round  negotiations, the government drew up a plan to reinforce the  activities of "the task force for the international  environmental management standards" set up at the Korea  Employers' Association (KEA).    The government hopes that the task force's activities would  lead industries to seek environment management systems.    Concerned that perhaps South Korea, sandwiched between the  developed and developing countries, may not make itself heard,  the ministers who attended the meeting agreed to carry out  aggressive diplomacy to defend Seoul's interests during the  Green Round negotiations.    The ministers also agreed to minimize trade regulations  imposed in the name of environmental protection, given that free  trade serves the causes of the world trade organization.    In addition, they decided to host the first  intergovernmental  meeting sponsored by the United Nations Emvironment Program  (UNEP) to enhance cooperation in Northeast Asia. North Korea  will also be invited to the meeting.    To join in global efforts to protect wild animals, the  ministers will establish laws banning the sale of tiger bones  and tiger-bone medicines by October this year.    Moreover, some 10 billion won will be provided to businesses  for the establishment of recycling facilities and waste storage  centers.</p>

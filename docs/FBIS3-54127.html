			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F> staff, by Tzvi Timor and Aharon Klein; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] ['AL HAMISHMAR] What did you think of al-Asad's  speech in Geneva? Do you think it means progress and a  breakthrough, from Israel's viewpoint?    [Baraq] I think the progress is mainly on a symbolic level.  A commitment was created by his very uttering of such words  while addressing the U.S. President and, later, the entire world  in the presence of the U.S. President -- with Clinton adding  some things. Yet the content was no different from things he has  said on previous occasions in various places, including public  ones. But I think it was nevertheless an achievement from the  point of view of American and Syrian diplomacy.    As for Israel, we have time, and time will show whether a  breakthrough did or did not take place. If we learn that  al-Asad is prepared to hold pragmatic discussions on the  substance of peace and the nature of security arrangements, it  will definitely mean progress. If, however, we learn that he is  not prepared to hold such a dialogue, we will realize that no  progress was achieved and that he may have been merely  attempting to make progress vis-a-vis the Americans. Time will  show whether that is the situation. In any event, if and when a  dialogue is launched, we will keep an unwavering eye on the  vital security interests of Israel, which are to remain intact.    ['AL HAMISHMAR] Is the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] drafting  plans for a possible withdrawal? Has the Army prepared any  contingency plans?    [Baraq] That is unnecessary at this stage. I have already  said once that we are intimately familiar with the Golan Heights  and if and when we are required to present our stand, we will be  able to do so at any kind of discussion about its future. We  must remember that the IDF has no part in the making of such  crucial political decisions. It has an interest in and a stand  on the security aspects of each decision, and it will present  its stand to the cabinet, apprise the Knesset of it, and inform  the general public of it in the appropriate fashion.    ['AL HAMISHMAR] Is the IDF capable of defending Israel in  any feasible situation, assuming there will be a partial or a  full withdrawal?    [Baraq] I say that in our current place and situation, and  in the situations we have had to face to date, we need the Golan  Heights very much. Every meter, every hill, every ridge and  knoll. As long as the current situation remains unchanged, as  long as the perils inherent in the current situation remain  unchanged -- namely, as long as a Syrian attack is still a  realistic possibility, even though not tomorrow morning -- we  need all of the Golan Heights. If the question refers to  hypothetical situations, I do not think this is the right time  to reply. If a different relationship is established -- a  relationship of substance rather than a merely technical or  formal one -- there will be things that can be reconsidered. In  any event, I do not believe there will ever be an Israeli  Government that will create a situation in which the State of  Israel is indefensible.    ['AL HAMISHMAR] Should an agreement with Syria include a  demand for -- or even insistence on -- the deployment of U.S.  disengagement troops on the Golan Heights or the Hermon?    [Baraq] It is hard to answer this question without knowing  what kind of an arrangement we will have. Any peace arrangement  with the Syrians must include a very complex system of security  arrangements, including demilitarization and early warning, as  well as arrangements preventing aggression initiatives in  general and surprise attacks in particular. Such a system may  allow for a certain involvement of outside elements, either to  supervise the arrangement or as part of a joint system of  control on both sides. I think discussing this question and the  possibility of troops is premature, because any such thing will  be the outcome of negotiations, and those have not even been  launched, and the outcome of such negotiations depends on what  the parties want. It would be wrong to discuss partial  components at this time. [passage omitted]</p>

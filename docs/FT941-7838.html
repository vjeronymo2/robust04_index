			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Management: Styles of execution - In light of the BMW-Rover deal / A look at the contrasting attitudes between German and British managers As BMW and Rover begin to get to know each other, and start deciding how to achieve the Bavarian company's goal of collaborating without destroying Rover's motivation and British character, new evidence has emerged of the deep gulf which separates managerial attitudes and behaviour in many German and British companies. The gap is so fundamental, especially among middle managers, that it can pose severe problems for companies from the two countries which either merge or collaborate, according to a study by a team of German and British academics called 'Managing in Britain and Germany', which will be published this autumn. The phenomenon manifests itself in the contrasting attitudes of many Germans and Britons to managerial expertise and authority, according to the academics, from Mannheim University and Templeton College, Oxford. This schism results, in turn, from the very different levels of qualification, and sorts of career paths, which are typical in the two countries. These contrasting patterns encourage many German and British managers to hold opposed views of the nature of management itself, according to a working paper by the German side of the team, under Alfred Kieser. The academics' conclusions are based on a comparative study of three industries - brewing, construction and insurance  - but are in line with the results of several broader studies over the past 20 years. The project leader, Rosemary Stewart of Templeton College, says the gulf in attitudes and behaviour may be narrowing in high-technology industries such as electronics, but she doubts whether they are doing so to the same extent in the motor industry. German managers - both top and middle  - consider technical skill to be the most important aspect of their jobs, according to the working paper. It adds that German managers consider they earn their authority with colleagues and subordinates from this 'expert knowledge', rather than from their position in the organisational hierarchy. Half the German managers in the study did not even mention their leadership responsibilities. By stark contrast, British middle managers see themselves as executives first and technicians second, says the working paper. The term 'management', it continues, 'was on everyone's lips', but more than a third of them did not even mention technical responsibilities. In some cases this may be because they do not possess the requisite technical expertise to do their jobs in a way which their German counterparts would consider effective, the academics suggest. As a result, German middle managers may find that the only people within their British partner companies who are capable of helping them solve routine problems are 'operatives' who do not have management rank, conclude Kieser and co. Such an approach is bound to raise status problems in due course, but 'there seems to be no way out given the current lack of knowledge of each other's system'. Other practical results of these differences in attitude include a greater tendency of British middle managers to regard the design of their departments as their own prerogative, and to reorganise them more frequently than happens in Germany, say the academics. German middle managers can have 'major problems in dealing with this', they point out, since British middle managers also change their jobs more often. As a result, UK organisations often undergo 'more or less constant change'. Of the 30 British middle managers in the study, 13 had held their current job for less than two years (compared with only three in Germany), and another 12 (seven in Germany) for less than four. One British insurance company manager had changed jobs nine times in eight years, and a construction company manager seven times in 11 years. Many of the Britons had also moved between unrelated departments or functional areas. In contrast, all but one of the Germans had stayed in the same functional area. Twenty of them had occupied their current positions for five years or more (12 of them for more than 10), compared with only five of the Britons. The Mannheim researchers almost certainly exaggerate the strengths of the German pattern; its very stability feeds the rigid attitudes which stop many German companies from adjusting to external change. But the academics are correct about the drawbacks of the unstable and technically-deficient British pattern. And they are right in concluding that the two countries do not merely have different career systems but also, in effect, different ways of doing business. That does not necessarily mean that the findings of the Mannheim-Templeton study should be taken as a direct warning to BMW and Rover. The latter's ability to learn from its long relationship with Honda has made the attitudes of many of its managers more Japanese than British - especially as regards the technical content of their jobs, as well as the source of their own organisational status. On both counts, Japanese and German attitudes are not too far distant from each other. In contrast with the long line of academic studies cited by Stewart and Keiser, other researchers have concluded that the variance of managerial attitudes between industries can in some cases be greater than it is between countries. If this reading proves correct, Rover's managers could find that they have relatively few differences with their new BMW masters. But the truth is likely to lie somewhere in the middle, with the Stewart-Keiser study having more than a modicum of relevance for both the Bavarians and the Brits. It certainly does for companies in many other industries.</p>

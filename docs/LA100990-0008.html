			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSTAGES CRISES IN TWO CITIES  </P> <P> As the owner of a fast-food restaurant in Hollywood, I am disturbed by the  implications in the article headlined "High Risk, Low Security at Fast-Food  Stands."  </P> <P> (Metro, Sept. 26.)  </P> <P> I believe it is wrong to single out fast-food restaurants as particular targets  of armed robbers. This is a problem that pervades our entire society, whether  it be at liquor stores or mom-and-pop groceries, follow-home robbers in posh  suburbs or Rolex grabbers on the street in broad daylight.  </P> <P> Any business that deals in cash or valuable merchandise must take reasonable  precautions to prevent criminal assault. But once we have done that, are we to  surrender abjectly to these elements and put our people behind bullet-proof  glass?  </P> <P> MICHAEL E. LEVITON  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

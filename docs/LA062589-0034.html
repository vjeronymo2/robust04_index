			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIN FOREST TEACHES CHILDREN LESSON IN LIFE  </P> <P> For Beverly Revness and Janice Tarr, the school year that ended Friday was a  long, difficult and tumultuous one, but comments from students like 10-year-old  Natasha Roje give them hope that it was not all in vain.  </P> <P> "I wonder, if I have children," Natasha told a classroom visitor recently, "if  they'll ever get to know about the rain forests, or if they have to see  pictures and stuff."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small-Scale Triumph  </P> <P> Revness and Tarr, teachers at Kenter Canyon Elementary School in Brentwood,  have spent the year raising the environmental consciousness of their fourth-  and fifth-graders with a joint project for the two classes.  </P> <P> While many parents, teachers and students will remember the 1988-89 school year  as the year of a teachers strike that highlighted the many troubles facing  urban public education, others may prefer to find hope in the small-scale  triumphs that take place in classrooms such as this one.  </P> <P> Drawing from a range of public and private resources, Revness and Tarr  assembled a year-long environmental awareness project for their classes which  will be entered in a federal competition sponsored by the Environmental  Protection Agency. The program, drawing hundreds of applicants a year,  recognizes 10 precollegiate projects around the nation for outstanding service  to the environment. Winning entrants are honored with a three-day trip to  Washington.  </P> <P> Together, the Kenter Canyon teachers fashioned a year-long curriculum centered  on what scientists say is one of the most serious threats to the world's  environment: the destruction of the globe's tropical rain forests.  </P> <P> Back in September, most of the children would have been unable to even locate  such forests on a map. Now, many show a remarkable grasp of some of the complex  issues at stake.  </P> <P> In one recent class, for example, they talked about how some American fast-food  chains contribute to deforestation by obtaining their beef from cattle raised  cheaply on cleared tropical land in South America and Indochina. At one point,  some of the students announced that they would boycott the chains that did so.  On other occasions, the students have written the heads of the International  Monetary Fund and the U.S. Commerce and Agriculture departments to urge a halt  to policies that encourage economic exploitation of such lands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Students Bused In  </P> <P> The Kenter students, despite the school's location in affluent Brentwood, are  relatively representative of the Los Angeles school district. About one-third  of the 500 children are bused in from overcrowded inner-city areas. The student  body is about two-thirds white, 21% Latino, 8% Asian-American and 7% black.  Slightly more than one-sixth of the students have been designated to have  limited English proficiency.  </P> <P> Spoken to individually, the children in Revness and Tarr's classes are eager to  explain what they have learned in lessons throughout the year.  </P> <P> "They're cutting down all the rain forest trees and they're burning them," says  9-year-old Dana Horstein. Citing a makeshift textbook of environmentalist  publications assembled by her teachers, she says rain forests are being  destroyed in the tropics at the rate of 50 acres per minute.  </P> <P> Environmentalists caution that at the current rate of use, such forests will be  completely cut down by 2050, at devastating cost. Up to half the life forms on  Earth live in the affected regions, including key sources for many drugs, such  as those used to combat childhood leukemia. Scientists also caution that  burning the trees amounts to a double-barreled contribution to global warming  -- the so-called "greenhouse effect." Combustion adds pollutants and carbon  dioxide to the atmosphere, while removal of trees decreases the planet's  ability to absorb the gas, believed to be the key factor in trapping the sun's  heat in the atmosphere.  </P> <P> Developers clear the forests for lumber, cattle-grazing land and commercial  development.  </P> <P> "By cutting down the trees it's going to make it hotter . . . and it'll be all  gone and it'll be really hot," Dana adds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Making Pollution  </P> <P> Rene Ramirez, 9, says: "I don't know, when they're cutting down the trees, if  they're thinking."  </P> <P> "I think they should . . . be more careful about it," adds Maiko Morishita, 10.  "If they cut down the rain forest and burn it they're making pollution."  </P> <P> "What I'm looking for when I'm teaching this course is to make these kids  become trustees of the environment," says Revness, 60. A 25-year supporter of  the Sierra Club and member of Greenpeace, the Audubon Society and World  Wildlife Fund, Revness initiated the Kenter project and is a three-time  recipient of a California teaching award for environmental awareness.  </P> <P> "We have assumed an activist role. The children unfortunately do not have the  money to join these organizations, but in spirit any time that they can work on  (related projects) they do," says Revness. "You see, the first thing you have  to do is motivate the children. And then it becomes a matter of education. . .  . I just don't want them to grow up and feel 'This isn't happening around here  and so this isn't happening (at all).' "  </P> <P> The curriculum for the yearlong course drew from a wide variety of sources.  Revness and Tarr, with the part-time assistance of June Carter, an  undergraduate geography major at UCLA, used National Geographic videotapes in  conjunction with several outings to the Los Angeles and San Diego Zoos to show  children tropical wildlife, much of which faces extinction if deforestation  patterns continue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Animal Habitats  </P> <P> Later, zoo docents visited the classroom to lecture in more detail about animal  habitats and food chains.  </P> <P> Pamphlets from environmental groups such as the Rainforest Action Network or  the World Wildlife Fund supplemented classroom materials depicting the tropical  ecosystem, while the teachers adapted environmental themes for discussions and  lessons ranging from social studies to art.  </P> <P> The heart of the yearlong project is a 4-by-6-foot scale model of an Amazonian  rain forest created by the students. Using paint, Mylar, acetate, clay,  Popsicle sticks, rubber bands and such, the students assembled a forest scene  including a cattle pen, aboriginal inhabitants, loggers, road-builders and  native animal species.  </P> <P> "We did the animals," said Maiko and Natasha proudly.  </P> <P> Carter took Revness's fifth-graders and Tarr's fourth-graders on field trips to  collect pebbles and branches for the model, while helping them design the  forest based on maps and textbooks. One student's retired grandfather helped by  donating labor and craft work.  </P> <P> "This is kind of unusual for fourth- and fifth-grade classes to do," says  Kenter Principal Suzanne Westmoreland. "It went into an area of geography into  depth. The children were really learning about the fragile balance of ecology."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Learn By Doing  </P> <P> "It's kind of a 'learn-by-doing' project," says Revness, who says the students  learned more by physically reconstructing what they had been taught.  "(Environmentalism) doesn't exist in a vacuum."  </P> <P> The model's designers like to talk about their work.  </P> <P> "We're trying to show how dumb it is to put the cattle in the rain forest  because the tigers and the lions just eat the cattle," says Philip Anson, 11.  "You have to be aware" of the issues, says Philip.  </P> <P> Others take a more reflective stance. Sometimes, "you just feel you can't do  anything" when confronted with the scope of international actions, Natasha  says. But her own formula for countering hopelessness reflects Revness'  personal guideline.  </P> <P> "What I look for in students is passion and commitment," says the teacher, who  began her career concentrating on civics and U.S. law.  </P> <P> For Natasha, the responsibility is clear. "You start thinking your vote can  count, and then you make more letters and phone calls until you get more people  to do something."  </P></p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Arts (Openings): Van Gogh An exhibition of rarely-seen Van Gogh self-portraits goes on show at Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum on Friday. The 20 paintings and two drawings all date from the artist's stay in Paris in 1886-7, when he was confronted for the first time with the range of colours used by the Impressionists. Five of the paintings have never been seen in public before. They were painted on the backs of earlier works, and have been reframed so that both sides can be viewed.</p>

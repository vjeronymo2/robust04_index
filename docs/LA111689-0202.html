			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON;  </P> <P> JOB-SEEKERS TARGET OF NO-PARKING SIGNS  </P> <P> In an attempt to discourage day workers from congregating on city streets to  solicit jobs, the City Council has authorized the posting of temporary "no  parking" signs in problem areas.  </P> <P> The council approved a resolution introduced by Councilman David John Shawver  that authorizes city workers to post temporary "no parking" signs on  unrestricted city streets where traffic problems are caused by job  solicitations.  </P> <P> The city already has increased its enforcement of existing parking and  trespassing restrictions.  </P> <P> While conceding that the city's present code-enforcement policy on public and  private property is working, Shawver urged the council to authorize the  temporary "no parking" zones to discourage day laborers from "spreading out  from posted intersections to areas where there are no parking or stopping  restrictions."  </P> <P> The measure now allows city workers to put up temporary signs similar to those  used in construction zones. The signs will be posted and enforced on a  day-by-day basis, whenever a particular area becomes a problem, Shawver said.  </P></p>

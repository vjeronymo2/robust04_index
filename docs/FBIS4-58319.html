			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 2 May (INA) -- The Iraqi newspapers issued  today reiterate their vehement denunciation of the hostile U.S.  Administration position on Iraq and its disregard of the  international community's will to lift the blockade on the Iraqi  people.    The newspapers AL-THAWRAH, AL-JUMHURIYAH, and BABIL  emphasize  that the White House policy on Iraq indicates a clear ignorance  of the logic of events, of the pillars of relations, and of  interests as well as a disregard of both the U.S. interests and  the exits to the U.S. markets.    In the "Standpoint" column, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH, which  expresses the views of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, says:  The picture at the Security Council is clear now. Only the  United States opposes lifting the embargo when China, France,  and Russia are making pressures to lift it. Britain  acknowledged that Iraq is cooperating with the Security Council.    AL-THAWRAH recalls what Washington imposed on its allies as  well as the U.S. issuance, in the Security Council's name, of  unfair resolutions against Iraq. The paper adds that after  Ekeus acknowledged before the Security Council that Iraq is  cooperating with it, the United States stood against the  international community's will, refused to implement Paragraph  22 of Resolution 687, and called for maintaining the blockade on  Iraq.    The paper draws the U.S. Administration's attention to the  fact that the international community is no longer capable of  following the U.S. policy indefinitely. The world is aware that  Iraq is a key player in the region and that it should be  addressed with rationality, patience, and good intentions  because any form of aggression or threats against Iraq are  useless. The paper urges the United States to adopt a different  policy toward Iraq; one that would take into account realities,  peoples' interests, and the international community's will.    The newspaper BABIL says that the U.S. position is becoming  more intransigent against Iraq at a time when the international  circles are witnessing increased cries and positions denouncing  the continued unfair economic blockade on Iraq. The paper adds:  Some influential members of the Security Council and the United  Nations support both the international law and the Security  Council resolutions which Iraq committed itself to implement.  The Iraqi commitment was acknowledged by the Special Commission  entrusted with international inspection. Thus, the only  explanation of the U.S. position is what we, in Iraq, knew from  the very beginning, that is, this position is a hostile and  conspiratorial one.    BABIL points out that with some signs appearing that many  international community circles are stressing the need for the  Security Council to fulfill its pledges to Iraq by issuing  resolutions lifting the oil embargo on it, the U.S.  Administration is no longer capable of using, as a pretext, the  international laws and human rights. This administration has  rancorously revealed its evil intentions about not fulfilling  its obligations to Iraq.    BABIL emphasizes that U.S. Secretary of State Christopher  could not endure this new state of affairs, so he visited the  region to meet with agents and with the afraid and shivering  ones and reassure them that the United States would always stand  against Iraq and its people. The paper points to Christopher's  article published in THE NEW YORK TIMES which contained a host  of lies that even the ordinary man in the street can no longer  believe. BABIL explains that this criminal U.S. position can  only receive further denunciation from the good ones and  conscientious people in the world.    The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH describes the Clinton  administration's policy on Iraq as resembling someone who fights  his own kinsfolk and stands against his people's interests.  Pointing out that the repercussions and damage resulting from  the blockade have extended outside Iraq and affected the  interests of Turkey, Jordan, and many European states such as  Germany, France, Spain, and Britain, the paper says that the  blockade inflicted grave damage on the Americans themselves  after it closed the doors to a market that used to import  one-fifth of the U.S. rice production in addition to large  quantities of grains, animal fodder, and other goods.    Discussing the large U.S. trade deficit with world states  last year, which amounts to $115.8 billion, the paper says that  the Clinton administration, under Zionist pressures and  individual interests, deliberately closes the doors to Americans  who wish to deal with Iraq, which has a tremendous ability to  accommodate goods and services.    Comparing the size of U.S. trade with Iraq and other states,  AL-JUMHURIYAH says that U.S. trade figures show that the overall  imports of U.S. goods by Syria, Bahrain, Oman, and Jordan did  not reach $1.5 billion and that Iraqi imports, during the period  of peak transactions with the United States, exceeded this  figure. Indicating that Iraq's imports of U.S. grains exceeded  $1 billion in 1989 and in the preceding year, the paper says  that, thanks to its huge ability to accommodate goods, Iraq  alone can import U.S. commodities worth more than one-half of  the U.S. exports to all Arab countries.    AL-JUMHURIYAH urges the Clinton administration to review its  policy and deal with Iraq through a rational logic based on  respecting sovereignty, abandoning both bigotry and hostility,  and looking forward to balanced trade relations. The paper adds  that there is still an opportunity for the White House  administration if it is aware of both the regional situation and  the U.S. interests in it.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Toshiba, IBM in technology link Toshiba of Japan, a leading manufacturer of notebook personal computers, has licensed microprocessor chip technology from International Business Machines in a breakthrough agreement in IBM's efforts to establish its PowerPC chip as a new standard for the personal computer industry. Under the agreement, Toshiba will purchase PowerPC chips from IBM for use in future products. It also gains rights to develop derivative PowerPC chips and to manufacture these chips for use in its own products. The agreement is also understood to include 'very significant' monitory elements. Toshiba has also licensed IBM's AIX computer operating system software. 'Toshiba and IBM consider this PowerPC alliance an important strategic step toward next-generation computer development,' said Mr Kunika Mizushima, executive vice-president of Toshiba. Intel, the world's largest chip maker, dominates the market for microprocessors used in PCs. About 90 per cent of all PCs sold contain either Intel microprocessors or chips designed to emulate Intel's technology. IBM, together with Motorola and Apple Computer, are, however, attempting to establish their jointly-developed PowerPC chips as a new industry standard. Apple introduced its first PowerPC products earlier this year. IBM said recently it had delayed introduction of PowerPC PCs until next year, although the company already sells work-stations and multiprocessor computers based on PowerPC chips. Toshiba is the first of the world's leading PC manufacturers outside the original PowerPC alliance to adopt PowerPC for use in future products, making it a valuable ally for IBM.</p>

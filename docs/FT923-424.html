			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered gets ADollars 71.5m in settlement STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK-based international banking group, is to receive ADollars 71.5m (Pounds 30m) cash as a court settlement for an ADollars 100m loan made to GPI Leisure International, an Australian leisure company, in 1988. The payment is in addition to the realisation of assets already recovered by Standard Chartered in relation to the GPI Leisure loan and accounted for in previous years. The defendants in the proceedings, brought in a New South Wales court, included Australian National Industries, Spedley Securities, and two former directors of ANI and Spedley. GPI Leisure was also a plaintiff in the court case. The cash payment is dependent on a number of preconditions being met in the next 90 days, otherwise the case will resume. Details were not released but Standard Chartered said that all parties were reasonably confident that the requirements would be met. The bank declined to give further details about the nature or details of the dispute. The cash will be included in Standard Chartered's 1992 accounts.</p>

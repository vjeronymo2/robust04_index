			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE ALERT: 439 BUILDINGS RATED UNSAFE;  </P> <P> BUT NONE OF THE COUNTY'S CITIES HAVE ADOPTED LAWS FOR PRE-1935 STRUCTURES  </P> <P> Beneath the charming facades of the historic brick buildings in the downtown  areas of Ventura County lies a hidden potential for disaster.  </P> <P> According to state standards, 439 buildings in eight of the county's 10 cities  are considered unsafe to be inside or near during a major earthquake, which  scientists say is inevitable in Southern California.  </P> <P> With no steel bars to reinforce walls, no anchors to hold the walls to the  roofs or to the foundations, the bricks can shift and crumble onto city  sidewalks and people.  </P> <P> Building officials cite as examples the massive damage caused by the October,  1989, earthquake in Santa Cruz and Watsonville, cities similar in construction  and geology to those in Ventura County.  </P> <P> To date, however, no cities in Ventura County have enacted ordinances that  require property owners to retrofit their buildings built before 1935 to meet  current safety standards.  </P> <P> The city of Ventura, the county seat, has the most unreinforced brick buildings  in the county. Among the 145 buildings of unreinforced masonry are the Ventura  Mission and Holy Cross School, where 200 children attend Mass and classes  daily.  </P> <P> The Catholic Church intends to bring the two historic buildings up to safety  standards as soon as the city of Ventura passes an ordinance requiring the  improvements, Msgr. Patrick J. O'Brien said. But the church has no money to do  the work now or after an ordinance is passed, he said.  </P> <P> "We are people of faith," O'Brien said. "People do come through for us when  there is a real need."  </P> <P> Everett Millais, Ventura's director of community development, said the city  should help its property owners improve their buildings as soon as possible to  save lives and businesses. He hopes the city will have an ordinance in place by  April.  </P> <P> "Anyone who looks at what happened to downtown Santa Cruz or Watsonville can  see what we need to do," he said. "We all want to do what we can to see that  when the earthquake does happen, we don't end up with a roped-off downtown  where we have to go in and bulldoze the buildings."  </P> <P> The city is waiting until it sees the results of a study by an outside  consultant before it develops an ordinance. Those results are due to be  completed next month.  </P> <P> The study will recommend the level of repairs that the buildings need and  whether they can still be economically viable after expensive repairs. Millais  said many of the buildings that are long and narrow might not pass the economic  test.  </P> <P> Those buildings, such as the one that houses Hess Hardware, need upgrades but  cannot command high rents to pay for the work. Some buildings might eventually  have to be razed, as owners walk away from their unprofitable investments,  Millais said.  </P> <P> Hess Hardware owner Daniel A. McKenzie said he hopes the day an ordinance is  passed never arrives.  </P> <P> "I hope the owner doesn't do any upgrades," said McKenzie, who for 45 years has  leased the small store space where buyers can find everything from nails to  nutcrackers. "If he does, we're out. The cost would be so great that the rent  would go up and we couldn't stand it."  </P> <P> Ventura's earthquake study comes on the heels of evidence that Ventura County  might be at greater risk for major earthquakes than previously believed.  </P> <P> Earlier this month scientists meeting in San Francisco uncovered evidence of a  fault off the coast of California that could cause an earthquake of the  magnitude of 7.  </P> <P> At the same meeting, scientists revealed that information from new space  technology confirmed previous findings that two Ventura County mountain ranges  are converging rapidly in geological time, increasing the likelihood of a major  earthquake.  </P> <P> But the information has not spurred enough action in Ventura County, said Jack  DeJong, a consultant hired by Fillmore and Ojai to advise the cities on  earthquake problems.  </P> <P> "From a safety standpoint, it is not wise to wait," said DeJong, who has  studied all the cities in the county. "But from an economic point of view, I  can understand the people's hesitancy to do anything about their buildings."  </P> <P> Santa Paula has a voluntary ordinance, which asks the owners of 120 unsafe  buildings to fix their properties. But the absence of a requirement together  with the city's lack of financial help for business owners renders the  ordinance almost ineffective, DeJong said.  </P> <P> He said people outside the affected area tend to forget the impacts of an  earthquake a few months after it happens. "The economics are such that if they  are not forced to upgrade their buildings, they are not going to do it," DeJong  said.  </P> <P> In Fillmore, 64 downtown buildings are unreinforced, but the city is waiting to  see how Ventura handles its ordinance, officials said.  </P> <P> Oxnard, with 53 unreinforced masonry buildings, should have an ordinance by  mid-1992 that requires upgrades and provides city redevelopment money for  low-interest loans, city officials there said.  </P> <P> Camarillo, with 37 hazardous buildings, contracts with Ventura County's  Building and Safety Department for service and falls under its guidelines. The  county has not yet required improvements.  </P> <P> Ojai is the only city that has made real progress, DeJong said. The city is  working on a mandatory ordinance and has begun working with its property owners  to improve 11 hazardous buildings. The city already worked in conjunction with  17 owners of buildings connected by the arcade, a stucco overhang that covered  a downtown sidewalk.  </P> <P> The city of Ojai set up an assessment district there to finance $1.7 million in  repairs.  </P> <P> Moorpark has only seven buildings considered hazardous and Simi Valley only  two. The cities of Thousand Oaks and Port Hueneme have none.  </P> <P> All officials acknowledge that tough political and economic decisions lie ahead  for the city councils that must make the policy decisions.  </P> <P> "There is no simple answer," Ventura's Millais said. "Our consultant put it to  us this way: If the objective is to preserve downtown building stock and  prevent loss of life and property in an earthquake, then we should do the  upgrades. But if the objective is to keep the downtown economically viable, the  solutions start becoming very complex."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUILDINGS' EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:4.31IN:3.54IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> No. of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Earthquake  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> unreinforced  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> upgrade  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> City  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> masonry bldgs.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> ordinance  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ventura  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 145 bldgs., mostly downtown  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No. Study and  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> recommendations due  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> in Jan.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Paula  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 120 bldgs., mostly downtown  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yes.

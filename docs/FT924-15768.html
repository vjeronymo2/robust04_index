			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Battle of Trafalgar It looks as though the good ship Trafalgar House has been well and truly holed by yesterday's dawn raid - and subsequent tender offer - from Hongkong Land. The question is whether the company will now sink ignominiously into the arms of its Far Eastern predator. For many in the City such a fate will be what Trafalgar's management richly deserves. Investors' patience has been sorely tried over the past couple of years by a series of strategic blunders, financial shocks, and apparent boardroom disunity. For some time the issue has been whether anyone would be prepared to come to the rescue. Much depends on the precise intentions of Land, and what sort of a fist Trafalgar makes of a seemingly weak hand. One must assume that Land genuinely wants to stick at 30 per cent, and hopes to make its presence felt through its own directors and the undoubted influence its stake would be able to wield over a cash-strapped company. Other shareholders might wince at the prospect of backdoor control and rush to tender their shares; alternatively they might conclude that even without a full bid a fresh broom can yet unlock shareholder value. Therein lies the crux. Quantifying the real value of the asset rich businesses is an uncertain and highly unscientific game. If Trafalgar's management cannot make a reasonable case that 85p per share is not enough, then it deserves no mercy.</p>

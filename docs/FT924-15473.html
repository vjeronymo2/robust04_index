			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Littlewoods expansion includes third store in St Petersburg LITTLEWOODS, the privately-owned pools and retail group, will open an Index catalogue shop in St Petersburg later this month expanding its trading presence in Russia to three stores. The company is also stepping up its expansion programme in the UK opening 10 stores over the next month creating 250 jobs. By the end of October, Index will have a chain of 128 outlets providing greater competition for Argos, which is currently the clear market leader in the catalogue shop sector. Littlewoods entered the Russian market a year ago when it opened one hard currency and one rouble store in the Gostinii Dvor shopping complex in St Petersburg. Although the stores have recorded strong sales they have had grave problems combatting shoplifting and more violent break-ins. Littlewoods has had to employ a team of security guards and take measures to prevent criminals entering the stores by smashing its windows. The Index store in St Petersburg will trade alongside the two other Littlewoods outlets. It will sell about two-thirds of the 2,000 lines normally stocked in Index stores in the UK and accept payments either in hard currencies or roubles. Mr James Higginbotham, Index managing director, said he was well aware of the need for additional security measures. He added that Index would consider opening more stores in Russia after fully evaluating whether the catalogue concept was suitable for the local market.</p>

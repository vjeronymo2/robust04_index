			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HONG KONG POLICE STORM REFUGEE SITE;  </P> <P> BOAT PEOPLE: TENSIONS AMONG 56,000 VIETNAMESE GROW IN THE FACE OF A PROMISED  NEW ROUND OF FORCED REPATRIATIONS.  </P> <P> Riot police firing tear gas stormed a refugee camp today, seizing more than 400  weapons and arresting boat people only hours after a group of 111 Vietnamese  voluntarily returned to their homeland.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive day of disturbances in Hong Kong's tense  detention centers, where more than 56,000 Vietnamese are awaiting resettlement  abroad or a one-way ticket back to Hanoi.  </P> <P> One Vietnamese was killed in what officials said was a gang fight in a closed  detention center Thursday night.  </P> <P> The clashes came in the face of a promised new round of forced repatriations to  Vietnam by British and Hong Kong authorities, who say the voluntary program is  too slow to make a substantial reduction in the population of the colony's  crowded camps.  </P> <P> At least 21 officers and eight boat people were hurt today in the melee in the  Chi Ma Wan detention center, where authorities said Vietnamese threatened  security forces and threw stones at them during what was described as a  "routine search" for hidden weapons.  </P> <P> More than 300 police and detention officers in full riot gear stormed one  section of the camp, firing canisters of tear gas into crowds of boat people.  Police said they arrested 19 Vietnamese and seized 430 weapons in the  operation.  </P> <P> Secretary for Security Geoffrey Barnes said authorities negotiated for five  hours with the boat people to give up their weapons and allow a search before  officers moved in.  </P> <P> "However, despite repeated efforts to obtain the cooperation of the boat people  and warnings that the search would have to be carried out regardless of their  objections, the boat people still refused to give up their weapons," Barnes  said. "In the circumstances, (detention officers) and police were forced to  conduct the search as planned.  </P> <P> "The boat people, in order to make the operation more difficult, pushed their  women and children to the front. In the end, it was necessary for (tear gas) to  be used to disperse the crowds and to reduce the possibility of serious  injuries."  </P> <P> The clash came hours after a group of 111 boat people voluntarily left Hong  Kong this morning on a chartered airliner for Hanoi rather than face months or  years in the crowded camps without hope of resettlement abroad.  </P> <P> Those who left today made up the eighth group to return to Hanoi under a  U.N.-sponsored voluntary repatriation program, bringing to more than 865 the  number of Vietnamese who have willingly gone home.  </P> <P> Police said there was no apparent reason for the uprising at Chi Ma Wan.  </P></p>

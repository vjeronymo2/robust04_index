			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Corruption rocks French ship of state: Resignations have holed Balladur's government and ambitions Announcing his resignation at his prime minister's Matignon office on Friday evening, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, described himself as calm and serene. He claimed he could now counter allegations of corruption concerning the financing of his Saint Tropez villa and a separate probe into the funding of his Republican party. For Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, however, it is difficult to be so sanguine. Mr Longuet leaves a government badly shaken by corruption investigations which are threatening Mr Balladur's presidential aspirations and which have prompted comparisons with Italy's 'clean hands' anti-graft campaign. Mr Longuet's departure compounds the blow sustained by the government a few days earlier when Mr Alain Carignon, the former communications minister, was detained in a Lyon jail. Mr Carignon had resigned in July after being accused by an investigating magistrate of receiving illicit payments in return for the award of public works contract in Grenoble, where he is mayor. Although less dramatic, Mr Longuet's resignation is more significant. A heavyweight in France's centre-right administration, the industry minister is the most senior figure yet ensnared by the corruption probes which are rocking French politics and business. His departure represents a landmark in the investigations and demonstrates the increased vulnerability of French establishment figures. For Mr Balladur, the events of the past week add up to his most serious challenge since his centre-right administration took office last year. In addition to the damage wrought by two ministerial resignations, his personal ambitions have been undermined. With his eyes set on next spring's presidential elections, the French prime minister looked to Mr Longuet as a vital ally in his battle with his Gaullist rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, for the conservative candidacy in the forthcoming polls. The French prime minister now finds his strategy and his standing undermined. 'It is no longer a question of cracks but of gaping holes in the Balladur system,' said Liberation, the daily newspaper, in an editorial. The risk is that the corruption affairs affecting his government may not be so easily tamed. A report into the finances of the Republican party by Mr Reynaud Van Ruymbeke, an investigating magistrate, could drag other senior party figures into the firing line, including Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, and Mr Alain Madelin, minister for economic development and small businesses. Of broader concern, are the growing wave of probes which have seen the chairmen of some of France's largest business groups, from Saint Gobain, the glass and building materials company, to Alcatel Alsthom, the transport, telecoms and engineering concern, placed under investigation for alleged corruption.  The cases have ensured that corruption will be a central theme in the presidential polls and have fuelled pressure for an Italian-style 'clean hands' operation. Mr Balladur, along with other senior politicians and businessmen, deny that corruption is endemic in France and reject the comparison with Italy. He argues that the spate of investigations reflects a freer hand enjoyed by the judiciary in pursuing cases which mostly date back to the 1980s. Despite his initial claims that the existing legislation will resolve the problem, Mr Balladur has bowed to mounting pressure and proposed a strengthening of safeguards against corruption. He is calling for a panel to perform an annual audit of the assets of ministers, MPs and senior local officials. He also proposed that prefects, the chief government representatives in the regions, be empowered to suspend suspect public works contracts. For some, however, such proposals do not go far enough. Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, an investigating magistrate, and now a Euro-MP, demands increased resources for magistrates investigating political and white collar corruption. He says failure to act swiftly against corruption will push France down the road to 'Italianisation', undermining political institutions and playing into the hands of demagogues such as Jean-Marie le Pen, leader of the extreme right National Front. Such an analysis, is itself, extreme. But the rising wave of corruption probes have already rocked the French ship of state. Mr Balladur has yet to show that he can steer it back on course.</p>

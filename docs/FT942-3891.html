			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Main advanced communications projects in Japan Remote medical services: The National Children's Hospital and the Teishin Hospital in Tokyo have linked up with some of their patients in an experiment to provide remote medical services. Secom and the Kugayama Hospital in Tokyo are providing a service to hospitals and clinics which enables them to send medical images, such as those obtained in computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, over advanced telecommunications lines to a central station, which then retransmits specialist analyses. Nikon, Fujitsu, Kyoto University and Osaka University are conducting experiments in telemedicine, such as the transfer of X-ray photographs and other medical data from one hospital to another across telephone lines. Cable TV experiments: Sega has started providing video games on demand for subscribers to two cable TV networks in Japan. In the spring of 1995, NTT plans to test the combined utilisation of cable for CATV video transmission, video-on-demand, telephone and other services through optical subscriber systems. General experiments: NTT is developing applications for multimedia in the office, using high-speed, broad-band backbone networks operating at the gigabit level, using a combination of a synchronous transfer mode and optical fibre technologies. Next spring NTT will be conducting experiments in high-performance electronic mail, electronic newspapers and other database services for private use. Public experiments: The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is promoting a programme in the Kansai Science City with the private sector to conduct multimedia experiments ranging from video-on-demand and TV shopping to personal handyphones, home reservation systems and video conferencing. Okazaki, a city in central Japan, is being designated a multimedia model city by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Educational photos and video are being digitised and the database will be linked by optical fibre to schools in the area, so that students can call up the data whenever they need it. An interactive conferencing system is also being considered for schools. The Ministry of Education is setting up a multimedia promotion group to lay the groundwork for the use of multimedia in education. Tokyo metropolitan government will conduct multimedia experiments in TV shopping, remote education services and video on demand. Compiled by Kuniko Kurimura in Tokyo</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / House 'yes'to curbs on poll cash The US House of Representatives yesterday passed a bill to reform the financing of election campaigns, agreeing to voluntary limits on spending coupled with a vague promise of public funding for candidates. The proposal split the House along party lines, with the Republican minority criticising the measure as a sham reform that would favour incumbents against their challengers, and thus help the Democrats preserve their majority. The bill passed yesterday would impose a voluntary spending ceiling of Dollars 600,000 on campaign spending by candidates for the House, with another Dollars 200,000 for those who win their party primaries by less than 20 percentage points. It would limit campaign contributions from political action committees formed by companies or interest groups to Dollars 200,000 and curb the 'bundling' of contributions, when a single group or lobbyist packages individual donations. Although the bill offers Dollars 200,000 of vouchers to pay for television advertising to candidates who accept the limits, it gives no way of paying for them, and few members of Congress are likely to go on record in a separate vote as favouring public financing of elections. However, since the Supreme Court ruled that mandatory campaign spending limits were an unconstitutional curb on free speech, the only way of giving meaning to spending limits is through a carrot such as public financing.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Activity in homes market declines Activity in the housing market declined last month, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said yesterday. Its survey of estate agents mirrors research by other business groups which suggested that the modest rise in activity over the summer has not been sustained. Nearly 60 per cent of the 127 agents included in the institution's survey said that pre-purchase activity such as inquiries and viewings declined during the month. Just 16 per cent said that activity had increased while 24 per cent reported no change. A survey last week by the National Association of Estate Agents found two-thirds of its members reporting lower activity last month. Three-quarters of the agents questioned by the institution said that house prices remained stable, although 15 per cent reported a decline. Mr Peter Miller of the institution said: 'Optimism about the short-term prospects for the housing market recovery has seeped away as the anticipated autumn pick-up in most areas simply failed to happen.' He added: 'It is now clear that neither house prices nor market volumes will increase until the new year at the earliest.' Mr Miller said that while the rise in interest rates had deterred some potential buyers, local factors were more important than national trends. The Halifax index showed prices rising slightly in the south in the past three months but falling in the north. The survey shows marked variations in housing market conditions even in neighbouring towns, depending on their local economic fortunes. Mr Robert Thomas, housing market analyst at UBS, the stockbroking group, said that in spite of regional variations, the evidence pointed unambiguously to a weaker market. He said: 'The relative weakness of personal disposable income following this year's tax increases and the psychological effect of higher interest rates have clearly had an impact.'

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Minister falls foul of the backbench referees IT WAS the judgment of Mr David Mellor's behaviour under the rules for backbenchers rather than under those for ministers that finally seemed to count against him in the eyes of his colleagues. As MPs gathered in Westminster yesterday morning, members of the influential 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers commented that the party was concerned about the propriety of Mr Mellor's acceptance of hospitality from wealthy friends without, apparently, making any admission in the register of MPs' interests. The rules leave MPs great freedom of action, provided that they declare financial interests including gifts and overseas visits. As backbenchers do not have the patronage ministers possess - although they can be influential in pursuing particular causes - the aim of the guidelines for MPs is to ensure that any links are known so that they can be taken into account when MPs make representations. The importance of declaring such interests - rather than not having any - can be seen in the fact that MPs generally see no problem with admitting to trips taken abroad. More than 160 of the 650 MPs declared overseas visits in the latest register of interests, published earlier this year, excluding journeys undertaken on behalf of groups such as the inter-parliamentary union. Visits declared included those by MPs who went to southern Italy at the invitation of the Tobacco Advisory Council, while numerous others went to Israel as guests of either the Conservative or the Labour Friends of Israel, or of the Israeli government. The last MP to fall foul of the regulations was Mr John Browne, then Tory MP for Winchester, who was suspended for four weeks early in 1990 after the Commons found him guilty of failing to declare a payment of more than Pounds 50,000 from the Saudi central bank and a 'client' relationship with a group of Lebanese middlemen. The form on which interests are declared asks MPs whether they have made any overseas visits related in any way to their membership of the Commons where the cost was not borne by themselves or from UK public funds. This does not mean MPs have to announce every time they stay in a friend's villa in Spain or flat in Paris. What raised eyebrows in Mr Mellor's case was the news that not only were he and his family alleged to have been provided with summer holiday accommodation in 1990 by Mrs Mona Bauwens, the daughter of a leading member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, but that she was also said to have paid for their flights. While the rules for ministers are strict, they are left more to the judgment of the individuals. They are advised that they should not accept 'gifts, hospitality or services from anyone which would, or might appear to, place him or her under an obligation'.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KEY TOPICS: WHERE THE CANDIDATES DIFFERED  </P> <P> The following are excerpts from key topics covered in Sunday night's  gubernatorial debate in Burbank between Democrat former San Francisco Mayor  Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> CHANGE  </P> <P> Wilson: "I think people are disillusioned because government hasn't been  working. We have to engage in prevention of a kind that is much more cost  effective and infinitely more humane than the kind of remedial actions that we  have undertaken in the past. I would much rather prevent drug use than try to  rehabilitate it. I would much rather prevent crime than punish it."  </P> <P> Feinstein: "I think the question before the electorate is who is best apt to  provide this change. Is it someone who has been part of the policies . . . or  someone who is going to chart a new future. You have to get out there and lead.  I think there's a need for someone who comes in that's fresh, that's new,  that's a little bit different."  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> Wilson: "I've come to the conclusion I'm going to endorse Proposition 140, the  term limits, because it may be the only way that we can make basic change in  Sacramento. This California Legislature had deteriorated markedly. The two  Democratic leaders . . . have been up there a combined total of over 50 years."  </P> <P> Feinstein: "You don't have term limits on lobbyists, you don't have term limits  on bureaucrats. I agree with President Reagan. I don't think term limits make  sense. Senator, if you really feel you can't handle (Assembly Speaker) Willie  Brown and (Senate President Pro Tem) David Roberti, stay in Washington. I'll  handle them."  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN FINANCE  </P> <P> Feinstein: "I favor a cap on spending, absolutely. Sen. Wilson talks about  special interests and yet Sen. Wilson is the largest recipient of Savings and  Loan contributions in the United States Congress. He's the second largest in  contributions from the chemical industry.  </P> <P> Wilson: "You can't say we're going to break the grip of special interests and  not take fat special interest checks and then do so. As far as your CHP  contribution, Dianne, I am truly shocked that you would be so blind to such a  gross conflict of interest that you would take $150,000 from a state public  employee association when you, or as governor, if you were elected, would be in  a position where you would have to set or approve their salaries."  </P> <P> ATTENDANCE  </P> <P> Wilson: "I have had an excellent attendance record. The votes I have missed, 30  of them had to do with the appendectomy that I suffered . . . I have been  involved in those budget negotiations as much as anybody else who is not one of  the five who sits there in the negotiations. But I think it would be a real  insult to the people of California to be absent during the debate. Mrs.  Feinstein would be delighted to have me in Washington. I don't blame her. Then  she would have the stage to herself."  </P> <P> Feinstein: "I think absenteeism is an important indication of performance . . .  the senator has the third worst attendance record in the Congress. He hasn't  returned to Washington since the Senate reconvened . . . I think it's a mistake  to be here the day before yesterday measuring podiums when the federal  government has come to a complete halt."  </P> <P> TAXES  </P> <P> Wilson: "I released all of my tax returns . . . I think it's the only way the  people can have a fair understanding of whether a candidate or an officeholder  has some personal economic interest that is in conflict with his or her public  duty. Will you join me as tomorrow I send to you and the press 10 years worth  of tax returns?"  </P> <P> Feinstein: "Pete, my husband and I have made available 17 years of tax returns.  The press has had an opportunity to come in and examine them. I could throw a  challenge to you as well. No one said anything to you about your spouse's  property. It's in a blind trust. I think you ought to make those investments  available."  </P> <P> LOTTERY  </P> <P> Feinstein: "Would you support early childhood education for every youngster in  the state of California funded by a change in the lottery, to increase the  share that goes to education from 34% to 50%, just two points over what the  state of New York's lottery provides to education?"  </P> <P> Wilson: ". . . a part of my program did include exactly the kind of preschool  education you're taking about. You want to decrease the amount that goes to  prizes and increase the percentage that goes to education. I would be all for  that if it worked. (New York) and other states which run lotteries have found  that if they do not guarantee a certain prize level . . . they do not generate  greater revenues at all, not for education or anything else."  </P></p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Disclosure on dam ruling by Hurd The decision by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to go ahead with the funding of Malaysia's Pergau dam project in 1991 was the only occasion on which the advice of an accounting officer in his department has been overruled since the Conservatives came to power. Mr Hurd's decision to go ahead with the Pounds 234m project, which was recently described by Whitehall's accounting watchdog as 'a very bad buy', was taken against the advice of Sir Timothy Lankester, the permanent secretary and accounting officer at the Overseas Development Administration, which is a part of the Foreign Office. In recent evidence to a select committee MPs, Sir Timothy said he regarded the funding of the Malaysian project as an 'abuse' of the aid budget, and that he therefore asked for a 'ministerial direction' from Mr Hurd to 'sign the cheques' for the project. In a written parliamentary answer released yesterday, Mr Alastair Goodlad, a Foreign Office minister, confirmed that this was the only occasion on which a foreign secretary had issued such a direction.</p>

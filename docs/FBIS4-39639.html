			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Stasovskiy report: "Tajikistan Fights Terror"] </F>   [Text] On 7 June Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev,  commander in chief of Russian Federation Border Troops, received  from Tajikistan a telegram from Imamali Rakhmonov, chairman of  the republic's National Assembly. In it the head of Tajikistan  expressed his sincere condolences in connection with the tragic  deaths of Russian border guards -- Lieutenant Colonels  Borisenkov and Leontikov. "The criminals," the telegram says,  "who have encroached on a most blessed thing -- the lives of  Russia's sons who, answering the call of duty and conscience,  were protecting the Tajik soil that had become their own -- will  not go unpunished. Some of them are already in the hands of the  law, the others will be found and punished with all the severity  of the law...."    Meanwhile, in Tajikistan everything is being done to get  control of the acute criminogenic situation. On 7 June 24-hour  joint patrols of Tajik and Russian servicemen began. Areas  where Russian servicemen and their families live have been put  under special guard.</p>

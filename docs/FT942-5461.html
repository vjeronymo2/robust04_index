			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo ordered to stop Enterprise accusations Lasmo, the independent explorer subject to a Pounds 1.2bn hostile bid from Enterprise Oil, has been told to stop repeating its accusation that Enterprise had '. . . breached UK accounting standards'. The move by the Takeover Panel is the second in a week which seeks to clarify allegations by Lasmo over Enterprise's record. Yesterday's statement related to a Lasmo document issued last month in which Enterprise was accused of contravening UK accounting practices in its treatment of acquisitions. Lasmo said Enterprise's actions inflated earnings. The Panel said it could not rule on the validity of the accusation. But Lasmo should have used '. . . less definitive terms'. The panel is believed to have been comfortable with the general tenor of the document, which raises questions about the bidder's earnings record. It is merely the conclusion, which might have implied there could only be one accounting treatment for certain acquisitions, which caused a problem. It is believed to be the first time the panel has had to rule on such a precise allegation. The panel said there was no dispute over the right of the companies to raise accounting issues. But it noted that 'Enterprise received unqualified audit opinions throughout the relevant period,' and that '. . . Lasmo should have noted the possibility of alternative views' on the way companies choose to treat acquisitions in their books. Enterprise said it was 'delighted' with the Panel's response. Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said Lasmo's attack was 'a dead issue. Now we can move back to having an intelligent debate with the institutions' over the merits of the Pounds 1.2bn bid. Lasmo disagreed, however, saying its claims that Enterprise had inflated earnings remained a live issue and called into question the value of the company's all-paper offer. Institutional investors said that the retraction reflected well on neither Lasmo nor Enterprise. 'We think the arguments on both sides have been of fairly low quality to date,' said one. The strength of the allegation that Enterprise could have breached accounting standards was blamed on Sir Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo chairman, who 'just likes to fight dirty and create a big hooha'.

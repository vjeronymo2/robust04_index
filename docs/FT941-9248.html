			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Tel Aviv stock market halts steep decline The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rallied yesterday after a recent spate of steep falls. The index ended up 1.8 per cent, building on its 0.5 per cent recovery following a 4 per cent fall on Sunday and a 9 per cent drop in the course of last week. The recent falls were triggered, in part, by well-publicised statements by leading officials and analysts that many shares were overvalued. Euphoria over the peace process had brought a wave of new investment, fuelling a 35 per cent rise in share values since last August. Another factor affecting market confidence was last week's arrest of two dealers who are suspected of large-scale insider trading. Yesterday a third suspect, leading stock broker Amos Weiss, was questioned by the Israeli securities authority on suspicion of share price manipulation and fraud. Jockeying began in earnest yesterday to replace Mr Simcha Dinitz, the chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, who has been forced to step down after being indicted for fraud and breach of trust. The agency has a Dollars 500m annual budget to bring Jewish immigrants to Israel and help in their absorption. Mr Dinitz is alleged to have used the agency's credit cards for personal expenses totalling Dollars 22,000. Chairmanship of the agency is a cabinet-level position. Mr Dinitz is a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's governing Labour party, and a former Israeli ambassador to the US. Several senior Labour politicians are believed to be pressing to replace him.</p>

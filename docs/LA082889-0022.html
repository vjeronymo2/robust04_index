			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS CUT STRONG SAFETY MILLER  </P> <P> The Chargers cut strong safety Pat Miller Sunday, leaving 11 players to cut by  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Miller played one game at linebacker for the Chargers during the 1987 strike  and was released. He returned to make the team as a safety last year, playing  eight games before a knee injury ended his season.  </P> <P> "He doesn't figure in the top eight guys right now," Charger Coach Dan Henning  said. "We think it's right to let him go now so he can possibly get hooked up  and get some chances elsewhere." DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

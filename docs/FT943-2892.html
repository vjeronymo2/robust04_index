			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik Gold seeks net Pounds 25m in placing Bakyrchik Gold, which so far has raised Pounds 11m for investment in a gold mine in Kazakhstan since it was floated in London a year ago, is raising a further Pounds 25.1m net via a conditional placing and a 3-for-5 open offer of 9.45m shares. This is far below the Pounds 70m cash call that Bakyrchik had warned shareholders was on the way. Mr David Hooker, chairman, said yesterday that shareholders had indicated they would prefer some bank debt to be raised for the project. They would also prefer not to hand over all the required cash at one time. Mr Hooker thought Bakyrchik might raise debt of between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m. Discussions with some banks had started but, although it appeared money might be available 'on suitable terms,' negotiations were not likely to be completed until the end of this year. He said Bakyrchik was likely to ask shareholders for further funds as early as the middle of 1995. Bakyrchik was floated at 120p a share. The price has been up to 405p and the placing is to be at 283p compared with 292p on Wednesday. The shares closed up 6 3/8 p last night at 297p. The company wants to develop further the Bakyrchik gold mine in a joint venture with the Kazakhstan government. The first stage set out to prove that it was possible to treat the sulphide ore from the mine by the Redox process. Mr Hooker said that the Redox plant was still not operating on a continuous basis because it had experienced 'typical start-up problems'. Production of 45,000 troy ounces of gold a year (including 30,000 ounces from the Redox plant) and a start on development of the underground mine were 'the principal objectives for the next twelve months.' A feasibility study estimated that annual gold production from Bakyrchik's sulphide ore would be 265,000 ounces, against 230,000 ounces mentioned in the 1993 listing particulars. Sulphide reserves are estimated to contain 1.26m ounces of gold compared with 660,000 ounces previously. Gold in sulphide resources was estimated to be 8.6m ounces against 9.3m ounces. The estimated cost of the second stage of development is now Dollars 102m (Pounds 66m) compared with Dollars 109.2m at the time of listing. Cash production costs are estimated at Dollars 142 an ounce compared with Dollars 147, among the lowest in the world.</p>

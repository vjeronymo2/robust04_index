			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 31, BNS -- Up to eight tons of oil  have leaked into a nearby ditch from an oil tank in a former  Soviet military base on the Viimsi peninsula outside Tallinn.    The ditch, measuring about 15 by 3 meters, is covered by a  10-centimeter layer of oil, a spokesman at the Estonian Ministry  of Environment said.    Work to neutralize the pollution must be started at once,  because the leakage both directly threatens the soil, as well as  creates the possibility of a later pollution of the underground  waters, the spokesman said.    Russian military at the base, however, have refused to allow  local environment officials examine the site, because the base  has not been turned over to Estonia yet.    Officials from the local Viimsi commune government, as well  as the Harjumaa county authorities have received an answer from  the military that access to the territory of the base can be  granted only by the leadership of Russia's Baltic Sea Fleet in  Kaliningrad.    According to information obtained by the Estonian ministry,  the fuel tanks at the base are no longer in military use, but  have been leased by Petro-N Ltd., a shareholding company closely  connected with the company N-Terminaal.    Russian military have said they will themselves take care of  the results of the leakage. "But it remains unclear how much  time this will take and whether also the polluted soil will be  removed," the ministry says.</p>

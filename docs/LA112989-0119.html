			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'DORF' GOES TO COURT AND WINS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles judge ruled that the latest sports videotape featuring comedian  Tim Conway's diminutive "Dorf" character can be shipped to stores despite a  distributor's claim that it was unfairly cut out of the deal.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin ruled Tuesday that J2 Communications Inc.  has the first right of refusal for distribution of "Dorf" videos only when they  are produced by Longshot Enterprises Inc., of which Conway is the majority  owner. Lewin said the story idea and production of the new "Dorf Goes Auto  Racing" came from Liaison East Inc., so the distribution contract between J2  and Longshot does not apply.  </P> <P> J2 distributed the first three "Dorf" videos, "Dorf on Golf," "Dorf and the  First Games of Mt. Olympus" and "Dorf's Golf Bible."  </P></p>

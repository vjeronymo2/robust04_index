			<p>BFN     [Text] The number of crimes committed in Russia with the  use of fire arms has increased from 4,000 to 22,500 (more than  five times) over the past three years, Head of the Interior  Ministry's Public Order Department General Vyacheslav  Ogorodnikov announced during a briefing on Tuesday. Last year  alone, 3,000 murders were committed and almost 9,000 attacks  made with the use of fire arms.    Ogorodnikov announced that this tendency persisted in 1994.  Given this, the Interior Ministry has drafted proposals on  amending and enlarging the laws on the circulation of weapons,  and proposed measures to toughen punishment for crimes involving  fire arms.    According to the ministry, fire arms get into the criminals'  hands as a result of improper control during the withdrawal of  troops from the former Soviet republics and foreign countries.  Over the past three years, more than 38,000 fire arms have been  stolen. To quote Ogorodnikov, the openness of the Russian  borders and instability in North Ossetia, Ingushetia and  Chechnya also facilitate the inflow of fire arms to the central  part of Russia.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Home delivery is answer to stores' green damage Sir, Mr John Gummer, UK environment secretary, is trying to get supermarkets to agree on recycling; at the same time there is concern about the miles travelled by the produce they sell ('Industry may be forced to fund recycling of packaging', October 10). What about the miles travelled by their customers and the social and environmental damage that causes? My local supermarket, just off the city centre, only welcomes cars, to the considerable detriment of the nearby residential areas. There is no direct access for public transport, and the only pedestrian access is directly across a busy dual carriageway. Absolutely classic bad planning. Mr Gummer should do some more head-bashing and make supermarkets take action to reduce customer use of cars. To do this, they could be required to provide a delivery service. That would at least provide some inducement for people to leave their cars at home and reduce environmental damage, as well as offering help for the elderly and disabled. Of course, if we were really modern the delivery service would, on a restricted basis, extend to telephone and computer contacts as well as personal rambles around the stores. The central thing is that there is an ever-increasing need for government to grapple with the environmental ill-effects of supermarkets and force them to accept some responsibility for the damage they cause. A delivery service would be a good start. R E Crum, 89 Hall Road, Norwich NR1 2PP.</p>

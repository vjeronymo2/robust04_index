In comparison with the last  year incomes rose by 37.5 percent, while consumer prices  increased by 2.1 times. As a result of the lowered common  purchasing power the actual value of goods bought and pay  services also decreased. The family consumer structure has  distorted in a way that the bulk of money expenses are  undertaken to pay for food, public utilities and taxes. The  asked families spent more than two thirds of their incomes in  1993 for these purposes: 44 percent for food, 19.5 percent for  other necessary goods, 19.2 for pay services. Poor families in  1993 spent 77 percent of their funds for food, public utilities,  transport and other necessary expenses.</p>

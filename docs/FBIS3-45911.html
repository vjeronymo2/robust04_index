			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at One" program] </F>   [Text] An air and sea search is continuing for nine crew  members of an oil tanker missing after their vessel caught fire  and broke in two in the South China Sea last night. Twenty-five  other crewmen were rescued, but one was later certified dead.    Senior Marine Officer Philip Weaver explained what happened:    [Begin Weaver recording] Late last night, the Cosmos S  actually had an explosion according to the people on board, and  the ship subsequently broke in two, the fore part caught fire,  and the vessel was abandoned. Shortly thereafter, some other  ships came by and rescued 24 survivors and recovered one dead  body. Throughout the night, the search continued for the  missing nine people. Then in the morning we had a fixed-wing  aircraft on scene, during the night and again in the morning.  That has returned to Kai Tak [Hong Kong's airport]. We are  having one more search this afternoon. The weather on scene is  easterly gale force. The captain of the on- scene commander has  said that he thinks there is little chance of any survivors.  The nine survivors that were thought to be alive may have  perished in the initial disembarkation because some eyewitnesses  have reported that the life raft was seen to be consumed by  flame.

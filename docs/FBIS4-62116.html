			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 11 May -- The leadership of  Moldavia [Moldova] and the unrecognized Gagauz Republic have  taken steps toward a peace settlement within the Gagauz problem.  A meeting of the sides' parliamentary commissions is to take  place in Kishinev on 12 May. They will discuss the draft law on  the legal status of the Gagauz settlements. Today, it was  discussed at a closed sitting of the commission of the Gagauz  Parliament, which was attended by its president, Stepan Topal.  The draft law grants the Gagauz people broad self-government  within a single Moldavia.    According to Komrat (Gagauz capital) sources, disagreements  appeared between the sides yesterday. They relate to the  articles of the draft law, which define the status of the Gagauz  rayons, their administration, and the division of powers between  the republic's central leadership and local bodies.    Komrat's spokesmen proposed that changes should be made to  the draft law, which envisages setting up the "Gagauz-eri"  national and territorial entity in southern Moldavia. They  insist on adopting their own constitution and are against the  proposed procedure for appointing judges and heads of power  bodies, which provides for their appointment by collegiums of  the relevant Moldavian ministries. Kishinev disagrees with this.    Despite this, it looks as if the sides have managed to draw  up compromise decisions, which will be discussed at tomorrow's  meeting.</p>

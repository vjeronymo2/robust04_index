			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 24 (ATA) -- The Constitution of the  Republic of Montenegro recognizes the right of the use of the  two languages, but this right has been not applied for the  Albanians. The inscriptions and names of places in the Albanian  language are disappearing with each passing day. Albanian  toponymy is in the objective of destruction and with thus  eliminating the traces of civilization and the presence of the  Albanians as well. Wherever you are in Ulqin, you could hardly  understand where you are. Everywhere you can read ULCINJ,  according to a report in RILINDJA. The Albanian names of the  places have been changed in order to eliminate the Albanian  identity of the toponymy. Changes of the pure Albanian names  have been also made in the official administration and they are  now being applied in the schools and even in the diplomas of the  Albanian students who have attended classes in Albanian schools.</p>

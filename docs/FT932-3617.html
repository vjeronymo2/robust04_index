			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher sold The tide turned against Kingfisher, recently the favourite of the stores sector, when Strauss Turnbull issued a sell note and fears over a price war in the DIY sector took hold. The shares finished 7 lower at 590p. Texas, Ladbroke's DIY subsidiary, is mounting an aggressive price discounting campaign, which is no help to Kingfisher, a major player in the DIY market through its B&amp;Q chain. Mr Robert Snaith, stores analyst at Strauss, also stressed that renewed confidence in Boots, one of Kingfisher's main store rivals, contributed to the downturn in Kingfisher shares. He believed there was a certain amount of overcapacity in stores and that perhaps 'Kingfisher has had it its own way for a little too long.' Elsewhere in DIY-related stocks, WH Smith 'A' fell back 6 to close at 439 and J Sainsbury went 12 lower at 485p in thin turnover. ICI dropped to 680p early in the session, before staging a late rally to close only a shade off at 691p. There were hints in the market that a round of substantial profits downgrades, possibly down to around the Pounds 200m to Pounds 230m level, compared with current estimates of around the Pounds 300m mark, could be in the pipeline. A mixture of nervousness and profit-taking dogged property companies with the majority giving up recently gained ground. British Land lost 6 to close at 320p; Great Portland Estates fell back 9 to 183p in the aftermath of BZW's sell note. Palmerston Holdings saw its value slashed by more than half with the price tumbling from 15p to 6p after news that receivers had been appointed at several of its subsidiaries. The market reserved judgment on Coats Viyella although it announced a Pounds 35m acquisition of Berghaus, the Dutch distributor of women's coats and jackets. The shares fell back 3 to 224p on the move, financed by a placing of 15.2m shares at 218p. One analyst said that more eyes will be on a company presentation next week which will reveal its strategy for India and Brazil. Recommendations from Henderson Crosthwaite and SG Warburg boosted Cadbury Schweppes and the shares gained 12 to 459p in trade of 2.2m. Scottish and Newcastle benefited from a recommendation from Nomura and put on 7 to 464p. Insurance brokers attracted buying interest after a number of influential stockbroking analysts adopted a bullish stance. Willis Corroon, the sector leader, jumped 8 to 210p, with analysts said to have been upgrading their profits estimates for next year to the Pounds 100m mark. Sedgwick moved up 6 to 186p. Lloyd Thompson added 9 to a record 303p. Shares in English China Clays recovered from an early retreat which followed the surprise announcement of a Pounds 113.4m cash call to help fund the Pounds 202.3m acquisition of Calgon, a speciality chemicals business in the US. Having fallen to 402p in early trading, the shares closed 9 ahead at 425p, as analysts pointed to the benefits of the purchase and plans to demerge its construction materials business. Rolls-Royce edged  1/2 forward to 152p, with the stock said to have benefitted from some switching from British Aerospace. The switching and general profit-taking following the strong run for most of the week left BAe 15 lighter at 410p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Burmese Government handed over 31 Thai citizens  who had been imprisoned in Burma to Thai representatives in  Kawthaung at 0900 today. Among the Thai representatives who  received the Thai citizens were the 1st Army Region deputy  commander; a representative of the 4th Army Region commander;  the Ranong governor; representatives of the Fisheries  Department; the chief of the Office for Protection of the  Interests of Thai Citizens Abroad under the office of the  Foreign Ministry permanent secretary; and officials from other  relevant government agencies.    The release of the 31 Thai citizens was the result of the  talks Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri held with Senior General  Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration  Council, during his April visit to Burma. He asked the Burmese  side to reduce the sentences or grant pardons to Thai citizens  imprisoned in Burma. On 27 April, at the closing ceremony of  the Ninth Thai-Burmese Joint Border Commission meeting, the  chief of the Burmese delegation announced that Burma had decided  to release 31 Thai citizens held in Burma after taking into  account the good relations between Thailand and Burma and the  success of the meeting.</p>

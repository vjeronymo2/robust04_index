			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / People: 100 Group's new chairman Michael Lawrence, group finance director of Prudential, is to become the new chairman of the 100 Group in November. The 100 Group is the influential body which counts most of the finance directors of the FT-SE 100 companies among its members, along with a number of counterparts from leading private companies. Lawrence takes over the chair from Hugh Collum, the finance director of SmithKline Beecham, when his two-year period of office comes to an end. Lawrence has been a member of the executive and technical committees of the Group. Although asked recently to take over the chairmanship, he says he has no idea how he was selected. 'It was quite a surprise and rather flattering,' he says. 'Financial service companies are a minority on the 100 Group and may be perceived as not sharing the same values.' Nonetheless, he says he has plans to advance the work of the organisation in a number of different areas. These include the continued campaign for a change in the legislation on advance corporation tax; and to make submissions to both the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance and the Goode committee on pension reform. He also hopes to increase representation with the European Commission, especially over the wide variations in international accounting requirements across the EC. ***** Andrew Thomas (right), managing director since 1980 of The Greenalls Group, the pub retailer and hotelier, has been appointed chairman and chief executive on the retirement of Christopher Hatton after 22 years as chairman. Peter Greenall (left) becomes managing director. Roger Young and John Bright join the board as directors responsible for, respectively, the group's retail managed pubs and tenanted pubs. Hatton will remain on the board as a non-executive director.</p>

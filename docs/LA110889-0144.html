			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA SAYS NO TO ROADS;  </P> <P> MEASURE P: VOTERS DECISIVELY REJECTED THE $285-MILLION TAX PLAN. THE WINNING  CAMPAIGN HAD ACCENTED DEVELOPERS' RESPONSIBILITIES.  </P> <P> Voters in the Santa Clarita Valley overwhelmingly rejected a tax initiative  that would have raised $285 million to build and improve roads in the  fastest-growing region of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Final election results today showed that 15,714 voters, just under 80% of the  total, cast ballots against Measure P. The measure got only 4,000 votes.  </P> <P> The decisive vote against Measure P was a blow to the valley's political  leadership, which had endorsed the tax and raised more than $86,000 to promote  the measure. Many of the region's leading citizens, including Mayor Jan Heidt  and state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), supported Measure P.  </P> <P> A small group of homeowners, all political unknowns, raised only $1,900 to  fight Measure P. The group, known as SMRT for Stop Mello-Roos Tax, said the  measure was a developer-backed ploy that would have forced homeowners to pay  for roads that should be built by developers or local and state governments.  Mello-Roos refers to legislation allowing such tax proposals.  </P> <P> When campaign spending reports released last month showed that most of the  money raised by the Roads Now Committee came from developers and contractors,  SMRT pounced on the issue.  </P> <P> The spending reports showed that SMRT was right, said John Machin, a SMRT  spokesman. "It gave us credibility," Machin said.  </P> <P> The public also knew that SMRT was made up of people not tied to the valley's  political power structure, he said. "People saw we were just other homeowners,"  Machin said.  </P> <P> Kenneth Dean, another SMRT member, summed up Measure P's demise: "It's very  simple," he said. "People are taxed-out."  </P> <P> The measure would have created a joint-powers agency, made up of county and  Santa Clarita officials, to select the road projects to be supported by the  tax.  </P></p>

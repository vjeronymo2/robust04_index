			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From Azman Ujang] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 7 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- President Bill  Clinton spoke Saturday of a dilemma facing the United States  over Bosnia, including the collapse of the United Nations  mission in the war-torn country if the U.S. unilaterally opted  for tougher action to resolve the conflict there.    Declaring that he had, since taking office, been in favour  of  lifting the arms embargo imposed by the UN, he said the danger  in this was that it could lead to the collapse of the UN mission  in Bosnia as other countries in the mission would pull out from  Bosnia.    Clinton, at a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Dr.  Mahathir Mohamed at the White House here Friday, also sought  advice on resolving the Bosnian and other issues.    Malaysia's permanent representative to the UN, Razali  Ismail,  who also attended the meeting, cited Clinton as saying the U.S.  could still supply the Bosnians with types of arms not bound by  the embargo but this was bound to be resisted by other member  countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) as  well as Russia.    But Clinton assured Dr. Mahathir that the United States  would  continue to press for the lifting of the arms embargo at the UN,  Razali told Malaysian journalists after the meeting.    On this, Dr. Mahathir advised Clinton to persuade NATO  members like France and Britain to agree to the lifting of the  arms embargo which had placed the Bosnians in a defenceless  position against Serb aggression.    Dr. Mahathir said he could not accept the present UN  helplessness over the Bosnian conflict and suggested that  countries which wanted to pull out from the UN mission could do  so to enable troops of other countries willing to help Bosnia to  take their place.    The bottom line is that if the UN cannot guarantee the  survival of Bosnia, then it should be allowed to defend itself  as provided for under Article 51 of the UN Charter, he said.    Clinton also sought Dr. Mahathir's advice on how the U.S.  could establish a credible partnership with countries of Asia  while assuring the prime minister that it was not his policy to  try to dominate.    The U.S. is looking for a partnership without dominance and  asked how this could be effectualised, Razali said.    One advice Dr. Mahathir gave was that countries like  Malaysia  could accept criticisms and what was perceived as right or wrong  as much as Malaysia had never hesitated to say what was right or  wrong [as received].    Razali said Dr. Mahathir, however, drew a line between  criticisms and arm-twisting. If coutries went beyond criticisms  in order to force others to bow to their demand, then they were  arm-twisting and this was unacceptable.    He cautioned the U.S. president about such tendencies in  Asian countries which are culturally very developed societies  and which are resilent and their natural forces should be  allowed to evolve towards their desired objectives, he added.    Summing up the meeting, Razali said: It was not one of those  superficial meetings and it was noticeable that President  Clinton took a lot of trouble to explain to Dr. Mahathir the  various aspects of his policies and, significantly, listened a  lot to what the prime minister had to say and sought his advice  on many issues.    This would create better understanding on how each country  looked at issues between themselves and the U.S. president  showed overwhelming sincerity in wanting to improve U.S.  relations with Malaysia, he said.    Razali said Clinton and Dr. Mahathir also spoke about  reforms  within the UN in the context of peacekeeping missions. It was  agreed that both the U.S. and Malaysia would initiatite these  reforms, he added.</p>

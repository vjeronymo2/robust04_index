			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tolle Aram] </F>   [Text] Salah al-Din, Iraq, May 17 (AFP)--The United Nations  has warned the two main rival Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq  that any more fighting between their supporters could jeopardise  international aid, a UN official told AFP Tuesday [17 May].    UN area security coordinator Stafford Clarry delivered the  warning Monday to Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, who lead  respectively the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] and the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK].    One hundred people at least were killed in heavy fighting  between the KDP and the PUK that erupted early this month and  ended a week ago.    Barzani and Talabani "should realise that the international  community has not chosen to remain in Iraqi Kurdistan .. so  they can engage in armed conflict among themselves," read  Clarry's warning.    The message, a copy of which was given to AFP, stressed that  the UN presence aims at providing the Kurds with "protection  against an external threat", in a reference to Iraqi President  Saddam Husayn's government.    The KDP and the PUK have controlled a major part of northern  Iraq since an uprising following the February 1991 defeat of  Iraq in the Gulf war.    The US and its allies imposed an air-exclusion zone over  northern Iraq to keep out Iraq warplanes and protect the Kurds.    Clarry, an American, said the latest clashes will seriously  affect the goodwill of donor countries who financially support  the Kurds.    He also said the clashes have stopped or seriously disrupted  the UN aid programs, including water supplies to villages, food  distribution and medical services.    Most of the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) operating  in Kurdistan had to stop their activities during the fighting,  although they were pressing ahead with existing programs.    The clashes however "may make it difficult to initiate new  programs," said Save the Children field director Bronwen Lewis,  a Briton.    The fighting, which the PUK said was triggered by a personal  dispute, has already had a negative impact on the German NGOs,  whose coordination and support office in Shaqlawa town was  ransacked and its Kurdish guards arrested.    The head of the office, Eberhard Walde, said he was recalled  back to Germany.</p>

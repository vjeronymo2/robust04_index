			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil easier ahead of key congress vote Brazil Sao Paulo eased from the day's highs to stand down 3.3 per cent by mid-morning as prices continued to test support and resistance levels. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares was down 538 at 15,840. Chart analysts noted that the index had a support level between 15,800 and 16,000 and resistance barriers between 16,800 and 17,300. 'With the lack of important economic and political news, trading has become more technically-driven over the last few days,' one chart analyst said. Investors were continuing to wait for congress to vote on a presidential decree creating the country's single price index. Reports said that the vote, which had been originally scheduled for May 11, was now postponed until next Tuesday. Analysts said that the approval of the decree was a major element in the government's plan to move forward with its anti-inflation package. Among active issues Telebras was down 4.6 per cent at Cr45.90 and Petrobras was down 4.3 per cent at Cr110. On Thursday the market had risen nearly 6 per cent. Mexico Baring Securities in New York said that it was advising investors to start buying the Mexican stock market more aggressively on expectations for improved economic growth in the second half of 1994, Reuter reports. Barings said that it expected real earnings per share growth of 12 per cent for a sample of companies in 1994, followed by 19 per cent in 1995.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: HMC buys mortgage book THE HOUSEHOLD Mortgage Corporation has bought the UK mortgage book of Westpac, the Australian banking group. No price has been disclosed for the purchase. The Westpac book is worth about Pounds 175m and boosts HMC's total loan portfolio to more than Pounds 2bn, spread across 40,000 customers. This is the third purchase of a mortgage book from a smaller lender by HMC, the third largest UK specialist mortgage company, in the last six months. In November it took over Chase Manhattan's Pounds 200m book, followed by a private deal for a second book, also of about Pounds 200m, from an unidentified lender which wished to withdraw from the market. Mr Paul Lahiff, Westpac's chief manager, said yesterday that the bank had decided to exit from the UK home mortgage market because it did not fit well with the bank's core mortgage business in Europe. He added that he was sure that HMC would provide good service to Westpac's mortgage customers. HMC said yesterday that it was considering further purchases of mortgage books from other lenders. 'This is a good time to buy. There are between 28 and 30 books on the market at present and though a lot of them are poor, there are some available at good prices,' the company said.</p>

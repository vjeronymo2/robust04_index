			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS AHEAD IN MONGOLIA  </P> <P> Early results from the primaries of Mongolia's first free parliamentary  election indicated today that the Communists will continue their seven-decade  rule, but the democratic opposition predicted it would win a share of power for  the first time.  </P> <P> The government announcement on Sunday's voting left some confusion over the  parties' strength, but international observers monitoring the election said the  Communists, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, appeared likely to win  in the final round this Sunday.  </P> <P> The opposition charged some voting irregularities but acknowledged that the  balloting had been generally free and fair. International observers, speaking  on condition of anonymity, agreed.  </P></p>

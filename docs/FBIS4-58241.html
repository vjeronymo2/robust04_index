			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 3  Network in Hebrew at 1355 GMT on 2 May begins a live relay of  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' address to the Knesset plenum in  response to three no-confidence motions by the opposition on the  upcoming agreement with the PLO and the ongoing negotiations  with Syria. Peres' 47-minute speech is punctuated by frequent  heckling and the correspondent's voice-over summarizing the  remarks from the floor, which precludes full texting of the  speech. The foreign minister's remarks in English are given  within slantlines. What follows are the monitorable parts of  Peres' address:    "On Wednesday, at 1100 in Cairo, we will indeed sign an  agreement with the Palestinians about the establishment of  autonomy in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. This is a big day  for Israel. Nothing will make Israel more Israeli than to be  rid of its responsibility for 800,000 Palestinians living in a  small strip of land. Nothing will make Israel more Israeli than  this agreement. Nothing else can free us of the huge historical  myth that Gaza belongs to us. We never owned it, and it has  been a burden to us."    "Nothing will unite the people more than our departure from  the Gaza Strip. If you want to speak about polls, let me tell  you that 84 percent of the people support a withdrawal from the  Gaza Strip. Nothing will legitimize the Zionist Movement more  (?than this move). From the United States to Russia, from India  to China; in Oman, Qatar, Morocco, Tunisia -- the State of  Israel is being recognized for the first time. This is  something you never dreamed of or experienced."    Turning to the opposition, Peres says: "You invented  autonomy; you recognized the PLO. You favored autonomy in all  the territories, not just in Gaza and in Jericho; you sat with  'Abd-al-Shafi in Madrid and you made an agreement with the PLO  in 1982 concerning Lebanon." Peres asserts that a government in  which the late Menahem Begin was a member "proposed to withdraw  from the entire Golan Heights in time of peace," and cites the  Israeli Government resolution of 19 June 1967 that Israel should  strive for a peace treaty with Syria "based on the international  border and Israel's security needs."    Peres adds: "When the Palestinians in Judaea and Samaria  were granted Jordanian passports we all welcomed it. How is a  Jordanian passport with the right to vote in elections to the  Jordanian Parliament better than a laissez-passer -- also known  as a passport -- to 800,000 inhabitants of Gaza? Do you want to  bar 800,000 people the right to move? Do you want to grant them  Israeli passports? Is that what you want?" "As far as  passports are concerned, there are three possibilities: either  grant them Israeli passports, give them Gazan passports, or  leave them without passports. Will it please you to leave them  without passports? Do you want to annex the Gaza Strip and make  its inhabitants Israeli citizens? Is that what you want?"    "An agreement will be reached in Cairo to set up an autonomy  in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. Israel will remain in charge  of external security, all the settlements will remain in their  place, and we will be responsible for their safety. Autonomy  will be enforced in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, contrary to the  Camp David proposal to implement the autonomy all at once in  Judaea and Samaria for all its inhabitants. I suppose the  decision to apply autonomy to the Palestinian inhabitants  referred to Palestinians who either belonged to the PLO or to  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. There are no other  Palestinians."    "We will establish the most logical possible autonomy. I  would like to say that we want this autonomy to work. Just as  one may buy a ticket to get on a bus, one may travel abroad with  a passport; there is no difference. If somebody wants to write  a letter, there are more stamps in the world than countries.  The stamps and the passports will bear either of the following  inscriptions: /The Palestinian Authority/ or /The Palestinian  Interim Self-Government Authority/. This will explicitly  differentiate them from a state."    "The terms full autonomy and strong police force were coined  by the Likud. /Self-government authority/ denotes full  autonomy, not a state. If you want to call it a state, be my  guests. The head of this /authority/ will not be called the  president of a Palestinian state, as he is being called, but  head of the /Palestinian Authority/. Autonomy means self-rule  and it can be interpreted in various ways. The autonomy applies  to everything except two issues; it gives the Palestinians full  self-government except for two issues: security and external  relations."    "We are carrying out a policy, without which the Jewish  people would have faced a catastrophe and 20 years of  procrastination." This latter remark triggers a commotion in the  Likud's ranks, especially on the part of Yitzhaq Shamir, to whom  Peres retorts: "You met with 'Abd-al-Shafi, the deputy founder  of the PLO. You were the first one who spoke publicly with the  PLO; you agreed to an international conference." "It was us,  not you, who excluded Jerusalem from the autonomy. Shamir was  prepared to wait another 20 years, which would have resulted in  more hatred, more poverty, more victims, more acrimony, more  knives. These were your prospects." Peres goes on to say that  "most Israelis favor this move. Most people believe this is a  courageous, genuine, and correct step. The fact that you ran  out of gas and have no plan is your problem, not the people's."    "We are the only ones who pulled the country out of a deep  freeze. People are delighted to see an Israeli delegation  headed by the director general of the Defense Ministry in Qatar,  Oman, Algeria, or Cairo, and to see us headed along a path of  peace with the Palestinians."    Asked by an unidentified Knesset member whether he can give  his commitment that there will be no Palestinian state, the  foreign minister says: "I can commit myself to the fact that we  are opposed to a Palestinian state and favor full autonomy, as  we promised. Through the establishment of autonomy we prevented  the establishment of a Palestinian state, because the  alternative to autonomy is a Palestinian state."    "It is an illusion to believe that the problem is only one  of  borders. The problem is of borders, but also of relations. It  is an illusion to think that terror can be cracked with jails  and military operations. Terror must be uprooted through  political means as well. Had relations in Hebron been  different, the existence of a Jewish settlement there would have  been no problem."    "The Revisionist Movement and the Labor Movement had both  hoped for a totally different relationship between Jews and  Arabs." "How can there be a relationship with 100,000 people  having spent time in Israeli jails, 20,000 people having been  injured, and 1,000 killed? Is that what you want? Is this the  only way?" Turning to the opposition, Peres says: "Where are  your ideology and your values? Where are your efforts to  improve relations with the Palestinians and the Arabs, not  because we fear them but on the basis of our own Jewish values?"  "The Jewish state is a state of values. We will allow the  Palestinians to travel as human beings with their own passports,  to send letters to Arab countries with which we have no  relations. They have the right to write letters, not in an  environment of hatred and a feeling of superiority. If somebody  in Gaza writes a letter, say to a relative in Iraq, does that  mean that he founded a state?"    "We will not be deterred. We are flying a moral flag, not  just a political one. We do not want to rule over another  people, oppress it, or put it in jail. With murderers we will  settle scores, while we will let ordinary people live with  dignity. Therefore, the Knesset elections, public opinion  polls, and even the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange show that we are on  the right track."    "The leader of the Likud shamelessly appeared in a news  conference and said: What we told you, that the prime minister  had presented maps, is true. I hereby announce: The prime  minister did not present even one map or any geographical lines  to Christopher. I demand that the leader of the Likud come to  this podium and apologize for spreading such lies." "The Labor  party, the current coalition, the Israeli Government, and the  prime minister publicly announced that we were in favor of a  territorial compromise on the Golan Heights. We did not deny  it, and we adhere to it. We did not give any maps. We will  conduct negotiations because we want to attain peace with Syria,  because we do not want to face a coalition with a totally  different kind of weapons, because we must think about the  future and not just about the past, because the future does not  only herald knives but also missiles, because the future also  holds nonconventional weapons, and because we must build a  different future."    Again to the opposition, he says: "You will not frighten us  even one little bit with your screams and threats. We are  treading the only correct historical, political, strategic, and  moral path. You know this deep down in your heart, and many of  you support it."    "What we proposed to the Syrians is to conduct negotiations  based on Israel's acceptance of the principle of territorial  compromise and its wish to discuss one package encompassing  withdrawal, peace, and security -- because these are three  inseparable issues -- while cautiously weighing our  pronouncements and our presentation of the issue. I hereby  announce from this podium: This government will do what it  promised and will strive to attain genuine peace with the  Syrians, which will include an element of withdrawal. We will  not present any maps before we know what the other components  are and before we see that a spirit of reconciliation and  willingness to arrive at a compromise exist on the Syrian side.  They are not doing us a favor, and we are not doing them one.  But, just as with the Palestinians, there are rules, and where  security was concerned, we insisted on our position throughout  the negotiations. On other issues, we tried to enable the  Palestinians to live dignified lives as human beings; with  passports, the right to write letters, self-government, and a  police force."    Peres goes on to quote Israeli Army reservists: "For 27  years we were sitting ducks in the Gaza Strip, and now we are  getting out of it. Shalom to Gaza and Shalom to Israel, and let  us turn over a new leaf."    "The words traitor, liar, and others were uttered even at  the  time of the Camp David accords. There were stones, and flags,  and demonstrations. The man who brought about the Camp David  accords, Begin, deserves all the historical praise. He was not  deterred by people calling him a traitor or the shouting of  Knesset Member Tzahi Hanegbi."    Peres ends his speech by saying: "A historic decision  entails pains, opposition, and screams. The decision has been  made. We are about to embark on the only correct road and I  propose to strike all the no-confidence motions from the  Knesset's agenda."    Replying to an interjection by the Likud's Binyamin Begin  citing press reports that the autonomy agreement is based on an  agreement made by Denmark with some islands near Greenland,  Peres says: "Any comparison with the autonomy that had been  proposed by the Likud or any other autonomy in the world is  totally unfounded, because in Greenland or elsewhere it was  stipulated that the autonomy would be a permanent form of  relations, whereas the Camp David accords stipulated that the  autonomy would be a temporary form of relations, which would  move on to a permanent arrangement within five years. Therefore,  there is a huge difference and no comparison should be made to  anything. Hence, all reports on the matter are totally  worthless.    "Secondly, it is true that Gaza is not Greenland. So, what  to do? Hold onto 800,000 people with jail wardens, soldiers,  policemen, stones, and knives? For God's sake, what is your  solution? Stop confusing the people! You offer no solution,  other than using force, violence, and confrontation." He  concludes by saying: "Knives can always be matched with knives,  but the desire of one people to run its own life must be met by  political and moral means -- and we are providing both."</p>

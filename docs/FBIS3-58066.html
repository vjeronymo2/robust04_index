The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation agreed in August to  launch air attacks on Bosnian Serbs if requested by the United  Nations to break the siege of Sarajevo and other mainly Moslem  communities.    "The concept to which we agreed in August is still valid,"  Woerner told reporters three days before a NATO summit where  France plans to make a new push for action on Bosnia amid  increased shelling of Sarajevo.    "I have no doubt that if we would be confronted with a  request by UNPROFOR (the United Nations Protection Force) or the  secretary general of the United Nations, NATO would be prepared  to do what it promised to do," he said.    Woerner also predicted the 16-member alliance would be ready  to help implement any peace accord reached to end the  21-month-old conflict in the former Yugoslav republic.    NATO has drafted plans to send a 50,000-strong force, half  of  it from the United States. But doubts have been raised whether  Washington would contribute its share after its peacekeeping  problems in Somalia and Haiti.    "I think if really the chips are down and the implementation  of a possible peace plan depends on NATO support, I think there  is a good chance that the United States will participate,"  Woerner said. "But that is my own guess."    Despite pressure by France, he did not think the Bosnian  conflict would dominate the summit, which will take up such  issues as ties to the former eastern bloc and strengthening  NATO's European pillar.    "This summit has as the major objective to prepare this  alliance for the future, to set it on track even for the 21st  century," Woerner said.</p>

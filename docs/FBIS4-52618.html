			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japan and other leading  industrial nations are cooperating on credit policy but not  simply to prop up the dollar, a top Finance Ministry official  said Thursday [12 May].    Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular news  conference that the Group of Seven (G-7) nations agree on  promoting "stable economic growth without inflation" and that  Japan is cooperating as a G-7 member. But he said each country  is making its own policy to further that goal and they "are not  necessarily (cooperating) for the sake of foreign exchange  alone."    Reports have surfaced in recent days that Japan, the United  States, Germany and other major nations are acting together on  interest rates, in addition to recent concerted central bank  interventions in the currency markets to boost the dollar.    Germany's Bundesbank on Wednesday cut two key rates by 0.5  percentage point each, with other European central banks  following suit. The Bank of Japan has been guiding market rates  to record lows through generous liquidity funding operations.    On the other hand, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely  expected to raise rates again Tuesday. Higher rates in the  recovering U.S. economy and lower rates in the other  still-sluggish economies are expected to boost the dollar, which  bounced back from near-record lows around 100 yen after the  market interventions of the past two weeks.    Saito said the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan do not  differ on monetary policy. Central bank chief Yasushi Mieno  said Wednesday he intends to keep rates low.</p>

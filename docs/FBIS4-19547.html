			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Robert Toubon] </F>   [Text] It is one thing to observe the international  community's impotence in the former Yugoslavia. Accepting it  without seeking the causes of this impotence, in other words,  the means of overcoming it, is a different matter. The causes,  or rather, the cause is the persistent refusal to take account  of the real situation.    Thinking that, after the fall of communism, the East  European  theater would automatically be destined for peace and fraternity  was a refusal to accept reality. Believing that Serbia would  allow the other Yugoslav republics to declare their independence  without reacting was also a refusal to accept reality. Finally,  believing that the United Nations could solve the problem was  also a refusal to accept reality, taking into account that its  troops were locked into a humanitarian mission and limited to  self-defense, and that they were in any case technically unable  to intervene effectively because of the problems of the terrain  and the extreme proximity of the different armed groups and  their interweaving with civilians.    For the future, taking account of the real situation would  obviously mean taking note of the fact that the Serbs have  already achieved virtually what they wanted on the ground.  Belgrade is primarily now seeking the same thing as the  international community: an honorable way out. And the only  point on which this way out could be organized is the embargo.  Although Serbia's isolation is not preventing the continuation  of the war, it does jeopardize the viability of the new Yugoslav  Federation and hence the power of Milosevic and his friends. As  for the international community, in addition to the fact that  this is the only argument it has in exchange for a definitive  halt in the fighting, it cannot go on forever practicing  selective humanitarian indignation, because, after all, in  Belgrade and in Sarajevo, it is always the same people who  suffer, the vast majority of "ordinary people," and not the  thugs or fanatics of pan-Serbism or expansionist Islamic  fundamentalism. Moreover, it is no accident that we have just  learned that the United States is now prepared to discuss a  gradual lifting of the embargo in exchange for an end to the  Serbian military operations and Belgrade's return to the  negotiating table. Of course, when the same proposal was made a  few months ago by [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe and his German  counterpart, it was met with widespread indifference. However,  admitting that, rightly or wrongly, what happens in Washington  and Moscow will always have more weight than what might be said  in Paris and Bonn is also accepting the harsh law of reality.</p>

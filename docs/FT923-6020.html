			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Owner-occupation is backed in home surveys THE PRIVATE rented sector is unlikely to become as significant in the UK housing market in the foreseeable future as it is in Germany, France or Scandinavia, according to Housing Finance, the economics journal of the Council of Mortgage Lenders. The council says that private rented accommodation makes up only 7.4 per cent of the UK housing stock, compared with 45 per cent in Germany, 33 per cent in the US and 18 per cent in France. Recent market research indicates that owner-occupation was still the most desired form of tenure in the UK. The council adds that the surveys show that only a 2 per cent annual increase in house prices was needed to make ownership more financially attractive than renting.</p>

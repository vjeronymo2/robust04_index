			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Decision Process for NESHAP Development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Source of Authority for NESHAP Development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112 of the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to establish national standards to reduce air emissions from sources that emit one or more HAP. Section 112(b) contains a list of HAP to be regulated by NESHAP. Section 112(c) directs the Agency to use this pollutant list to develop and publish a list of source categories for which NESHAP will be developed; this list was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). The Agency must list all known categories and subcategories of ``major sources'' that emit one or more of the listed HAP. A major source is defined in section 112(a) as any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit in the aggregate, considering controls, 10 tons/yr or more of any one HAP or 25 tons/yr or more of any combination of HAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Criteria for Development of NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions from both new and existing sources according to the statutory directives set out in section 112(d) of the Act. The statute requires the standards to reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAP that is achievable for new and existing sources. This control level is referred to as the ``maximum achievable control technology'' (MACT). The selection of MACT must reflect consideration of the cost of achieving the emission reduction, any nonair quality health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements for control levels more stringent than the MACT floors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MACT floor is the least stringent level for MACT standards. For new sources, the standards for a source category or subcategory ``shall not be less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the Administrator'' [section 112(d)(3)]. Existing source standards should be no less stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources for categories and subcategories with 30 or more sources or the best performing 5 sources for categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources [section 112(d)(3)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although NESHAP are normally structured in terms of numerical emission limits, alternative approaches are sometimes necessary. In some cases, physically measuring emissions from a source may be impossible or at least impracticable because of technological and economic limitations. Section 112(h) authorizes the Administrator to promulgate a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, in those cases where it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emissions standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following sections explain the rationale used in selecting the proposed standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Selection of Pollutants and Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Selection of Pollutants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The specific pollutants regulated by the proposed standards are those compounds that are listed as HAP in section 112(b) of the Act. In the wood furniture (surface coating) source category, HAP are emitted from finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HAP most commonly used by the wood furniture industry are VOC's used as solvents in the finishing materials and include toluene, xylenes, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). Another material used in finishing operations in this industry is thinner, which is used to dilute finishing materials purchased from an outside source. Thinners contain one or several of the HAP previously noted and, therefore, are a source of HAP emissions. Nonvolatile HAP that are contained in the finishing materials used by wood furniture manufacturers are typically in the pigments and include chromium, cobalt, and manganese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

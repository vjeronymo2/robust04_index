			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 18 (CTK) -- The law on  large-scale privatization was passed today in its original form  after being re-discussed by the Slovak Parliament.    Notes added to the bill by Meciar's government before its  fall a week ago, were not accepted by parliament. This means  that the most controversial point in the law, which forbids  members of the government or parliament from simultaneously  being members of the presidium, executive committee, or  supervisory council of the National Property Fund (FNM), was not  changed. FNM representatives must be nominated by the relevant  parliamentary committee, whose proposal must be approved by  parliament.    The only proposal of the former government accepted by  parliament in the legislation was that FNM funds may be used for  the purpose of increasing the capital stock of trade companies  that are associates of the FNM or in which the FNM has a stake.    The law should ensure that conditions for the transfer of  property from the state to a third party not be subject to  suspicion or criminalization, said Juraj Plesnik, vice-chairman  of parliament's Privatization Committee. Parliament will look  into the privatization methods used by Meciar's government in  February, when capital stock in enterprises in which foreign  firms are interested were sold under very lucrative conditions,  he added. Most of the approved privatization projects are not  backed financially, he stated.    Meciar's government in its last weeks sold property valuing  three billion Slovak korunas ($96.800 million), but only 600  million korunas (about $19 million) worth was backed by loans.</p>

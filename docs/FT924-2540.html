			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Insider trading charge for MCA chief's son THE US Securities and Exchange Commission has brought insider trading charges against Mr Jonathan Sheinberg, the son of Mr Sidney Sheinberg, president of MCA, the Hollywood studio acquired in 1990 by Matsushita of Japan. According to the SEC charges, which were filed in a lawsuit in a Los Angeles federal court and settled simultaneously by agreement with the younger Mr Sheinberg, the 34-year-old son of the MCA chief overheard his father discussing the Dollars 6.1bn Matsushita takeover on the telephone. He then shared that information with others even though his father stressed that he must keep it confidential and not trade in MCA stock. The SEC alleged that Mr Sheinberg shared the inside information with his father-in-law, a close friend of his former wife and his business manager, each of whom then purchased MCA securities on September 24 1990, based on the information. Matsushita's takeover of MCA was formally announced in November 1990. Mr Sheinberg and his friends all agreed yesterday - without admitting or denying the allegations made by the SEC - to pay a total of more than Dollars 1.3m, an amount equal to the alleged profits made plus interest and penalties. The Matsushita takeover of MCA was the largest Japanese acquisition of a US company when it was unveiled. MCA owns Universal Pictures, plus record labels and a cluster of publishing, theme park and property assets.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: The many faces of Shylock exposed - Shakespeare and anti-Semitism My father, when conscripted to the pre-first world war Russian army, was a Jew in little more than name. Then one day, during a trivial argument, the non-Jew who was his greatest friend called him a dirty Jew. 'All right,' thought my father. 'If to them I'm a Jew, to myself I'll be a Jew.' From that day on, he observed his religion with the strictest orthodoxy. In David Thacker's new interpretation of The Merchant of Venice for the RSC, which opens at the Barbican next week, Shylock's Jewish identity is awakened in the same way as was my father's. When we first see Shylock at his financier's desk in the 1990s London yuppie dockland - a clever analogy for Venice - in which this production is set, he is dressed in the kind of clothes worn by those prosperous Jewish businessmen who, on high holy days only, attend St John's Wood synagogue. As the play progresses and the emphasis on his Jewishness increases, Shylock dons a skullcap. Subjected - as the action approaches its climax - to the full force of anti-Semitic prejudice, he responds by wearing the black overall that is customary among ultra-Orthodox Jews. Many critics, not all of them Jews, regard The Merchant of Venice, with its apparently stereotyped Jewish villain, as unplayable. Such critics misunderstand not only the play but its author. Compare The Merchant of Venice with other works of English literature featuring Jews, and it is not the similarities but the differences which are remarkable. Marlowe's The Jew of Malta, written around the same time as Shakespeare's play, presents a protagonist, Barabas, who conforms to the worst sort of racial stereotype. He thinks only of money, and to get it he is perfectly ready to cheat and deceive Christians: 'We Jews can fawn like spaniels when we please; And when we grin we bite; yet are our looks As innocent and harmless as a lamb's' At the end of the play Barabas dies as he has lived - evil, violent and unrepentant. That kind of caricature is repeated in the particularly nasty anti-Semitism with which the vastly over-praised Charles Dickens portrays that other well-known fictional jew - Fagin of Oliver Twist, the criminal and corrupter of children. On his first appearance Fagin is described as 'A very old shrivelled Jew (with) villainous-looking and repulsive face . . . dressed in a greasy flannel gown'. He is truly evil, egging Bill Sikes on to murder Nancy and utterly defiant as he goes to his execution before a raucous and jovial crowd. Yet the depiction of Fagin was not some odious excrescence but the norm. Instinctive and automatic anti-Semitism was endemic in English plays and novels until early this century. Saki's stories are peppered with anti-Semitic references, and so are John Buchan's. In The Thirty-Nine Steps there is the early appearance of 'A little white-faced Jew in a bath-chair with an eye like a rattlesnake', and the narrative is obsessed with 'Jew-anarchists'. Anti-Semitism featured, too, in the writings of GK Chesterton, in whose reputedly warm-hearted Father Brown stories the word 'Jew' is used as a synonym for 'alien'. Three of this century's best-selling authors of detective novels - Agatha Christie, Marjorie Allingham and Dorothy Sayers - were reflexively anti-Semitic (even though Sayers's publisher was a Jew). In The Merchant of Venice, Shylock starts out as benefactor who offers a loan to an avowed anti-Semite. Antonio accepts the terms for forfeiture - the pound of flesh - quite readily: 'If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not As to thy friends . . . But lend it rather to thine enemy; Who if he break thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty.' The key event that precedes Shylock's switch to a stubborn insistence that the debt must be repaid, and in the manner to which Antonio has agreed, is the defection of his daughter, Jessica. She not only runs off secretly to marry a gentile, but she also steals much of her father's wealth and then proceeds to throw in her lot with his enemies. Shylock is a loving father. It is the loss of Jessica rather than his money that he principally laments: 'My daughter] O my ducats] O my daughter]' It is understandable (though not pardonable) that, taunted by street-people and insulted by his enemies, Shylock should become vengeful. Suffered of injustice both in being robbed and in not having his loan repaid, it is he, not Antonio, who is ruined. He is not the play's villain but its victim. Thacker demonstrates that anti-Semitism is only one element of the bigotry that pervades Venice. There is a telling moment in the first casket scene when Portia flinches from the touch of the black Prince of Morocco and, later on, Antonio's own friends mock his homosexual attachment to Bassanio. Thacker not only illustrates the prejudice but dramatically emphasises it. Shylock's 'Hath not a Jew eyes?' speech occurs some way into the first scene of the play's third act. In mid-scene and indeed in mid-speech, the director stops the play and starts the interval, thus imprinting on the audience's mind what is the most profoundly effective apologia for Jewry in all literature. Thacker is able to create that coup de theatre because Shakespeare wrote that speech. The Merchant of Venice reveals its playwright to have been a moral pioneer, who transcended prejudices which prevailed not only in his own time but for centuries to come. The Merchant of Venice is not an anti-Semitic play, but one that exposes anti-Semitism. Shylock, humiliated, robbed, compelled to betray and abandon his own religion, is an ancestor of the Jews persecuted by Hitler. Portia, Bassanio and the rest of that trivial-minded and selfish dominant group in Venetian society were fore-runners of Nazis like Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. At the end of the play, their hounding of a Jew accomplished, they turn, complacent and impervious, to their merry-making.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Zheng Xinghua (6774 5281 5478) and </F> reporter Hou Yanqian (0186 1750 6197): "Establish New  Mechanisms for Smooth Operation of Production and Distribution"]    [Text] The provincial conference on reform of the crude  oil and refined oil distribution system was concluded in Taian  on 18 June. At this three-day conference, the guidelines of the  State Council instructions were relayed, the methods for the  reform of Shandong's crude oil and refined oil distribution  system were discussed and drawn up, and rectification of the  refined oil markets throughout the province was arranged. Vice  Governor Wang Yuxi gave a speech at the conference.    Wang Yuxi said in his speech: The basic guideline of this  reform is, by achieving a balance between the total demand and  total supply, to control resources, prices, and tax revenues,  rationalize the channels for marketing, implement the two-tier  reserve system, strengthen supervision and management, and  establish new mechanisms to ensure the smooth operation of  production and distribution. The major content of the reform is  as follows: First, based on the economic development rate,  industrial policy, import and export policies, energy  consumption pattern, the policy of frugality, and oil field  production capacity, the State Planning Commission draws up  annual plans as well as medium- and long-term plans for  balancing the total supply and total demand of crude oil and  refined oil to guide and arrange the production, import and  export, and distribution of crude oil and refined oil. Second,  the crude oil to be processed according to plans will be  delivered to the petrochemical corporation by the State Planning  Commission; and the crude oil not covered in the plans will all  be organized for processing by the petrochemical corporation  except for that used by oil fields themselves and the amount  lost in a reasonable way. Oil fields are no longer permitted to  exchange oil for electricity or materials and to provide crude  oil directly to local governments. Regarding the crude oil  delivered to local small oil refineries for processing as a  support to the refineries, its amount will not be increased.  All oil refineries will no longer take domestic crude oil for  processing. Third, the refined oil produced by all refineries  from the crude oil distributed by the state in a unified manner,  the imported refined oil, and the refined oil produced by  foreign-funded enterprises to be marketed in China according to  regulations will all be distributed under state guidance. The  distribution of refined oil will be organized by the  petrochemical corporation along with the various provincial,  regional, and municipal petroleum companies. Fourth, all the  refined oil produced by refineries will be sold at the  state-stipulated factory prices, and all gas stations and retail  outlets should sell at the stipulated retail prices. All  distribution units should strictly implement the state tax  system and unify the tax rate. Fifth, the channels for  marketing will be rationalized, and the intermediate links will  be reduced. Sixth, the existing oil product wholesale units  will be strictly screened, and the existing gas stations and  refined oil retail outlets will be rectified with great efforts.  Meanwhile, the sales agent system will be phased in.</p>

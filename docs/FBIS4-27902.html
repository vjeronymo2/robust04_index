			<p>CSO     [Text] New Japan-U.S. framework talks have been resumed  after being suspended for three and one-half months since former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said "No" during the summit in  February.    Economic interdependence of the two countries has become so  strong that relations are not about to be undermined merely  because of a hiatus in intergovernmental discussions. However,  if the suspension should persist too long, it will have an  adverse impact on areas other than the economy. There's also the  risk of worsening emotional attitudes between the peoples of the  two nations.    The resumption of the talks is welcomed in terms of the fact  they represent the avoidance of such a serious situation. We  would like to see the two governments engage in constructive  talks, but an evaluation of the agreement reached on the  resumption of talks indicates that we cannot assume an  optimistic outlook for the talks.    In reference to the key aspect of the agreement, U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor explained, "Japan obtained the  clear commitment that the United States will not seek numerical  goals and the United States obtained the commitment that it  would place emphasis on results."    The agreement was phrased so that the goal "to increase  participation and sales in Japan of competitive foreign  products" would be evaluated by each sector, such as  "automobiles and related parts." This language is being  construed as pointing to emphasis on results.    The Japanese Government persisted in its objection to  numerical goals as being managed trade. However, there is a very  fine distinction between emphasis on results and managed trade.  We cannot deny that an element of vagueness remains about the  distinction.    The question now is how the agreement will be concretely  reflected in the individual sectors on the basis of future  negotiations. We imagine that both governments foresee difficult  negotiations. The original deadline for negotiations, "July  1994" has been eliminated.    In its "external economic reform outline" approved at the  end  of March, the Japanese Government announced that it would  compile specific plans by the end of June to conduct  negotiations in three specific sectors, to open markets through  deregulation, and to administer the economy led primarily  through domestic demand.    Deregulation measures are being studied by three working  committees covering areas such as "housing and land." Among  issues being considered in the area of expansion of domestic  demand are income tax reductions after next year and the  revision of the 10-year 130 trillion yen basic public works  program. The program must be revised to reflect projects of  substance.    A key to plans for expansion of domestic demand is the  revision of the tax system. Although the Hata government is  controlled by a minority coalition, the Liberal Democratic Party  and the Social Democratic Party of Japan must be thoughtful and  refrain from using that fact as a political issue.    One wonders why the Clinton administration has softened its  stance on trade negotiations with Japan. Although there is the  aspect of learning that unyielding Asian policies are not  working well as a whole, the foremost issue affecting the policy  change is probably the "turbulence of market forces."    Just as the threat was posed in the stance that a strong yen  was welcomed if Japan did not make concessions, market  skepticism prevailed in respect to the fragility of the U.S.  economy and distrust of its economic policies, resulting in a  weak dollar.    Attacks on Japan using attorney-like tactics cannot inspire  sudden reversals of economic trends. Forceful policies that  disregard economic fundamentals can bring about results which  are contrary to hoped-for objectives. That lesson must be  garnered from market turbulence by the U.S. authorities.    A similar statement can be made about Japan. Delays in  market-opening measures and the slowness of economic recovery  have caused an extension of the stubborn balance-of-payments  surplus. On the other hand, increased exports to maintain  optimum factory operating rates have given a boost to the strong  yen. It's a case of exacerbating one's own problems. I feel that  both politicians and bureaucrats are excessively insensitive to  the current situation.    The Japanese Government, which had said "No" without any  particular idea about what it was going to do to resolve the  problem, has managed to gain resumption of the talks by what  might be considered a default by the U.S. Government, but what  takes place in the future is more important. We would like to  see politicians and bureaucrats resolutely grapple with the  issues at hand, mindful of the fact that economic reform is  essential not for the United States but for the recovery of the  Japanese economy.</p>

The county, once a revolutionary base noted for its remote  location, signed more than 80 contracts for joint-venture or  cooperative projects in 1993, involving more than 1.1 billion  Hong Kong dollars.    The amount of overseas investment in the county last year  was  equivalent to the total for the previous 10 years.    County official Wang Jingji said that the harsh geographical  conditions and backward communications used to hold back  potential investors.    The influx of overseas funds in other parts of this booming  province made the county officials aware that they must spare no  effort to bolster local infrastructure.    Since 1991 the county has mobilized more than 200,000 people  to upgrade 760 km of highways and build another 270 km of new  roads to link it up with neighboring counties.    It opened automatic switch boards in 1990 and installed  6,000  program-controlled telephones in 1992. Eighteen of its 23 towns  have been brought into the county's network of  program-controlled telephones.    In addition, pagers and mobile cellular phones have also  been  introduced into the county.    A power plant has been built with an installed capacity of  30,000 kw to ensure a stable supply of energy.    Meanwhile the county has promulgated a set of preferential  policies to encourage overseas investment. It now holds an  annual trade and investment fair.    The county is currently building an express highway to  connect it up with the ongoing Beijing-Kowloon railway, five km  away.</p>

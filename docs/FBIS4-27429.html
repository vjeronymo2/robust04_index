			<p>BFN     [Text] At a news conference on 31 May, Defense Agency [DA]  Director General Atsushi Kanda commented on North Korea's  preparations for experimental missile launching, saying that "it  does not mean that live shells will be flying around." At the  same time, he also said: "We are making appropriate  preparations to face outcome of the experiment." In this way,  he suggested that the government, from the viewpoint of Japan's  security, is ready to strictly deal with the situation if North  Korea carries out the experimental launching.    What the Defense Agency is strongly concerned about is the  type of missile North Korea is preparing to launch. A  government source points out that "there is a strong possibility  that North Korea may deploy missiles, which can reach Japan, for  actual warfare" if a missile, which will be used in the  experimental launching, is "Nodong-1" medium-range missile,  which is capable of flying 1,000 km and was launched in May last  year, or another type with longer flying capability. Defense  officials are increasingly worried that depending on outcome of  the experiment, Japanese security may face a dangerous situation.</p>

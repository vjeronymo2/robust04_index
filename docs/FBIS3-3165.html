			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "China Announces That Its Aviation Market Will Be </F> Opened to Foreign Investors"]    [Text] Beginning in 1994, foreign investors will be  allowed to invest in China's commercial airports and get  involved in all aspects of the air transportation industry  except for air traffic control.    This was recently announced by Lin Kun, a department  director  of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, who is responsible for foreign investment in China.    Reportedly in order to more rapidly boost the construction  of  transport facilities in all fields, China will adopt various  forms to encourage and attract foreign investment. China will  open its aviation market to foreign investors, and this is one  of the major actions to be taken. In fact, China's transport  industry, especially the air transport industry, is far from  being able to meet the needs of its economic development. Such  problems as insufficient transport capacity, backward  technology, poor management, a lack of competent personnel, and  the low safety coefficient have become increasingly serious and  have caused serious concern among people at home and abroad.    People in this industry pointed out that if China's air  transport industry is opened up to the world and introduces  advanced world equipment, management methods, and technology,  this will play a certain role in resolving the above-mentioned  problems and will help change the current backward condition of  the air transport industry and promote its healthy development.    Foreign investors have strong interest in the Chinese  mainland's huge air transport market, which has great  development potential. Aircraft maintenance and repair is a  major field of such investment. At present, China Southern  Airline, Rockefeller International Airplane Service Corporation  of the United States, and Hutchison Whampoa (China) of Hong Kong  have set up a joint venture in Guangzhou to offer aircraft  repair services.    In addition, Hong Kong Air Terminal Service Ltd. and Xiaman  International Economic and Technological Cooperation Corporation  have also signed an agreement to set up an aircraft maintenance  joint venture in Xiamen. Other Hong Kong companies  participating in the joint venture include the New World Group,  Kumagai (Hong Kong) Ltd., the Fok family, and Macao's Hainan  Tongao Economic Development and Investment Ltd.    Regulations on the operation of travel agents for  border-crossing air tickets were formulated before Director Lin  Kun announced the opening of China's aviation market. Travel  agents allowed to sell air tickets into China should have at  least 500,000 yuan of registered capital; and those being  allowed to sell air tickets out of China should have at least  1.5 million yuan of capital. They must have registered offices  inside China, and their personnel should have work experience in  the field of air transportation. After their applications are  approved, their business licenses will be valid for three years.</p>

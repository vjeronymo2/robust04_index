			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Labour to press on NHS funds today OPPOSITION MPs plan to press ministers again today after last week's announcement of about 600 job losses at Guy's Hospital, London, and a probable 300 at the Bradford Hospitals Trust, as the uproar over National Health Service funding continues in the run-up to Thursday's local-government elections. The financially provoked cuts, announced less than a month after the introduction of the government's NHS reforms, have led to renewed calls for publication of the business plans on which ministers granted self-governing trust status to 57 hospitals and other services. Mr Robin Cook, Labour health spokesman, has written to Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, asking whether the proposed job losses at Guy's were in its plan. Mr Waldegrave said in a BBC radio interview yesterday it would have been wrong to expect hospital managers to predict last year - when the business plans were prepared - exactly what their income would be for this year. He agreed that a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, chartered accountants and management consultants, had shown that only about 12 of the trust candidates were without financial difficulties. Mr Waldegrave said, however, that it had been his job to judge whether the solution was going to come 'from the very management structure which had created those problems' or from setting up trusts. Under the health reforms, trust hospitals such as Guy's manage their own day-to-day affairs. All hospitals, whether trusts or directly managed, now receive their finance from contracts negotiated with health authorities and general practitioners. The more competitive funding system means that further cuts and service reductions, such as those announced last week, are likely - particularly in London, where the hospital sector faces substantial rationalisation. The Guy's and Bradford job cuts, coming so soon after the start of the reforms and just before the local government elections, have embarrassed the government. Mr Peter Griffiths, chief executive of Guy's hospital, stands by his decision to tell his staff last week that jobs needed to be shed. He said: 'Too often, problems in the NHS have been caused by money running out towards the end of the financial year and forcing hospitals into sudden, unplanned decisions. I thought it was right to make the position clear at the start of the financial year so that we would have as much time as possible to tackle it.' On Saturday Mr John Major, the prime minister, and other ministers met medical and health specialists to discuss targets for improving the nation's health. The meeting kept to its planned agenda, although Mr Major emphasised to his audience that the government had no intention of reducing the overall resources devoted to the NHS. He said the objective was to get more health care for every pound spent. The plans for health targets discussed on Saturday will be published by the Department of Health next month. Although the idea is welcomed by health specialists, it is likely to generate more controversy. Critics say that the government's economic policies have added to the health problems of poorer people.</p>

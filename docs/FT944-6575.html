			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: The Spanish Lady - Opera When Elgar died in 1934, one of the three major unfinished projects he left was an opera, The Spanish Lady. Is it salvageable? Arguably not. The surviving material is extensive but fragmentary, and almost beyond repair. But both Cambridge University Opera Club, and Dr Percy Young, to whose devoted scholarship we know as much as we do, are to be congratulated on having a crack at it. The Spanish Lady was staged last week as part of the enterprising Cambridge Elgar Festival. The story is broadly based on Ben Jonson's play The Devil is an Ass, on to which Elgar grafted texts from other sources, including Jonson's The Epicoene (on which Strauss was already working independently for Die Schweigsame Frau). Elgar's text is not merely eclectic, but butterfly-like: part-masque, part Restoration comedy, mainly morality a la Volpone (with a satirical bite rather lost here in performance). This first full staging, in Young's conjectural completion, made for a mixed evening. What was badly needed was the kind of coherent, taut direction Joseph Ward brought to the Royal Northern College's Pilgrim's Progress. There, not a flinch or quiver was wasted. Here, Adrian Osmond (Trinity), unhelped by the cramping of on-stage orchestra and the set that gave none of the intended sense of place, failed to surmount the inherent problems. Most first-half stage entries and exits were loose, at worst abysmal. Over-fussy or random crowd activity muddied too many focal moments. Principals projected insufficiently, so that the intricate plot became further confounded. Character definition was weak, with the exception of Leigh Melrose's Meercraft and Keith Perry's foppish Manly, both admirably sung. The devilry of Pug (Susie Trayling) soon lost its initial promise. Even a memorably funny drag entry by Christopher Genz (Wittipol) as the Spanish instructress was blurred by poor blocking. Blake Applegate supplied the tidiest cameo as Engine, doubling as the duenna. And Elgar's music? Young's orchestral completion turned out attractive, but markedly 'safe'. Too often, the music seemed to bare scant relation to what was happening on stage. More risks needed to be taken. But where a salient feature appeared, such as the brief prominence awarded to paired clarinets and bassoon near the end, a momentary magic was unfurled. Conductor William Lacey (Kings) gave consistently clear leads, surviving one nervous Act II moment in the upper strings but engendering some needlessly awkward pauses that detracted from overall pace. His besetting fault was a monotonous dynamic, frozen between forte and mezzo-forte. (The leisurely Handelian pacings best in the stately Sarabande) often verged on the bland: the poise of a Lully or Rameau would have been a welcome relief. The choreographer, Darren Royston, seemed alone in sensing this: his dances (with chief accolade, undeniably, to the boys) were charming, lucid and inventive.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] KEYHAN Economic Service -- The Islamic Republic of  Iran is trying to find a way to deal with its foreign exchange  commitments and get out of its foreign-debt bind by sharply  cutting imports. This measure, which has created one of the most  severe fluctuations in the history of Iran's foreign trade, has  not just affected the import of consumer goods, it has also  created daily increasing problems for industrial units in  meeting their import needs, and in some areas it even threatens  to stop the production cycle.    Economic experts in the Iranian capital say cutting exports  alone will not solve Iran's foreign debt problems, and that  hasty measures taken for public display in this area will only  lead to greater disruption of Iran's productive ability.  <H5>  From $29 Billion to $12 Billion? </H5>   Based on the predictions of some Iranian and foreign  sources,  the volume of Iran's imports will drop from $29 billion in the  year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] to about $12 billion in  the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. If this occurs,  Iran's imports will drop 58 percent in 12 months. It is said  that this year only America was unable to increase its exports  to Iran.    Concerning the amount of Iran's imports in the year 1371 [21  March 1992-20 March 1993], the figure of $29 billion is based on  a statistic published late in the month of Azar [22 November-21  December] by the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Office of  Statistics and Machine Services. In its report, the Customs  Office emphasized that this volume of imports includes political  exemptions, foreign goods in transit, goods accompanying  travelers, and smuggled goods, and if these goods are counted,  imports for the year 1371 will be more than $29 billion. The  largest amount of goods in terms of value in the year 1371 came  into the country from Germany, Japan, and Italy.    Reports published recently by foreign sources show that  there  was a significant drop in the exports from the above three  countries to Iran. Based on the latest statistics published by  the Japanese Foreign Trade Organization, in the first nine  months of the year 1993 (winter through summer of last year)  Iran imported about $1.2 billion from Japan, while the value of  Iran's imports from Japan in the first nine months of 1992 was  $2.1 billion.    The total volume of Germany's exports to Iran in 1993  decreased about 40 percent, but no reliable reports in this  regard have yet been received. In Italy, hundreds of small- and  medium-sized companies active in the Iranian market are on the  verge of bankruptcy because of the sharp drop in exports to the  Islamic Republic and hundreds of their workers are faced with  unemployment. This situation has developed as the result of  Iran's new import policy, and it has also caused insurance  guaranteeing exports to Iran to be cut by the Italian Export  Credit Insurance Agency, known as Sace. Sace, following the lead  of its Western counterparts such as COFACE [Foreign  Trade-Insurance Credit Company] in France and Hermes [export  credit guaranteee agency] in Germany, is refusing to issue  insurance coverage on exports by Italian companies to Iran. A  group of Italian parliamentary deputies, in asking a question of  the government of that country, warned of the unemployment of  those hundreds of workers. They said: "What Sace did with  exports to Iran has caused heavy losses for Italian companies,  because those companies, after signing contracts with their  counterparts in Iran, have stopped production because of Sace's  failure to make a quick decision and they have stopped exports  to Iran." The measure taken by Sace followed the intensification  of the frightening financial conditions in the Islamic Republic  of Iran and this country's inability to meet its foreign  commitments.  <H5>  Highest Rate of Debt Growth </H5>   Iran's financial crisis mainly came about in the wake of the  disruption of its trade balance, meaning the dominance of  imports over exports. The nation's trade deficit went from $7  billion in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] to $10 billion in  1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993]. The result was that Iran's  foreign debt reached astronomical levels, rising to about $30  billion (or, according to some Iranian sources, including the  newspaper SALAM, to about $40 billion). In its recent report on  world debt published as World Debt Tables, the World Bank said  Iran had the highest rate of debt growth among the Middle  Eastern and North African nations. This report, which is  published annually, shows the latest short-term and long-term  debt situation for all nations.    This report says Iran's foreign debt increased from $11.3  billion in 1991 to $14.2 billion at the end of 1992, amounting  to about 13 percent of the value of Iran's gross domestic  product [GDP]. This figure was about 10 percent at the end of  the year 1991. The aforementioned report also says that in the  year 1992, 78 percent of Iran's foreign debt was short-term  debt. The World Bank concludes that Iran's rate of acquiring  debt is the highest among the nations of the Middle East and  North Africa.    Can the policy of sharply reducing imports put an end to  Iran's foreign debt crisis? Apparently the repayment of debt,  which is mostly short term and at high interest rates, is a  priority for Iran's economic policymakers. However, there is  much evidence that this crisis cannot be solved by reducing  imports alone.    First of all, even if the Islamic Republic could reduce  imports to $13 billion by the end of 1372 [20 March 1994], it  would only succeed in leveling the nation's trade balance,  because the nation's exports, with a best-case assessment of the  current state of the oil market, even including nonoil products,  will not go higher than $14 billion. This amount of foreign  exchange will barely suffice to meet the need for subsidized  goods, the Ministry of Petroelum's equipment and services,  military equipment and interest on loans, and then there will  nothing left to pay the principal on loans.    Moreover, foreign trade problems must not be assessed solely  in light of the balance between imports and exports. Many of  Iran's producing units are dependent on imported capital and  intermediate goods, and suddenly depriving them of these goods  could lead to their absolute destruction and the unemployment of  hundreds of thousands of workers.    In this same regard Dr. Akbar Karbasian wrote in the 5 Dey  [26 December] issue of RESALAT that the decisions of the Foreign  Exchange Market Regulating Commission have exposed private  companies to "the long and wide bureaucracy of the Ministry of  Commerce. While they have to register their orders with that  ministry (and not at the Central Bank), they are wandering  between the Ministry of Commerce, the Central Bank and Iran  Customs. What is not clear is, if there is a foreign exchange  shortage, what are the nation's many producers, their personnel  and their families going to do?"    Akbar Karbasian adds that even if the Foreign Exchange  Regulating Committee's policymakers "can in the short term  inject some calm into the nation's economic structure, which is  now limping along, the long-term indicators such as the GDP,  per-capita income, and new investment are on the decline."    To solve Iran's financial crisis, short-term and long-term  measures are without a doubt more constructive than quick fixes  for public consumption. Some Iranian experts say that to get out  of the deadlock, the country should pay off its short-term debt  as quickly as possible by getting new sources of foreign  exchange on the international financial market in the form of  long-term lower-interest loans. The only way to achieve this  goal, however, is to hold a series of international talks,  especially with the IMF and the World Bank. This will get the  country out of its economic constraints, and it has to do with  the Islamic Republic's foreign policy and its relations with the  world community.  <H5>  War Against `Economic Hypocrites' </H5>   Despite the decisions by the Foreign Exchange Regulating  Committee and the imposition of heavy pressure on imports, the  future of the rial against the dollar remains quite uncertain.  In this regard many rumors are circulating in the Islamic  Republic's capital. Based on reports received from Tehran, some  Central Bank experts are saying that based on the economic  models they have that the price of the dollar will go to 280  tomans and will find relative stability at this level.    The drop in value of Iran's national currency, which is  caused by severe social disruption in the country, is currently  one of the hottest economic debates in the Islamic Republic's  press. In its 28 Azar [19 December] issue the newspaper  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI writes: "the problem of foreign exchange is  more than an economic reality. It has now become an all-out war  between the economic hypocrites and the government." This  newspaper adds that the "economic hypocrites" paraded in the  playing field for several days by taking over the Islambul [a  Tehran street] intersection, just as the "political hypocrites"  tried to destroy the Islamic Republic by taking over Islamabad.    With regard to the difference between "political hypocrites"  and "economic hypocrites," the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI  writes that the first group, "with its savage actions, showed  more than before the oppressed condition of Islamic officials."  Now the second group, "with its actions, is causing people to be  disappointed with the government's officials, and with the  rumors it is circulating among the people, it is saying that  even the government's top officials are acting with it, and this  is to disperse the people away from the Islamic government."    The same newspaper adds: "More regrettable is the influence  of those who have positioned themselves here and there in  government organizations as specialists and are making the  analysis that our national currency should fall even further to  reach real parity."    The experts the newspaper refers to are in the Central Bank.  As was mentioned, they put the parity rate of the rial and the  dollar at 280 tomans.  <H5>  `Ruinous' Policies </H5>   On the other hand, in its 24 Azar [3 November] issue the  newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI published a very harshly worded  editorial accusing Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government, without  mentioning the president of the republic's name, of implementing  "ruinous" economic policies. This newspaper wrote: The  unjustifiable silence of the nation's economic officials has  reached an intolerable point, and it is still unclear whether  this silence is a specific policy or whether our economic  officials really have nothing to say.    In its editorial, the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI adds: Even  those who defend the policy of unifying the foreign exchange  rate, even those who consider it necessary at this time to  implement the policies of economic adjustment, and even those  who approve of simultaneous implementation of all these  programs, fully acknowledge the truth that there is no economic  justification of any kind for the instantaneous jump in the  foreign exchange rate.    This newspaper says "unbridled imports" are the main cause  in  the drop in the value of Iran's national currency. It wrote:  Even if we did not have the self-sufficiency slogan, even if we  did not think in revolutionary terms, even if we were not  thinking about deprived people and the owners of this  revolution, we should not tolerate such ruinous decisions and  economic policies, which open the country's doors to imports of  everything. Today we are like someone who has drained the water  out of his pond and is wondering why the fish do not have any  water. Today we are aligning our national currency with foreign  currencies at a time when our national economic and banking  system are not ready and do not have the capacity to make such a  change. With the water drained out of the pool, we still want to  see the fish living and in the water.

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Firmer tone to dollar The dollar finished firmer yesterday ahead of the release today of important US labour market data, writes Philip Gawith. The US currency tested the upper limits of its recent trading range to close in London nearly a pfennig higher against the D-Mark at DM1.6515 from DM1.6428. It was also firmer against the yen at Y104.930 from Y104.650. In New York it ended at DM1.6532 and Y104.80. Trading, however, was fairly thin, with many large investors out of the market attending the Forex 94 conference which is under way in London. Analysts said it was unlikely that the firmer tone represented the beginning of a new trend for the dollar. The interest rate futures markets were again very active. Short sterling contracts regained some of the ground lost recently, while Euromark contracts saw heavy volumes. In Europe the Swedish krona recovered slightly from recent weakness to close at SKr4.756 against the D-Mark from SKr4.787. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate to 5.30 per cent from 5.40 per cent. Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank, said there had been a 'very corrective feel' about a lot of the trading yesterday, with most markets retracing the moves of earlier in the week. Currencies again took their lead from the more turbulent bond markets. 'You cannot have the sorts of falls in credit markets we have seen recently and not experience some sort of correction,' said Mr Barr. It was a classic case of markets where there was lots of 'noise', and few firm trends to follow. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said there had been cautious dollar buying, which probably reflected that the market had been short at the beginning of the week. He said dollar purchases had also been prompted by indications earlier in the week that the US non-farm payroll figure today might be quite strong. Mr Barr added that the US employment data were unlikely to give the dollar fresh impetus but, if anything, this would be on the downside. The recent pattern has been for strong figures to cause a slide in bond prices, which has then fed over into a weaker dollar. The futures markets were again very active, partly for technical reasons as investors rolled over positions in the June contracts, which will soon be expiring. With considerable cash buying seen across the yield curve, traders were also hedging positions through the futures market. The December short sterling contract settled at 93.61, up 12 basis points from Wednesday's close. More than 27,000 lots were traded. The December Euromark contract saw nearly 69,000 lots dealt and ended slightly easier at 94.78 from 94.81. Following recent reversals in the market, dealers were reluctant to predict that the sharp rally in short sterling would be sustained. But the return of genuine buying interest was reported. Traders said the market had also been ripe for a correction after sharp falls earlier in the week. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 15m. The central bank had earlier provided Pounds 335m of liquidity to the market after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m. Over-night money traded between 3 per cent and 5 1/8 per cent. Money markets in most German centres were closed on account of the Corpus Christi holiday. Trade resumes today. The pound finished the day with the sterling index unchanged, after earlier testing the psychologically important DM2.50 barrier against the D-Mark. The UK currency closed at DM2.4977, up from DM2.4922 on Wednesday and off a high for the day of DM2.5020. Mr Hawkins said most of the potentially bad news about the currency appeared to have been discounted, while recent economic figures were on the strong side of expectations. Even allowing for stronger German growth, interest rate differentials were still likely to move in sterling's favour. The main constraint on the UK currency, said Mr Hawkins, was its close link to the dollar. Analysts said the rate cut by the Bank of France showed that it was sticking to the pattern of tracking the Bundesbank. Mr Hawkins said the central bank tended to move when the spread between the intervention rate and the German repo rate was more than 20 basis points. He added, though, that the current spread of 15 basis points was 'about as tight as they would like to go'. In Greece, meanwhile, Mr Yannos Papandoniou, the economy minister, declared that the recent drachma crisis was over. 'Markets have now understood that our foreign exchange policy is, and it will remain, unchanged.' The drachma was fixed at Dr149.50 against the D-Mark from the previous fix of Dr149.150. Interest rates continue to fall. The Athens Interbank Offered Rate (ATHIBOR) for one month dropped to 60.46 per cent, from 78.75 per cent on Wednesday and 120 per cent on Tuesday.</p>

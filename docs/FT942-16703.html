			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann expects record year Bertelsmann, the world's second largest media group, yesterday said earnings for the six months ending December 31 were 'well above budget'. In addition, it expected full-year results to be better than the 1993 record figures, despite losing an estimated DM160m through the collapse last week of the Vox private television channel. Total foreign sales rose 6.2 per cent to DM9.3bn (Dollars 5.43bn) while earnings rose by 'an even higher percentage', the company said. It did not give further details. The family-owned company said sales were expected to grow 6 per cent to more than DM18bn for the full year, maintaining Bertelsmann's position as the second largest media group in the world, behind Time Warner of the US. While Bertelsmann admitted the recession had not left it 'totally untouched', it said it would ride out the collapse of Vox, which folded just 14 months after its launch when two shareholders, Suddeutsche Verlag and WestLB, pulled out. Sales at Bertelsmann Buch, the newly created division which handles book clubs in German speaking countries and the international publishing arm, jumped 6 per cent to DM3.2bn. The company's best performing division, Bertelsmann Music Group, which includes the Arista Record company, reported sales up by 10 per cent to DM2.7bn. Turnover at Gruner+Jahr, the second largest division, which embraces newspapers and magazines and is more focused on the German market, rose 2 per cent to DM1.9bn. The industry group, which takes in printing plants and paper production, reported turnover up 1.5 per cent to DM1.6bn while the film and television division reported turnover up 23 per cent at DM500m.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Equity Issues: Firm demand for emerging market Euroconvertibles THE RECENT spate of Euroconvertible issues from emerging markets in east Asia indicates that investor demand for equity-linked bonds is far from satisfied. Around Dollars 2.5bn has been raised so far this year, and deals worth a further Dollars 1bn are expected to be launched by the end of the year. Hong Kong issuers have been the most active, raising about Dollars 1.3bn, followed by Thai companies with just under Dollars 600m. South Korean, Taiwanese and Indian companies have also made an appearance. International investors have been keen to buy these issues so that they can obtain exposure to some of the world's faster-growing economies. At the same time, they are protected against the volatility and the illiquidity which are endemic in emerging stock markets. The relatively high yield on the bonds is another attraction, especially to European investors. The two main advantages from the issuers' point of view are an ability to raise relatively large amounts in one go, a feat which would be much more difficult to achieve in domestic markets, and an opportunity to expand their investor base worldwide. Investor demand has reached such a pitch that last week's issue for Guangzhou Investment Company, the Hong Kong-listed vehicle for southern China's wealthiest city, was eight times over-subscribed. As a result, the five-year issue, lead managed by Morgan Stanley, was increased by Dollars 30m to Dollars 105m. The issuer also achieved an aggressive conversion premium of 24.6 per cent and a coupon of 4.5 per cent, at the low end of the 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent range. The bonds were launched at par but were trading at 104 3/8 yesterday. Morgan Stanley said the bonds' rapid rise reflected the demand across the globe for high-quality convertible paper as well as news that Cheung Kong, a core shareholder in Guangzhou Investment, had taken up Dollars 30m of the issue. Syndicate managers say the pricing of emerging market Euroconvertible issues depends on several factors, including how well-known the issuer is, the size of the issue, whether there are any calls or puts on the bonds, and the volatility in the underlying stock market. Hong Kong borrowers tend to achieve the highest conversion premiums, of between 20 per cent to 25 per cent, because most are already familiar to international investors. In addition, investors have shown themselves willing to pay higher prices for securities which offer exposure to mainland China. By contrast, Thai and Indian issuers can only expect a premium of perhaps 10 per cent to 15 per cent because their names are relatively new and their stock markets are not as developed as Hong Kong's. However, syndicate managers warn that any attempt to force investors to pay unrealistic prices could spoil the party for everyone. 'The market will be fine provided people don't indulge in silly pricing,' says one syndicate manager. Syndicate managers report that there is a long queue of issuers waiting to tap the market. Among Hong Kong names, Sino Land issued a seven-year Dollars 150m offering yesterday and Henderson Land is expected to launch a Dollars 400m offering in the near future. Several Thai issues are also in the pipeline. SCICI will be the first Indian financial institution to tap the Euroconvertible market when it launches a Dollars 100m offering later this month through BZW with joint-leads Lazard Brothers and James Capel. ITC, the Indian tobacco and hotels company in which BAT of the UK has a stake, is expected to launch a Dollars 100m convertible bond issue before the end of the year.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Risk and Reward: The value of hedging comes in for re-assessment SOME fund managers are giving hedging a bad name. To most people, the term implies risk reduction: logic suggests that a 'hedge fund' should carry less market exposure than a normal investment fund, for instance. In practice, that may not be true. The growing number of such funds being sold internationally carry a wide array of risk profiles. How potential investors assess for themselves the balance between risk and potential return from such vehicles is an open question. From their inception in the US, hedge funds have always looked remarkably unhedged. Among the leaders in the field is Mr George Soros, the Hungarian fund manager who achieved near-legendary status when a massive bet he placed against the European exchange rate mechanism came good last year. But Mr Soros himself lost Dollars 800m when he wrongly predicted a stock market crash spreading from Japan in the mid-1980s: 'hedge' hardly seems the right word to describe such an investment approach Some hedge funds - many of which grew up in the commodities markets - run rudimentary hedging strategies that hardly warrant the name. Such imperfect hedges can come disastrously unstuck. Many US currency funds  -a popular investment vehicle in 1991 and the first part of 1992, as US interest rates fell - discovered this last autumn. A popular approach had been to go long of higher-yielding European currencies (the Italian lira or sterling ) and shorting the D-Mark to create a currency 'hedge'. Such a strategy was based on the apparent belief that the parities between currencies in the ERM were fixed, effectively making the lira or sterling a proxy for the D-Mark. The hedge funds now becoming familiar outside the US largely take a more cautious approach, or so they claim. They still claim to be able to make returns far in excess of normal market levels, given the apparent level of risk, though. The demand for such vehicles has come with falling worldwide interest rates. Not surprisingly, hedge funds - or other geared 'futures funds'  - like investors to judge their promised returns against money-market levels. Cresvale, a UK-based securities house that has raised Dollars 140m for three hedge funds over the past year, says it aims to make around three times the return available from cash, with no extra risk. Citibank has just attracted Dollars 257m for a three-year geared fund, Spectrum 95, which aims for returns between two and three times more than three-year dollar rates (which currently stand at little more than 4 per cent). Both have targeted the averagely well-off who are now the target for such leveraged investments (Citicorp's minimum investment was Dollars 100,000, Cresvale's Dollars 10,000.) Is it possible to make higher returns without also taking on higher risks? Only if the market has mispriced particular financial instruments (Cresvale's claim), or through a portfolio diversification approach which reduces overall exposure (Citibank's). For investors, the problem is how to assess the claims fund managers make for their own ability to identify and take advantage of these opportunities  -as well as the quality of their risk-management analysis at hedging away risks. Cresvale, for instance, claims to hedge investments in Japanese equities with equity warrants in a way that leaves it with no underlying exposure to the Japanese equity market. 'The mispricing is in the relative valuation of the warrants,' says Mr Lester Petch, managing director of Cresvale International Asset Management. Analysed on the standard Black-Scholes method of option pricing, the warrants (or long-dated options) look cheap, he says, 'but you have to know how to extra the value'. In theory, such option strategies should struggle to show a return when market volatility is low - as in the Japanese market over recent months. However, Cresvale claims a return of 18 per cent in the year since its funds started. As leveraged investment funds like this become more familiar, it may well be time to reassess what hedging really means.</p>

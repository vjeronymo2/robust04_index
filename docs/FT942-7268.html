			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Forty into one does go - Why IBM is putting all of its advertising eggs into Ogilvy and Mather's basket You don't need an army to run our system. The slogan, featured in the latest poster advertising of its AS/400 computers, belongs to International Business Machines. But as of next month it could just as easily be applied to the running of the computer giant's own worldwide advertising. In a move which took the ad industry by surprise on Tuesday, IBM announced that it would be sacking its 40-plus advertising agencies around the globe and giving all the work to a single agency, Ogilvy and Mather. Estimates of IBM's annual advertising spending - unconfirmed by the company itself - range from Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) to Dollars 500m. The rationalisation follows plans announced earlier this month to shake up IBM's 40,000-strong marketing and sales force. Lou Gerstner, chief executive, intends to cut across the existing geographic organisation and form 14 teams, each covering a specific industry segment. All the upheavals are part of the company's desperate attempt to regain ground lost to rivals and restore profits, following three years of losses. Companies everywhere have been cutting the number of their suppliers - be they advertising agencies or providers of goods and other services - in recent years. What is remarkable in this case is the extreme to which IBM has gone in placing all its advertising with a single agency. Says Abby Kohnstamm, IBM vice-president for corporate marketing: 'There is a trend among many companies we have looked at to have as few agencies as possible as their partners. But I'm not sure any have taken it to the degree we have.' According to Dominic Mills, editor of the advertising trade journal Campaign, IBM's move is a 'reaffirmation of something Martin Sorrell (chief executive of WPP, O&amp;M's parent company) has always preached, which is one-stop shopping - you can get everything you want from one agency network'. But while it is possible to point to other companies going in the same direction as IBM - Mills cites Reebok, the sports shoe manufacturer, for example - he also says there are companies taking the opposite path and decentralising. 'Coke, for example, traditionally only used McCann-Erickson, now it uses a number,' he says. Now that IBM has a single worldwide network at its disposal, it can be expected that global advertising for the IBM brand will emerge. Kohnstamm says that the intention is for there to be an overall international campaign, modified as necessary for each country. Beneath that, there will be more localised advertising for specific products. There are dangers inherent in this global approach, as Maurice Saatchi, chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, pointed out in a speech in London recently. 'How do you communicate to lots of different people in all these different countries across the world without being so bland and jelly-like that you have nothing real to say?' he asked. Charlotte Beers, O&amp;M chief executive, acknowledges that global campaigns are 'the most challenging of all tasks because you must reach for a common denominator and yet never violate significant cultural differences'. But she nevertheless believes that it can be done, pointing to her agency's work for Unilever on its Ponds skin care range. 'The idea was developed in Paris, refined in London and has now been taken to 43 countries with major market share success. The same thing has been done with the Ford Mondeo,' she says. Maurice Saatchi also points to the organisational challenge for an agency of running offices all over the world. Networks 'mean co-ordination, which often means committees - not the best environment for inspired creativity', he said. The organisational challenge, both for O&amp;M and IBM, is not underestimated by either party. Shelly Lazarus, head of O&amp;M's North American operation, says she is putting together a worldwide team to bear responsibility for the IBM brand. There will also be a regional O&amp;M team in Paris relating to IBM's head of communications in Europe, and similar teams for Latin America and Asia Pacific - the latter will operate from Tokyo. These will be in addition to all of the national offices which both IBM and O&amp;M already operate. O&amp;M is ideally placed for the job, in Mills' assessment. 'There's a cultural fit - both are powerful brands, with long traditions and big global operations.' Overall, he sees the move to a single agency as positive for IBM. 'It has the reputation of being a really bad client, with the left hand never knowing what the right hand was doing - hence 40 agencies producing what were potentially very discordant messages about IBM,' he says. The financial rewards for the agency, and parent WPP, are as yet unclear. Neil Blackley, media analyst with Goldman Sachs, says it will cost the company money in the first half of the year. 'It's pain and then, hopefully, pleasure down the road,' he says. There will also be some account losses within the agency - Microsoft and Compaq business, for example, will have to be jettisoned because of conflicts of interest. And what has been O&amp;M's gain has been some loss to sister WPP agency J Walter Thompson, one of the 40 agencies to be crossed off IBM's list. But these minor points will not be uppermost in Sorrell's mind. For him the IBM victory is particularly sweet. When WPP took over J Walter Thompson in 1987, it also inherited a smaller subsidiary called Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein. The agency was well-respected and held a number of prestigious accounts, including IBM. After defections of a number of key personnel, financial claims by Sorrell and counter-claims by the defectors who formed a rival agency, a court settlement of Dollars 7m was accepted by WPP. The IBM account was lost to both agencies and Sorrell has had to wait until now to see it return to the fold.</p>

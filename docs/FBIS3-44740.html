The mainland's request to invite a Hong Kong Government  civil  servant to Beijing to explain the airport management plan was  advanced at a meeting attended by Chinese officials and  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.    However, the request was immediately turned down by the  British Hong Kong authorities on an excuse of there is no need  to establish another channel of communication.    Responding to the refusal from the Hong Kong Government,  Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong  Kong branch, said the Hong Kong Government failed to offer any  convincing argument for the refusal.    Construction of the Hong Kong new airport is one of the  matters stretching the change-over of power in 1997. Therefore  the draft airport corporation bill should be discussed through  consultation between the Chinese and British Government, Zhang  said.    The PWC shoulders the responsibility of studying issues  relating to the smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong. It is  logical for them to invite an official from the Hong Kong  Government to explain the airport bill, he added.    Zhang stated that the draft airport corporation bill was  published under the demand of the Chinese side to seek opinions  from local residents.    He said he is expecting that the current invitation of  public  opinions would be done in real earnest instead of making a  gesture.</p>

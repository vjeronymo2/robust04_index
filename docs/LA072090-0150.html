			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> American jockey Steve Cauthen was fined $1,800 by the Jockey Club, the  governing body of British horse racing, for withdrawing from a race at the last  minute in May.  </P> <P> Cauthen refused to ride a Pip Payne-trained colt, Nicholas Payne, at Leicester  after he weighed out.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it was fair of the trainer to book me for that particular  horse," Cauthen said. "There is no doubt he was a difficult ride -- everybody  backed me."  </P> <P> Cauthen can appeal the decision.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special corespondents Sergey Zhirnikhin, </F> Georgiy Shmelev]    [Text] Budapest, 22 Feb -- A whole range of problems linked  with the peaceful settlement of the situation in Bosnia were  discussed in Budapest late on Monday evening by Andrey Kozyrev  and Beniamino Andreatta, the Russian and Italian foreign  ministers.    The meeting took place at the request of the Italian  minister, who flew to Budapest especially to hold talks with his  Russian colleague.    In an exclusive interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondents at  the end of the meeting, which had been held in the Russian  Embassy, Beniamino Andreatta said: "I am heading for Brussels,  and I made a request by telephone for this meeting to be  organized so that I could discuss personally with Andrey  Kozyrev, first of all, the situation in Bosnia and the 'happy  ending' to the settlement of the Sarajevo problem. We agreed on  the need for joint work on the problem of protecting other  populated areas in Bosnia as well."    The main thing, the Italian minister stressed, was "not to  lose momentum" in consolidating the good results now achieved in  settling the situation around Sarajevo. In Beniamino  Andreatta's view, this will be the first step on the path  towards peace in Bosnia as a whole. Secondly, the minister  continued, new impetus must be given to the process of finding a  political settlement of the issue, holding various forums to  this end. Also discussed was the "format" of some such meetings  and negotiations.    In addition, we examined the European Union's plan of action  and "worked on it" in order to determine "more realistic"  borders and possibilities for the exchange of territories, and  also some forms of arbitration, taking account of the region's  particular historic, cultural, and ethnic features. In the  minister's view, this will make it possible to arrive at a  genuine settlement of the conflict in Bosnia.    It was also necessary to exchange opinions on the political  future of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the minister continued, "and at  least as a start we agreed on the possibility of maintaining  Bosnia's present borders."    The Italian government is in favor of any settlement of the  conflict which would predetermine cooperation at least between  two ethnic national groups in Bosnia, and if it is impossible  between all three, Beniamino Andreatta said.    Also discussed in detail was the problem of the sessions of  countries of the Seven and the Eight, and the organization of  genuine cooperation between the world's leading states.  Preference must be given in this to examining economic aspects  of such cooperation within the format of the Seven, and  political aspects within the format of the Eight.    They also discussed the problems of the CSCE in the context  of Yugoslav problems, and the situation in the Baltic countries  (the minister intends to visit the Baltic countries in the near  future). I believe that with the heightened activity of the U.S.  and Russia to settle the situation in Bosnia the situation has  significantly improved and the possibilities for a peaceful  solution are now much more real than before, Beniamino Andreatta  said in conclusion.    In turn, Andrey Kozyrev stressed in an interview with the  ITAR- TASS correspondents that an extremely wide range of  problems and ideas had been discussed. But above all attention  had been focused on the question of how to move forward towards  a settlement, in order to profit from the possibilities which  have opened up for a political settlement and the enforcement of  a security zone in Sarajevo and other areas. It is necessary to  push forward the process of seeking a peaceful settlement in  Bosnia as a whole.    Italy is now the coordinating country of the Seven, and we  have examined the conditions for holding sessions of the Eight  on political issues. We believe it is extremely important to  establish full-scale relations of partnership with the U.S.,  Italy, and other states in the Seven on political aspects.  Otherwise how can we achieve practical results in Bosnia or  elsewhere?    Andrey Kozyrev believes that it is wrong to adopt "separate  unilateral decisions; progress should be reached in the  settlement of the Bosnian crisis by joint efforts." This  constituted the essence of our meeting, for which I am extremely  grateful to the Italian minister, Andrey Kozyrev said in  conclusion. "Now it is my turn to catch my Italian colleague  somewhere on the move", the Russian minister laughed.</p>

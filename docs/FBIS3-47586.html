Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says:    It has become all the clearer that the "civilian" fascist,  the "civilian" dictator who has pursued an anti- popular labour  policy defending the privileged circles intends to totally  stifle the labour movement this year by brandishing the fascist  bayonet more desperately.    The analyst further says:    As for "industrial peace" cried for by Kim Yong-sam, it was  invented by the traitor No Tae-u, the military fascist dictator  of the "Sixth Republic," in a bid to stifle the labour movement  by shifting the responsibility for the economic crisis of South  Korea onto the workers.    With this anti-popular slogan, the Kim Yong-sam group  attempts to categorically turn down the vital demands of the  workers and obliterate the labour movement itself, fooling  people into believing that the economic catastrophe is  attributable to the "labour- management dispute" and wage hike,  as the preceding dictators did. Stripped bare is the fascist,  anti-popular nature of Kim Yong-sam who is trying to suppress  and stifle the struggle of the workers by adding new methods to  all the fascist laws and means of suppression employed by the  successive military dictatorial regimes.    That day, Kim Yong-sam cried for "measures to control  prices," saying the "vicious cycle of price hike must be  checked" this year. This is really a shameless sophism.    The traitors would be well advised to act with discretion,  well aware of their position.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television The Mary Whitehouse Experience was one of the funnier of the new wave comedy programmes and three of its protagonists have been encouraged to write and star in a new sit-com, Me, You and Him which receives its first outing on ITV at 8.30. Inevitably it involves three youngish men, old school friends now coping with real life - as a teacher, as an executive, and, realistically, as an unemployed graduate. More males on parade in Men Talk (Channel 4, 10.20). The opener, on sex, aroused a good deal of media interest but this week the discussion centres on the more mundane subject of male vanity. The problem with these frank discussion programmes is that inevitably the participants are unrepresentative exhibitionists. Alan Bennett's words, Patricia Routledge's acting - who could ask for anything more. Talking Heads provides the most civilised interlude in a duff evening at 9.35 on BBC 2. It is followed by the worthy Early Travellers in North America. Among the commentators on the New World are Dickens, Thackeray and the Trollopes, mother and son.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading FAVOURABLE economic data in the UK and Germany generated a squeeze sending stock index futures sharply forward, writes Joel Kibazo. September opened at 2,322 and traded sideways in a tight range for the next couple of hours and briefly dipped to 2,317 at around 10am, the low point of the day. Bear closing thereafter helped September gently forward, before the release of favourable UK retail price figures and good wholesale figures in Germany led to strong demand for the contract. The contract continued forward during the afternoon with buying interest boosted by the strong performance in the gilts market, though a positive opening on Wall Street was said to have had no impact on the day's trading. September closed at 2,390, up 61 on the previous session and around 21 points above its estimated fair value premium of about 12. Turnover was 9,128. The traded options saw an improvement in activity of the stock options. Total volume reached 29,137 contract with the FT-SE 100 option trading 9,222. BTR was the busiest stock option at 2,152.</p>

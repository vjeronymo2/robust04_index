			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEASURE ON REPLACING COUNCIL MEMBERS  DELAYED  </P> <P> A proposed amendment to the City Charter that would grant the Los Angeles City  Council broader authority to remove its members from office is not likely to go  before voters as a ballot measure until next June, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> It had been hoped by some City Hall officials that the amendment, which must be  approved by voters, could be ready in time to appear on the April 9, 1991,  ballot, allowing for a June special election to replace ailing Councilman  Gilbert Lindsay.  </P> <P> However, the council's Rule and Election Committee, which has for the last week  been pouring over the language of the amendment, seemed to agree that rushing  the debate on the controversial issue could prove unwise.  </P> <P> "We've lived with the situation we've got . . . for several months now; another  couple of months isn't going to make a difference," committee Chairwoman Ruth  Galanter said.  </P></p>

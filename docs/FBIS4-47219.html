			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alla Okulevich: "Kazakhstan's Oil Reserves"] </F>   [Text] There was a time when some college professors  delivering lectures about the oil and gas fields of the USSR to  their students referred to data taken from foreign sources.  Within the country, all information was considered secret to  varying degrees. Time has passed, and secret classifications  have been removed; however, to this day we have been getting  only disjointed information. I would like to remedy this  situation to a degree and provide for your attention information  on the general condition of the Kazakh oil and gas industry.    The Kazakh Republic has recoverable oil reserves of 2.1  billion tonnes, condensate reserves of 0.7 billion tonnes, and  gas reserves of 1.7 trillion cubic meters.    Some 26 million tonnes of oil and condensate and 8.1 billion  cubic meters of natural gas were produced in 1992. In 1993,  production fell to 22 million tonnes of oil and condensate and  6.5 billion cubic meters of gas.    Consumption stood at the level of 23 million tonnes of oil  and 20 billion cubic meters of gas.    For comparison: Nigeria, Venezuela, and Mexico have similar  levels of reserves. However, Mexico produces approximately six  times more than Kazakhstan, Venezuela--four times more, and  Nigeria--three times more.    The bulk of the proven reserves of oil and gas and  hypothetical reserves are located in the western part of  Kazakhstan: in Mangistau, Atyrau, West Kazakhstan, and  Aktyubinsk Oblasts; small reserves exist in Kzyl-Orda Oblast.    The reserves are distributed among 160 fields. However, only  58 fields are producing (10 of these fields hold about 80  percent of all reserves). The rest are not worked because they  fall into the category of resource fields (in keeping with the  Soviet system of reserve evaluation). It is possible that some  of these fields may be reclassified as profitable, and their  development may begin if they are reevaluated in keeping with  the American system.    Hypothetical reserves of oil are estimated to be 4,475  million tonnes on land and 3.5 billion tonnes on the shelf of  the Caspian Sea; hypothetical reserves of gas--5.9 and 2.0  trillion cubic meters, respectively, and hypothetical reserves  of condensate--1,635 million tonnes. These reserves have been  calculated for five oil-and gas-bearing basins. In addition,  there are nine sedimentation basins with oil and gas prospects  in the territory of Kazakhstan. This is a very important factor  because at present about 90 percent of all reserves are used for  development, and it is necessary to vigorously conduct  prospecting that at present is being gradually wound down for  lack of funds.    The fields are developed by two state holding companies with  the resources of territorial production associations. Some  fields, including the largest in Kazakhstan, Tengiz, have been  transferred for development to joint ventures with foreign  participation. Small fields that have not been developed  previously have been transferred to the jurisdiction of local  administrations.    Kazakhstan has three oil refineries: in Atyrau (using oil  from Kazakhstan), in Pavlodar (using oil from Russia), and in  Shymkent (using oil from Russia and Kazakhstan), as well as two  gas processing plants. However, the capacity of these plants and  the assortment of products manufactured by them are by far not  enough to meet the needs of the republic (their output meets  only slightly more than 70 percent of the republic's needs).    Take a look at the map of Kazakhstan. Oil production is  concentrated in the western part of the republic whereas two of  the main, relatively modern oil refineries are located in the  eastern part. The pipeline that feeds these oil refineries comes  from West Siberia along the Pavlodar-Shymkent line and then on  to Central Asia. To be sure, a pipeline from the Kumkor field  (Kzyl-Orda Oblast), which delivers about 1 million tonnes of oil  to the Shymkent oil refinery is connected to the former  pipeline. For a number of reasons, the Pavlodar Oil Refinery is  idle most of the time at present, whereas the Shymkent Oil  Refinery operates at hardly one-half of its capacity.    Yet another oil refinery in Atyrau has a stable supply of  raw  materials. However, it has long since become worn-out and  obsolete (the depth of refining comes to 56 percent and is at  the levels of the 1950's), while it is capable of processing  only about 5 million tonnes of raw material a year.    No oil refinery in Kazakhstan produces industrial oils,  although we do have fields with very valuable oil that is  shipped away as far as Yaroslavl specifically to produce oils.    Out of 22 million tonnes of oil produced last year, only 6  million tons were used within the republic. Where does the rest  of the oil go?    Some of the oil from Mangistau and Atyrau is used at the  Atyrau Oil Refinery; about 5 million tonnes is exported to  faraway foreign countries. Small amounts are delivered to CIS  countries, including up to 2 million tonnes, which in better  years were transported through the port of Aktau to Baku and  Makhachkala; a large proportion goes to Russia.    Therefore, the overall picture appears as follows: On the  pattern created in the times of the USSR, the entire flow of oil  and gas moved from east to west. Small hoses branched off this  stream in order to meet the needs of republics. It was not  important whether these republics had oil of their  own--everything was subordinated to the overall pattern. With  its own oil available, Kazakhstan was forced to use Siberian oil  while pumping further west its own oil located closer to the  western borders of the USSR.    The Kazakh oil and gas complex has been fully integrated  with  that of Russia. This is why we cannot produce more oil at the  fields even though we have an opportunity to do so. For this  reason, Kazakhstan, which has large oil reserves and produces 22  million tonnes a year, and in previous years up to 27 million  tonnes, cannot provide refinery products for itself. This fact  is at the very least surprising.    Now that the readers have a general idea of the oil and gas  complex, I can offer something like a conclusion with which some  might not agree.    Kazakhstan has a very disadvantageous location, which is  designated in the English language by the very felicitous and  precise term "land-locked" [word published in English]; this can  be translated as "locked by land." The significance of this for  the oil and gas industries is tremendous because in this case  access to hard-currency markets is much more complicated.    The reason hampering the development of the oil and gas  industries is found in the very structure of the oil and gas  complex or, more precisely, the way in which it developed during  Soviet times: It is comprehensive integration, which was quite  logical and perhaps justified at one time. However, the further  continuation of this structure and this situation makes it  possible for third countries, including Russia and Turkey, to  bring pressure to bear on Kazakhstan in order to achieve their  objectives. The issue of economic independence remains open  under such circumstances whereby other states have levers for  the most powerful economic influence at their disposal.</p>

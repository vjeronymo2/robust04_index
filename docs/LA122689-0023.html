			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: LOS ANGELES IS THE NO. 1 HIT ON RADIO ADVERTISING CHARTS  </P> <P> When FM rock station KQLZ, known as Pirate Radio, broadcast ads recently for a  Los Angeles ticket scalping agency, it received angry complaints from a few  listeners.  </P> <P> The ads were quickly killed. "Why accept a commercial if it's going to irritate  your listeners?" posed Scott Shannon, the station's program director and drive  time disc jockey. "If you're just doing it for the money, that's like  prostitution."  </P> <P> Los Angeles is one of the few radio markets in the country where many  advertisers are so eager to purchase air time that some stations can afford to  pick and choose their sponsors. Besides the ticket scalpers it rejected, KQLZ  routinely turns down a number of those fast-talking spots from auto insurance  companies. The station airs only four commercials an hour, some at a charge of  up to $1,500.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles is undeniably the healthiest radio market in the U.S. today," said  Lynn Anderson, president and general manager of one of the top-rated FM radio  stations, KIIS, which charges up to $2,000 for some one-minute commercials. "It  has experienced unprecedented growth for the past six to eight years. And I see  nothing that indicates that won't continue."  </P> <P> Now there's evidence that this growth will not only continue but also  accelerate throughout the 1990s. A new study of Los Angeles radio advertisers  spells out just how big the radio market has grown in the area -- and just who  the big-time advertisers are here.  </P> <P> The findings project that 1989 radio advertising revenues in the Los Angeles  area could surpass $400 million. The study of more than 800 advertisers is the  first commissioned in the radio industry. Although such studies have long been  available for television and print advertising, they have not been done on  radio spending until now.  </P> <P> "Radio is the Rodney Dangerfield of media," said Gordon Mason, president of the  Southern California Broadcasters Assn., which commissioned the new quarterly  survey compiled by the North Hollywood accounting firm of Miller, Kaplan, Arase  &amp; Co. "But in Los Angeles, the average person listens to radio at least  four hours a day. Here, a lot of people look at radio like it's a friend."  </P> <P> And the best friend of Los Angeles radio for the first nine months of 1989 was  Anheuser-Busch Inc., which spent more than $4.2 million on radio ads in the  Southland for its beer brands, according to George Nadel Rivin, an accountant  with the firm that compiled the study. During the same period, Lucky Stores  ranked second, spending upward of $3 million; GTE placed third by investing  more than $2.8 million.  </P> <P> "Radio advertising fits the life style in Southern California," said Chuck  Fruit, vice president of corporate media at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis.  "People in Los Angeles seem to always be outdoors -- maybe listening to their  radios at the beaches. Of course, that's not the case in most cities like, say,  St. Louis, where it's 15 degrees below zero. "  </P> <P> The bulk of Anheuser-Busch's radio spending in Los Angeles is pegged toward  sponsorship of professional sports teams -- the Dodgers, Angels, Rams, Raiders,  Lakers, Clippers and Kings. Anheuser-Busch also uses radio to target minority  audiences.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Lucky says it spends more than any other Los Angeles supermarket on  radio advertising for one reason. "A whole lot of people spend a whole lot of  time in their cars in Southern California," said Judy Decker, communications  manager for Lucky Stores Inc. "Radio allows us to concentrate on quickly  promoting special prices on items."  </P> <P> But unlike most cities, where food and beverage companies are the biggest radio  advertisers, the largest advertising category in Los Angeles is auto dealers  and manufacturers. In fact, the broadcasters association estimates that 13.3%  of all radio advertising in Los Angeles is purchased by auto-related companies.  </P> <P> Demand for radio time by car makers -- and other advertisers -- has helped  bolster the value of local radio stations by many millions of dollars.  Recently, KJOI sold for $79 million, quite a leap from the $18.5 million it was  purchased for in 1984.  </P> <P> Price tags like that, however, are placing enormous pressures on stations to  rank near the top in the ratings. "The cost of being in the radio business in  Los Angeles has escalated incredibly," KIIS' Anderson said. "There is a heavy  price to pay for playing in L.A."  </P> <P> Although the Los Angeles radio market may be enjoying a heyday, executives in  the New York market say not to count them out. "There is a general perception  that Los Angeles is a hotter radio market than New York," said Maurie Webster,  president of the trade group New York Market Radio Broadcasters Assn. "But if  you take all the people in New York who listen to radio during morning drive  time and subtracted from that all the people from Los Angeles who do the same,  the number left over is slightly larger than the population of Detroit."  </P> <P> To get that point across, the New York radio trade group recently ran an ad in  the monthly newsletter published by the Los Angeles broadcasters group. The ad  tried to convince advertisers that the New York radio market "outperforms" the  Los Angeles market.  </P> <P> But the radio rivals in Los Angeles laugh at all this. "New York may be No. 1  in population," responds Mason, "but where it counts -- in the bankbook --  we're still No. 1."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agency Tastes Success, Lands Second Account  </P> <P> Here's one agency that ended its yearlong business drought appropriately -- it  landed a mineral water account.  </P> <P> Campbell &amp; Wagman Inc., the 3-year-old Los Angeles firm that has relied  almost exclusively on First Interstate Bancorp for its business, last week won  the estimated $3-million to $5-million Vittel Imports account.  </P> <P> "For us to be successful in the long run, we know we can't be reliant on a  single client," said Craig Campbell, president of Campbell &amp; Wagman. About  this time last year, the agency lost the $22-million Marshall's Department  Store business. That left it with just one client besides First Interstate --  Sundale Beverages, a maker of fruit juices for children.  </P> <P> Vittel -- one of the largest producers of bottled water in the world -- is a  latecomer to the $3-billion U.S. bottled water market. Vittel Imports, which  recently moved its North American headquarters to Newport Beach, is up against  such giants as Perrier and Evian.  </P> <P> The Vittel campaign, expected to break in February, will likely focus on the  health benefits and good taste of the water, Campbell said. And he hopes his  agency can use this win of Nestle-owned Vittel as a springboard for picking up  more packaged goods clients.  </P> <P> How did the agency celebrate the win? Said Campbell, "We closed down the  switchboard and served Vittel to everyone."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Giveaway Assures That Aspen Smells of Aspen  </P> <P> If you know any men living in Aspen, chances are they're smelling spiffy today.  </P> <P> Last week, virtually every man living in that city -- about 4,000 or so -- was  mailed a $14 bottle of cologne from the maker of a new men's fragrance named,  you guessed it, Aspen.  </P> <P> Behind this pungent promotion is Chicago-based Quintessence Inc., which also  makes such fragrances as Jovan and Dare.  </P> <P> Why did the fragrance company play Santa Claus? "The fact is, it's named  Aspen," said Greta DeBofsky, vice president of public relations at  Quintessence. "We at least wanted the people of Aspen to know about it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ad Campaign Has Even a Stone-Face Smiling  </P> <P> First, there was the Prudential rock. Now, along comes the HomeFed Bank stone.  </P> <P> To be precise: stone statues. And to be more precise: three giant statues that  look like stone but are actually made from masonry.  </P> <P> These colossal statues will soon appear on a TV screen near you. Behind it all  is a $10-million campaign for the newly renamed thrift's adjustable certificate  of deposit, which, as the commercials painstakingly point out, are not "carved  in stone."  </P> <P> If a saver buys a nine-month CD at HomeFed and the S&amp;L offers a better rate  during that period, he or she may ask HomeFed to bump up its rate. The Los  Angeles agency behind the campaign is Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates, which  also creates ads for Honda. The 14-foot stone statues were created by a special  effects firm in Pasadena.  </P> <P> In the TV spot, one statue even appears to smile -- a stunt accomplished by two  men hidden inside the statue who stretch its rubberized lips, said Larry  Postaer, co-founder of Rubin Postaer. The figures are modeled after those found  in the Easter Islands in the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> Of course, the ads weren't filmed in the Easter Islands, but in Simi Valley.  And the crew gave the three statues nicknames -- Manny, Moe and Jack -- after  those familiar Pep Boys TV spots.  </P> <P> Wondering which one is the smiling statue? Moe, of course.  </P> <P> </P> <P> L.A.

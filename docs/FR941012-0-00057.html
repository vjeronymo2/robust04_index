			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Training.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the proposed rule generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported the need for training. Several commenters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, raised specific questions about particular training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues. As a result, OSHA requested in the hearing notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further comment on the following training issues: Effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of training, sufficiency of training, and portability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Effective date for training.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA would have required employers to be in compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all provisions of the final logging standard within 60 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of publication of the rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule did not provide extended compliance time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers to familiarize themselves with the standard and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop and conduct training. Some commenters said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional time to meet the training requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule was unnecessary (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13; Tr. OR 343). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters said that in many logging establishments training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is already being provided and that employers would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require significant time to incorporate the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training requirements into their ongoing programs. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other commenters argued that the effective date for training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be delayed because additional time was necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop the required training program and to train employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 5&hyph;2, 5&hyph;27, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;2; Tr. W2 243&hyph;44). Commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed various effective dates for training. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Northeastern Loggers Association, Inc., recommended a 2-year phase-in of the training requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;2). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Pulpwood Association, Inc. (APA), however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported a shorter six-month phase-in period: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Safety training programs for loggers are largely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific to a function (for example, proper felling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technique). A fully comprehensive training package  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will have to be developed to meet the training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. APA is attempting to develop training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and have them available by the end of 1989.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* APA will seek OSHA staff review of its training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program as it is developed. We'd like a brief delay in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement, just long enough for us to have something  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for employers (Ex. 5&hyph;27).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the hearing there was little testimony about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delaying the effective date for training. Mr. Doug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Domenech, testifying on behalf of APA, repeated APA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position that employers should be given some additional time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to comply with training requirements:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The training is a very needed thing and, unfortunately,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we just don't have the infrastructure to provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training. That's why *&blank;*&blank;* we *&blank;*&blank;* hope that OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will give some kind of variance on time before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citations are delivered because it's just not out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there. If loggers had to comply with a training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement today, they'd all be cited (Tr. W2 243&hyph;44). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the same time, however, Mr. Alex Hansen, of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Associated Oregon Loggers, Inc. (AOL), testified that Oregon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loggers already were in compliance with the training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions contained in the proposed rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As far as we're concerned in Oregon, you could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the training tomorrow. We already have it in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place. We don't have a problem with it. We're  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advocates of safety training in the woods. I know some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other states have some problems. They haven't been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doing it or maybe not as strenuous as the Oregon rules,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and I understand their problems, but as far as our association is concerned, if you pass it tomorrow, we're in compliance (Tr. OR 343).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

On that occasion, views  were exchanged on the current situation in the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia and the region and also on the development  of friendly relations between the two countries.    The American congressmen expressed particular pleasure over  the successful cooperation with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  and the Macedonian Government. The American side reiterated its  interest in the preservation of peace and stability in the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In the course of the  talks yesterday, President Gligorov informed his American guests  about a Macedonian request to join NATO, particularly to join  the Partnership for Peace initiative. This would be, Gligorov  said, an important step forward in the prevention of the spread  of war to the south of the Balkans and in securing a higher  level of stability and security in the region.    In his statement for the local state television, Congressman  Murphy [title as received] expressed readiness to deploy fresh  additional U.S. Army forces in the UN peace mission, but  according to UNPROFOR, there is no reason for such a move.</p>

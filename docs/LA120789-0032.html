			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> Two of seven escapees from the crowded County Jail in Chula Vista have been  recaptured, the Sheriff's Department said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The prisoners, among 123 in Module 3A, designed for 24 inmates, broke out of  the South Bay jail Tuesday by covering their clothed bodies with hand lotion  and squeezing through a 6-inch window opening. Using tied-together bed sheets,  they then shinnied down 80 feet to flee, spokesman Jerry Snow said.  </P> <P> Jail officials were notified that the inmates had escaped when they received  calls at 6:27 p.m. from parents who said their children playing near the  complex on South 2nd Avenue saw inmates wearing blue uniforms. A lockdown was  ordered a minute later, spokeswoman Lorraine Truitt said.  </P> <P> Deputies from the jail along with Chula Vista police searched the area by car  and saw the fugitives, Truitt said.  </P> <P> Jose S. Urquieta, 34, and Antonio L. Gonzalez, 22, both serving time for auto  theft were captured that night and taken back to the jail, Truitt said.  </P> <P> The remaining five have not been captured, Truitt said Wednesday evening.  </P> <P> Prison officials blamed the escape on the crowding and understaffing. The jail,  intended for 192 prisoners, houses 882.  </P> <P> Still at large late Wednesday were Manuel A. Canpasco, 30, serving time for  possession of narcotics; Porfilio Cruz, 24, held for parole violation; Gerardo  Cortez, 22, awaiting trial on charges of possession of stolen property; George  Fernandez, 20, held on burglary charges and violation of probation, and Martin  C. Wiggins, 25, held without bail on parole violation and two counts of  burglary.  </P></p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Observer: Greek tug of war The Russian navy has just sent out an urgent SOS. Two of the biggest salvage tugs in the world have gone missing and it wants them back. If anyone spots them please contact V Eryomin, deputy CINC of the Russian navy in Moscow. In fact the two tugs - Giant and Challenger - are not hard to find. They are holed up in Greece where they are the showpieces of the Tsavliris brothers' fast growing salvage fleet. The family announced the acquisition back in March. However, the Russian navy believes it still owns the tugs and has warned international banks against taking out mortgages on the vessels. Like much else in Russia, it is all the fault of private enterprise. To earn extra money, the Russian navy leased the tugs to a privately-run shipping company and matters seem to have got a bit out of hand. According to a circular that the Russians have sent to international banks, the tugs were then re-registered in Malta with fake documents and have now resurfaced in the Tsavliris fleet. Understandably, the Tsavliris family is rather upset by the broadside from the Russian navy. 'We are bona fide operators. We cannot afford not to be,' says George Tsavliris, adding that 'we have dotted every I and crossed every T'. Let's hope that the Russian navy doesn't take the law into its own hands and send one of its out-of-work battleships to settle the dispute.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Democratic Alliance issued in Tirana on 15 </F> January: "We Accuse the Democratic Party's Government of a  Renewed 2 April in Shkoder"]    [Text] The failed attempt by a group organized by the  Democratic Party [PD] to disrupt the Democratic Alliance [AD]  meeting with the Shkoder electorate in the Migjeni Theater in  the city of Shkoder on 14 January ended tragically in the  shooting by PD provocateurs of Gjovalin Cekini, a 26-year-old AD  member. On the basis of the fact that this fascist act is a  result of the state's oppressive policies against the AD as the  most determined and credible opposition group, seeing here a  dangerous escalation of the mthods of political struggle used by  the ruling party, and convinced that the Albanian nation has  chosen the path of tolerance and dialogue in building democracy,  the AD accuses:    1. the ruling PD of organizing systematic verbal and  physical violence against the AD, illegally making use of the  institutions of the Albanian state;    -- the parliament of limiting political and other freedoms  in Albania by not recognizing the AD parliamentary group and by  approving antidemocratic laws;    -- Radio-Television, which is used as an instrument of  verbal  violence against the AD, of not giving the AD a single  opportunity to speak for itself;    -- the National Intelligence Service of placing under  surveillance and attempting to frame AD leaders;    -- the police of being under orders to tear down AD  propaganda posters.    The PD's orders are to persecute and dismiss from their jobs  AD members and sympathizers and to paralyze its normal politics  activity, impeding it by means of hooliganism.    2. The AD accuses PD Deputy Chairman Ali Spahiu of being the  direct organizer of the group of hooligans and criminals that  intervened illegally, disrupted the AD meeting in Shkoder, and  finally carried out the murder of Gjovalin Cekini.    3. The AD accuses Sali Berisha, president of the republic,  by approving similar activities by the same group at the time of  the Socialist Party leader's visit to the same city a few months  ago, of encouraging the deeds of these criminals who commuted  this murder with his name in their mouths.    4. The AD accuses Prime Minister Meksi and his government,  by putting the state authorities under the PD and the influence  of criminals, of paralyzing the capacities of the forces of  order and the law, thus becoming responsible for a new 2 April  in Shkoder. This government, with its illegal privatization, is  supporting criminals and thieves to create support for its rule.    5. The AD accuses Albanian Radio-Television and its  directors Skender Bucpapaj and Qemal Sakajeva of inspiring a  climate of hostility and terror through its attacks and slanders  against the AD and its portrayal on the screen of hooligans as  heroes in obstructing the political activities of parties.    The AD informs the Albanian public that the killing of  Gjovalin Cekini is the murder of one of their sons who had  struggled for true democracy and human rights since before  December 1990. The AD calls on Albanians not to forget this  name, not to be scared by hooligans and criminals, and not to  retreat a single step on the road on which we embarked in  December 1990. The AD calls on its members and supporters  throughout Albania to continue on the road of democracy through  dialogue and peaceful methods, to keep cool heads, and to avoid  all kinds of provocations intended to encourage violent  reactions. Dialogue and tolerance are our weapons. The use of  guns and terror of any kind will end in failure. In the hope  that ideals of December still occupy a place in the minds and  hearts of those in power and of ordinary PD members, the AD  calls on these people to dissociate themselves from the world of  crime and corruption that surrounds them. The AD wishes to draw  the attention of the European Community and democratic states to  the need to help and support Albania, asking them to call on  President Berisha and Prime Minister Meksi to respect democratic  standards in Albania.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MARMONTE LEAGUE  </P> <P> Channel Islands 13, Agoura 10 -- An inspired Channel Islands defense stopped  Agoura running back Kurt Klotz on the one-foot line with one minute to play,  preserving a victory at Agoura.  </P> <P> With five minutes to play, Agoura drove from its 31 to the Channel Islands'  five and seemed ready to seize the lead.  </P> <P> But three consecutive running plays only moved the ball to the one, setting up  the final attempt.  </P> <P> Lamont Pearson dashed 79 yards for the Raiders' go-ahead touchdown late in the  third quarter. Pearson finished with 106 yards in 11 carries.  </P> <P> Agoura (5-3, 2-3) took a 10-7 lead with 3:51 to play in the first half on a  nine-yard run by quarterback Sean Fitzgerald, who completed 11 of 19 for 173  yards.

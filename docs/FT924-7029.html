			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (6): Battle for change - Reforms are held in a bureaucratic tug of war A BUREAUCRATIC struggle being waged between the country's three leading economic agencies will largely determine the future of South Korea's financial liberalisation programme. The Economic Planning Board (EPB), traditionally the senior economic agency in the government, favours an accelerated push for financial liberalisation. But the powerful Ministry of Finance (MOF) is resisting rapid change and wants to maintain control over the financial system. Caught in the middle of the dispute is the Bank of Korea (BOK), the central bank, which has become a proponent of financial reform in a bid to gain independence from the MOF, its political master. The EPB has been the most influential state economic agency since it was established in 1961 by President Park Chung-hee to supervise South Korea's industrialisation programme. It played the central role in South Korea's dirigiste economy over the next three decades, drawing up five-year plans that determined the country's industrial structure. EPB's strength reflected the concentration of power within the Blue House, the executive mansion, under Presidents Park and Chun Doo-hwan. One indication of its senior position in the official hierarchy is that the EPB director is also automatically the deputy prime minister, while the EPB headquarters physically dominates the Kwachon government complex, overlooking the other economic ministries from its hilltop location. But the EPB's power has waned under President Roh Tae-woo who has favoured decentralising power to the individual ministries as part of the country's democratisation process. Mr Roh, who likes foreign policy, has also paid less attention to economic issues than his predecessors. 'The EPB has become an institution without a role as economic planning becomes less important,' says one western diplomat. 'It is becoming more academic in its thinking and more liberal in its policy recommendations, including financial liberalisation.' The case for financial liberalisation within the EPB is supported by the fact that many of its senior staff were educated at US universities and have been influenced by market-based economic theories. The MOF gained influence at the EPB's expense, consolidating its already powerful position in the Korean bureaucracy. Critics charge that the MOF is becoming the centre of resistance to financial reform because its officials are reluctant to relinquish the power they wield. Under the current regulated financial system, the MOF determines the allocation of credit to industry, decides what companies can borrow funds from abroad and who will lead the nation's banks. Due to their influence, MOF officials can also find secure jobs in the financial sector once they retire from government. 'Retired MOF officials won't have any place to go to under financial liberalisation,' said one Korean financial analyst. MOF officials disagree. 'MOF is being blamed more than it ought to be,' says Mr Oum Bong-sung, an advisor to the Finance Minister. 'Our critics are unaware of the practical difficulties of financial liberalisation.' But some of the most harsh comments within the MOF are reserved for the BOK. Tensions between the two agencies have grown in the past few years as the BOK attempts to assert its independence from the MOF. The BOK is now one of the most tightly controlled central banks in the world, according to a recent study by the World Bank, which ranked it as 42nd out of 56 central banks surveyed in terms of independence. 'The government favours keeping control over both fiscal and monetary policies, so it wants continued co-ordination between MOF and the BOK,' explains one MOF official. The government has often interferred in BOK operations, frequently replacing its governors and encouraging an expansion of the money supply in an attempt to boost economic growth. But Mr Cho Soon, the new BOK governor appointed in March, has become outspoken in criticising the government and demanding financial reform. Mr Cho was head of the EPB between 1988 and 1990, but was forced to resign because his strong views on economic deregulation angered politicians and the business sector. His appointment as BOK governor was consequently considered something of a surprise and he has lived up to his reputation for independence. Earlier this year, he successfully fought to tighten the money supply in a bid to lower the inflation rate and restore stability to the country's overheated economy. He is now battling with the MOF in pushing for faster deregulation of interest rates. Interest rate deregulation would improve the BOK's ability to control the money supply and fight inflation, while giving it a more independent role through its exercise of open market mechanisms. It would also deprive the MOF of its power to allocate cheap credit to favoured industries - one of its most cherished privileges. MOF announced last year that it would deregulate interest rates in four stages by the end of the century. The bank and the ministry are now arguing about when to introduce the second stage - scheduled by the MOF for between last July and the end of 1993 - considered crucial since it frees most lending rates. With interest rates recently falling sharply, the bank believes now is the time to launch the second stage. But the MOF remains cautious, saying the early introduction of the second phase would cause interest rates to jump. Most analysts believe, however, that this will not happen since corporate demand for funds is falling as many industries curb investment because of excess production capacity. Instead, the MOF's resistance is considered symbolic of its innate conservatism. It wants to avoid any risk of an interest rate rise before the presidential election in December. The MOF is still considered strong enough to resist pressure from the EPB and the BOK on speeding up financial reform. Nevertheless, the election of South Korea's next president could alter the outcome of the bureaucratic struggle. Mr Kim Young-sam of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) is favoured to win the election. Although Mr Kim admits to a lack of economic expertise, some of his advisors are considered strong reformers of the financial system. Their ability to accelerate financial liberalisation will depend on whether Mr Kim can reassert the power of the Blue House over the bureaucracy in economic affairs. Some doubt that Mr Kim can succeed, since his base of support within the ruling party is small, making it difficult to oust leading economic officials appointed by the Roh administration.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: GrandMet The market was unsettled yesterday by GrandMet's deluge of differing accounting figures - and little wonder. The company has 'lost' Pounds 500m of its historic 1991 profits and two-thirds of its reported earnings per share. This apparently alarming restatement does not stem from indulgence in GrandMet's drinks products; rather it reflects the sober reality of the new accounting regime which demands that most extraordinary charges are taken above the line. The market has griped about GrandMet's accounting policies in the past. So despite the initial shock, greater transparency may help project the company more favourably in future. The smoke surrounding the accounts - and the property writedowns at the now peripheral Inntrepreneur joint venture - has obscured GrandMet's continuing evolution from opportunistic asset trader into energetic manager of food and drinks brands. GrandMet's US food business may have proved worryingly volatile last year with a vegetable glut wiping the smile from the jolly Green Giant business. But GrandMet's drinks business is resilient and the US economy may be looking up. Currency translation gains alone could contribute Pounds 50m this year although a sticky-fingered president-elect may decide to pocket some of the surplus if his half-promised tax on foreign corporations materialises.</p>

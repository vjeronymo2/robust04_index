			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  secretary general, commented on his cooperation with Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] member Michio Watanabe, former deputy  prime minister and foreign minister, in a Fuji Television  program on 22 April. Ozawa indicated his intention to continue  to seek a cooperative relationship with Watanabe in the future  on the condition that Watanabe leaves the LDP. He said:  "Allying with the LDP runs counter to our spirit (and our ideas  upon forming Shinseito). However, I still hope to act with him  if he secedes from the LDP."    In criticizing the idea of "forming a coalition between the  LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan" while excluding  Shinseito, which is an idea that once cropped up in the process  of establishing the next administration, Ozawa stated, "This  concept lacks the right recognition of the times." In warning  these parties, Ozawa said: "This is nothing other than a  suicidal act. Why do they want to do this?"</p>

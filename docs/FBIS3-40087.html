Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist, a great proletarian  revolutionary, strategist, and theoretician, and the great  leader of our entire party, entire armed forces and all  nationalities throughout the land. He performed immortal feats  in the founding and development of our party and the Chinese  People's Liberation Army [PLA], in the victory of the  revolutionary cause of the people of all nationalities in China,  in the founding of the People's Republic of China, and in the  development of China's socialist cause. He made major  contributions to the emancipation of the oppressed peoples of  the world and to the cause of human progress. Today, when the  socialist modernization of our great motherland is striding  proudly ahead, is thriving, and is constantly winning great  victories, when the Chinese people are filled with pride and  elation, are becoming more prosperous with each passing day, and  are proudly and steadfastly taking their place among the  people's of the world, we more deeply cherish that great son of  the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. We will forever remember  the arduous pioneering work and the great achievements in  China's revolution and construction performed by the older  generation of proletarian revolutions represented by Comrade Mao  Zedong.    From the time he was a young man, Comrade Mao Zedong devoted  himself to the Chinese revolution, and he fought for it his  whole life long. Comrade Mao Zedong was one of the founders of  our party, and the principal founder of our glorious People's  Liberation Army. Following the collapse of the Great Revolution  [1924-1927], he led the Autumn Harvest Uprising [1927] forces  into Jinggangshan, where he founded the first rural  revolutionary base under leadership of the party. During the  most difficult days of the Chinese revolution, he found the  correct revolutionary road, formulated a correct overall  strategy, and gradually fashioned a whole body of correct  theories and tactics. Thus, he turned defeat in the revolution  into victory. Beginning with the Tsun-i Conference in 1935,  Comrade Mao Zedong became the nucleus of our party's first  generation central leadership collective, thereby ensuring that  the Chinese revolution went steadily from victory to victory.    We shall never forget that but for Comrade Mao Zedong there  would be no new China. In China's struggle to gain a magnificent  victory in the new democratic revolution, it was Comrade Mao  Zedong's correct leadership, the Communist Party of China that  he headed, and the tremendous theoretical bravery and spirit of  courageous struggle that opened a road that led from the  countryside surrounding the cities to ultimate victory  throughout the country. It was he who led the whole party and  the people of the whole country through 22 years of arduous and  brilliant people's revolutionary war that included the great  land revolution war, the War of Resistance to Japan, the war of  liberation, and ultimately the overthrow of the three big  mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratism for the  opening of a new era in China's history. In his connection,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping paid high tribute when he said: "Without  Comrade Mao Zedong's outstanding leadership, it is extremely  likely that the Chinese Revolution would still not be  victorious. Thus, ...our party would still be struggling  painfully in darkness. Therefore, to say that without Chairman  Mao there would be no new China is no exaggeration at all." The  founding of New China marks the Chinese' people's farewell to  100 years of humiliation. It marks the time when the Chinese  people stood up. This immortal contribution of Chairman Mao  Zedong will forever be the pride of the Chinese people.    We can never forget that without Comrade Mao Zedong,  socialism would not have been founded in China. It was under the  correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong that Chairman Mao  Zedong and his comrades in arms took advantage of the economic  and political conditions for making a transition to socialism  that victory in the new democratic revolution provided for the  adoption of a policy of simultaneous socialist industrialization  and socialist transformation, and a concrete policy of a gradual  change in private ownership of the means of production. They  were able to solve both theoretically and practically the  daunting task of building a socialist system in such a populous  and both economically and culturally backward large oriental  country. This was the most profound and most magnificent  socialist transformation in China's history. It greatly  emancipated social production forces, and it lay a solid  foundation for China's progress and development, thereby  enabling new China very rapidly to gain a foothold immediately  following its founding, and to initiate great socialist  undertakings. Regarding this magnificent historical achievement  of Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The success  achieved in our socialist transformation is very wonderful. This  is a major contribution to Marxism-Leninism of Comrade Mao  Zedong."    These two major acts of leading the Chinese people, who  account for one-fourth of the world's population, in standing  up, and leading the Chinese people in taking the socialist path  influenced and changed China's and the world's historical  course. This was Comrade Mao Zedong's most outstanding  historical achievement for the people of China.    Comrade Mao Zedong also led the entire party and the people  of the whole country in exploring a path of socialist  construction suited to China's circumstances. Following founding  of the people's republic -- and particularly following the  decisive victories gained in socialist transformation -- as  large scale economic construction unfolded and experience was  gained, and as some shortcomings, mistakes, and the taking of a  tortuous road came to light in the USSR's economic construction,  acting on the basis of China's circumstances and our party's  experience in consistently maintaining independence and keeping  the initiative in its own hands, Comrade Mao Zedong courageously  suggested using the Soviet Union's experience as an object  lesson in the task of exploring a path of socialist construction  suited to China's circumstances. In early 1956, he proceeded  from investigation and study, gathering together the wisdom of  the entire party to propose the correct handling of 10 major  relationships, which emphasized the rallying of all positive  elements to build China into a powerful socialist nation. In  1957, he raised social contradictions of two different  characters in socialism that must be correctly differentiated  and handled. He made correct handling of contradictions among  the people the main theme in the nation's political life. In  1958, he further called for a change of work emphasis to  technological revolution and cultural revolution. He said,  "self-reliance is primary; gaining foreign assistance is  secondary. The eradication of superstition, maintaining  independence and keeping initiative in our own hands in carrying  out a revolution in industry, agriculture, and technology, and a  cultural revolution, overthrowing a slavish mentality, burying  dogmatism, and diligently studying good foreign experiences  while also studying bad foreign experiences -- using them as  object lessons -- is our line." It must be said that this  analysis was correct at the outset. Putting forth these ideas  was valuable and it held long-term guiding significance.  Unhappily, because of an overestimation of the effect of  international and domestic class struggle, and because of the  arrogance and anxiousness to succeed that a succession of  tremendous victories engendered, guided by mistaken "leftist"  ideology after the last half of 1957, the application of this  analysis was not successful, and even veered in a wrong  direction. Both the party and the people paid a grievous price  for this. However, emphasis on taking a socialist road of  construction in keeping with China's circumstances as a basic  spirit and fundamental direction remains a principle that we  should forever follow.    Comrade Mao Zedong was a great man of the age, but he was  not  a perfect man. During the later years of his life, he made  serious mistakes, but they were, after all, mistakes that a  great proletarian revolutionary makes. Moreover, even during the  final several years of Comrade Mao Zedong's life, when his  mistakes were already very serious, he still kept a watchful eye  on the motherland's independence and security. He correctly  grasped new changes in the world situation; he led the party and  the people in withstanding all hegemonist pressures; and he  produced a new pattern for China's foreign relations. The Sixth  Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee made a full  and penetrating evaluation of Comrade Mao Zedong's historical  position in "Decisions on Various Historical Problems Since  Founding of the People's Republic." It said that "Taking his  life as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far  surpassed his errors. His accomplishments are primary; his  mistakes are secondary." His historic contributions, and his  scientific writings and correct ideology have struck deep roots  in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people throughout the  country. Today, our whole party, whole armed forces, and all  nationalities throughout the country solemnly commemorate  Comrade Mao Zedong's centenary. This is a response from the  heart of the Party, the heart of the armed forces, and the  hearts of the people. He will forever be revered and remembered  by the whole party, the whole armed forces, and all  nationalities throughout the whole country.    In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong's centenary, more  important than recalling his immortal contributions and  expressing reverence for him is the maintenance and development  of Mao Zedong Thought to expand and develop the endeavors he did  not complete.    The Mao Zedong Thought of more than half a century is a  scientific guiding ideology fashioned by the CPC, of which  Comrade Mao Zedong was the leading representative, according to  basic principles of Marxism-Leninism to meet China's  circumstances. It is a product of the blending of the general  principles of Marxism-Leninism with concrete practice in the  Chinese revolution. It is the application and development of  Marxism-Leninism in China. It is the theoretical principles  pertaining to the Chinese revolution validated through practice  and the summarization of experiences. It is the crystallization  of the collective wisdom of the CPC. Numerous outstanding CPC  leaders have made major contributions to its formation and  development. Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific works epitomize it.  Mao Zedong Thought is an integrated scientific system that is  extremely rich in substance, including philosophical, political,  economic, military, cultural, educational, and diplomatic  theoretical principles, precepts, and scientific methods. In  particular, its theories on new democratic revolution, its  theories on policies and tactics, its theories on ideological  and political work and on cultural work, and its theories on  party building are all innovative theoretical enrichments and  development of Marxism-Leninism. They are the living soul of Mao  Zedong Thought. They are the standpoint, the point of view and  the methods that run through all of the foregoing integral  parts. They have three basic aspects, namely, seeking truth in  facts, the mass line, and maintenance of independence and  retaining the initiative in one's own hands. They are the  concrete application of dialectical materialism and historical  materialism to all proletarian political party work, and they  are the distinctive standpoints, points of view and methods of  Communist Party of China members formed through long and arduous  struggle in China's revolution. As scientific truths, the  standpoint, points of view, and methods of Mao Zedong Thought  will always be our guide for action. Numerous of their important  points of view and expositions combine basic Marxist-Leninist  principles with China's concrete realities. They are the  thoughts behind the creation of China's own path of revolution  and construction. They are the thoughts behind the Communist  Party being the leadership nucleus for the people of the whole  country and that only socialism can save China. They are the  thoughts behind the founding and consolidation of a CPC-led  people's democratic dictatorship republic. They are the thoughts  behind the correct handling of contradictions among the people,  for rallying all positive elements, for uniting all forces that  can be united, and for building a great socialist power. They  are the thoughts behind the founding and development of a  patriotic united front. They are the thoughts behind maintenance  of independence and retention of the initiative in one's own  hands, for self-reliance, for arduous struggle, for unceasing  efforts to become stronger, and for standing on one's own two  feet among the people's of the world. They are the thoughts  behind the people being the power that creates history, for  maintenance of unity and reliance on the masses of people, and  for wholeheartedly serving the people. They are the thoughts  behind maintaining and carrying forward the linking of theory  and practice, for the superb work style of maintaining close  links with the masses, and for criticism and self-criticism.  They are the thoughts behind comprehensive improvement of party  building, particularly improvement of the party's building of  ideology. They are the thoughts behind the people's armed forces  and people's war. Today, they still radiate truth. They still  play an extremely important guiding role in our work today and  in the future.    Mao Zedong Thought is our party's precious spiritual wealth.  During the course of long struggle, comrades throughout the  party have drawn wisdom and strength from Comrade Mao Zedong and  Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured generation  after generation of party leaders and large numbers of cadres.  It has educated the people of the whole country and, in the  course of transforming China, it has become a tremendous  material force. Therefore, we must treasure and cherish the  precious spiritual wealth that is Mao Zedong Thought. As Comrade  Deng Xiaoping said: "Generation after generation, we must raise  high and safeguard this glorious and magnificent banner.  Generation after generation, we must use correct and complete  Mao Zedong Thought to guide our whole party, our whole armed  forces, and our whole people, and to advance victoriously the  cause of the party and socialism, and the international  communist movement. Moreover, to do this, we must diligently  study and apply the standpoint, point of view, and methods of  Mao Zedong Thought to the study of new circumstances that occur  during practice, to solve new problems, using new principles and  new conclusions consistent with realities to enrich and develop  our party's theory to ensure that our activities continue to  move forward on the scientific path of Marxism-Leninism and Mao  Zedong Thought.    Comrades. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party  Central Committee, our party has maintained and developed Mao  Zedong Thought in the active exploration of a road for building  socialism that meets China's circumstances, making tremendous  achievements thereby. The most important of these achievements  has been finally finding the way to build a distinctively  Chinese brand of socialism that Comrade Mao Zedong sought but  did not find during those years, and to fashion Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building a distinctively Chinese brand of  socialism. This is a process of combining Marxism and Chinese  realities. It is continuing to find ways for China's new  democratic revolution to bring about the second historical leap  after the first historical leap. Taking our own road to build a  distinctively Chinese brand of socialism is a road that must be  taken for the development of China's society. It is a road that  China must take to move toward prosperity, wealth, strength, and  to stand on its own two feet among the people's of the world.  Right now, diligent study of the newly published Volume 3 of  Deng Xiaoping's Selected Works, to striving to  understand Deng Xiaoping's theories about the building of a  distinctively Chinese brand of socialism, and translating them  into a tremendous "material force" to win new victories in the  cause of building a socialism that is distinctively Chinese is  to use real actions to maintain and develop Mao Zedong Thought.    Fifteen years ago, the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Party  Central Committee formed the Central Committee leadership  collective of which Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the nucleus. This  collective set the guiding policy of emancipating thinking,  using one's head, seeking truth from facts, and uniting as one  to look ahead. It firmly rejected the mistaken "leftist" policy  of "taking class struggle as the key link," which is not  appropriate to a socialist society, and it changed the party's  and the state's work emphasis to economic construction, thereby  bringing about a great historical change that ushered in a new  era in the development of the socialist cause in China.    The most distinctive feature of the new area is reform and  opening up to the outside world. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the  architect of China's socialist reform and opening up to the  outside world, and its modernization. As the nucleus of the  party's second generation leadership collective during the new  era of reform and opening up to the outside world and socialist  modernization, his most outstanding contributions have been not  only leading our party and nation out of the profound  catastrophe of the Great Cultural Revolution, but also using his  profound understanding of contemporary China and the world to  put the party and the national again in the forefront of the  trend of the times, and drawing up a brand new and magnificent  blueprint for the Chinese people to take their place among the  peoples of the world with greater strength. His feet firmly  planted on the good earth of China, he oriented toward the  world. He looked squarely at China's present realities and cast  his eyes on the future. In the process of studying new  situations and solving new problems, he conceived and designed  with great foresight a whole development strategy that is  distinctively Chinese in character. In brilliantly leading the  Chinese people in reform, opening up to the outside world, and  modernization, he conducted an arduous and unflagging  theoretical exploration. He respected practice, and he respected  the masses. He was always concerned about the rights, interests,  and hopes of the broadest masses of people. He was adept at  capsulizing the experiences and creativity of the masses. He  keenly understood the pulse and the moment of the times. He both  continued what predecessors had done and broke with outmoded  conventions. He exhibited tremendous political courage in  opening new roads for the building of socialism, and tremendous  theoretical boldness in blazing new realms of Marxism to make  major historical contributions to the founding of distinctively  Chinese socialist theory that brought Marxist theory to new  heights in contemporary China. He is the originator of the  theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively  Chinese brand of socialism occurred under historical conditions  in which peace and development became the main themes of the  age. In the course of China's reform and opening up to the  outside world, and its modernization, he summarized the  historical experiences of socialist victories and reverses in  China, and borrowed from the historical experiences of the  waxing and waning, and the success and failure of socialism in  other countries to fashion and develop this theory. It is a  product of Marxist-Leninist basic principles and contemporary  Chinese realities combined with the character of the age. It is  a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the whole party  and the people of the whole country. It has a distinctive  character of the time. This theory provides, for the first time,  a preliminary answer fairly systematically to a series of basic  questions such as how to build socialism in a country that is as  economically and culturally relatively backward as China, and  how to consolidate and develop socialism. It employs new ideas  and points of view to carry on, enrich, and develop Mao Zedong  Thought. It is the newest product of the linking of Marxism to  Chinese realities. It is contemporary Chinese Marxism.    It was under guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism that China's  reform and opening up to the outside world, and its socialist  modernization during the past 15 years scored tremendous  achievements that attracted the attention of the world, that the  people's standard of living improved markedly, and that the  party's endeavors increasingly gained the support of the people.  It was because practice showed this theory to be correct and a  scientific guide for our activities, that the 14th Party  Congress explicitly made it the party's guiding thought. The  14th Party Congress' call for the use of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism to  arm the whole party is urgently required for moving ahead with  the great undertaking of reform and opening up to the outside  world, and socialist modernization. It is an important measure  for enhancing and improving the building of the party in the new  era, and it is also a basic guarantee for maintaining the  party's basic line without wavering for 100 years. The recently  published third volume of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, and the second volume, which was published 10  years ago, assemble the most important and the most original  works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping in shaping and developing the  theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism.  They provide the finest teaching materials and the most powerful  weapons for our further use of the theory of building a  distinctively Chinese brand of socialism to arm the whole party,  to educate cadres and the people, to unify ideology, to  strengthen confidence, and to actively, completely, and  correctly carry out the party's basic line. How diligently we  study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  and profoundly understand and master the basic experiences  accumulated, the basic theories created, and the basic lines  formed by the second generation of the CPC leadership  collective, of which Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the nucleus, in  undertaking entirely new endeavors will have a major effect on  whether we will be able better to complete the tasks of the  1990's and advance victoriously into the 21st century.    The crucial issue in our study of Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and in studying  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively  Chinese brand of socialism lies in firm mastery of the  quintessence, which is emancipation of thinking and the seeking  of truth in facts, and linking the ideological realities and the  work realities of all battlelines for the conscientious  overcoming of all ideological restraints to enable a confluence  of ideology and practice, and to enable a confluence of the  subjective and the objective.    From Mao Zedong Thought to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism are the two  historical leaps generated in the course of persevering in the  great cause of combining Marxism with China's realities by  members of the Chinese Communist Party represented by Comrades  Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Although the two leaps occurred in  different historical periods, and have the characteristics of  different historical conditions and times, and although they  faced different historical contradictions and historical tasks  and gained different historical victories; nevertheless, the two  leaps were permeated with a common essence and substance. This  was that they adhered to the ideological line of seeking truth  from facts, and followed China's own road of revolution and  construction. Adherence to the ideological line of seeking truth  from facts and taking China's own road of revolution and  construction are the most basic historical experiences of all  the historical experiences summarized in Mao Zedong Thought and  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's building of a distinctively Chinese  brand of socialism. They successfully transform the scientific  tenets of Marxism into a complete system of new ideas, new  theories, lines, plans, policies, and realistic operating  principles for guiding practice in China's revolution and  construction. Thus, they enabled China's revolution and the  building of socialism to become a great scientific practice and  a successful reality. All the history of our party shows that  perseverance in combining Marxism with China's realities must  proceed from national circumstances and the character of the  times. It requires a thorough knowledge of the spiritual nature  of Marxism to carry on and develop Marxism. This requires, in  turn, the emancipation of thinking, the seeking of truth from  facts, and diligent investigation and study of Chinese realities  to induce new ideas and points of view, and new methods of  solving problems. It means one cannot copy word for word the  books and prescriptions of Marx, or mechanically follow the  models and experiences of other countries. Failure to understand  these points would have rendered impossible the creation of  China's new democratic revolution and socialist revolution  theories, and it would have rendered impossible the creation of  the theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of  socialism. The most fundamental experience of adherence to the  ideological line of seeking truth from facts and taking our own  road of revolution and construction enabled both Mao Zedong  Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a  distinctively Chinese brand of socialism of our party to express  the distinctive features of the times and the character of  China, and to be imbued with the essence and the substance of  universal Marxist truths. This is another reason why Mao Zedong  Thought is a continuation and a development of Marxism. It is  the reason that the theory of building a distinctively Chinese  brand of socialism is the most substantive embodiment of the  continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always upheld Mao Zedong Thought.  He deeply understands the ideological essence of Mao Zedong  Thought's seeking of truth from facts. He also developed the  ideological essence of the seeking of truth from facts of Mao  Zedong Thought. He proposed the concept of emancipating  thinking. He made the emancipation of thinking a part of the  party's ideological line. He emphasized that the emancipation of  thinking is of extreme importance in upholding the party's  ideological line of seeking truth from facts. The emancipation  of thinking and the seeking of truth from facts are parts of a  piece. Only by emancipating thinking can the seeking of truth  from facts be attained. Only the seeking of truth is facts is a  true emancipation of thinking. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is a  paragon of upholding the Party's ideological line of seeking  truth from facts. He is a paragon of adherence to and  development of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  repeatedly emphasized that "emancipation of thinking and seeking  truth from facts" is the essence that permeates the entire point  of view of the theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand  of socialism. In studying the new volume of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, we must grasp this essence, and  clutch this substance firmly. We must adhere to practice being  the sole criterion for testing truth. In the course of practice,  we must adhere to truth and develop truth. We must reject  dogmatic interpretations of certain Marxist principles and  Marxist writings; reject understandings of socialism that are  not scientific or that distort it; reject incorrect ideas about  skipping the preliminary state of socialism; resolutely oppose  erroneous points of view that basically repudiate Marxism; and  uphold the use of the world outlook and methodology of  dialectical materialism and historical materialism in analyzing  and solving problems. We must constantly improve our perceptions  as history advances, as times develop, and as practice deepens.  The achievements we have made stem from the emancipation of  thinking and the seeking of truth from facts. If we are to make  even greater achievements in the future, we must likely depend  on the emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth from  facts. New situations and new tasks are placing new requirements  on our emancipation of thinking and seeking of truth from facts.  We must continue to emancipate thinking and seek truth from  facts so that our ideas and understandings meet constantly  changing situations. This is a matter that we must understand  before studying the third volume of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping.    In studying the third volume of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, not only must we profoundly understand that  the emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth from facts  are important ideological premises for maintaining and  developing Mao Zedong Thought, but we must profoundly understand  and grasp that on a series of important issues -- particularly  basic issues such as what is socialism and how to build  socialism -- how Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building  of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism building is a  continuation and development of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "In carrying out reform and  opening up to the outside world and in placing the work emphasis  on building the economy, we have not abandoned Marxism,  Leninism, or Mao Zedong Thought. We cannot abandon the  forefathers!" He also said: "Following the Third Plenary  Session, we revived the correct things of Comrade Mao Zedong, we  studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in a correct and  integrated way . The basic points are still the same. In many  ways, today we are still doing things that Comrade Mao Zedong  proposed but did not do. We are doing things well that he did  not do well. For a fairly long time to come, we will be doing  well these things and we will also be developing, but we will  also have to continue to develop." He also noted that "True  Marxist-Leninists must, based on current circumstances,  understand, continue, and develop Marxism-Leninism." This is  because "the world is constantly changing. In particular, modern  science and technology are developing very rapidly. What used to  be done in the old society in several decades or as much as a  century or even a longer period is done in a single year  nowadays." Therefore, true Marxists must make their thinking  catch up with and meet rapidly developing circumstances. They  cannot fall behind. This is like "the reason Lenin is a truly  great Marxist is that he found the revolutionary road not in  books but in reality, logic, philosophical ideas, and communist  theory. The great Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong, did not seek in  the books of Marx and Lenin the way to win victory in the new  democratic revolution in backward China. Could Marx have  predicted that the October Revolution would occur in a backward  Russia?" Could Lenin have forecast that the use of rural  villages to surround the cities could be used to attain victory  in China?" Therefore, true Marxists must boldly pioneer and  innovate. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a  distinctively Chinese brand of socialism is both a continuation  of what those who have gone before have done and an opening up  of a way to the future. This theory holds both very strong real  pertinence and the distinctive character of the times. It is  pertinent to today's rapidly changing world situation, and it is  pertinent to the basic situation in China. It is also pertinent  to various mistaken points of view that have existed for a long  time in the understanding of socialism. It addresses the main  issues in basic socialist theory, namely what is socialism and  how to build socialism. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has put forward a  series of new ideas, new points of view, and new concepts. They  include new ideas, new points of view, and new concepts about  the innate character and basic tasks of socialism; about the  initial stage of socialism; about the standards for judging the  "three facilitates"; about the economic development strategy of  proceeding in three steps to accelerate development, the  national economy moving a new step upward every several years;  about science and technology being the primary productive force;  about reform being China's second revolution; about China's  development being inseparable from the rest of the world,  opposing self-confinement and isolation; about the existence of  no fundamental contradiction between socialism and a market  economy; about how political system reform must correspond to  economic system reform; about doing many things simultaneously  and working with might and main; about one nation, two systems;  about adherence to socialism, halting disturbances, and  preventing peaceful evolution; about the need for vigilance  against the right, and mostly guarding against "leftism"; about  adherence to the party's basic line of "one center and two basic  points" for a hundred years without wavering; about peace and  development being the two main themes in the contemporary world;  about taking the five principles of peaceful co-existence as the  standard for building a new international order; about the need  for dispassionate observation of the international situation,  securing one's position, and dealing with matters calmly; about  the key to China's problems being doing a good job within the  Communist Party; and about greater building of clean government  and opposition to corruption. This series of new ideas, new  points of view, and new concepts are a creative development of  Mao Zedong Thought. They are a major contribution to Marxist  theory. It is the innovation of such theories that has brought  about today's vigorous development of socialism in China. The  facts show that we are true Marxists only because we both  continue our forbearers' breaking of outmoded conventions and  dare to pioneer and create the future. It is only by consciously  understanding this point that we may be considered to have truly  reached the ideological heights of modern Chinese Marxism, and  to have more profoundly comprehended and truly grasped Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand  of socialism. Therefore, when we read the third volume of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we should study  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic ideas and theoretical points  of view, and diligently study his scientific attitude and  creative spirit in employing the Marxist standpoint, point of  view, and methods for use in studying new situations and solving  new problems.    Comrades, only by adhering to contemporary Chinese Marxism  --  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building of a  distinctively Chinese brand of socialism to guide our ideology  and every endeavor -- will our cause have a bright future. Only  in this way will our country be able to prosper, become rich and  wealthy, and our people prosper and flourish. As Comrade Jiang  Zemin said in his speech at a public lecture on the study of the  third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  "Doctrine may be likened to a banner." When the CPC was first  founded, it solemnly wrote the words Marxism-Leninism on its  banners. Following the Yanan rectification and the 7th Party  Congress, it solemnly made Marxism-Leninism and practice in the  Chinese revolution a unified ideology -- writing Mao Zedong  Thought on its own banners. Beginning with the 3d Plenary  Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, and on through the  12th, 13th, and 14th Party Central Committees, our party has  solemnly written Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building  of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism on its banners.  This is an extremely precious spiritual wealth for which our  party paid a tremendous price. It is a scientific summarization  of the new historical innovations of our party and people. It is  a great banner of our development of the socialist cause. It is  a powerful spiritual mainstay of our nation's advance and  development. In contemporary China, only by having this banner,  and having this spiritual mainstay can a large party of 50  million members and a large country with a population of 1.1  billion have greater cohesiveness, combat strength, and  creativity. The 15 years of reform and opening up to the outside  world and the socialist modernization since the 3d Plenary  Session of the 11th Party Central Committee fully demonstrates  that "adherence to Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a  distinctively Chinese brand of socialism is true maintenance and  development of Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought." So  long as we continue in the direction and along the road charted  by this theory, and follow the "movement in three steps"  development strategy all the way into the middle of the next  century to attain the level of a moderately developed nation in  the world, a wealthy and strong, democratic, and cultured modern  socialist China will certainly be able to stand lofty and firmly  in the Orient.    Comrades, as the largest city in China, Shanghai holds an  important position in China's revolution and construction  endeavors. It received a high degree of attention from Comrade  Mao Zedong. Prior to his death, Comrade Mao Zedong had more than  50 important activities underway in Shanghai. He gave numerous  important instructions about work in Shanghai, and he left a  glorious imprint and a great ideology. Back in March 1919, in  seeing off the students for part-work part-study in France, he  began his earliest contact with Shanghai. During the period of  the party's founding, Comrade Mao Zedong came to Shanghai  several times to seek truth for rescuing the nation and the  people. He actively launched revolutionary activities, and did  much work in founding the party. He attended one of the first  Chinese Communist conferences convened in Shanghai, thereby  becoming one of the founders of the CPC. When the CPC  established a democratic revolutionary program of opposition to  imperialism and feudalism for the founding of the democratic  united front, Comrade Mao Zedong was appointed by the party to  go to Shanghai to take part in the work of the Kuomintang  Central Executive Committee. He actively promoted the first  cooperation between the KMT and the CPC, and did much work  "sowing the seeds" of the subsequent grand and spectacular first  great revolution. Following defeat of the great revolution,  Comrade Mao Zedong left the city to found revolutionary bases in  the villages. Using the single spark of a red regime, he  encouraged and supported the people of Shanghai in arduous and  tortuous struggle. Following the party's Wayaopao Meeting [in  December 1935], the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong  looked after and guided the work of the Shanghai underground  party organization, thereby making Shanghai one of the main  bastions of China's workers's movement, revolutionary cultural  movement, and the patriotic and democratic movement of various  democratic strata in the Chinese democratic revolution. When the  war of liberation was on the verge of success and the CPC  Central Committee decided to shift the party's work emphasis  from the rural villages to the cities, showing great foresight,  Comrade Mao Zedong personally drew up the strategic policy of  "both the need to annihilate the enemies defending Shanghai, and  the need to preserve Shanghai intact." He also personally  drafted nearly 20 telegrams in the name of the CPC Central  Committee and Central Military Committee as part of the strategy  for Shanghai's liberation and takeover. He drew up a series of  plans and policies that permitted Shanghai, the largest city in  China, to revert intact to the hands of the people.    Right after Shanghai's liberation, faced with a grim  situation of blockade by the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek,  bombings, sabotage by enemy agents, rampant speculation, and  countless tribulations, the CPC Central Committee and Comrade  Mao Zedong adopted a series of important policies for guiding  the people of Shanghai in rapidly overcoming all difficulties to  win a tremendous victory in transforming the old Shanghai and  building a new Shanghai. Later on, thanks to the guiding spirit  of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, Shanghai  rationally readjusted existing industry and commerce and  smoothly carried out a full revival of Shanghai's national  economy. After three years of economic revival and the socialist  transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and  handicraft industries, as well as the planned building of  socialism, Shanghai's industrial production rapidly revived and  developed.    With the full launching of socialist transformation and  construction, Comrade Mao Zedong personally visited Shanghai  several times to explore avenues for building Chinese socialism.  He went down to the grassroots, inspected industrial plants and  enterprises, and contacted cadres and the masses to learn about  events. He met with people in all walks of life and listened to  statements from all quarters. He personally made a report to  Shanghai cadres announcing the party's plans and policies to  promote work in every way in Shanghai. In January 1956, Comrade  Mao Zedong visited Shenxin Plant No 9 where he told everyone  that after the USSR took power, capitalist property was taken  over by the state with a single order, but that China had  adopted the method of gradual transformation. This was done in  view of China's circumstances. Soviet methods were not rigidly  copied. He also warned everyone to rely on the working class to  look after the factories. Around this same time, Comrade Mao  Zedong also visited Shanghai port and the Jiangnan Shipyard. On  5 November 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong boarded "Gangshen Lun," for  a zestful inspection of the port's new appearance. He also said  significantly that Shanghai is China's largest port; it is an  international port; and it is a port that has development  potential. We must take good care of it. He also said to  accompanying leading cadres that Shanghai cadres should study  management skills to meet needs in building socialism. At the  Jiangnan Shipyard, he was ecstatic upon learning that this 100  year-old shipyard was able to build submarines. When an  accompanying municipal CPC committee official said that not only  was it necessary to learn Soviet techniques but to surpass them,  Comrade Mao Zedong said in great agreement: "We must have this  kind of courage." In July 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong visited the  Shanghai Machine Tool Plant. When Comrade Mao Zedong learned  that within seven years after liberation, Shanghai-produced  grinding machines were being supplied to the whole country to  support construction everywhere, he said: "This kind of plant is  needed for construction." After hearing that the plant was now  designing its own grinding machines instead of making the former  copies, he said delightedly: "We must take the independent  design road," and he emphasized the study of advanced foreign  experiences "for our own use." During this period, Comrade Mao  Zedong used a large amount of investigation and study to shape  many new approaches to the building of socialism in China.  Comrade Mao Zedong personally urged along the cadres and people  of Shanghai saying, "Shanghai has a future. It must be  developed," to point out a direction for Shanghai's  construction. He directed Shanghai to set up a "completely  useful and rationally developed" industrial construction plan.  During the 10 years of beginning the all-out building of  socialism, Shanghai brought into play the potential and the  strengths of its old industrial base, providing powerful support  for the economic construction of the whole country.    During the period of his visits and guidance to Shanghai,  Comrade Mao Zedong also frequently associated with the people.  He had extensive contacts, intercourse, and even communications  with people in all trades and professions, and all strata in  Shanghai. He was profoundly concerned about the feelings and  hopes of the masses.    The Shanghai working class will never forget Comrade Mao  Zedong's hopes for the working class. Comrade Mao Zedong often  went among the working people of Shanghai. He had cordial talks  with them and learned about their circumstances. He encouraged  everyone to contribute to the building of socialism. He was  particularly solicitous about and cherished model workers. He  instructed cadres in the need to pay attention to making the  most of the role of model personnel as mainstay cadres, leaders,  and bridges. In March 1960, he also personally invited to dinner  Shanghai's innovators and labor model representatives, and he  encouraged everyone to suggest ways and means for the  technological revolution, and to contribute their energies to  it. He also pointed out that "Revolution is no easy matter.  Remember this truth when you are making technological  innovations. No testing means no failures, and no successes!  Everything must be tested and experience gained through failures  making later success possible." He emphasized the need to train  college students, train engineers, and train writers from among  the workers. It was because of Comrade Mao Zedong's advocacy and  concern that the first group of worker engineers was born in  Shanghai. A number of labor models entered university, and  advanced model personnel in every trade and industry spurred  technological innovation and a technological revolution campaign  throughout the city.    Comrade Mao Zedong was concerned about the production and  the  livelihood of Shanghai's peasants. On many occasions, he issued  instructions on the need for concern and assistance. He warmly  endorsed and recommended the experiences of Songjiang County in  convening meetings of delegates from all walks of life during  the early liberation period. He also personally wrote comments  on the reports of five agricultural production cooperatives,  including one from Hongnan Township in suburban Shanghai, and it  was included in a book titled "High Tide in China's Rural  Socialism."    Comrade Mao Zedong was solicitous about the growth of  Shanghai's young people. In April 1950, despite being busy with  a political campaign, Comrade Mao Zedong took the time to write  a few words of encouragement for the Shanghai Nanyang Model  Middle School student wall newspaper, QINGFENG, that urged the  students to learn skills to serve the people. In reply to a  request from the Shanghai QINGNIAN BAO, he sent the powerful  inscription, "March On, March On, On!" to encourage the  embattled Shanghai youth who were overcoming difficulties. When  visiting the Shanghai Machine Tool plant, he noticed that most  of the people in the workshops were young workers. He happily  instructed, "This is the newly rising force that you must  nurture." "You have so many young people; you will certainly be  able to run the plant better!" This expressed Comrade Mao  Zedong's ardent hopes for and confidence in youth.    On several occasions, Comrade Mao Zedong met women  delegates,  which left unforgettable memories for the women of Shanghai.  When Comrade Mao Zedong saw quite a few women workers on the  frontline of production when he visited plants, he shook hands  warmly with them. He was sincerely proud of the emancipation of  China's women, and he said approvingly: "Now that women have  been liberated, they can run machine tools too. Things that male  comrades can do, female comrades can also do." His encouragement  and praise encouraged the broad masses of women in Shanghai to  play a "hold up half the sky" role in the building of socialism.    Comrade Mao Zedong always paid close attention to the  building of the people's armed forces. On numerous occasions, he  visited and encouraged units stationed in Shanghai. In February  1953, when Comrade Mao Zedong inspected navy vessel units for  the first time, he boarded the Chang Jiang, and the Luoyang. He  also said that "We are determined to build a powerful people's  navy to oppose imperialist aggression." Comrade Mao Zedong also  personally wrote the well-known "Eighth Company Eulogy," which  praised the model deeds of "the good Eighth Company of Nanjing  Road." All the party, all the armed forces, and all the people  were called upon to study it.    On numerous occasions, he met notables in the fields of  education, science and technology, health, literature and the  arts, and news and publication, as well as delegates from  commerce and industry. He befriended them and showed great  concern for their ideology and livelihood. Thus, they sincerely  revered this leader of the people, and they felt the warmth of  the party in living expression of the party intellectuals policy  and united front policy.    After founding of the people's republic, Shanghai was also  an  important site for the CPC Central Committee's and Comrade Mao  Zedong's state activities. Under his personal sponsorship, the  CPC Central Committee convened numerous important conferences in  Shanghai, which produced numerous major policies and decisions.  In addition, he conducted numerous important foreign affairs  activities in Shanghai where he received important heads of  state and international friends from numerous countries. The  birth of the Shanghai Communique was a major victory for Mao  Zedong's diplomatic line. It lay the foundation for our opening  up to the outside world of today.    All of this encouraged the entire party and all of the  people  of Shanghai to struggle to build socialism. Comrade Mao Zedong's  brilliant thought and leadership style left a profound  impression on the hearts of the people of Shanghai. The people  of Shanghai will forever cherish the memory of Comrade Mao  Zedong.    Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central  Committee, the older generation of revolutionaries, including  Comrade Deng Xiaoping, have exhibited extreme concern and  expectations for Shanghai. Shanghai's every construction  achievement has been the coacervation of the guidance and  support of the Central Committee leaders and the older  generation of revolutionaries. In recent years, in particular,  Comrade Xiaoping has made a fairly concentrated and profound  exposition of Shanghai's development problems as part of his  macroeconomic strategy of accelerating China's economic  development. In 1990, in talking with Central Committee comrades  in charge, he said: "Take Shanghai, for example, which is  considered a major case. Shanghai is our king card. Getting  Shanghai going is a shortcut." When he visited Shanghai in 1991,  Comrade Xiaoping said that development of Pudong "is not just a  Pudong matter. It is a matter affecting the development of  Shanghai. It is a matter of the use of the Shanghai base to  develop the Chang Jiang Delta and the Chang Jiang Basin." In  discussing finance as the nucleus of a modern economy, he also  noted that "for China to achieve international standing in the  finance and banking field, Shanghai will have to be relied upon  first of all." During his visit to south China in 1992, Comrade  Xiaoping said in his important remarks that Shanghai holds a  marked advantage in human resources, technology, and management,  which influences a wide area. "Right now it has all the  conditions for acting faster." In this connection, he called  upon us "not to miss opportunities." We should emancipate  thinking a little bit more, be a little bolder, and act a little  faster. He said that we can only move ahead but not retreat in  the development of Pudong today, and that you have no retreat  route. Pudong's late development is bad, but it is also good.  You can benefit from Guangdong's experiences to do a better job,  and to be more modern. The starting point can be somewhat  higher. Later on, you can rest; I believe this. He said,  Shanghai people tend to be agreeable. This is a boundless force  for the building of socialism. Look at Shanghai with so many  changes in a single year. In three years, it will have greater  changes. Comrade Xiaoping stressed doing many things at the same  time and working with might and main. He asked Shanghai to issue  two questionnaires, one on economic construction and the other  on spiritual civilization. He said that by the end of the  present century, Pudong in Shanghai and Shenzhen in Guangdong  will have to answer the question whether what you have done is  socialist or capitalist, and both of you will have to be role  models. You must pay attention to overall national strength, but  at the same time you have to pay attention to spiritual  civilization. Comrade Xiaoping's important instructions and  earnest hopes provided enormous spiritual motivation for  Shanghai's progress.    The third generation of party leaders in which Comrade Jiang  Zemin is the nucleus also showed deep concern and provided warm  encouragement to work in Shanghai. Not long after the 14th Party  Congress, Comrade Zemin conducted an inspection in Shanghai  during which he said that historically Shanghai's commodity  economy has been fairly well-developed. It has multiple  advantages, including the human talent needed for the  development of a socialist market economy. He called upon  Shanghai to take the lead in building a socialist market economy  operating mechanism. He ardently supported the development and  opening to the outside world of Pudong. During his inspection of  Shanghai during April 1993, he acted personally, night after  night drafting speech drafts reiterating that the Central  Committee's development and opening to the outside world of  Pudong is firm and unshakable, and the Pudong policy is  unchangeable. He also directed many times that Shanghai should  take the national lead in the building of spiritual  civilization. As a socialist international metropolis, Shanghai  should have things such as a symphony orchestra and a ballet,  highly refined arts that express Shanghai's level of  civilization. The expectations for Shanghai of the CPC Central  Committee and the older generation of revolutionaries make every  cadre and party member in Shanghai feel a heavy sense of  responsibility. Today, when we solemnly commemorate the  centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth, in addition to  expressing the respect and reverence of cadres and the public in  our entire city, more important is the use of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on the building of a distinctively Chinese  brand of socialism to arm our minds, to guide practice, to seize  opportunities, to accelerate reform and to hasten development.  This is also the best commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong's  centenary.    The key in using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory for building  a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism to arm the mind, and  full and correct implementation of the party's basic line of "a  single center and two basic points" lies in firmly grasping the  essence of the emancipation of thinking, seeking truth from  facts, and proceeding from realities in all affairs. Comrade  Xiaoping, who occupies a commanding position in the times, and  who brilliantly analyzed the international and domestic  situations, stressed on several occasions the need to seize  opportunities to develop productivity. He said, "Development is  a firm principle." An essential feature and fundamental task of  socialism is the development of productivity. Without the  development of productivity, changing of our impoverished and  backward state is impossible. Neither can the masses standard of  living be improved nor the superiority of socialism be  demonstrated. He stated clearly that "poverty is not socialism."  At the same time, he brilliantly pointed out that "too slow  development is also not socialism." If socialism is to gain an  advantage comparable to capitalism, it must "realize the proper  speed of development." "Slow speed is tantamount to a halt, or  even to regression." This is not just an economic problem; in  reality, it is a political problem." "Therefore, those who can  develop should not stand in the way. Places having the  conditions must do all possible to work faster. So long as they  stress returns, stress quality, and operate an export-oriented  economy, they have nothing to worry about." The 1990s are  Shanghai's "last opportunity" for development. The CPC Central  Committee has made the development and opening to the outside  world of Pudong a strategic emphasis for China's reform and  opening to the outside world during the 1990's. We must seize  this difficult to obtain historical opportunity, clear away all  interference, work singlemindedly, and devote ourselves  wholeheartedly to building the economy. We must proceed from  Shanghai's realities to focus on three strategic points, namely  building the city's infrastructure, tertiary industries, and  high and new technology. We must accelerate building of the  city's infrastructure, give priority to the development of  tertiary industries, and energetically develop high and new  technologies to fashion high and new technology industries and a  new generation of mainstay industries, to raise the overall  quality of Shanghai's national economy and its international  competitiveness, and strive to realize the established goal of  making Shanghai prosper during the 1990s.    Hastening development means taking the road of reform.  Reform  is the road that must be taken for the emancipation and  development of productivity. Reform is "fundamentally changing  the economic system that hampers the development of  productivity, setting up a socialist economic system that is  imbued with vim and vigor to advance the development of  productivity." The 14th Party Congress decided that the goal of  reform of China's economic system is the founding of a socialist  market economy system. The decisions of the 3d Plenary Session  of the 14th Party Central Committee systematized and gave  substance to this goal that the 14th Party Congress set as the  basic framework for building a socialist market economy system.  It is our operating program for hastening reform and  accelerating development. We must hasten the pace of reform in  Shanghai on the basis of the requirements for building a  socialist market economy system. We must make a transition from  the planned economic system that was practiced for a long time  to a socialist market economy system. Combining the socialist  market economy system with the socialist basic system is a  pioneering undertaking without parallel. In moving ahead,  inevitably difficulties and problems of one kind or another will  be encountered. We must adhere to a spirit of seeking truth from  facts, proceeding from reality in all endeavors, and using  reform measures to solve them. Only whatever helps develop  socialist social productivity, helps increase the socialist  country's overall national strength, and helps improve the  people's standard of living should be boldly practiced.  Experiences should also be constantly summarized to move ahead  steadily. Fifteen years of reform and opening to the outside  world have infused enormous vitality into Shanghai's economy.  They have changed Shanghai's appearance daily, and they have  constantly improved the livelihood of Shanghai's people.  Consequently, reform and opening to the outside world have  gained the full support and hearty endorsement of the masses. So  long as we are adept at linking the spirit of the Central  Committee with practice in Shanghai under leadership of the CPC  Central Committee, and go about our work in an innovative way,  we shall certainly be able constantly to bring about a new  situation in Shanghai's reform and opening to the outside world,  and its modernization.    Reform and opening to the outside world require a stable  social environment and strong moral support. The glorious cause  of vigorously developing Shanghai and developing Pudong, has  produced an unprecedented centripetal force and cohesion in  people throughout the city. It also places higher demands on  people's ideology and morality, and their scientific and  cultural attributes. This requires that we proceed from the  heights of full implementation of the party's basic line in  truly working with might and main, steadily intensifying the  building of socialist spiritual civilization. The basic task of  building spiritual civilization lies in the nurturing of a new  socialist man possessed of ideals, virtue, discipline, and  culture. In addition, it is necessary to improve socialist  democracy and the legal system, to make science and culture  flourish, and to promote all-around social advance. In a  situation of reform and opening to the outside world and the  development of a socialist market economy, resisting the  corrosion of decadent capitalist and feudal ideology and doing a  good job of building spiritual civilization is both an extremely  daunting and complex piece of systems engineering, but also a  strategic task that has a bearing on success or failure in  socialist modernization. We must pay great attention to doing a  solid job, steadily move ahead with the building of spiritual  civilization in Shanghai, making a satisfactory response to the  material civilization and the spiritual civilization that the  CPC Central Committee and the older generation of  revolutionaries such as Comrade Deng Xiaoping have passed along.    Today, we can thank Comrade Mao Zedong and countless older  generation revolutionaries for Shanghai's present political  stability, economic development, and social tranquility under  the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council. The situation is very good in every way.  Throughout the city, cadres at every level and the far-flung  masses are diligently studying Volume 3 of The Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, and the Decisions of the 14th Party  Congress. They are taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building a distinctively socialist China as a guide in carrying  out the "Decisions" of the 14th Party Congress in order for  Shanghai to take the lead in building a socialist market economy  operating mechanism. They are striving and fighting to attain  the 14th Party Congress goal of Shanghai becoming "a turnkey"  and "three centers."    Comrades, from now until the end of the present century is  the magnificent historical period for realization of the second  step of the strategic goal of building socialist modernization.  It is an important historical period in Shanghai's vigorous  development to become a "turnkey," and "three centers." It is a  great time to be alive. We all feel proud and honored in  shouldering this important historical task. Let us unite closely  around the CPC Central Committee in which Comrade Jiang Zemin is  the nucleus. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building a distinctively Chinese branch of socialism, let us  steadfastly uphold the party's basic line of "one center and two  basic points," study and carry forward the glorious  accomplishments and ideological model of Comrade Mao Zedong and  the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, work hard  to blaze new trails, do solid work, and make the contribution we  should make to realize Shanghai's reform and construction goals,  and to realize the magnificent cause of building a distinctively  Chinese brand of socialism.</p>

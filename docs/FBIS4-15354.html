			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS--Today's newspapers highlight  the results of voting in the Federation Council, the upper house  of the Russian parliament, on whether to accept the resignation  of Russia's Prosecutor-General Alexey Kazannik.    The Federation Council did not accept Kazannik's resignation  and formally he still remains at his post. At the same time,  according to the presidential decree dated February 26, the  duties of prosecutor-general are being performed by Alexey  Ilyushenko whose powers were reaffirmed on April 6 by President  Boris Yeltsin.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the Federation Council vote: "Two  prosecutors-general are too many for Russia. Through its  decision, the Federation Council has drawn itself into a  juridical collision, and an easy and painless way out of it can  hardly be expected...    "Prior to making a new recommendation of a candidate for the  office of prosecutor-general, the president should again suggest  that the Federation Council accept Kazannik's resignation. The  circle closes...    "It is clear that the Federation Council will not be able to  resolve the problem without a thorough juridical analysis of the  current situation and a search for a compromise solution".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject: "The Federation  Council does not yield to the presidential team. Next move is  to be made by the presidential side. The president should  either recommend Alexey Kazannik to the Federation Council, or  get to terms with the upper house of parliament in some other  way".    TRUD carries an analytical article headlined "Who is  Prosecutor- General in Russia?" Turning to the provisions of  the new Constitution, the newspaper writes: "Since a  prosecutor-general is appointed by the Federation Council on the  president's recommendation, it can well be reckoned that the  president should have presented prosecutor-general's candidacy  to parliament for approval. This must also be demanded by the  upper house of parliament.    "Neither the former nor the latter had been done in time.  The president does not recommend Kazannik now because he has  already accepted his resignation. On the other hand, by  refusing to accept the resignation, the Federation Council has  actually `appointed' a prosecutor-general without the  president's recommendation".    Newspapers also give prominence to a draft agreement on  achieving civil accord in Russia, which President Yeltsin has  referred to the two houses of parliament, as well as sent it for  publication and country-wide discussion.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an article in which it expresses  doubt  that the document would be implemented. "Special sections of  this sizeable document deal with both regional, national and  socio-economic policies... Obligations are envisioned in all of  them. But would they be feasible in real life full of  contradictions?"    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) is more optimistic on the  subject:  "The draft agreement inspires hopes, albeit faint and  indistinct."    PRAVDA frontpages statistics on the economic situation in  the  country: "In the first quarter of this year, industrial  production declined by 25 percent. Food production continues to  shrink. The amounts of milk and meat produced decreased by  15-18 percent and eggs by six percent. Investment diminished as  production fell. Investments in the country's economy accounted  for 75-80 percent of those in the corresponding period last  year."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the money incomes of the country's  top officials. Under the headline "No One Wanted To Fill in a  Declaration of Income", the newspaper carries an article which  points to the construction of costly three-storey mansions for  some ministers, mayors, and deputies.    The authors of the article urge Russian parliamentarians to  pass a law which would make it binding upon top executives of  the country, and leaders of state-run organisations to fill in  declarations of income, which could prevent the emergence of  corruption in the civil service system.</p>

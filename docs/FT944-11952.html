			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Banks seek tighter loan covenants - Revival in syndicated lending has reawakened old fears Many US banks may have breathed a sigh of relief at the warning by Mr Walter Shipley, chairman and chief executive of Chemical Banking, that he is prepared to give up Chemical's leadership of the US syndicated loans market rather than accept looser terms for lending. European banks will hope that this example becomes the latest development in syndicated lending to cross the Atlantic. There were signs last year that the revival of syndicated lending - in which a loan to a large company is arranged by one or two lead banks, and an unlimited number of banks contribute to it - was bringing back to banks familiar dangers. It has become reality this year, as European banks have followed those in the US by narrowing margins and slackening loan covenants. Many banks fear a repeat of the late 1980s, when the driving down of margins as banks competed for assets was followed by a wave of corporate collapses. A form of lending that would scarcely have brought an adequate return on capital for banks, even if every loan had been paid back, became the latest of a series of collective blunders by the banking industry. Yet, while banks have been groping for a floor to lending terms, developments such as the re-entry of smaller Japanese banks since April have made it elusive. 'One keeps hearing of bank credit committees saying they will not go below this or that line, but one rapidly hears of a deal that does so,' says Mr Stanley Hurn, head of loan syndication at Midland Bank. As banks in first the US and then Europe have re-built capital ratios to well above the minimum levels set by the 1988 Basle accord, they have been seeking assets again. 'There is an awful lot of money chasing very few borrowers, and the imbalance of supply and demand is driving prices down,' says Mr Jonathan Macdonald, a vice-president of Union Bank of Switzerland. Some deals are starting to resemble the notorious multi-option facilities (Mofs) of the late 1980s, which made banks bid to take part when companies exercised agreed facilities. 'Mofs are so discredited that we will not see them again, but a facility with a bidding mechanism is a Mof by another name,' says one head of loan syndication for a European bank. In theory, syndicated lending ought to be a dying art. Banks have calculated that they need a margin of at least 80 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) on loans to single-A grade borrowers to make adequate returns. In practice, margins have fallen this year from about 45 to between 20 and 22 basis points. Companies were also thought to be shifting towards relying on capital markets for short- and medium-term finance. But bond market volatility this year has made many corporate treasurers re-think. 'Margins are at historically low levels, and borrowers can achieve terms similar to bond markets,' says Mr Peter Nightingale, Chemical's head of European loan syndication. However, syndicated lending can be more profitable for banks than it immediately appears. One reason is that the cost of funds of large banks, such as the UK clearers, is not in practice Libor. Because of their size and strength, they can obtain money at about 10 basis points below Libor, which makes their actual lending margins about one-third higher than their apparent ones. A second reason is that banks get fees for lending in addition to the margin. These range from underwriting fees for banks that syndicate and lead manage loans, to partic-ipation fees for smaller banks. Many larger banks try to arrange and lead manage as many loans as possible to obtain fees, and keep only a tiny proportion of those loans on their balance sheets. A third reason is that banks still use lending as a means of attracting other business such as cash management and cheque clearing. All these factors have led to a big revival in the global syndicated loans market. There were Dollars 795bn of loans in the global last year, compared with Dollars 627bn in 1992, according to Euromoney Loanware. About Dollars 497bn was lent in the first nine months of this year, and activity is expected to intensify. This has led not only to margins tightening sharply, but banks have also been willing to lend for longer, locking themselves into low-return assets. Banks were reluctant to lend for more than three years in the early 1990s, but facilities such as the recent 10-year, Pounds 100m loan negotiated by 3i, the UK venture capital group, have become increasingly common. Furthermore, fees are coming under pressure. The standard commitment fee for undrawn facilities has fallen to 10 basis points or below. Some bankers report that legal fees charged on standard loans by leading UK firms have been forced down to about Pounds 10,000 from Pounds 25,000 two years ago. They also fear that banks will start to wrap fees into the overall lending margin. Potentially the most worrying development for banks, however, is the relaxation of loan covenants. These commonly include financial ratios such as interest cover, gearing and the minimum net worth of the borrower. It is the willingness of some banks to accept deals with loose covenants - and some deals with none - that has particularly worried Mr Shipley. Some bankers argue that covenants are not significant because European credit quality is improving, and covenants did not prevent the last wave of corporate defaults. Yet given the ability of a single corporate collapse to eliminate the slim return on assets in a bank's syndicated lending activities, others regard the protection of covenants as vital. Mr Shipley's warning may be a first step to restoring equilibrium for other banks. But the protection of loan covenants will require senior directors of banks to back the judgment of internal credit committees against those of executives who market loans. Without such tough measures, many bankers fear that history will repeat itself uncomfortably quickly.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Continental Airlines files plan to reorganise CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier but in bankruptcy since late-1990, filed a reorganisation plan with the courts late yesterday afternoon. This incorporates the potential Dollars 450m investment from Air Canada and Air Partners, a Texan investment partnership - a deal announced last week, and which would give the two investors equity stakes of 27.5 per cent each. Copies of the plan were not immediately available, but it is understood that secured creditors generally receive close to the amounts they are owed. Unsecured creditors will get stock in the restructured company, which, at book-value, is reckoned to give them a return of about 5.5 cents on the dollar for amounts owed by the carrier and 6.6 cents for sums owed by the parent holding company. Aside from bankruptcy court approval, the investment requires a green light from the US Department of Transportation, which must agree to the involvement of Air Canada, a foreign carrier. It seems likely that some decisions by the Continental board will need a majority of votes to pass, and that Air Canada, with six board seats, will be in a potential blocking position. This could raise the sort of control issue which has dogged British Airways' plan to invest Dollars 750m in USAir, another US carrier, in return for a large minority stake.</p>

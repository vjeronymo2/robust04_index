			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Multinationals furious over Mexican contract THREE multinationals have formally complained to the Mexican government about alleged irregularities in the awarding of a Dollars 21m contract for the renewal of Mexico's air traffic control system. The complaints come at a sensitive time for Mexico as the North American Free Trade Agreement awaits ratification by the US Congress and the legislatures in Mexico and Canada. The agreement, which is expected to have an awkward passage in Washington, is meant to open up most procurement for the Mexican public sector to US and Canadian companies. IBM, Westinghouse and Raytheon's Canadian subsidiary allege that an initial tender to replace the system was unjustifiably cancelled. They also claim that they lost a second tender to a rival bid which had been reduced by an inexplicably large margin and did not comply with the tender requirements. The air traffic control contract was awarded in December to the two European companies responsible for Mexico's current air traffic control system: Thomson of France will provide the new data processing system and Alenia of Italy the radars. The complaints are being investigated by the office of Mexico's General Comptroller of the Federation, which monitors how Mexican government money is spent. They have been delivered by the US and Canadian embassies in Mexico and, according to those involved, are unusual in their ferocity. The comptroller's office declined to comment on the allegations until it had time to review the documents relating to the two tenders. The initial tender for the prestigious contract to replace the 14-year-old system was announced in August, but cancelled abruptly on November 19. The reason given for the cancellation was that none of the seven bidding companies had complied with the tender requirements. This has infuriated the US and Canadian companies which claim world leadership in the technology, and deny that they failed to comply in any material way with the almost 200 requirements.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Midland head warns of soft recovery ANY recovery for the banking industry will 'feel much like recession', Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Group warned yesterday. However, his bank, recently acquired by Hongkong Banking Corporation, has returned to profit in the six months to June 30. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 89m, compared with a Pounds 71m loss in the comparable period. But the profit in the most recent half is less than the Pounds 107m before tax made in the second half of 1991. Mr Pearse also gave details of the group's new management structure and said that, as part of the Hongkong Bank, Midland would push to increase its share of the UK banking market. The regional structure for UK branch banking is being changed to devolve considerable management power to new regional units. The bank has appointed five regional general managers: for London, the Midlands, the North, the South and Wales. The effects of the recession on Midland have altered in recent months. The charge for bad debts has fallen from Pounds 530m to Pounds 355m. However, this has been partly offset by a 5.1 per cent drop in group income to Pounds 1.59bn. Midland's customers have been making fewer banking transactions, reducing fees and commissions paid, and the bank has also cut the volume of loans. Mr Pearse said the fall in the bad debt charge was largely due to an improving trend for personal customers. The corporate bad debt charge of Pounds 249m was only Pounds 1m less than in the second half of last year, and was mainly attributable to small companies. The property and construction industries suffered most, contributing 54.3 per cent of the total corporate charge. Mr Pearse did not expect a rapid improvement in bad debts. He said the number of companies looked after by the bank's 'intensive care unit' had fallen during the past six months. But he said that 'those in intensive care are in a worse state than before'. He also said: 'When recovery comes, it will not feel much different from recession.' He expected companies would continue to collapse in the early stages of recovery, and was concerned that customers would spend less and borrow less. Midland is not paying a dividend, because of the transfer of ownership to Hongkong Bank. Its shares will, however, continue to be traded for a short while and yesterday they closed unchanged at 467p.

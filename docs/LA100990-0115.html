			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE WASN'T BUCKWHEAT, '20-20' ACKNOWLEDGES  </P> <P> 'It was a real foul-up in research," a spokeswoman for "20/20" acknowledged  Monday, referring to the ABC program's story last Friday about a grocery clerk  in Tempe, Ariz., who it said used to star as Buckwheat in the "Our Gang"  comedies.  </P> <P> The actor who actually played the role, William Thomas, died in 1980.  </P> <P> "20/20" spokeswoman Maurie Pearl said that the magazine show had undertaken the  segment after receiving a letter from a viewer who said that the man who had  played Buckwheat in the films of the 1930s and '40s was living in Tempe. The  man interviewed was named Bill English; he told "20/20" that he had changed his  last name from Thomas.  </P> <P> The network is looking into the matter and is likely to apologize when "20/20"  airs Friday, Pearl said. Whatever disciplinary action is taken will be handled  internally, she said.  </P></p>

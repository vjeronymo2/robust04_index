			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHUTDOWN HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON CALIFORNIA IN FIRST DAY;  </P> <P> CLOSINGS: BUDGET DEADLOCK LEADS MOSTLY TO CONFUSION AND PETTY ANNOYANCES. SAN  DIEGO'S CABRILLO NATIONAL MONUMENT AMONG CLOSURES.  </P> <P> Thousands of campers in Yosemite National Park began getting the bad news  Saturday morning. Because of the federal budget stalemate, all campsites in the  park will be closed at 1 p.m. today, although the Ahwahnee Hotel, Yosemite  Lodge and other facilities operated by the Curry Co. will remain open, as will  the visitor center with a reduced staff.  </P> <P> "We are technically closed right now but the gates are still open because it's  difficult to close Yosemite in a short period of time," said Park Ranger Bob  Clopine. "We're confused but we're making the best of a difficult situation."  </P> <P> For most Californians, there were few such problems Saturday because the vast  majority of federal agencies were closed for the weekend.  </P> <P> Some part-time workers for the U.S. Census Bureau even put in a day of overtime  as they rushed to complete the field work for the 1990 census.  </P> <P> Rick Winston, a Census Bureau district manager in Panorama City, said he and 11  others were told Friday to report to work Saturday regardless of what problems  Congress was having with the budget. "I don't know if we're going to get paid,  but we have to assume they know what they're doing."  </P> <P> In San Diego, visitors to the Cabrillo National Monument, a popular tourist  destination, were dismayed to find that the federal shutdown had prompted  short-staffed managers to close the seaside park.  </P> <P> "What is surprising is the number of visitors we turned away who had no idea  this was going on," said Mark Anderson, ranger at the site, which is named in  honor of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, the Portuguese explorer who was the first  European to sail into San Diego Bay. "We've dropped down to the minimum  essential crew needed for caretaking the monument."  </P> <P> Elsewhere in San Diego, however, the federal budget crunch seemed to have  little impact. Essential services remained in place, lessening the potential  for disruption.  </P> <P> No unusual delays were reported through the afternoon at Lindbergh Field, the  principal airport.  </P> <P> The U.S. Border Patrol, which has more than 800 employees in the San Diego  area, the nation's largest such contingent, was also said to be conducting  normal operations.  </P> <P> The usual weekend delays were  </P> <P> present along the two U.S.-Mexico border crossings between San Diego and  Tijuana, but no usual backups were reported. The border facilities are manned  by federal immigration and customs personnel.  </P> <P> "It's a normal Saturday," said Alicia Williams, operations supervisor at the  San Ysidro port of entry, the world's busiest international crossing.  </P> <P> The visitor center at Angeles National Forest remained open thanks to a budget  surplus that will allow it and those at other national forests in California to  continue operations until Oct. 15. "After that, God only knows," said Ranger  Gerry Reponen from the Chilao Visitor Center.  </P> <P> The budget deadlock, however, touched Southern Californians in small ways.  </P> <P> Alfred Golden, first vice president of Seniors for Action, a senior citizens  political action group, said a toll-free number available to "tell Congress  exactly how we feel" was not in service.  </P> <P> The visitor center was closed at the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation  Area and scheduled nature hikes for hundreds of weekend visitors were canceled,  although the area was open to those who wanted to hike on their own.  </P> <P> The Channel Islands National Park visitor center in Ventura also was closed.  Private boat operators are still providing tours of the islands, but park  rangers will not guide the tours.  </P> <P> The visitor center in Sequoia National Park was closed and all naturalists  talks and hikes were canceled. The campgrounds remained open. Because of the  reduction in services, however, no entrance fees were being collected.  </P> <P> At Yosemite, visited by 3.4 million people last year, park entrances were kept  open and rangers continued to collect fees, although visitors were being warned  that services were limited.  </P> <P> Guided walks and ranger programs have been halted, Yosemite's Clopine said. And  if Congress fails to find a budget solution by this afternoon, the campgrounds  will be closed, he said.  </P> <P> "You mean I came all the way from Ohio and I can't go backpacking?" Robbi  Young, 32, of Cincinnati said after Ranger Bob Slimak explained the budget  situation.  </P> <P> "Write your congressman when you get back to Ohio," Slimak responded.  </P> <P> Young and her friend, George Carman, 33, of San Diego, had hoped to go on a  backpacking trip to Little Yosemite Valley this morning.  </P> <P> The 550 employees of the park have been told to report to work Tuesday,  following the Columbus Day holiday, when they will find out whether they will  continue working or be put on furlough.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Patrick McDonnell, Terry Rather, Mayerene Barker and Psyche  Pascual contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Oppositionist Palestinian Factions </F> Turn Down Offer to Participate in National Authority"]    [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Fatah Central Committee  member 'Abbas Zaki is making contacts with leaders of the  Palestinian factions opposed to the Oslo accord to persuade them  to participate in the self-rule authority. But there have been  no indications that any of the factions with which he met in  Amman has agreed to do so, despite the "tempting offer" he is  carrying. Palestinian sources have told AL-HAYAH that the  Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has turned down "Fatah's  tempting offer during Zaki's meeting with its leaders in Amman."  And that it reemphasized its refusal to participate in the  administrative self-rule authority.    The sources added that the Fatah Central Committee member  moved to Damascus yesterday, where he met with Nayif Hawatimah,  secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP], and Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general  of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. He  briefed them on Fatah's position on the Cairo accord and asked  them to participate in the self-rule authority on the basis of  shares equal to Fatah's in order to rebuild the negotiation  process in accordance with international legitimacy.    The DFLP secretary general emphasized that the weapons of  the  national forces opposed to the Oslo accord "will remain their  hands and will never be subject to any bargaining as long as  there is occupation and settlers."    Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas representative in Jordan, said that  the movement has turned down "an official offer" from the PLO to  participate in the self-rule authority on an equal footing with  Fatah. Nazzal said that the offer was presented during his  meeting in Amman with Zaki, "who told me that he had been sent  by the Palestinian leadership and Yasir 'Arafat personally. He  offered us participation in the authority on the basis of seats  equal in number to those of Fatah." He added that Hamas' reply  to the offer after consideration was "the complete refusal to  participate in this authority, because the movement is against  the (self-rule)" accord. It also considers the Palestinian  authority a tool in the hands of the occupation, not a real  authority."</p>

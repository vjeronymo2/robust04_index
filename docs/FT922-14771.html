			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Election and You): Tax, what the parties are planning for you - But will it hurt your wallet or leave you with a smile come election day? Scheherazade Daneshkhu and John Authers examine the figures The general election campaign has transformed the arid subject of personal finance into a heated political issue. Both leading parties have made sweeping claims: Labour says its plans would make 'eight out of 10' taxpayers better off while the Conservatives reply that everyone would pay an annual average of Pounds 1,250 more under Labour. They cannot both be right. Indeed, accountant Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte concluded this week that all parties - including the Liberal Democrats - would have to raise income tax to meet their spending programmes. So what exactly will the parties do to the tax system if they win next Thursday? Labour and the Liberal Democrats both intend to alter the tax structure and make it more redistributive in order to fund social security and education. The Conservatives want to expand the 20 per cent basic-rate income tax band introduced in the Budget. But it is not only income tax which determines your disposable income. Increases in state funding for health, education and benefits will also make a material difference to most people. VAT at 17.5 per cent eats into disposable income while direct taxation other than income tax - including capital gains and inheritance tax - have had less publicity. With less than a week before election day, here is a quick guide to the parties' plans. Income tax In his election Budget, Norman Lamont introduced a 20 per cent tax band on the first Pounds 2,000 of earnings. The dual aim was to further the Tory goal of lowering taxes - and to squeeze Labour by stressing how the move would benefit the lower-paid. But the total saving is only Pounds 100 a year and it is not targeted just at the low-paid; everybody will get reduced tax bills. Lamont said this week the recession meant there would be little room for further cuts until 1995-96. Labour plans two significant changes in personal taxes. An extra band of income tax, at 50 per cent, will be added for those earning more than Pounds 40,000 a year. It will abolish the annual ceiling on National Insurance contributions (NICs). At present, these are 9 per cent on incomes up to Pounds 20,280. Under Labour, they would be paid at this rate on all annual income - effectively increasing by 9 per cent the marginal rate of tax for all those earning more than this figure. The combined effect of these measures would be painful for people earning in excess of Pounds 30,000. But Labour also plans to raise thresholds, benefitting the lower-paid especially. Plans to levy NICs on investment income have been dropped. The party does not intend to abolish tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) or personal equity plans (Peps). By far the most ambitious income tax programme comes from the Liberal Democrats. They would integrate income tax and NICs. The 20 per cent tax band introduced by Lamont would be abolished and 1p added to the basic rate, making it 26p. There would be three tax bands with the basic-rate band - 35 per cent - applying to earnings up to Pounds 33,000. Between Pounds 33,000-Pounds 50,000, the rate would be 42 per cent. Those earning more than this would pay 50 per cent (41 per cent income tax and 9 per cent NICs). The party estimates that 80 per cent of taxpayers would fall into the first band. Pensioners and small savers would be exempt from NICs and a tax credit system would replace personal allowances. Another sweeping change is replacing all savings schemes - such as Peps and Tessas - with a single savings account which would get tax relief and into which savings for pensions also would go. Labour intends moving in this direction as well, but its plans are much less clear-cut. Capital gains tax The Tories hope eventually to abolish CGT and the Conservative Way Forward group has called on Lamont to reduce the rate at which it is paid. But he played safe in the Budget and simply raised the annual exemption in line with inflation from Pounds 5,500 (for what is left of the present tax year) to Pounds 5,800 for 1992-92. CGT was introduced in its present form by the first Labour government of Harold Wilson. It could reach its nemesis under a Kinnock Labour administration, which would make the amount of CGT payable depend on the length of time a share had been held. Those who retained their assets for a long period would pay less tax than those aiming to make quick profits by short-term 'stagging.' This could be done by imposing two, or possibly three, tiers of taxation. Plainly, such a system would encourage long-term investment, in line with Labour's desire to stimulate industry. But Labour has committed itself to the reform only over the long term - the reason being its great complexity, which might open the way for accountants to devise avoidance schemes. Labour's short-term plans are more prosaic. The CGT threshold will come down to something nearer the threshold for income tax - probably less than Pounds 4,000. This would be chargeable at the payer's top rate of income tax, subject to a maximum of 40 per cent. Labour has consistently denied its opponents' claim that the threshold would be reduced to Pounds 1,000. Margaret Beckett, the party's treasury spokeswoman, says this figure is an 'invention.' The Liberal Democrats would reduce the CGT threshold considerably and everyone would have a Pounds 2,000 allowance. They would also have a Pounds 2,000 investment income allowance to offset against the 9 per cent tax element of National Insurance. But transferability of half of an allowance (Pounds 1,000) from capital gains to income, or vice versa, would be allowed if either was not used fully. Inheritance tax While John Major wants a classless society, he also wants to see 'wealth cascading down the generations.' This statement, made at the Conservative conference last year, led many people to expect either the abolition of inheritance tax (see Professor Cedric Sandford's article on page V) or a reduction in the IHT rate. But again, Lamont was cautious in the Budget. He said he intended to raise the annual exemption by more than inflation from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 150,000 for the 1992 tax year and promised 'to look for ways of lightening the burden of inheritance tax.' In the Finance Act, it was indexed to Pounds 147,000. Labour is planning root-and-branch reform in the other direction. It would base the tax on the beneficiary, rather than the donor, and assess it on a lifetime basis, so doing away with the present (and cumbersome) 'potentially exempt transfers.' As Sandford explains, this would increase sharply the incentive to distribute wealth widely, but it is unlikely to happen in John Smith's first Budget. Like Labour, the Liberal Democrats want to make the beneficiary, not the estate, liable for IHT. But their plans are costed more clearly. This would be one of the few areas in which the wealthy could do better under a Lib-Dem government because it would be easier to avoid paying IHT. Each individual would have a Pounds 50,000 IHT exemption. If an heir received Pounds 150,000, he would have to pay IHT on Pounds 100,000. But if it was left to three heirs, there would be no IHT. There would be exemptions or concessions for family businesses. Labour has not hinted what the level of exemption would be. Pensions Thatcherism shook the pensions industry into action. The big change was to create personal pensions, allowing an alternative to company final-salary schemes and widening choice substantially for savers. Personal pensions have many attractions over Serps (the state earnings-related pension scheme). These include a big rebate of NICs for those who contract out of Serps, and the possibility of superior investment performance. Those already in company schemes can take out additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) which are, in many respects, similar to personal pensions and can boost retirement income significantly. AVCs cannot be made to Serps. The Tories will reduce the incentive for opting out, but their manifesto makes clear they aim to ensure personal pensions remain effective. Labour would take pensions in the opposite direction. For a start, it has pledged that the basic state pension would rise by Pounds 5 a week for single people and Pounds 8 for married couples. Serps would be revamped to offer a pension based on the best 20 years of earnings - especially useful for those who take a long career break. There would also be an increase in the maximum earnings that could be taken into account. Serps would be open to the self-employed and there would be provision for AVCs. All of these measures remove advantages now held by personal pensions and might well lead to many savers moving back into Serps. The Liberal Democrats plan an immediate improvement in state pensions which everyone would receive by right. Single pensioners would get Pounds 5 a week more and married couples Pounds 8. This increase would be funded partly through the abolition of Serps, although those with Serps entitlements would receive their pension from it. In addition, all parties would have to implement equal retirement ages for men and women following a decision by the European Court. Under the Lib-Dems, the retirement age would be 65 for both sexes, with a 'flexible decade of retirement' between the ages of 60 and 70. Labour would also opt for a flexible decade. The Conservatives are undecided.</p>

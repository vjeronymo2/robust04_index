			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE CAR MAKERS  </P> <P> I'm sick and tired of reading so much about the superiority of the Japanese  automobiles and that American cars have not caught up on quality.  </P> <P> I for one feel the design and quality of the big three are as good as any  foreign make. I've come back to buying American cars; I bought an '89 Mustang  convertible last year and recently traded my Nissan for a Ford Ranger truck.  I've come back -- I wish everyone would.  </P> <P> JACK D. GILLESPIE  </P> <P> Diamond Bar  </P></p>

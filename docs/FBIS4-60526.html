			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- The impact of the ongoing  battles between North and South Yemen has reached the Yemeni  Embassy in Cairo. Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah issued a decree relieving Yemen's Ambassador in Cairo  'Abd-al-Jalil Ghilan, a southerner, of his post and recalling  him to Sanaa, appointing Ambassador 'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id, a  northerner, in his place.    Ghilan closed the embassy's electronic doors this morning,  prevented staff from entering to assume their duties, and took  refuge in his residence on the upper floor of the embassy  building. The employees assembled in front of the building,  causing a traffic jam on Amin al-Rafi'i Street in the al-Misahah  area of al-Dukki. A police force imposed tight security around  the embassy.    A security source has stated that the goal of these security  measures is to protect the embassy against storming operations  or riots.    Muhammad Fayid, a diplomatic attache at the embassy, told  MENA that work was supposed to be resumed in the embassy this  morning according to official instructions, which granted  employees a four-day holiday for 'Id al-Adha. But he was  surprised to find the embassy closed.    Fayid said he learned that former Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil  Ghilan, who, as he put it, was recalled by President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, grabbed the embassy keys from the inside guard  and threw him out. Hence, he added, the embassy staff and  diplomats were unable to enter to perform their duties and  render services to the members of the Yemeni community in Egypt  or to the Egyptians.    Fayid commended the Egyptian efforts to resolve the Yemeni  crisis and President Mubarak's appeal for a cease-fire. He said  that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih responded to that  appeal and accepted a cease-fire. But the southern leaders'  decision to break away led the situation to explode, he said.  He denied a separation of North and South Yemen, describing  events as "a mutiny" by a group of renegades and affirming that  the entire Yemeni people support unity. [passage omitted]</p>

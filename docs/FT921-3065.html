			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Norway weighs cost of arms NORWAY'S Defence Commission yesterday unveiled a far-reaching study, based on two-years' work, advocating zero growth in military expenditure over the next 15 years. The commission's recommendation for military spending is 13 per cent lower than that made last Friday by Admiral Torols Rein, the Chief of Defence. It was based on an absolute minimum requirement enabling Norway to defend itself against an invasion for between two and four weeks while awaiting allied reinforcements. The difference in expenditure between the two recommendations is about NKr50bn (Dollars 7.8bn) from 1993, excluding Nato infrastructure costs. But the commission's recommendation is based on its study of the perception of future military threat to Norway and what is necessary for the country to maintain a credible defence structure. The commission's study calls for investment of NKr356.26bn in the period 1993-2008 while Admiral Rein recommends expenditure of NKr421bn during 1995-2012. Mr Kaare Willoch, the former conservative prime minister who headed the Commission, said 14 out of 15 members agreed investment in military hardware should comprise 30 per cent of investment during the next decade. The commission therefore sees a marked shift in military investment from personnel and administration to hardware for the airforce and navy. The two studies will be used as working documents by the Ministry of Defence to plan long-term defence investment.</p>

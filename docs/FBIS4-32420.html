			<p>BFN     [Text] The parliamentary group of the Union of Democratic  Forces [SDS] decided on its own judgment to infringe the  parliamentary boycott because of the bill on amending the Law on  Rehabilitation Victims of Repressions. Stefan Savov, the  group's chairman, told our reporter Antoaneta Puncheva that when  a decision -- he clearly had the boycott in mind -- proves to be  wrong, it has to revoked.    Savov has not received any official reaction from the SDS  National Coordinating Council to the parliamentary group's  decision, which was reached yesterday. The coalition's  political organ will discuss the decision at its meeting on  Tuesday [28 June]. Stefan Savov also denied the rumor that he  is supposed to become prime minister during the term of the  present parliament, implying he will be prime minister of a  caretaker cabinet. I have a big party behind me, he said; I am  not the kind of politician fit to serve in a caretaker cabinet.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: France Telecom poised to join BT's global alliance FRANCE TELECOM seems close to winning its campaign to join Syncordia, British Telecommunications' global alliance. The UK group was originally against the French state-owned company becoming a partner in the venture. It wanted only to do a deal with Germany's Deutsche Telekom and Japan's Nippon Telephone and Telegraph. However, following persistent lobbying through both political and commercial channels, France Telecom has succeeded in winning the principle that it can be admitted. The exact terms of its involvement remain to be finalised. Syncordia, based in Atlanta, Georgia, aims to provide multinational companies with comprehensive communications services. It is part of a trend whereby telecommunications monopolies are trying to compete in foreign markets and provide global services. The industry has been in a frenzy of match-making as companies manoeuvre to form alliances with the most attractive partners. Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, has been trying to attract Deutsche Telekom and NTT into the venture for over a year but has run into a series of obstacles. In particular, France Telecom has put pressure on the German company with which it has close ties, not to join unless it is also admitted. A compromise has now been reached under which the German company is expected to sell on part of the stake it buys from BT to the French company. BT itself is dealing directly with Deutsche Telekom rather than the French concern. The size of the stakes and the number of directors each company would be able to appoint are still unresolved. BT originally wanted 48 per cent with the German and Japanese groups each receiving 26 per cent, but they were unhappy with the junior status this implied. Marketing procedures, such as whether shareholders will compete with each other in signing up customers, have yet to be determined. Such arrangements will need to be carefully drafted if they are not to fall foul of the European Commission's competition regulations. Meanwhile, NTT has to receive permission from its government to take part. BT said there seemed to be a willingness from the German side to reach agreement.</p>

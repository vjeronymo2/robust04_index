			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- The outflow of Russian capital  abroad comprised 10-15 billion US dollars in 1992-1993,  according to chief banker Viktor Gerashchenko.    He told a press conference on Tuesday that a system which is  going to cut short the export of capital was introduced only  this year. It will monitor all import and export operations.    The chairman of the central bank denied press reports that  he  objected to the six economic decrees signed by the president of  late. He said they would help create a favourable climate for  reforms, although certain changes in legislation would be  necessary for that.    Gerashchenko added that the president is expected to sign a  decree lifting certain limitations on the activities of foreign  banks in Russia.</p>

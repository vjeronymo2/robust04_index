			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: FAT-WATCHERS CAN ENJOY A HOLIDAY MEAL FROM GRILL  </P> <P> Memorial Day usually signals the beginning of the outdoor barbecue season, but  it can also begin a period of anxiety for fat-watchers since some favorite  grilled items are major sources of saturated fat -- the dietary element most  recently implicated in raising serum cholesterol.  </P> <P> Beef roasts and steaks, cheeseburgers and frankfurters are among the top  sources of saturated fat in the diet, according to a recent issue of  Environmental Nutrition, a diet, nutrition and health newsletter written by  registered dietitians. Health-conscious consumers should keep this in mind when  planning the holiday cookout menu.  </P> <P> A bill of fare built around lean-meat alternatives (avoiding such items as beef  and pork ribs) and augmented with fresh fruit, vegetable and whole grain  accompaniments will preserve the festive theme of the holiday and still adhere  to recommendations that fat in the diet be held to 30% of total calories.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Newsletter Suggestions  </P> <P> The newsletter suggests: choosing select grades of beef instead of the more  fat-marbled cuts such as choice or prime; using non-stick vegetable sprays;  removing skin from poultry before cooking, and opting for white poultry meat  over dark.  </P> <P> Some other ideas for preparing flavorful but low-fat grilled meals:  </P> <P>  -- Choose lean top round steak, which contains about 166 calories per 3-ounce  cooked serving. Marinate in a tenderizing mixture with a minimum of oil, then  grill.  </P> <P>  -- Season ground turkey with spices or packaged flavorings such as instant  soup mixes to give additional flavor and use as a substitute for ground beef in  hamburgers.  </P> <P>  -- Rub chicken or Cornish hens with a spicy dry marinade or marinate in a  no-oil dressing for extra flavor before grilling.  </P> <P> GRILLED CORNISH HENS  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> 1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon paprika  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  </P> <P> 2 Cornish hens, halved  </P> <P> Combine tomato sauce, oil, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder and cayenne  pepper.

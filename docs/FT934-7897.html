			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Contractors see shift in bids policy LOCAL authority contractors believe that a letter written by Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, to the Financial Times signals a change in the government's guidance on the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations. Where Tupe applies a successful bidder for a local authority contract must take over the workforce on existing terms and conditions, making it harder for private sector companies to compete. In his letter Mr Baldry said: 'It is not for local authorities to dictate in advance whether Tupe applies when they put their services out to tender. This will depend on the contractor's proposals. If they (local authorities) prejudge the issue, and restrict the range of proposals they are prepared to entertain, I will not hesitate to use the powers available to me in law to take action against them.' Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, of Clause 26, the contractors' pressure group, welcomed Mr Baldry's comments. He said they contradicted the government's draft guidance to authorities issued at the end of September, which said that in the event of disagreement between a contractor and an authority Tupe would be held to apply if the local authority received legal advice to that effect. According to contractors this would allow authorities which chose their legal advisers carefully to 'drive a coach and horses through compul-sory competitive tendering'. The environment department said that no decision had yet been made on the draft guidance to authorities, and that Mr Baldry's comments referred only to the advertisements which local authorities place seeking tenderers. At this stage local authorities are not allowed to take a view on Tupe. According to the department they are allowed to do so only after they have seen the contractor's proposals. Mr Baldry's letter also came under fire from local authorities. Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said his advice flew in the face 'both of the law and of common sense'.</p>

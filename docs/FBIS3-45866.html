I make this statement on the basis of two major events: 1)  Asia's economy has grown rapidly. While trying their best to  preserve their existing relative interests, Western countries  have shifted their attention to the Asia-Pacific region. 2) The  sanctions against China by the West have fallen through.  China's important position in the world has been further  established.    The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact  indicated the withering away of a political and economic bloc  and the disappearance of one of the two poles. It represented  an "earthquake of a global scale." Immediately after the  incidents, almost all countries, including developed and  developing countries, reassessed their own strengths and the  world situation to discover their positions on this celestial  body. While repeatedly bringing pressure to bear on China in an  attempt to topple socialist China and to create a "domino  effect," the developed countries made greater efforts to start  an economic war on a global scale to establish themselves as  economic powers in the 21st century, a war which means a keen  competition of the overall strengths of the countries involved.    Under the new situation, China met the challenge calmly and  outmaneuvered the rivals wisely. The development in 1993 proved  China's policy decisions and measures were entirely correct.    China arrived at a correct understanding of itself. A few  years ago some people said that China, the United States, and  the Soviet Union constituted a big triangle. The statement  sounds reasonable from the political point of view. However,  since China has a long way to go to adequately liberate and  develop its productive forces and it still ranks behind many  countries in terms of economic strength, the triangular  relationship cannot be interpreted as a situation of tripartite  economic confrontation. According to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  strategic idea, China will not reach the economic level of  moderately developed countries until the middle of the 21st  century. Even at that time, China's per-capita GNP level will  still lag behind. Therefore, in handling the relationship  between internal and foreign affairs, China puts emphasis on the  former. Namely, China will initially try to succeed in internal  affairs by focusing on economic development. China's foreign  policy will naturally serve this central task.    This does not in any way mean that foreign affairs are not  important. On the contrary, the task of carrying out foreign  policy becomes more strenuous. To create a favorable  international environment for its economic development, China  has pursued an omnidirectional diplomacy. China is willing to  establish and develop state-to-state relations with any  countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,  irrespective of their political systems and ideologies. This  has enabled China to greatly expand its field of activity as  described by the saying: "The wide sea allows the fish to leap  about and the vast sky the birds to fly."    As a third-world country, China has maintained its  traditional friendship with many other third-world countries in  the world. While refusing to treat itself as a "leader," China  has stressed time and again that it opposes hegemony and that it  will never seek hegemony. Such a position wins sympathy and  support from the broad masses of people in the third world.    China has made unremitting efforts to stabilize the  situation  in surrounding areas and has firmly pursued a good-neighbor  policy toward surrounding countries. It has taken positive  steps to solve territorial disputes. For instance, when Indian  Prime Minister Rao visited China, the Chinese Government reached  a consensus with him on preserving peace and security in the  border areas. For those territorial disputes which defy  solution for the time being, we proposed that "relevant parties  shelve the dispute and join forces to develop the disputed  area," thus creating a peaceful environment.    A favorable external environment has proved conducive to  reform and opening up. After several years of rapid economic  growth, China was still able to preserve the favorable economic  momentum in 1993. The GNP increased by 13 percent, the foreign  trade volume may beat the record figure of $190 billion, and the  foreign capital actually absorbed in the January-October period  stood at $17.2 billion.    With these achievements, China basically changed its  position  in 1993.    Some countries attempted to get China into trouble or to  subvert it and regarded the human rights issue as the  breakthrough point, but they ran into a stone wall. At the  international human rights conference held in March this year,  all the proposals against China went down the drain. On the  contrary, a "declaration on development rights," which points  out that right of development is an inalienable human right and  which reflects China's consistent position was adopted by the  conference. In the future, some people in some countries will  continue to make an issue of human rights, but since their  attempts have been seen through, they will not be as overbearing  as before.    Toward the end of 1993, German Chancellor Kohl visited  China.  Soon after the visit, President Jiang Zemin met with U.S.  President Clinton. These two events show that the West realizes  that isolating China will not only put China in trouble, but  also jeopardize their interests, with the result that they  hastily wound up the sanctions against and the plan to isolate  China. President Jiang Zemin's presence at the unofficial  meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization  and his visit to Cuba, Brazil, and Portugal manifested China's  enthusiasm for economic cooperation in the Asia- Pacific region,  which holds a rosy future. President Jiang Zemin's trip also  indicated China has extended its antenna to Western Europe and  Latin America.    The world could not afford to ignore the existence of China  as a political power long ago, and it also cannot afford to  ignore China's economic prospects and potential. In the final  analysis, state-to-state relationships are based on interests.  Western countries cannot develop themselves by turning away  from Asia, a huge and attractive market, while China is an  important country in this region. American entrepreneurs, who  are very sensitive and are optimistic about China, have made  arrangements to expand business in China. Likewise, the  Asia-Pacific region must develop themselves through intensifying  international trade and economic cooperation. China has now  further consolidated its foothold in the world because, apart  from its political influence, its economy has become an  important link in the global economy. Taking advantage of this  favorable strategic position, China is now holding high the  banner of "peace and development" in the international arena  while holding high the banner of reform and opening up in the  country and seizing on the favorable opportunity to expand.    In 1994 China will introduce a series of major reform  measures. As a result, its economy will further converge with  the world economy, its economic strength will continue to grow,  and its international status will improve, thus enabling it to  play a bigger role in the world. The sudden rise of a unified,  powerful, and prosperous China in the East represents a  historical trend which no force on earth can stop.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Global shopper takes a step out from the shadows - Consumer convergence HARVARD professor Ted Levitt electrified the marketing community in the early 1970s with his belief in the existence of a global consumer. According to Levitt, technology was driving markets in such a way as to make 'different cultural preferences, national tastes and standards vestiges of the past'. But it was not until the late 1980s, when plans for the single market were launched and acted as a catalyst for new thinking, that the degree of consumer convergence across countries became a live issue for the mass of companies. Today it is commonplace to hear companies as diverse as Shell and Suchard justifying their strategies in terms of common consumer trends, the internationalisation of the media and the growing irrelevance of national boundaries. But to what extent are these beliefs valid? And what are the implications for companies? There is no doubt that there are powerful common trends operating across Europe. For example, all the major European countries are experiencing a significant decline in their youth population. This will affect both the personnel policy of all companies as well as the strategies of individual companies, such as Heineken and Nike which have traditionally relied heavily on this group for their sales. Equally, the incomes of Europeans in work continue to increase - albeit at a different pace, but with the same kind of consequences. It is helping to raise consumer expectations, lessening deference towards companies and reducing the willingness to accept inferior products and services. At a sector level, common needs can also be seen to be emerging. The growing inability of all governments to finance welfare state systems is raising fears among consumers, especially older ones, about their ability to fund their retirement. Some governments, such as in Italy, have reacted by raising the retirement age and tightening eligibility criteria, rather than by privatising pension provision in the way that the UK has done. Yet there is some common ground in pension and saving product opportunities across Europe. But in spite of a background of increasing uniformity, the evidence of continued differences across Europe is overwhelming. In each case, these differences can be traced back to variations in factors such as legislation, government policy, corporate marketing strategies, retail environments and product availability. Two examples are: A higher proportion of people in Germany and the Netherlands place the environment at the top of their list of concerns and there is no reason to suppose this situation will change. Legislation which applies to packaging in Germany, together with the pro-active policies of national retailers, have been critical in shaping consumer attitudes and are unlikely to be copied with anything like the same force in other countries. Throughout Europe, higher levels of education, reduced deference towards the medical establishment and the desire of governments to contain health spending have combined to provide a boost to over-the-counter drugs sales. But the tendency for consumers to consult their doctor or pharmacist for an ailment such as a cough varies considerably. Again, continued differences in payment systems and in the relationship between doctors and pharmacists will perpetuate this situation. It is to be expected that some of the differences between countries will be eroded by some powerful forces. In particular, the consumer's desire to be different and to experience new things cannot be underestimated. For each Englishman who starts eating croissants for breakfast and drinking wine, there is a Frenchman who is taking up cereals in the morning and drinking beer with his evening meal. To this extent, cross-country European niches will develop. At the same time, companies are playing a key role in stimulating convergence. The growth of international brands such as McDonald's, Ikea, Nike and Toys R Us and the increased co-ordination of company marketing policy - think of the way in which Unilever has rolled out brands such as Radion across Europe - are raising the number of common experiences. These factors could prove the most important in promoting convergence. Others are not quite as important as they might at first appear. After all, when taking into account factors such as holiday taking, it must be recognised that for most Europeans this is still a domestic phenomenon. The relaxation of protectionist legislation has not significantly changed behaviour. Germany's removal of beer purity laws did not lead to an avalanche of imported beers. European niches are emerging but national and regional differences still need to be considered. Co-ordinating activities while being sensitive to local market conditions is a difficult task - and one at which few companies have excelled.

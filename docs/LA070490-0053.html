Edward Nison hailed the conviction as a landmark in anti-gang  prosecution, although he described the law's impact in the Madrigal case as  minimal because by law, Madrigal will be required to serve a longer term than  15 years, the longest term the gang membership provision could ensure. "In this  case the practical affect isn't significant," Nison said,  </P> <P> Madrigal's attorney, Mel Brown, said his client will appeal the conviction.  </P></p>

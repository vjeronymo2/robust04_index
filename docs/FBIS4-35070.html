			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] The United Nations has allocated funds to foster  Cuba's efforts and experience against drug trafficking. The  United Nations will contribute $1.019 million to the Cuban  program against drug trafficking. This will help to acquire  supplies and equipment for Interior Ministry units and Customs.  This was announced in Havana by members of the Cuban Drug  commission. Dr. Zenaida Osori, first vice minister of Justice,  pointed out that Cuba's geographical location between suppliers  and consumers requires constant vigilance.    Cuba's efforts in this regard have been praised by diverse  international organizations. The members of the commission went  on to explain that the increase in Cuban tourism requires  maximum quality and that all those involved in the fight against  drugs are working toward that goal. It was also announced that  as of 30 December 1993, 79 operations took place and that  3,364.297 kg of cocaine and 1,353.291 kg of marijuana washed up  on Cuban shores. So far this year, however, there have been only  11 cases, not of smuggling, but of foreigners carrying small  amounts for personal use.    The members of the Cuban Drug Commission wonder whether drug  traffickers have stopped using Cuba as a bridge or if Cuba has  improved its operations. Cuba is waging the war of good against  evil.</p>

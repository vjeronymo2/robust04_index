			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa improves after losses Johannesburg saw some recovery from its recent heavy losses in mostly slow trade, although many investors continued to hold back, still worried about uncertainties in other equity markets. The overall index finished 34 better at 5,487, and industrials picked up 72 to 6,359 after Monday's 190-point fall. Gold shares ended a net 6 lower at 2,084, bargain hunters having provided late support after the sector saw some earlier pressure following bullion's overnight losses. De Beers and Anglos pared early gains to end only mildly better, each adding 25 cents at R109.50 and R230.25 respectively. SAB posted a strong R3 recovery to R89 and Remgro finished unchanged for the second consecutive day at R26. Gencor firmed 35 cents to R10.35 and Richemont rose 85 cents to R39.85.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / US health care reform proposals Mrs Hillary Clinton yesterday met Democratic and Republican members of Congress as the White House's efforts to build momentum for its healthcare reform proposals gathered speed, George Graham reports from Washington. Administration officials are telling members the reforms will trim more than Dollars 90bn (Pounds 58.4bn) from projected government spending over the years from 1994 to 2000, despite expanding the types of care paid for by insurance and despite extending a guarantee of coverage to an estimated 35m people who currently have no insurance. Many members of Congress are sceptical about the prospects of actually saving money with the reforms, despite an estimated Dollars 105bn of revenue to be generated in 1994-2000 by an increase in the cigarette tax.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (29): Software to the rescue - Faster faxes / From PC to PC THE fax machine has emerged as a wonderful piece of communications technology which is held back by inefficient software - software in the form of the human users. Computer software is now coming to the rescue in the form of packages which enable users to send and receive fax messages directly from and to their personal computers (PCs), writes John Kavanagh. The trouble with the fax machine, the argument goes, is that the user typically has to print the document to be sent, fill in a cover sheet, walk to the fax, load the document and dial, wait around 45 seconds for each page to go through the machine, possibly wait for the transmission report to be printed, walk back to the office and file the document. All this is eliminated if the user can send the fax directly from a PC. Mr Tony Adams, telecoms manager at international law firm Clifford Chance, points to this fact as a benefit of installing an automated system. 'People no longer spend time standing over a fax machine,' he says. 'That was an expensive pastime because in effect they were doing nothing.' UK and US studies highlight the costs of the manual procedures. The International Computer Fax Association, based in the US, calculates that if an organisation sends just 25 faxes a day it will save over Pounds 12,000 a year on labour costs alone by using an automated system. In the UK, European Printing Systems, which sells a fax package, concludes in a detailed costings report that in an organisation sending 40 three-page faxes a day, the time spent on the task adds up to two-thirds of one person's work. Its study shows that it takes over seven minutes to print, send and file a document with two pages plus a cover sheet. On incoming faxes there are variable costs of sorting and distribution, depending on each organisation's individual arrangement. Mr Martin Hannah, managing director of system supplier Topcall, says all these costs, largely overlooked by senior management, need prompt attention, given a Gallup survey showing that the number of faxes sent in the UK will increase by over 130 per cent this year. Tony Adams at Clifford Chance confirms that significant staff savings are possible. The firm sends and receives more than 20,000 pages every day by fax at its London head office and used to have 50 central fax machines and 50 more dotted around the building. By installing an automated system - and without providing direct links to PCs - its central service has been extended to a 24-hour operation without increases in the 22 fax and telex support staff. The European Printing Systems study also details printing and stationery costs. These add up to 8.4p for a cover sheet and a two-page letter using headed stationery. A three-page incoming fax costs 6p in stationery. If it is then photocopied, this adds 4.2p. The organisation both sending and receiving 40 faxes a day thus spends almost Pounds 1,935 a year on stationery. The other cost highlighted by system suppliers is that of transmission. Costs can be cut by up to 30 per cent if faxes are sent at cheap rates. Office fax machines can be loaded with a document and programmed to dial and send unattended in the evening. However, Martin Hannah at Topcall believes that 'very very few machines ever get programmed, and then only in some limited way'. Almost all the manual and stationery costs can be eliminated by automated systems. Users do not leave their seats to send faxes but press a few keys on the PC keyboard. Images of incoming faxes are typically inspected on a screen by an operator and directed electronically to the addressee. Any number of recipients and transmission times can be set through the keyboard. Stationery costs are cut because documents do not have to be printed. Incoming faxes can be filed on an optical disc (CD-ROM), although the European Printing Systems report assumes half will be printed. However, achieving the savings demands initial investment. Clifford Chance operates a Faxswitch system from Comwave, a combined package of equipment and software. Prices for this system from the top of the range start at Pounds 30,000 and go up to Pounds 120,000. Comwave also offers a package for local area networks: this starts at Pounds 1,495 for up to 20 users and goes up to Pounds 4,500 for 100 users. A system for a single self-contained PC, including the circuit board to attach the computer to the telephone line, costs Pounds 595. Tony Adams at Clifford Chance says the system cost 'a lot of money' but adds that the benefits of tighter control, enhanced service, staff savings and automated archiving have more than justified the cost. The benefits have been achieved even though Clifford Chance has stopped short of linking staff personal computers to the Faxswitch. Tony Adams believes having incoming faxes directed automatically to people's computers raises important issues such as what happens when a person is away for a fortnight: an important fax demanding immediate attention could disappear into the person's computer until his return. The central switching system supports 35 document scanners and 35 laser printers installed over 18 floors and serving 2,000 staff. Central operators can view incoming and scanned documents through 10 A3 screens. Two supervisor screens handle a range of tasks, including queue management and time deferrals. 'All faxes are now logged automatically, so we know if a fax has arrived or been sent,' Mr Adams says. 'The built-in accounts package means jobs can be costed accurately and automatically. This was previously done on paper, which meant people forgot to log faxes and the information might be illegible - we can now account for a greater proportion of faxes, so we have better management control. The accounting information is passed to our accounting system on our IBM AS/400 computer on floppy disc.' Fax images are archived on to an optical storage system. Mr Adams says the introduction of this system 'was like moving from a quill pen to a word processor': faxes used to be photocopied and filed manually. The broadcast facility is used extensively. As Tony Adams puts it, 'It's much faster and easier to send a 15-page document to 50 people.' Service to staff has improved considerably, Mr Adams says. Previously the fax service was similar to a central internal mail service. Today incoming faxes are directed automatically to a laser printer in a mail room on each floor and delivered by hand. Outgoing documents can be put through a local scanner operating 12 times faster than a fax machine. The number of fax machines has been reduced to around 15. Tony Adams says: 'we're realistic enough to know you would never do away with them completely. There will always be someone who wants his own machine and they provide back-up in case of a disaster.'

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Alleged fraud at BA probed A POLICE report into allegations of fraud in the property maintenance department of British Airways is being studied by the Crown Prosecution Service, BA and the police said yesterday. At least 11 people have been questioned and released on bail. Details of the investigation have emerged within weeks of the exposure of a 'dirty tricks' campaign by BA against rival airline Virgin Atlantic. The allegations involve claims that payments were made for maintenance work which was not carried out or that duplicate payments were made for the same work. Yesterday BA denied a newspaper report that it had sold surplus engines which were unserviceable because they no longer had their logbooks from its fleet of Trident aircraft. 'BA does not sell serviceable engines without their logbooks except to museums and to local authorities running, for example, apprenticeship training schemes,' it said. Meanwhile BA confirmed that it had had 'good and constructive' talks last week with Virgin Atlantic aimed at striking a peace deal over the 'dirty tricks' but refused to give details. It also refused to comment on reports that Lord King, appointed BA president after stepping down as chairman last month, would receive between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 600,000 a year.

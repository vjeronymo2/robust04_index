			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: China questions Murdoch bid for 22% stake in TVB MR RUPERT Murdoch's bid to enter Asian broadcasting is in doubt after China yesterday questioned the wisdom of allowing him to buy 22 per cent of Television Broadcasts (TVB), Hong Kong's leading broadcaster. The semi-official China News Agency (CNA) warned the Hong Kong government that careful research was needed to determine if the public interest would be affected by Mr Murdoch's purchase of TVB. 'Since it is the general policy of the Hong Kong government to restrict media cross-ownership, deep thought is required before any decision is made,' CNA said. TVB's licence, which is valid until 2000, comes up for periodic review next year. China may well argue that, as the licence is a form of franchise, any change in TVB's ownership ought to be the subject of Sino-British talks. The entry of China into the Hong Kong government's determination of the purchase has cast a cloud over News International's HKDollars 1.85bn (USDollars 239m) offer, unveiled earlier this month. It complicates the already difficult regulatory hurdles Mr Murdoch has to overcome in order to win government approval. To take up his 22 per cent of TVB, Mr Murdoch needs three exemptions from Hong Kong's broadcasting law. The first is the restriction the law makes on foreigners' voting rights. Currently foreign shareholders in a television licensee can vote only up to 10 per cent of a company's stock, even if their share-holding exceeds 10 per cent. Mr Murdoch also needs approval from Hong Kong's Executive Council, or quasi-cabinet, to own more than 15 per cent of a television licensee. Furthermore, he needs an exemption from the limits on shareholder ownership in television companies. News International's purchase of TVB also comes at a time when Hong Kong regulators are drafting tougher cross-ownership regulations. If enacted, these would make it impossible for the owner of newspapers in Hong Kong to control a television station. Mr Murdoch currently owns the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's leading English-language newspaper, and the Wha Kiu Yat Po, a Chinese-language newspaper.</p>

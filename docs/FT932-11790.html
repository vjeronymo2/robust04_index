			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / New PM expands cabinet PAKISTAN'S caretaker prime minister, Mr Balkh Sher Mazari, yesterday expanded his cabinet to a record 50 members, bringing in new groups and a controversial minister from the previous sacked government, Reuter reports from Islamabad. A total of 17 new ministers, 10 ministers of state and three advisers were sworn in, to add to the existing 17 ministers, two special advisers and one special assistant inducted shortly after Mr Mazari took office 11 days ago. Most of the ministers belong either to a faction of Mr Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Moslem League that rebelled against him before he was sacked as prime minister, or to the former opposition led by the Pakistan People's party of ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Among the new ministers was Mr Sardar Aseff Ahmad Ali, who escaped orders for his arrest earlier this month after he resigned as minister of state for economic affairs, accusing Mr Sharif of failing to tackle terrorism.</p>

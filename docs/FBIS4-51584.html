			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Allocation Proves BN (National </F> Front) Sincerity"]    [Text] The approval of an allocation of 500 million ringgit  for implementing projects in Sabah shows the sincerity of the  National Front (BN) government's promise to fulfill its  responsibilities to the people of that still backward state. The  announcement of the allocation was made only a few days after  the BN formed a new government in the state. The allocation  proves the BN government feels that efforts to develop Sabah can  no longer be delayed. It is up to the state government under the  leadership of Tan Sri Sakaran Dandal to speed the process of  preparing a project proposal paper, which needs to consider the  overall benefits to be enjoyed by the people of Sabah. In our  view, although the money may be available, it should not be  spent indiscriminately or without careful study. We should not  be too greedy, as though money were "falling from the sky." The  money is the people's money and needs to be channeled to the  people wisely. Therefore, each proposed project should consider  local economic and social interests in order to avoid waste.  Waste will bring disaster. To ensure efficient management and  administration, social and economic research should be conducted  first.    Considering the present condition of the Sabah people, we  agree with the view of Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar  Ibrahim that projects for supplying water and electricity need  to be given priority. These two basic facilities are normally  the absolute measure of poverty. Naturally, the focus will be on  rural residents, who lived in helplessness under the previous  government, which was led by the Sabah United Party (PBS).    For members of the state legislature (led by the BN) in an  area like that, it is their duty and responsibility to make  detailed recommendations on what the government needs. They can  get information immediately from development officials of the  state or from the respective divisions and districts. The most  effective thing for them to do will be to visit the people and  see their helplessness for themselves, instead of receiving  information while they occupy soft seats in their offices. That  is not the kind of BN member that the people of Sabah are  expecting. BN legislators must serve the people in the best  possible way. We need for them to prove to the Sabah people that  they were elected because of their ability to serve the people  and state of Sabah. For those who left their original parties  and joined the BN, this is their time to prove that, having no  confidence in their original parties, they did not transfer for  their own interests but for the interests of the people.    If, as the BN has charged, the PBS could not develop Sabah  because of its unwillingness to cooperate with the Central  Government, the time has come for BN legislators to prove the  truth of that statement. They need to prove that the PBS has  indeed been an obstacle to progress. Thus, they need to prove  that through the BN the situation will be greatly changed. We do  not want BN legislators to be negligent in taking action, to  give opportunity to the PBS, or to return "unripe fruit" to the  BN. The BN will be tested at least once every five years. We do  not want Sabah to return to its original condition, which will  make it more difficult for us to take power. The experience of  the last election should be a lesson on how hard it is for the  BN to eradicate the state-centered sentiment created by the PBS.    We realize that from now on Sabah needs to act more  appropriately in order to be on an equal footing with states  administered by the BN. Despite enthusiasm, however, we do not  want the BN to slip or follow erratic impulses that cannot  benefit the people as a whole.    We also agree that the government should speed up its effort  to establish a university in Sabah. It is only through building  such a university that we will see all the people of the state,  whether rich or poor, receiving equal benefit. As long as they  have the qualifications, all the people deserve to occupy  Sabah's grand ivory tower.</p>

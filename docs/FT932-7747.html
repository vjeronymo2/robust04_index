			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Foster's signs second Chinese brewing deal FOSTER'S has signed a second joint brewing venture deal in China as part of its push into the fast-growing Chinese beer market. The Australian brewer's subsidiary, Carlton and United Breweries, signed a USDollars 7m agreement with the state-owned Princess Brewery in Guangdong province, south China. Foster's executives expect to invest about USDollars 140m by the end of this century in a network of breweries in China. The Guangdong brewery, at Doumen near the Portuguese enclave of Macao, will be upgraded, and a second brewery built later. Carlton and United Breweries expects to be producing 300m litres a year at the Princess Brewery within five years, compared with present production of 35m litres. On Tuesday, CUB agreed a joint venture with the Huaguang brewery, one of Shanghai's leading brewers. It expects to sign a further agreement soon with a brewer in northern China, and anticipates that within five years it will be producing more beer in China than in Australia. Foster's expects China to displace the US as the world's biggest beer market by the end of the century.</p>

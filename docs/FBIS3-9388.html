The convention adopted the [word  indistinct] declaration and elected delegates to the assembly of  the Serbian Civic Council, which will be held in Sarajevo on 27  March. Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, attended the meeting. Our correspondent  Enes Osmancevic reports on the meeting:    [Begin recording] [Osmancevic] With the genuine feeling of  overall affiliation to Bosnia-Herzegovina as an irrefutable  historical fact, we voice our reason and spirit against  national-fascism expressed in the genocide, which was aimed not  only at creating ethnically pure areas but also at destroying  basic human values. This is the basic message of the  consultative convention of the Serbian people held in Tuzla  today, which was attended by Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member of the  Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The fact that we wanted to live on this territory and that  we  remain living here is the best proof that we did not succumb to  Greater Serbia national hysteria. We voice our condemnation of  the inspirers and perpetrators of war crimes, it is said in the  joint statement of ethnic Serb citizens who attended today's  convention.    Rejecting, as he put it, all forms of tribal loyalty to  Karadzic, Koljevic, and Plavsic, (Miso) Bozic expressed the  stand that was accepted as the basis for the statement by Tuzla  delegates to the forthcoming Sarajevo convention. It reads as  follows: We accept joint life in Bosnia-Herzegovina as an  independent, sovereign, united state within its internationally  recognized borders, which was for centuries adorned by a  multinational and multicultural character.    Addressing the people present, Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member  of  the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, proposed the following:    [Pejanovic] [Words indistinct] halting of all military  activities and offensives on the part of the Serbian side with  the decisive pressure by the international community to control  a cease-fire and peace in all points [words indistinct].    Second, we demand that the Serbian side be included in  negotiations on an overall peaceful solution for  Bosnia-Herzegovina under the auspices of the United Nations, the  United States, the European Union, the Russian Federation, other  countries, and all other factors participating in determining  our destiny.    Third, we think that the federal [word indistinct] setup  based on cantons is a basis for reaching a global solution for  peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is really involved is a  slight modification of the well-known Vance-Owen plan, which was  not given full support (?then) in the given historical  situation. In our opinion, that is one of the best solutions  that keeps the wholeness of Bosnia-Herzegovina and enables  equality of the peoples, as well as self-assurance [samobitnost]  and cultural autonomy.    Fourth, we think that Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a joint state  of  equal peoples, in its wholeness within internationally  recognized borders, according to the Republican Presidency's  platform on the work under war conditions, has economic,  cultural, and national interests of Muslims, Serbs, and Croats.    Fifth, we propose that it is in the ultimate interest of all  peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina that the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina join the union of European countries and  thereby ensure its economic and cultural prosperity and  restoration [words indistinct] interests in Europe. [applause]    Sixth, I propose to demand that the Serbian Civic Council  take part in negotiations with the international community on  the political future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serbian Civic  Council will be constituted in Sarajevo on Sunday [27 March] as  the proponent of the interests of ethnic Serbian citizens in  Bosnia-Herzegovina who favor a just peace, the equality of  peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, civil and human rights, and  Bosnia-Herzegovina in its historical and internationally  recognized borders. [applause]    [Osmancevic] Supporting the assembly of ethnic Serb citizens  which, as was said, together with the Pan-Bosniak convention and  the assembly of Croats, is striving toward a full respect for  human and civil rights, which are a prerequisite of a modern  democratic society in which national, cultural, religious, and  other characteristics of all citizens of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be respected, cherished, and admired,  the Serb People's Convention held in Tuzla today has elected  delegates to the Sarajevo assembly, where the Serbian Civic  Council will be constituted.

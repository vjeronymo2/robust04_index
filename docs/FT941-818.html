			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Balladur retreats on cutting young workers' pay Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday effectively abandoned his controversial law cutting wages for young trainee workers, in a move designed to end a month of street protests by students and unions. Mr Balladur made his fourth retreat on domestic policy in recent months after government parties did slightly less well than they had hoped in local council elections on Sunday. After meeting student leaders, he announced he had suspended the contrat d'insertion professionelle (CIP) for a week and instructed the head of the ANPE national employment agency to find an alterative system within that time. The CIP, which permits young apprentices to be paid less than the minimum wage, passed into law last autumn. Decrees implementing it were published last month. Though the CIP law has not been formally scrapped - as students and unions have demanded - Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, budget minister and government spokesman, made clear this was the intention. He said the mission of Mr Michel Bon, head of the ANPE, was to 'define a new system and put an end to the CIP'. Student union leaders welcomed Mr Balladur's suspension of the CIP 'as a first step', but said their members would not be satisfied until the law was scrapped. They indicated they might go ahead with a protest march planned for Thursday. As late as last Friday, when 30,000 students marched in Paris against the CIP, Mr Balladur seemed resolved to make an exception to his previous tendency to give way in the face of street protests. He had already watered down the original CIP to maintain the minimum wage for diploma-holders and to strengthen training provisions for unqualified youths receiving less than the minimum wage. But on Sunday night, Mr Balladur promised to 're-establish a dialogue' with the nation's youth and to 'examine various possible solutions' to the CIP. In addition to Mr Bon's mission, which may result in the creation of a special job agency for the 25 per cent of French young who are without work, the government plans to consult a variety of youth organisations. In contrast to his strong policy stands, for example in maintaining French troops in Bosnia or pursuing a firm franc, Mr Balladur has tended to surrender on social issues at home. Over the past year he has yielded to striking Air France employees protesting against lay-offs, to defenders of state education complaining about a proposed improvement in private school finance, and to fishermen demonstrating against imports.

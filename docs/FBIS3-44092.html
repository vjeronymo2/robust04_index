At a media briefing in Johannesburg, the SACP said 16 of the  top 50 candidates on the ANC parliamentary list were SACP  members and not 27 as claimed by the NP at the weekend. SACP  Central Committee member Jeremy Cronin challenged the NP to  produce proof of any other SACP members on the ANC list of 200  candidates for the national assembly.    He said there had been a "flurry of resignations" from the  SACP in 1990 after it was unbanned, but none since. He denied  there were any "sleeping party members". The SACP produced a  copy of the ANC list of candidates with the names of 34 SACP  members marked.    Mr Cronin admitted SACP members made up an "embarrassing" 16  of the top 50 on the ANC list, but stressed these members had  achieved their positions in terms of their records as activists.    SACP Central Committee members who briefed the media were at  pains to point out there had never been a SACP candidate list.  "Early last year we decided not to have a list, but to rely on a  democratic and open (selection) process," Mr Cronin said.    The ANC candidate list released last week had been adjusted,  Mr Cronin revealed. This had been done to ensure a third of the  nominees were women and that members of groups such as the  ANC-led Patriotic Front, Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade  Unions] and the ANC Youth League were adequately represented.  However, the first 85 names on the list were in the order of  the number of votes they had received.    The list was topped by ANC President Nelson Mandela,  followed  by Cyril Ramaphosa, Thabo Mbeki, Joe Slovo, Pallo Jordan and Jay  Naidoo. The SACP had three names in the top 10: Mr Slovo,  Ronnie Kasrils and Sydney Mufamadi.    Former known SACP members such as Ahmed Kathrada and Mac  Maharaj no longer belonged to the party, the media was told. Mr  Kathrada had allowed his membership to lapse and Mr Maharaj had  not rejoined the party when he re-entered politics after a break  in 1990.    SACP members elected to Parliament on the ANC ticket would  be  bound by it, Mr Cronin said. He said according to the new  constitution, party members were not allowed to cross the floor  to form a separate political bloc or to join another party  without losing their parliamentary seat.    He admitted there was a risk the SACP could lose its  identity, but it was a necessary risk. "The key thing (after  the April 27 election) is to unify South Africa."    Fellow Central Committee member Essop Pahad said a decision  to form a separate party caucus had not been taken. He expected  a healthy debate among ANC parliamentarians, and if not the SACP  would "manufacture" one.</p>

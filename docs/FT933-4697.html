			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Brazil plans to curb inflation BRAZIL is next week expected to introduce further measures aimed at curbing inflation, now running at an annualised rate of more than 2,000 per cent. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, is due to give a television address next Tuesday, just over three months after he took over the job, in which he is expected to give a comparatively upbeat assessment of Brazil's growth prospects for this year. He may also confirm some structural changes such as the separation of accounts between the treasury and central bank, designed to make financial movements between the two institutions more transparent. Mr Cardoso has repeatedly claimed he will not launch any economic 'shock' plans before fiscal reforms are in place to deal with the country's structural economic problems. However, some economists believe Mr Cardoso and his economic team are working on such a package. Suspicions have been raised by the recent appointment of Mr Andre Lara Resende as principal foreign debt negotiator and Mr Persio Arida as president of Brazil's development bank. Both men were involved in the now discredited 1986 Cruzado plan, which involved a price freeze and the introduction of a new currency. The presence of President Carlos Menem of Argentina and Mr Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister, at Brazil's annual independence celebrations yesterday has further fuelled the speculation. Ahead of meeting Mr Cavallo, Mr Cardoso said Brazil would not follow Argentina and peg the currency to the dollar to curb inflation. The Brazilian and Argentinian leaders were expected to discuss progress towards eliminating trade barriers within Mercosul, the regional grouping which links the two countries with Uruguay and Paraguay. They will also discuss trade frictions caused by a rapid increase in Brazilian exports to Argentina. Argentina has accused Brazil of favouring its companies with covert subsidies and criticised it for failing to stabilise its economy. Mr Cavallo denies that the Argentinian peso is seriously overvalued. Argentina has resorted to an array of mechanisms to slow the onslaught of Brazilian imports and Brazil has now threatened to retaliate. However, tension comes against a background of rapidly rising trade between the two.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Fleets of cash boxes on wheels - Simon Davies analyses the bus companies' race for acquisitions The UK's biggest bus groups are involved in a race against time. Declining passenger numbers mean that - in the absence of initiatives to encourage urban public transport - acquisitions are the easiest route to meaningful profits growth. The fragmentation of the old government-owned National Bus Company into 90 new companies in 1987 has been rapidly reversed by the private sector. Stagecoach yesterday made its 10th acquisition in a year, at a total cost of Pounds 120m. Many analysts believe that by the turn of the century there will be four or five large operators, assuming they avoid political backlash over the creation of private monopolies. The source of pressure for acquisitions was underlined by the latest Department of Transport statistics, issued last week. These showed a decline in passenger numbers every year in the past decade, in spite of efforts to improve efficiency and service since privatisation. The most up to date figures, charting the year to April 1994, show a fall of 105m in the number of passenger journeys to a total of 4.37bn. This is 23 per cent down on the 5.65bn journeys undertaken in 1984. Given this unhelpful macro-economic picture, operators have had to focus on controlling costs and buying less efficient operators. The four listed bus companies have responded with enthusiasm, making 20 substantial acquisitions in the past year. This has proved fortunate for the government, as it coincided with the privatisation of the 10 London bus operators. Nine of these have been sold, with four going to listed companies and the remainder to management buy-outs. Mr Martin Higginson, economic adviser to the Confederation of Passenger Transport, says: 'The listed companies are making acquisitions because profits from the core businesses cannot expand rapidly.' However, given the increased muscle of the listed companies, bargains are hard to come by. As Mr Higginson says, 'those who made a move in the earliest days of privatisation got good bargains. Now, they are having to pay fair market value.' The operators argue that there are substantial efficiencies to be stamped on an industry with decades of public sector fat, and that takeovers are the best means of advancing the efficiency drive. Buses are cash boxes on wheels, with predictable revenue streams and a cost base which offers big economies of scale. By renewing the fleets, new management has been able to reap the benefits of buying in bulk, and of reduced maintenance costs on vehicles. The extent of this trend was demonstrated by bus manufacturer Trinity Holdings, which in the first half of the year received Pounds 33m of orders from Stagecoach and Badgerline, the two largest listed bus companies. Badgerline plans to buy 450 buses a year in 1995 and 1996 to replace ageing buses that are in turn sold on to developing countries at or above book value. Management structures have been simplified and employment agreements renegotiated. The net result has been a leap in profits, with all the listed companies expected to announce profits growth above 50 per cent this year. However, acquisitions have provided the main thrust for increases and Mr Brian Souter, chairman of Stagecoach, expects that 'there will be a flurry of acquisitions which will go a bit further and then fizzle out'. Recent management buy-outs of bus groups will probably become targets for acquisition at a later stage, but the prices are rising. Mr Souter says there is potential organic growth left in bus companies through management efforts to improve fleet usage, routes and the quality of service. He also suggests that UK companies should look beyond the Channel. 'In the longer-term, the overseas markets are where the privatisation bargains are going to be.' Growing competition is making life harder for the bus companies and politics could create further difficulties. The Office of Fair Trading has already launched a number of investigations into potential monopolies within the bus system. Stagecoach, the largest UK operator with close to 12 per cent of the market, has borne the brunt of these, with 20 investigations by the OFT since 1989 and three adverse rulings. The recent scuffle in Darlington - where the council-owned operator went out of business, complaining that Stagecoach had 'swamped' the city with free buses - suggests that political concerns over competition will remain. The bus companies counter that competition comes from the car and that this will ultimately dictate ticket prices, rather than the existence of other operators. At the same time, they are hoping that the government will help tilt the playing field against the motorist. The recent Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution favoured a push to persuade motorists to convert to public transport. The government has also spoken in favour of such a strategy, although little has yet been done. But the great hope of the bus operators is that growing congestion in the cities will force action. There are already signs of local government initiatives to improve bus services, such as bus lanes. But it will take much more to reverse the trend of declining passenger numbers. Mr Ballinger, managing director of Go-Ahead, said: 'Ultimately we see our future in the urban areas, where we see changes in policy inevitably arising.' However, management will soon start to face the increasing challenge of eking out growth from static revenues.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> UNLIKELY HERO POWERS PIRATES, 6-5  </P> <P> Rey Quinones, who had hit only two home runs all season, wasn't even thinking  about hitting one. Randy Myers, who hadn't given up a home run in 28  appearances this season, certainly wasn't thinking about giving one up.  </P> <P> But Quinones hit a two-run homer off Myers with one out in the bottom of the  ninth inning Saturday, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates a 6-5 victory over the New  York Mets at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Since blowing a 10-run lead in a 15-11 loss to Philadelphia on Thursday, the  Pirates -- who are 5-21 when trailing after six innings -- have rallied for two  consecutive come-from-behind victories over the Mets. They beat the Mets 4-3 in  10 innings Friday night.  </P> <P> Barry Bonds singled to start the Pirate ninth and moved to second on Jeff  King's sacrifice bunt. Quinones, who had doubled and scored in the eighth, then  hit a 1-1 pitch into the left-field seats for his third homer and the first  Myers has given up in 35 1/3 innings this season.  </P> <P> "I wasn't thinking home run, I was just trying to make contact against him,"  Quinones said. "I think I hit it pretty good. We're picking it up now, we're  starting to play like we can, like the real Pirates."  </P> <P> Myers (5-2) had given up only two runs in his previous 23 appearances and had  an 0.31 ERA in his last 28 2/3 innings. He had pitched out of a bases-loaded,  one-out jam in the bottom of the eighth with the Mets leading by a run.  </P> <P> "He caught a fastball and he hit it out, and I knew as soon as it went off his  bat it was a home run," Myers said. "The hitters know that I'm going to be  throwing (fastballs), and it they make good contact, it's going to go a long  way."  </P> <P> Houston 1, Atlanta 0 -- Jim Clancy gave up five hits in 7 1/3 innings as the  Astros beat the Braves at Houston.  </P> <P> The Astros, who have won five straight, are unbeaten in their last 11 one-run  games.  </P> <P> Clancy (4-4) struck out three and walked two. Dave Smith, the third Houston  pitcher, got the last three outs for his 12th save in 13 opportunities.  </P> <P> John Smoltz (7-5) had retired 14 straight before Billy Hatcher singled with one  out in the Houston sixth. One out later, Bill Doran doubled down the  right-field line to score Hatcher.  </P> <P> San Francisco 1, San Diego 0 -- Robby Thompson's triple, one of only two Giant  hits off Ed Whitson, and a sacrifice fly by Will Clark in the third inning were  enough to beat the Padres at San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Giants ended Whitson's seven game-winning streak. Whitson (9-3) also gave  up an infield single by Tracy Jones in the second inning. Whitson walked two  and struck out two in his first loss since April 22.  </P> <P> Scott Garrelts (5-1) gave up six hits in six innings, striking out six and  walking none. The right-hander left the game because of tightness in his  pitching elbow.  </P> <P> Montreal 9, Philadelphia 1 -- Tim Raines' pinch three-run double highlighted a  five-run sixth inning, and Bryn Smith pitched a five-hitter as the Expos beat  the Phillies at Montreal to move within a game of first place in the National  League East.  </P> <P> Hubie Brooks had two RBI doubles and Tim Wallach drove in two runs with a  double and a single. The Expos had 15 hits, three by Brooks, and tied a team  record with eight doubles. The Phillies have lost 13 of 16.  </P> <P> Smith (6-2) struck out nine and walked none for his third complete game. Bruce  Ruffin (0-3) gave up eight hits and two earned runs in five innings.  </P> <P> St. Louis 6, Chicago 0 -- Joe Magrane pitched a six-hitter for his first  complete game of the season, and Tony Pena drove in three runs as the Cardinals  shut out the Cubs for the second straight day at Chicago.  </P> <P> Magrane (4-5) ended a personal three-game losing streak with his sixth career  shutout. The left-hander struck out nine, a career high, and walked two.  </P></p>

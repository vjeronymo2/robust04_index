			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRIO CONVICTED OF HELPING CUBA MAKE FAKE WINSTONS  </P> <P> If these Winstons didn't taste good like a cigarette should, it could be  because they were counterfeited in Cuba.  </P> <P> Three men, including a former R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. engineer, were  convicted Wednesday of violating export laws and the U.S. trade embargo against  Cuba by shipping equipment to the island to make imitation Winstons.  </P> <P> They exported a carton-stuffing machine, cigarette-wrapping equipment, red and  gold ink and other items through Panama to Cuba, where the fake Winstons were  manufactured for export, according to prosecutors.  </P> <P> "It should be a big embarrassment for Cuba," said Keith Prager, who supervises  the investigating U.S. Customs unit. "This case . . . shows how desperate the  Cuban government is, that they are down to counterfeiting cigarettes."  </P> <P> Customs officials heard about the scheme after a tip on some equipment  shipments in March, 1989, and the discovery of 1,800 cases of Cuban-made  Winstons in the Netherlands in August.  </P> <P> Prosecutors claimed that sales of the American cigarettes could have made $2  million for Cuba's foreign exchange-starved economy. It wasn't clear whether  any of the cigarettes were eventually sold.  </P> <P> Convicted after a nine-day trial were former R. J. Reynolds engineering foreman  Michael Macko; Emilio Ortiz De Zevallos, the Peruvian director of a Panamanian  export company, and Frank Van Ameringen, who ran several small tobacco  companies from his home in Miami.  </P> <P> They face prison terms of 15 to 21 months. U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt  set sentencing for July 23.  </P></p>

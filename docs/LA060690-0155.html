			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FRENCH CABINET VOTES BAN ON ALL TOBACCO ADS BY '93  </P> <P> The Cabinet today voted to ban all tobacco advertising in France by 1993 in  what would be one of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws.  </P> <P> The bill would also severely restrict advertising for alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> Ads for hard liquor would be allowed only in publications oriented specifically  toward adults, and these would have to carry a message about the health hazards  of drinking.  </P> <P> A separate bill is expected to be introduced soon that would raise cigarette  prices 15% -- the biggest single hike ever in France.  </P> <P> Cabinet spokesman Louis Le Pensac said: "100,000 people die prematurely in  France each year because of tobacco and excess alcohol consumption. This in an  intolerable human, social and economic cost."  </P> <P> Under the legislation, submitted by Health Minister Claude Evin, all direct and  indirect tobacco advertising will be banned as of Jan. 1, 1993, including the  sponsorship of sports and cultural events by tobacco companies.  </P> <P> Even the use of cigarette trademarks as logos on non-tobacco items, such as  clothing or luggage, would be banned, Le Pensac said.  </P> <P> The law is expected to win easy approval in the National Assembly.  </P> <P> Cigarette manufacturers have contended that a ban on tobacco advertising would  not affect consumption, but they estimate that the proposed price increase will  lower sales by 10%.  </P> <P> Ironically, the government is a major producer of cigarettes. Through SEITA,  the government's wholly owned tobacco company which produces such brands as  Gauloises and Gitanes, it controls about 51% of the cigarette market.  </P></p>

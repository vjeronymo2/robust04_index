			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai: "What </F> Should the Banking Sector Do To Meet the Development Demand of  the Economy"]    [Text] Progress scored in 1993 by the banking sector has  contributed actively to the general improvement of our economy.  Many problems, however, still remain. While discussing  cooperation in financial consultancy with foreign countries, our  prime minister remarked: Finance and money are the two most  important areas when we transform to the market economy under  state management. These areas have made some progress and  achievements. But they are far too short for our demand and too  little when compared with our neighboring countries.    Therefore, in 1994 and the following years, the entire  banking sector must further its renovation and satisfactorily  accomplish the duties outlined in the government program of  action. The important duty and requirement imposed on the  banking sector by the national economy is that it must firmly  stabilize the currency. This is one of the decisive factors for  a stable macroeconomy and for the creation of a safe environment  for savings and investment. Therefore, it must be considered a  paramount duty in monetary management. This is a main and  direct responsibility of the Central Bank and this  responsibility must not be neglected. Although inflation has  decreased and market prices have been relatively stable, our  ability to control inflation is not very strong and the  possibility of increasing inflation must not be considered  lightly.    We resolutely have stopped issuing money to cover budget  overruns. But with its current practice of providing credit  capital to commercial banks, the Central Bank cannot control and  regulate monetary circulation and it cannot fulfill its role as  a last credit provider in the credit system. And the two-level  banking structure outlined by the stipulations of the banking  system has not been correctly implemented.    The control and regulation of monetary circulation becomes  more complicated when development investment rapidly occurs and  foreign capital quickly enters the system. This causes the  investment situation to overheat and damages price stability.  In addition to that, many enterprises, government organs, and  the public still use both U.S. dollars and gold to settle their  financial transactions in the market. The bank cannot control  this practice. In reality, there has been no progress in the  attempt to make the dong the only currency used for financial  transactions in our country. This is an urgent and complicated  issue for the banking sector in its duty to control inflation  and stabilize the currency.    Capital is badly needed to maintain and expand current  business and production enterprises, build new establishments,  and create economic transforming steps for industrialization and  modernization. When the capital market is still primitive and  without the existence of a stock market, the effort to fulfill  the capital demand for different economic sectors and the public  is a great imperative and challenge for the banking sector.    In 1994, the capital reserved for loans by the Investment  and  Development Bank is at least 6,300 billion dong, excluding 3,000  billion dong reserved for the electricity sector. The demand on  capital by different sectors and localities is much greater,  about 20,000 billion dong. Many urgent investment projects have  not been able to find any funding sources.    Present enterprises are badly in need of capital to upgrade  equipment and technology and to meet their higher demand to  circulate capital. Our agriculture and rural areas also demand  a great amount of capital to change their production structure;  to transform the planting and cropping structure in central and  mountainous provinces; and to invest in processing industries,  building material production, and fishing boats. We must  introduce processing industries to rural areas as outlined in  the Fifth Plenum resolution in order to build new rural areas  and improve the peasants' material and spiritual life.    At the mid-term party national conference, Comrade General  Secretary Do Muoi stressed: Internal capital is decisive and  external capital is important in the national construction  process. Internal capital comes from higher economic efficiency,  the practice of frugality, and the continuous rate of  accumulation for investment. To raise internal capital  resources, one must encourage the people to practice thrift for  their own interest and for national prosperity, ensure adequate  developing investment, and create conditions for better  attraction and application of the external capital resource. In  a strategic sense, internal capital has a decisive role,  although in the beginning, external capital may account for a  higher percentage in the total developing investment. According  to the Statistics General Department, at the moment, there is  about 20,000 billion dong (equals to $2 billion) of idle capital  in the public domain. If it can be put to use, it will be an  important source to develop investment.    The banking sector should develop cohesive coordination with  other sectors to widen relations with foreign credit  organizations, which offer acceptable interest rates. This  credit then can be used in various forms as loans to business  establishments and individuals at reasonable interest rates.  This is an urgent task that needs to be started now or we might  miss many development opportunities in 1994.    In the process of transforming to a market-oriented economy,  it is impractical for central-level management to send out  orders on projects to local authorities. The establishment of  projects should be based on the development trend of our  economic structure from now until the year 2000; credit and  investment activities should be oriented by the  industry-agriculture relations. The banking sector should be  sensitive to all new demands, be apt in finding targeted  customers, and be dynamic in soliciting credit partners and not  using the usual sit-and-wait-for-the-customer practice.    Banking activities should be thoroughly revitalized before  they effect changes in the economy. In many countries, banks  never reject a loan proposal that proves to be efficient and  will be repayed. Bankers will find other ways to finance a good  proposal if funds are not readily available, including loans  from other banks, raising funds, or calling for foreign credit.    Current bank interest rates are another issue that needs  reorganization. In the present situation, most business  capital, especially circulating capital, is obtained through  bank loans. When the inflation rate is at a level that makes the  borrower pay annual interest several tens of percent, then it is  excessive and exceeds repayment capacity.    At the current interest rates for bank loans, business  establishments will not be able to create any reserves nor  expand their business after tax obligations are fulfilled.  Business establishments are actually facing this difficulty.  If businesses are unable to develop, their production  activities will not expand or modernize. Competitiveness will  be damaged and they will not be able to avoid further the danger  of economically lagging behind other countries.    The interest rates, therefore, need to be adjusted more  reasonably. This will allow businesses to develop and banks can  develop their credit activities. Business establishments with  sluggish activities need to be reorganized. Bank interest rates  also have a direct relation to banking operation costs, which  presently are too high. Measures should be worked out for more  suitable interest rates.    We must strive for progress in foreign currency management  in  1994. A foreign professor remarked that there is now a trend of  U.S. dollarization in liquidation [USD hoa trong thanh toanfor  banks to guarantee their liquidating ability in all situations,  using faster and more convenient methods, and using less cash.  This will attract more funds for bank reserves. Liquidation  procedures through banks quickly should be modernized. Banks  should have concrete plans for investment in technology and  equipment modernization and use all available fund sources,  including the depreciation allowed by the government or overseas  loans.    The last issue is the urgent need to train bank personnel at  present and for the future. We need to gradually form a  contingent of banking experts. We are also in need of experts  to be sent to work at international and regional finance  institutions.    We need to pay attention to both skills and character when  training staff since these two elements are closely  interrelated. Talent should be coupled with a high sense of  morality, which can be effectively used, in every country. This  is even more important as we pursue a socialist path: bank  cadres should not see money above all else.    The banking sector should strive to fight negativity and  corruption. It has to be reorganized to get rid of excessive,  annoying, and redundant procedures. It also has to eliminate  authoritativeness and other disturbing attitudes. This way  people will see that the banking sector truly serves the  people's interests and the national economy. The trust of the  people and customers is a decisive element for the  competitiveness of the state bank 21/03] in Vietnam. This is  a dangerous trend and we need to be careful, especially when  using the U.S. dollar to lend and repay capital and interest.  We have to prepare positively and start as early as possible to  carry out all operations of exchange, trade, and liquidation for  goods and services using Vietnamese currency. All  establishments with income in foreign currencies should sell  those currencies to banks. Business establishments, according  to operations demands, presently can keep suitable amounts of  foreign currencies in their bank accounts for use to import  supplies and materials for production activities or to expand  business. Banks should ensure that business establishments can  easily purchase foreign currencies whenever needed. Banks  should operate in accordance with the economic structure and not  rely on administrative orders to buy and sell foreign currencies.    Bank liquidation operations made some progress, but they are  mainly manual and backward when compared with foreign banks.  The target for the year 1994 is for banks to guarantee their  liquidating ability in all situations, using faster and more  convenient methods, and using less cash. This will attract more  funds for bank reserves. Liquidation procedures through banks  quickly should be modernized. Banks should have concrete plans  for investment in technology and equipment modernization and use  all available fund sources, including the depreciation allowed  by the government or overseas loans.

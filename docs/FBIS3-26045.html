Wan Yueyuan, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of  Zhejiang, presided over the meeting. Chai Songyue, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee and vice governor,  transmitted the national economic work conference guidelines.  Li Zemin, secretary of the provincial party committee,  delivered a speech on behalf of the provincial party committee  standing committee to express views on how to implement the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decision  and the provincial party committee's work in 1994.    Li Zemin said: The next five years will be a decisive period  for forming an operational mechanism for a socialist market  economy in this province and fulfilling the second-step  strategic goal ahead of schedule as well as a period for laying  down a good foundation for realizing modernization by 2010. The  new provincial party committee is formed in a critical period of  accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive, so it has a great responsibility. You  members, especially standing committee members, must do your  best to fulfill your duties, persist in serving the people  wholeheartedly, study diligently, and constantly raise your  ideological, theoretical, and leadership levels. You should  promote unity, strictly implement the democratic centralism  system, and consciously accept supervision from various sides.  We must take a new attitude and a new style of work,  concentrate all forces to accomplish various tasks set by the  provincial party congress, be worthy of the trust of the people  of the whole province, and never let the party Central Committee  down.    Li Zemin said: Next year will be critical for promoting  reform in an all-round way and maintaining a fast and healthy  development of the economy. It is extremely important to do  well next year's work. The general demands for our work in the  next year are: Firmly take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line as our guidance; implement in an all-round way the  14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, and the Ninth Zhejiang Provincial  CPC Congress guidelines; take advantage of current opportunities  to speed up reform and development; correctly handle relations  between reform, development, and stability; persist in  "attaching importance to both spiritual and material  civilizations"; maintain social stability; and promote a  sustained, fast, and healthy development of the national economy.    Li Zemin pointed out: Next year will be critical for  promoting reform in an all-round way while centering around the  work of establishing a socialist market economic structure. It  will also be a year to deepen and expand the scope of reform  with great difficulties. We must fully understand the  complicated and arduous nature of promoting reform in an  all-round way. Party committees and governments at various  levels must make greater efforts and strengthen their leadership  over the reform work, pay attention to solving key problems,  plan and organize reform work carefully, insure stability,  reduce risks, and strive to achieve success in the reform work.  We should stress the following five points: 1) It is necessary  to continue the work of changing the enterprises' operational  mechanism and take the reform of the property rights system as  the breakthrough point in experimenting with the modern  enterprise system at selected units. 2) It is necessary to give  prominence to establishing and developing various markets for  the basic means of production while consolidating and improving  the existing commodity markets. 3) It is necessary to continue  the social security system reform. 4) It is necessary to  promote comprehensive reform in finance, taxation, banking, and  investment in a planned manner. 5) It is necessary to promote  organizational reform and change government functions.    Li Zemin pointed out: We must adhere to the main direction  of taking advantage of the current favorable conditions to  accelerate reform and development, and should follow the central  guidelines of relying on reform in promoting development. We  must not seek rigid uniformity in the speed of economic  development. We should make the investment structure as  effective as possible and increase the returns on investment.  The general demand on economic work is to raise economic  quality and efficiency through reform, reorganization,  transformation, structural adjustment, technological progress,  and improvement of enterprise management. We should stress four  points: 1) It is necessary to strengthen leadership over  agricultural work and give priority and prominence to the work.  2) It is necessary to further open up to promote reform and  development. While increasing the total volume of  export-oriented economy, we should also pay attention to  quality. 3) It is necessary to adjust the production structure  and raise economic results. 4) It is necessary to continue the  speedy construction of infrastructure works and make great  efforts to reduce the limits of "bottlenecks."    Li Zemin pointed out: To accomplish next year's reform,  construction, and other tasks, we must persist in paying  attention to "both links" [liang shou zhua 0357 2087 2119] and  maintain a stable social and political environment. We should  promote reform and construction amid stability, and rely on  reform and construction to insure long-term stability in  society. This should be an important principle in next year's  work. First, we should control the level of price increases and  do a good job in improving people's living conditions. Second,  we should do a good job in six things [liu jian shi 0362 0115  0057] solidly. Third, we should correctly handle various kinds  of contradictions in society, and do a good job in the  comprehensive management of public security. Fourth, we should  promote socialist democracy and the construction of the legal  system. Fifth, we should firmly unfold struggles against  corruption and achieve effective results step by step.    Li Zemin emphatically pointed out: To accomplish various  tasks in the next year, the key lies in strengthening and  improving the party's leadership. We should improve ourselves,  have a new mental outlook and style of work, do things in  solidly, and make actual achievements. To improve the party's  own building, first of all, we must pay attention to improving  the leading bodies at county and above level. We should  consider the work of organizing the study of Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping as a work of primary  importance. Meanwhile, we should also study well the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Committee decision. We should  train all leading cadres at and above county level next year.  We must not slacken our efforts to improve the ideology and  work style of leading cadres. Party committees at various  levels must set strict demands on leading cadres, and train and  supervise them strictly. We should attach great importance to  the building of party organizations at the grass-roots level.  In particular, we should continue to improve the backward party  branches in rural areas and actively explore ways to improve  party organizations in village and town enterprises and "joint  ventures, cooperative ventures, and wholly foreign-owned  enterprises." We should do a good job in admitting new party  members from plants, rural areas, science-technology research  institutes, and the education front. Leading cadres at various  levels should conscientiously and honestly perform their duties  and effectively improve their leading style. First, the  provincial party committee should concentrate on discussing and  tackling major issues, hold periodic meetings to analyze current  situation, and have a good grasp of the trend of economic and  social development. It is necessary to attach importance to  investigation and study. Provincial party committee standing  committee members should at least spend two months at lower  levels and make one or two investigation and research reports  according to their respective duties for reference when the  standing committee makes policy decisions. Second, they should  take the whole situation into consideration, coordinate the work  of various sides, establish a responsibility system for their  respective duties, and develop the role of the provincial party  committee and its standing committee. Third, standing committee  members should pay attention to supervision and inspection, and  plan to carry out inspection work. They should timely supervise  and check the implementation of provincial party committee  arrangements. Standing committee members and concerned  departments should report to the provincial party committee, and  each level should check the work of the lower level to ascertain  the implementation and results of various resolutions. Fourth,  it is imperative to forbid formalism and reduce "documents and  meetings" and various kinds of social activities. Meetings and  speeches should be short, and things should be done in an  effective manner with actual results.    Those attending yesterday's plenary meeting were provincial  party committee members and alternate members. Provincial  discipline inspection commission members, leading party cadres  at and above deputy provincial department head level, veteran  party comrades, party committee secretaries of various cities  (prefectures) and counties, various mayors, various prefectural  commissioners, responsible members of the provincial people's  congress and the provincial committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, and principal responsible  members of party committees (leading party groups) of various  provincial level departments attended the meeting as observers.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Following a statement by President  Francois Mitterrand, who "exclaimed" that if he were 20 years  younger, he would run again for president and "beat everybody,"  Francois Bazin comments in the 3-9 March Paris weekly LE NOUVEL  OBSERVATEUR that "subtle" observers "decoded" the president's  message as follows: 1) the Right is weakened by its internal  divisions 2) the Left can win the 1995 presidential elections 3)  it must have a candidate who can "seize the opportunity" 4) with  Mitterrand unable to run "because of his arteries" and Socialist  Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard out of the running "due to poll  results," EC Commission President Jacques Delors is the only  remaining candidate.    According to Bazin, Delors "is benefitting from  extraterritoriality." While he possesses experience, he is seen  as a "new man" and has not been affected by the disenchantment  of the French with Europe. Were the presidential candidate to be  designated by opinion polls, Delors would be nominated, Bazin  comments. However, Mitterrand has taught the Socialists that the  laws of public opinion are unlike those that rule parties, and  that "faith in one's destiny can modify the most delicate  situation." Therein lies the difficulty of "operation Delors,"  Bazin contends. Delors himself has long wavered and his  statements have contributed to confusing the issue. Meanwhile,  only a Rocard "faux-pas" could deny him the nomination and the  June European Parliament elections may in fact settle the  situation. If the Rocard list receives less than 20 percent of  the vote, many in the PS would abandon the first secretary,  switching their support to Delors, Bazin contends. On the other  hand, if a "window of opportunity" opens this summer for Delors,  no one believes the EC Commission president would reveal his  intentions before the end of 1994, when his presidency comes to  an end. This leaves Rocard a valuable six months to overcome a  possible defeat in the June elections. Bazin notes that in this  case, the only solution for Delors partisans would be a strategy  aimed at the progressive attrition of Rocard's positions, to let  the PS leader understand that the preservation of his work  demands his voluntary "self-effacement to the benefit of Delors,  Bazin concludes.    According to a brief article in the 24 March Paris weekly  PARIS MATCH entitled "Will There Be a Rocard-Delors War?",  Rocard acknowledges he is dropping in the polls at a time when  the Left itself is on the rise. The article cites a close Rocard  aide as saying that the PS first secretary must no longer  confine himself to "beating on Balladur, but ought to widen his  audience" by addressing people's problems and their solutions.  The article also notes that Rocard is "lucky," because Delors  has no intention of interfering with his plans in the belief  that the PS leader has a right to run for the presidency. At the  same time, a Delors confidante is quoted as pointing out that  while the EC Commission president will "do nothing against  Rocard," it does not mean he would not be a candidate if a  "stagnating" Rocard decides not to run.</p>

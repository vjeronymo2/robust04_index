			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Hanson raises dividend: First-half profits up to Pounds 683m  -Bonham looks for acquisitions Hanson surprised the stock market yesterday by increasing its quarterly dividend, from 2.85p to 3p, when announcing half-year pre-tax profits up from Pounds 507m to Pounds 683m, a figure buoyed by Pounds 333m of disposal profits. Lord Hanson. chairman of the Anglo-American conglomerate, also gave an upbeat view of trading, saying 'our return to profit growth at the operating level is now established'. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said economic recovery in the US and UK, an accelerating trend in underlying profits growth, the resolution of uncertainties such as the US coal strike, and the improvement in the group's balance sheet meant 'we feel positive enough to increase the dividend'. He said Hanson would not have raised the dividend unless it was sure the new level was sustainable. Fully-diluted earnings per share rose from 7.7p to 9.9p in the six months. He added that the dividend increase put Hanson on one of the highest yields in the FT-SE 100 index. The stock market started to erode that yield by pushing the share price 5 1/2 p higher to 268 1/2 p at the close. The initial reaction had been better, though, with the shares jumping to 273p before easing back. Some analysts, who had not expected a dividend increase for another three or six months, applauded the move but others questioned whether it was prudent. One said: 'They are already paying a high dividend. There is no reason to pay more.' He added that last year's dividend had been covered by earnings only 1.3 times - 'a very uncomfortable ratio compared with the rest of UK plc'. Another suggested Hanson had 'an in-built desire to please the market and get the share price up' to use shares for acquisitions, and that had prompted the increase. It was the first rise in the quarterly dividend since December 1992. In December last year, when reporting full-year figures, the 1993 final dividend was not increased for the first time in the group's 30-year history. Mr Bonham said underlying operating profits rose 8.4 per cent in the half-year to March 31, with the pace quickening between the first and second quarters. Quantum Chemical, the US polyethylene and propane group bought last September for Pounds 2bn, had added to earnings in its first six months, contributing Pounds 70m of profits before Pounds 40m of interest costs. After the Quantum deal Hanson's gearing rose to 86 per cent, but a disposal programme had cut it to 69 per cent at the end of March. With an expected further reduction in the second half, Mr Bonham said: 'We're prepared to look at acquisitions from here on.'

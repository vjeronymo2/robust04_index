			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Corporate funds for arts down 13% BUSINESS sponsorship of the arts fell by 13 per cent to Pounds 57.69m in the year to the end of March, the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts said yesterday. It is the first annual decline the association has recorded. Company expenditure on events such as concerts, art exhibitions, opera and dance performances was only slightly down, from Pounds 45m to Pounds 44.4m. But contributions to capital projects fell to Pounds 5.4m from Pounds 12.5m. This was due partly to the near-completion of the new Glyndebourne Festival Theatre, the largest privately funded arts project in the UK. Involvement in corporate membership schemes - an important source of revenue for large arts companies such as the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden - and the Royal National Theatre, marked time in 1992-93 at Pounds 7.9m. It remains a considerable retrenchment on the Pounds 12.5m that companies paid for guaranteed seats at the opera and ballet in 1990-91, before the recession forced many to economise on corporate entertaining. Mr Colin Tweedy, the association's director-general, said the main reasons for the fall in expenditure were the disappearance of the Japan Festival and the Glyndebourne factor.</p>

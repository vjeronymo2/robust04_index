The fruitless attempts to find a compromise with Taci, who  proclaimed the leadership illegitimate at the Gostivar meeting  last month, have, after all, been the elementary reasons for the  repeated postponement of the congress, announced for 15 January.  The efforts for a compromise between the two currents (the  Committee and the "hard current") have, as a matter of fact,  been urged by the Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. The  idea was to fuse the Committee and the commission composed of  members of the "Gostivar meeting" into a new body, which would  then be in charge of the preparations for the Congress. For  that purpose mediators from the Coordinating Board of Albanian  parties (in former Yugoslavia) were elected. However, the  meeting in Pristina two days ago ended without success, because  representatives of the "Gostivar meeting" did not arrive. This  was stated in the report signed by the Pristina mediators Femi  Agani, Izmi Islami, and Riza Halimi. Thus, it seems that these  negotiations have ended, nevertheless, well-informed sources  claim that the Taci group is proceeding with its contacts with  Tirana. A delegation of this group, headed by Aliriza Loga,  paid another visit to its "sponsors," as our sources said, and  recently "a new envoy from Albania" visited Debar [Macedonia].  It is even claimed that the Taci group is not very interested  in the congress, because it intends to form its own party. The  assemblies of the Tetovo, Gostivar, and Struga branches have not  taken place (it is a precondition for the congress) and they are  expected to be held by the end of this week. If that happens,  the congress could be postponed for a week or two. The Congress  Preparatory Committee has to put forward presidential candidates  for the PDP. As we have stated several times, delegate  Abdurahman Aliti, vice chairman of the Macedonian People's  Assembly Djeladin Murati, and head of the PDP delegate group  Muhamed Halili were mentioned as candidates for this function.</p>

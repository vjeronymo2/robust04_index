			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO has apologized to  Cuba, a bishop, and its readers for printing false information  about the Cuban Government and the religious leader, who  allegedly attended a summit with Colombian guerrillas. The  newspaper claims it was the victim of a obscure intended set-up,  the mastermind and objective of which still have not been  identified.    The Colombian newspaper admitted that a professional and  serious examination of the sources, reconfirmation of the data,  and a confrontation with those affected would have unmasked the  sources and prevented the publication of false information. El  TIEMPO also points out the falsehood of Colombian Prosecutor  General Gustavo de Greiff's statements, which gave the  information an apparent credibility. The Cuban Government and  the highest Colombian authorities promptly and repeatedly denied  Havana's involvement with the alleged so-called guerrilla  summit. The newspaper goes on to say that the legal editor and  the head of the editorial staff have tendered their resignations.</p>

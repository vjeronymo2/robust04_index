In all, 1,024 candidates  from 13 parties and blocs and 12 independent candidates are  running for 104 seats in the new parliament. But the election  represents not merely a formal change of deputies in Moldova's  top legislative body, but also a kind of referendum on the  future path of the state's development.    The Agrarian Democratic Party, clear favorite in the  election  marathon, is in favor of preserving state independence. The  Socialist, Social Democratic, and other parties are fighting for  votes with similar programs. To counterbalance them, the  People's Front of Moldova and the "Civic Alliance of Romania"  have come up with the idea of uniting the republic with Romania.  But, according to the Moldovan Embassy in Moscow, these ideas  have the backing of no more than 8 percent of the population.    The alarm over the possibility of more bloodshed seems not  unfounded. In the Dniester Region, for instance, the creation  of polling places and technical groups to hold the elections is  forbidden. Dniester Moldovan Republic [DMR] President Igor  Smirnov's edict introducing a special situation came into force  20 January. Admittedly, the Central Electoral Commission is  examining the possibility of organizing a ballot on the Right  Bank of the Dniester for Moldovan citizens resident in Left Bank  rayons. Despite Gagauz leaders' refusal to take part in  elections, polling places will also be set up in some rayons of  southern Moldova with compact Gagauz communities.    The 14th Russian Army has once again taken center stage in  politics. After Commander Aleksandr Lebed announced the policy  of "armed neutrality," it stopped the war between Moldova and  the Dniester Region. DMR power structures are now accusing  Lebed of attempting a coup d'etat, preparations for which  allegedly began back in January last year. That naturally  brought retaliation. In a statement disseminated by the mass  media the 14th Army's Military Council drew attention to the  exacerbation of the situation in the unrecognized DMR. The  leadership of the 14th Army accused the managerial apparatus of  the DMR of being corrupt and merging with the criminal world,  which has created over 200 criminal groupings in the Dniester  Region. Official circles in Moldova and the Dniester Region  have been warned that they must abandon their illusions as to  the possibility of resolving matters in the region by strong-arm  methods. People organizing armed provocations from the Left  Bank of the Dniester, the statement says, will be severely  punished for attempting to unleash conflict. If large-scale  armed provocation arises, no matter who is behind it, the 14th  Army reserves the right to "cool overly hot heads."</p>

At least 15  MPLA-PT soldiers and many civilians were killed in the clashes.  According to sources quoted by the Voice of Resistance of the  Black Cockerel correspondent in Lunda Norte Province, the cause  of those clashes was that Riot Police agents had been diverting  international aid and selling it at exorbitant prices on the  black market for their own benefit.</p>

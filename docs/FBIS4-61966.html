			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] With the deadline for the signature-collecting  campaign being only three days away, three main candidates for  the Belarussian presidency have already submitted a list of  100,000 signatures to the central election commission. They are  Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Communist Party Chief Vassiliy  Novikov and leader of the opposition People's Front Zenon  Pozniak.    Also about to do so are former Parliamentary Chairman  Stanislav Shushkevich and leader of the People's Accord Party  Gennadiy Karpenko.    In the meantime, members of the monitoring commission of  pro-democracy parties and movements have stated a number of  irregularities in the election campaign. The commission  maintains that the interior ministry was instructed to ensure  that members of the police force should vote in favor of the  prime minister; the defence minister at a recent meeting told  his subordinates to vote for Kebich and against Shushkevich and  chairman of the anti-corruption commission Aleksandr Lukashenko;  and the collection of signatures at a number of plants in Minsk  was held under management pressure.    Local observers say as the battle between presidential  candidates becomes more uncompromising as the campaign is  drawing to a close.    In a recent interview, Shushkevich accused the prime  minister  of trying to shift the responsibility for economic collapse,  mismanagement and failure to carry out market reforms on the  Russian Government and taxpayers. He said Kebich's drive for a  closer union with Russia was used as a cover up to try to divert  attention away from genuine government corruption from top to  bottom.    On the monetary union with Russia, Shushkevich said that  "all  of the Russian rubles will flow back to Moscow currency  exchanges in a week's time to cause further inflation in Russia  and shortage of rubles and non-payment of wages in Belarus". He  said that many in Russia were well aware of this.    The withdrawal of 400 members of the White Russ Slav  Assembly  from the support group collecting signatures in favor of  Alexander Lukashenko came as a bomb shell, local observers say.    The Assembly's sudden change of heart follows WR's  allegations saying that "Lukashenko and his associates have been  speaking of their opposition to integration with Russia and a  monetary union with Moscow."</p>

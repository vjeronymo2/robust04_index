			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Guyana ends investment tax breaks Guyana has abolished tax holidays for foreign investors, creating what Mr Asgar Ally, finance minister, says will be 'a level playing field for all investors'. Local business has been complaining of being put at a disadvantage to foreign investors who have enjoyed grace periods and exemptions from a range of taxes and duties. 'Existing tax holidays will be allowed to expire,' said Mr Ally. 'We have not been granting special holidays to anyone for more than a year.' The Guyana government has been seeking foreign investors to expand the economy which is based on gold and bauxite mining and sugar and rice production. Several have invested in power generation, telecommunications and mining over the past four years as the government has been selling off a number of state-owned enterprises.</p>

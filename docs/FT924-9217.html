			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Westbury returns to to the black with Pounds 2.6m WESTBURY, the Cheltenham-based housebuilder, returned to profit in the six months to August 31, mainly due to a reduced interest burden following last year's Pounds 20.7m rights issue. The shares gained 12p to 80p. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.56m compared with losses of Pounds 1.14m. Despite the improvement, the interim dividend is cut by 46 per cent to 1.75p; the company said the final would be reduced in proportion. Interest costs fell to Pounds 583,000 (Pounds 2.83m) and net borrowings fell from Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 13.5m, leaving gearing at 14 per cent. Mr Richard Fraser, chief executive, said recent interest rates cuts were welcome but had yet to feed through into confidence in the housing market. Westbury sold 1,115 new houses during the period, only slightly below last time's total. Average sales prices fell about 2 per cent to Pounds 61,131. But incentives, which are not reflected in the sale price, of up to 5 per cent of a property's value maintained pressure on margins. Turnover fell more than Pounds 4m to Pounds 64.5m but tighter cost controls improved operating profits 44 per cent to Pounds 3.63m against a depressed comparative period. Earnings per share were 3.5p (losses of 2p), giving dividend cover of 2 times. The company said it would aim to improve that ratio to about 2.5 times.</p>

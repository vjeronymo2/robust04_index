			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ti Fei (3321 7236): "An Internal Report on the </F> State of the PRC Shows That Its Treasury Is So Empty That It Is  Going To Be Hard for Even a Sage To Rescue It"]    [Text] In this "perilous autumn" of Zhu Rongji's  emergence, what is the state of the PRC central government's  revenues? PRC national affairs experts Hu Angang [5170 7254  6921] and Wang Shaoguang [3769 4801 0342] disclosed certain  facts about them a few months ago. A pertinent PRC party has  also transmitted their substance internally.    On 2 July 1993, the PRC's "top ace" in solving knotty  problems -- Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, took the helm as the  president of the Peoples' Bank of China [PBOC]. As Zhu has been  responsible in recent years for curing various complicated  cases, such as inflation and state enterprise losses, the  liquidation of triangular debt, and the suppression of peasant  wrath, there have been both official and unofficial expectations  that this grand master could cure today's "national disaster" --  all economic problems, such as the "empty" treasury coffers  caused by financial corruption.    But while the collapse of a tall building is hard to prop up  with just one log, the magic wand wielded by Zhu Rongji could  not go wrong. He was going to rectify the financial order to  adjust the investment orientation, with the efficacy of this  magic wand completely dependent on the financial regulation and  control capability of the central government.    So in this "perilous autumn" of Zhu Rongji's emergence, what  is the state of the PRC central government's financial  capability? PRC affairs expert Hu Angang and a U.S. PRC  scholar, Wang Shaoguang, recently disclosed certain facts in a  "Report on China's National Capability."  <H5>  How Strong Is the Central Revenue Capability? </H5>   Hu and Wang pointed out in this report that: "Since the  general separate revenue' package system was instituted in 1980,  the state's financial capability has declined rapidly, with  government revenues extremely decentralized, and the center's  macroeconomic control capability down."    This has shown up in detail as:    1. The ratio of revenues to GNP has dropped steadily,  already  being less than one-half that of industrialized countries with  market economies. This revenue ratio had dropped from 31.2  percent in 1978 to 14.7 percent by 1992, and is projected to be  down to 11.3 percent by the year 2000. But in 1989, it was 34.6  percent in the United States, 45.9 percent in Germany, 46.1  percent in France, and 37.1 percent in Australia.    2. Revenue growth elasticity is down, being in a state of  low  elasticity. From 1986 to 1991, revenues grew only 0.66 percent  per 1 percent growth of GNP. In comparison, from 1979 to 1988,  this revenue-growth elasticity value was 0.95 percent in the  United States, 1.094 percent in Britain, 2.821 percent in Japan,  1.143 percent in India, and 0.899 percent in Indonesia which,  while ranking lowest, was still higher than China's for the  period.    3. Central government revenue capability is down to its  lowest point in PRC history. In 1989, China's ratio of central  revenue spending to GNP was only 1.6 points higher than that of  the former Yugoslavia, or one-fifth to two-fifths that of large  developing countries with populations of up to hundreds of  millions, such as India.    Revenues and expenditures are quite decentralized. While the  ratio of central revenues to all revenues during the Seventh  Five-Year Plan was about 40 percent, with local revenues at 60  percent, IMF data for the period show the ratio of central to  all revenues at 88 percent in France, 63 percent in Germany, 59  percent in the United States, 69 percent in India, and 97  percent in Indonesia, with the only exception being Yugoslavia,  where it was 28 percent. If we include extrabudgetary funds in  revenues, then central revenues make up only one-fifth of all  revenues, with local revenues accounting for the other  four-fifths. World Bank experts have come to the conclusion  that "there is probably no other country in the world where  revenues and expenditures are more decentralized than in China."    Having made this comparison, Hu and Wang point out that: "In  comparison to industrialized nations with market economies or  large developing countries with populations of hundreds of  millions, the Chinese Government's central revenue capability is  severely inadequate, meaning that unless it takes resolute  steps, it will be hard for it to fulfill its missions of market  economy development during its conversion period." As to the  causes of the Central Government's declined financial  capability, Hu and Wang hold unanimously that: As opposed to the  contemporary revenue systems in general use in industrialized  nations with market economies -- tax separation and uniform  taxation, Mainland China's current revenue package system has  the severe defects of being nonstandard, unscientific, and not  uniform.  <H5>  Where Is State Revenue Flowing? </H5>   Due to the revenue shortage, the long-hoped-for sharp  increase in salaries for employees in institutions and state  organs will again not occur in the short-term.    Mainland China's revenue losses are all through the  following  channels:    1. Tax Erosion. Under mainland China's current  separate-revenue package system, the phenomenon of localities  and enterprises acting out of local interests to arbitrarily  institute tax reductions and exemptions is unstoppable, with  enterprise tax evasion and avoidance quite common. A pertinent  poll and projection shows that tax evasion and avoidance exists  in about 50-60 percent of China's state and collective  enterprises, and in over 90 percent of its individual and  private enterprises, with China's annual tax losses amounting to  about 50 billion yuan.    2. Profit-Payment Losses. This is seen mainly in  the interception and shift of profits that should be paid to the  government, through the following common methods: After  fulfilling contracted profits, some intercept and shift surplus  profits, even to the point of artificially fabricating book  losses; some "accomodate" through counterfeit documents (not  only are such counterfeit invoices and documents boldly  fabricated by certain operating sectors, but they are also  openly offered for sale on markets), making fraudulent  applications and claims, and shifting income; some shift  general-account income, such as joint-venture or tertiary  enterprise income and unit nonoperating income, fine and  confiscation income, and even some business income, to unit  "small treasuries," or even "fly it across the sea," shifting it  to temporary deposits in overseas units; and others include  nonproduction expenses in costs. Such losses are so large that  they are hard to even investigate or measure.    3. Dual-Track-Price Erosion. In the process of  economic and financial reform, some units, groups, and  individuals that hold great authority over commodities have  accurately seen the opportunity of "dual-track prices," taking  advantage of their authority to buy long and sell short, and  seeking exorbitant profits without personal participation,  with over 70 percent of such income flowing into private  pockets. Data beginning in 1988 show that such revenue erosion  has reached a high of about 100 billion yuan. In recent years,  the reduction in state revenues due to dual-track prices has  again expanded from the field of circulation into other fields.    4. Rebate Losses. Mainland China's rebates  [commissions, kickbacks] are certainly not like those in other  market-economy countries, i.e., a form of profit concession  between industrial and commercial enterprises. The "rebates"  prevalent in China's purchase and marketing field are actually  "advantage fees," landing directly in private purses.  Incomplete data from one small Chinese city show that the  accumulated spending on rebate fees in 1991 of over 5,000  industrial and commercial enterprises topped 100 million yuan.    5. Interest Losses From Private Deposits of Public  Funds. A typical poll published on a certain province finds  that private deposits of public funds make up about 5-10 percent  of financial-institution deposits. Projecting from this, China  has private deposits of public funds topping 100 billion yuan,  causing annual interest losses of about 3 billion yuan.  Certain local finance and banking departments act in  collusion, using state-revenue funds for phoney commissioning,  lending, and division of interest. Banks collude with  enterprises to profit from financing, which losses are also  sizeable.    6. Grey Distribution. This refers mainly to  certain enterprises and institutions violating state policy, by  recklessly issuing property to employees. A poll and estimation  by a concerned department finds that the wage income of  employees throughout China shot up from its 1985 level of 20.08  billion yuan (15 percent of payrolls) to 77.3 billion yuan by  1990 (26.2 percent of payrolls). Grey distribution is now still  expanding, in some cases making up 40-50 percent of all employee  income, and even as high as several or dozens of times.    7. Entertaining. The variety of pretexts for and  ways of entertaining at public expense in China can be said to  be unmatched anywhere else in the world. The State Statistical  Bureau estimates that 60-70 percent of the business turnover of  large- and mid-sized hotels and restaurants throughout China  comes from entertaining at public expense. The most conservative  estimate is that China loses as much as 80 billion yuan a year  in public funds through entertainment.    8. Conferences and Publicly Funded Tourism. The  current various forms of exchange conferences, demonstration  meetings, appraisal gatherings, cooperation get-togethers, and  symposiums, as well as investigation groups leaving the country  mostly for tourism, are innumerable, with the size of their  spending leaving one speechless. The Ministry of Finance has  disclosed that during the Seventh Five-Year Plan, domestic  conference spending grew at an average of 21 percent a year.    9. Group Consumption. Many government organs and  enterprise units compete with each other to see "which can  consume the most." Some units compete in purchasing air  conditioners, color TVs, and expensive cars, indiscriminately  installing telephones, going in for ostentation and  extravagance, and parading wealth, with all sorts of  extravagance and waste prevalent, and social group consumption  up sharply. In the first three quarters of 1992, nonproductive  group-consumption spending grew over 30 percent in 21 mainland  Chinese provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. There is  basically no way to calculate the group-consumption spending  through other channels.  <H5>  Corruption and Abuse of Power Are the Causes. </H5>   This revenue erosion is essentially due to those with  varying  amounts of power and influence taking advantage of their  authority to plunder public assets unscrupulously, with the  opening of all ways being subject to the means of corruption and  bribery. In recent years, there have been numerous major  cases of graft and bribetaking involving millions and tens of  millions of yuan, with such graft and corruption having spread  to all government-authority sectors, such as public security,  industrial commercial, taxation, banking, land management,  administration and law enforcement, and labor and personnel.  This lamentable reality shows that the mainland Chinese  government is beyond cure. It could be said that it is  precisely the corrupt political system that has created this  corrupt bureaucracy, with China's current overall situation  being the result of the "endeavors" of those so corrupted.    The Chinese Government also seems to have awakened to the  cause of its current plight, with its "rectification of the  financial order" being accompanied by an "anti-corruption  struggle," which the people call anti-corruption led by the  corrupt," so whose effects will certainly be suspect. As so  many central figures of authority have princes, princesses, and  sons-in-law doing their utmost to get by improper means, what  hope is there that those below will not follow the example of  those above throughout China?    As China is now on the verge of paying for its autumn grain  harvest, with peasants holding IOUs for years angry to the point  of bursting, any further passing out of IOUs will be bound to  touch off an "autumn-harvest uprising." So in order to bridge  this pass, all specialized banks throughout China have turned  over to the PBC all of their savings that are not out on loan  (it is still not known how interest is to be paid on this), with  recent transfers of 13 billion yuan from Guangdong and nearly 8  billion yuan from Jiangsu. While this is injecting a little  blood into the exhausted state revenues, it is undoubtedly  merely a drop in the bucket. With such a state financial  capability to undertake the many heavy duties in the conversion  period, such as stopping the slide in agricultural production,  adjusting the slanted investment structure, easing the  increasing inflation pressures, and opening up the bottleneck  restraints in areas such as transportation and energy, even if  Zhu Rongji had the nerve to "clear up the whole mess  thoroughly," it is feared that he lacks such tremendous power.</p>

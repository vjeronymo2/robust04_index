			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Epwin rises 51% and 'committed to expansion' With good progress in all but the public sector contracting side of its business, Epwin Group, the maker of PVC-u windows and doors, lifted pre-tax profits by 51 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 4.68m. The shares responded with a 17p rise to 317p. Furthermore, Mr Jim Rawson, chairman and managing director, said that the group was committed to expansion by acquisition. It could, and would, grow organically within its core windows and doors product area, but he said that was not 'exciting' enough for the management below board level, and the shareholders. He said the board was looking for product areas like garage doors, porches and shower screens - 'products not outside the markets we understand'. Mr John Townsend, finance director, said the group was in a strong financial position, having done well through the recession, and would have no difficulty raising funds. He added the group would be happy to be 50 per cent geared. Turnover advanced 18 per cent to Pounds 50.9m (Pounds 43m). 'By selling aggressively, we have gained market share,' Mr Townsend said. The two-year Pounds 10m capital expenditure was now complete, though a further Pounds 4m will be invested this year. Earnings emerged at 15.17p (11.84p) per share and a proposed final dividend of 5.2p makes a total 7.5p (6.8p), up 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: AGF confident despite decline in first six months Assurances Generales de France, the French insurance group which is a candidate for privatisation, yesterday announced a fall in net profits to FFr1.04bn (Dollars 192m) for the first half of 1994 from FFr1.41bn in the same period last year. However, Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman, said AGF was on course for an increase in net profits for the full year to between FFr1.46bn and FFr1.7bn. This compares with net profits of FFr977m in 1993. 'We're extremely cautious,' he said. 'But our forecast at the moment is that profits for the full financial year will be 40 per cent to 60 per cent higher than those for the first half.' Mr Jeancourt-Galignani also stressed that AGF would be ready for privatisation by the end of September, the deadline set earlier this year when the Balladur government outlined its privatisation plans. The government has since appeared cooler about the prospect of selling its AGF shares, in favour of concentrating on the proposed partial privatisation of the Renault motor group. AGF has made no secret of its hopes that the sale will go ahead this autumn. 'It's up to the government to take the decision,' said Mr Jeancourt-Galignani. Meanwhile AGF is reorganising its assets. Mr Jeancourt-Galignani confirmed it intended to sell a 43 per cent stake in Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur, which is held jointly with the Credit Lyonnais banking group. He also affirmed that AGF had begun talks with Suez, the French holding company, to acquire the latter's 26.7 per cent holding in SFAC, a credit insurance concern. AGF already owns 45 per cent of SFAC and hopes to take control. Mr Jeancourt-Galignani declined to comment, however, on the progress of talks for AGF to raise its stake in AMB, the German insurance company of which it now owns 33.5 per cent. AMB doubled its contribution to AGF's interim figures, providing net profits of FFr106m, against FFr54m in the first half of last year.</p>

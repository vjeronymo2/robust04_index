			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, June 16 (MAP) -- The regional economic  development working group stemming from the multilateral Middle  East peace negotiations started the proceedings of its 5th  session here Wednesday [15 June] in the presence of 46  delegations.    The meeting, held for the first time in an Arab country,  consecrates Morocco's active role in the promotion of peace in  the Middle East. The previous meetings were held in Brussels,  Rome, Copenhagen and Paris.    The Rabat meeting agenda highlights activities taken under  the umbrella of the Copenhagen action plan which sets a work  program in the short and medium term.    The meeting will examine the activities undertaken in  several  sectors since the last session and explore means of making  further progress, said head of the delegation of the European  Union which is chairing the 5th session Constantin Prevedorakis  (Greece) in an opening statement.    He added that the session will also look into proposals for  the monitoring of the action plan by the regional parties so  that effective follow-up be assured and discuss guidelines for  future activities in regional economic cooperation.    "The challenge we face is to lay a firm basis for the  promotion of prosperity through regional cooperation in the  Middle East", he said recalling that since its first session in  1992, the group has made substantial progress in pursuing its  principal immediate goals: Transforming ideas and initiatives  into practical proposals, establishing priorities, creating a  framework for regional economic cooperation and building  confidence among the people of the region.    The Copenhagen action plan deals with 35 development  projects  mainly in the sectors of transport, communications, energy,  tourism, agriculture, financial markets and investment, trade,  electricity. The carrying out of each project is entrusted to a  country or a financial institution such as the World Bank.    The head of the US delegation Daniel Kurtzer whose country  is  co- sponsoring along with Russia the negotiations process said  the Copenhagen action plan proved to be an important milestone  in the progression from a stage of planning and discussion to  one of implementation.    However, in spite of these positive steps, we must assess  our  work to see if we are doing all that we can at this time to  advance prospects for regional economic development and  cooperation, the US delegate said.    He also called for further efforts to include Syria and  Lebanon in this important work. The two Arab countries have  been boycotting the group since its inception arguing that no  progress can be made in the multilateral negotiations before a  noteworthy progress in the Israeli-Arab bilateral negotiations.    The US delegate pointed out further that the group should  examine how to address the needs of the private sector and take  advantage of their energy to advance regional economic  development. He also stressed the importance of the projected  establishment of a comprehensive database for the working group  as it will offer linkages to the academic community, research  institutes and the private sector.    The participants in the meeting, he said, should consider  what sort of organizational structure for the group will be  required to develop these goals and priorities. "The regional  parties will certainly have to play a major role in directing  the process", he said adding that the US plans to announce a new  initiative related to air transportation.    The head of the Japanese delegation echoed the US delegate  stressing the need to involve the private sector wherever  possible. Economic development is not only the greatest reward  of peace but also most effectively strengthens peace, he said.    The Japanese delegate also stressed the importance of the  participation of Syria and Lebanon saying this participation "is  essential if regional cooperation is to be fully promoted on a  regional scale".    The Jordanian delegate on his part stressed the need to  consider financing requirements of priority projects and renewed  the idea to establish a regional bank or fund to bankroll these  projects.    "Another requirement to enhance regional cooperation is to  resolve the debt problem facing some of the regional parties",  he said.    The Chinese delegate pointed out that economic development  in  the region must be sustainable and steady and should benefit  all. "It is therefore important to formulate long-term and  phased development programs", he said before calling for  increasing assistance to the areas under the Palestinian  self-government and other territories still under occupation  through bilateral or multilateral channels to enable an earlier  start of the reconstruction of Palestine.    He equally stressed the need to establish as soon as  possible  a regional research body of economic experts to work out medium  and long-term plans for regional economic cooperation and  identify priority projects.</p>

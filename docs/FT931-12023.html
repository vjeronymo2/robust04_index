			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Battle to avert Croat dam disaster BRITAIN is sending a team of engineers to Croatia to help save a dam from bursting and flooding 20,000 villagers. The Overseas Development Administration said the three-man team would leave for Croatia today to advise local experts on how to repair the Peruca hydroelectric dam which was damaged in fighting between Croatians and retreating Serbs on Thursday. 'The humanitarian consequences of the collapse of the dam could be horrific. We have the capacity to help and I am pleased that we have been able to respond so quickly,' said overseas aid minister Baroness Lynda Chalker. A collapse could flood more than 20 communities in a long fertile valley stretching south-west towards Split, Croatia's largest Adriatic port. Croatian engineers were preparing a controlled drainage of the 12-mile-long reservoir to relieve pressure on the damaged dam wall, Mr Tonci Caracic, a Croatian scientist, said yesterday. UN officials said the dam was not in immediate danger of collapsing. Engineers warned that the entire reservoir, 500m cubic metres of water, might have to be drained to avert the danger of flooding 20 villages downstream from the dam. The dam was seized on Thursday night when Croat forces on the seventh day of their offensive broke through a year-old United Nations ceasefire line. Croats and Serbs yesterday traded accusations about who caused the three gaping holes in the 63-metre-high dam. On an emergency visit to Peruca, Mr Hrvoje Sarinic, the Croatian prime minister, accused Serb fighters of trying to blow up the dam to make sure it would be out of operation before they were forced to pull back. Witnesses said the sluice gates had been blasted away and the control room was a 'twisted hunk of metal'. But Serb leaders in Knin, the nearby centre of self-proclaimed state of Krajina, lashed out at Croatia for 'attempting to cause an ecological catastrophe'. 'Croatia is trying to make it seem as if the wild Serbs tried to explode the dam. But they have jeopardised thousands of people's lives in their botched attempt to mine the dam,' said Mr Boro Martinovic, a minister in the self-styled government. Serb fighters seized Peruca during the seven-month Serbo-Croat war in 1991 and mined the dam, which provides electricity for much of central and southern Dalmatia. Yugoslav customs athorities detained outgoing Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic at the Horgos border crossing between Yugoslavia and Hungary, Independent Serbian television NTV reported yesterday. He was returning after several weeks of absence.</p>

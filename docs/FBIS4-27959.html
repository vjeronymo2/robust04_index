			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party (DLP) will ask the opposition camp to cooperate in  building a national consensus on dealing with the North Korean  nuclear issue, it was learned Tuesday.    At the same time, the ruling party will devise proper  follow-up measures on its own to back up the results of  President Kim Yong-sam's summit meetings in Russia. The party  measures will be crafted through a series of meetings with  concerned cabinet ministers who accompanied the president on his  trip.    At a meeting of top postholders presided over by DLP  Chairman  Kim Chong-pil at party headquarters in Yoido, the ruling party  decided to seek the opposition camp's cooperation in supporting  sanctions against Pyongyang through individual contacts by key  postholders.    President Kim will likely emphasize the need for a national  consensus to settle the nuclear problem by maintaining a joint  international stance when he explains the results of his Russian  trip. Wednesday's meeting at Chongwadae will be attended by the  heads of the three government branches -- administration,  legislature and judiciary -- as well as the DLP and main  opposition Democratic Party chairmen.    The ruling party will hold a meeting with main postholders  from the opposition camp as soon as Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu and nuclear affairs ambassador Kim Sam-hun return home  to give briefings on future measures and their consultations  with the United States and Japan.    In a separate move, the ruling party will convene the  National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification  Committee this week to press for joint parliamentary measures,  including the adoption of a resolution urging North Korean  acceptance of nuclear inspections.    At Tuesday's meeting, chief DLP policy-maker Yi Se-ki said,  "despite the government's position that sanctions against North  Korea are inevitable, there is some domestic opinion against the  sanctions in fear of the possibility of war on the Korean  peninsula. This (opinion) is feared to dissolve the prevailing  public opinion and will be a stumbling block to the  international mood against North Korea's nuclear adventures."</p>

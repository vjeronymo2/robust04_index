			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / The new politics of dependency The notion that governments should seek to mould the behaviour of citizens is somewhat chilling. It conjures up images of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, where the social and genetic conditioning was so absolute that even the subhuman 'deltas' were perfectly content with their menial lot. Yet this seems to be the direction in which US social policy is moving. Many poverty experts argue that the obstacles to self-advancement in the inner city and elsewhere are internal rather than external: psychological rather than economic. Modern society may be moving into a third phase. In the first pre-capitalist phase, only an aristocratic elite enjoyed high living standards. The industrial revolution ushered in a second 'progressive' phase during which the mass of working people improved themselves, partly through the opportunities created by free markets and partly by pressing successfully for a host of social reforms, such as government pensions, healthcare and jobless benefits. In this phase, reformers of all political stripes made a critical assumption: the poor are no different from anybody else and will respond readily to market incentives and government programmes. Yet entrenched poverty in an economy as wealthy and open as the US perhaps indicates the start of a third social phase. Here, the bulk of the population lives comfortably because obstacles to personal advancement, while real, are minor by historical standards. However, a significant minority - most visible as a disaffected urban underclass - is dependent: either unable or unwilling to grasp new opportunities. Poverty experts see policies aimed explicitly at changing behaviour as the only way to energise the passive, non-working poor and hence propel them into the social mainstream. Mr Lawrence Mead, an academic at New York University, is one of the most articulate exponents of such theories, known as 'the new paternalism'. In a recently published book*, he argues that conventional social policies fail because they take for granted people's competence to respond positively to incentives. By competence, he means all the qualities that allow a person to get ahead economically - not only intelligence but foresight, energy, discipline, and the ability to sacrifice for the future. He believes the challenge is no longer to alter the economic or social structure of society, but to change the personal psychology of dysfunctional adults. Controversially, Mr Mead blames poverty squarely on lack of work effort, not low wages. If the poor worked as hard as the middle classes they would not be poor. On his figures, only 16 per cent of the heads of poor families work full-time; less than half work at all. The top fifth of the income distribution works seven times as many hours as the bottom fifth. He claims that most barriers to work are largely imaginary: there are still plenty of unskilled jobs; most women can arrange childcare quite cheaply; welfare benefits are too low to provide a rational alternative to employment. The problems lie mainly in people's heads. It is not that the poor are social rebels. Surveys indicate that welfare claimants share the same values as the rest of society: for example, they affirm the importance of steady employment and law and order. On many social issues, the poor are actually more conservative than the better off: 'They value external controls on behaviour exactly because their internal controls are less secure.' For Mr Mead, the core problem is that the poor have difficulty organising their lives and responding constructively to the opportunities that do exist. They are 'dutiful but defeated', unable to put good intentions into practice. The solution is not more incentives or opportunities but - horror of horrors  -enforcement. Mr Mead strongly supports workfare, or policies that make welfare benefits conditional on work or training. Mandatory requirements are necessary to 'overcome the defeatism of the clients, to engage their own energies in the quest for employment'. He claims that workfare is much less resented by the poor than intellectuals suspect, mainly because the aim is to enforce values that clients already possess. Indeed, some clients are gratified to be chased up by officials because it indicates an interest in their lives. The main purpose is not to force people unwillingly into jobs but to ensure they organise themselves for regular activity outside the home. 'Authority thus operates as the midwife, not the antithesis, of freedom,' he claims. New paternalism is still a sideshow. But as states implement the 1988 Family Support Act, workfare requirements will become more common. It is likely to mark the beginning of a new trend, in which government agencies demand rather than merely encourage changes in behaviour. The reliance on authority leaves a sour taste. But market liberals who put freedom first should remember how much their philosophy takes for granted. Those who flourish under capitalism have usually been subject to heavy psychological moulding during childhood, both at school and in the home. They have been trained to respond to the right incentives. The new paternalists are no more authoritarian: they merely want to tackle dependency by providing a little extra training for those who missed out in childhood. *The New Politics of Poverty, Basic Books New York, Dollars 25.</p>

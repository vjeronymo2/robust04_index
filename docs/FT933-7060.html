			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Fleming to launch trust for China FLEMING Investment Trust Management is planning to launch an investment trust specialising in the Chinese market, writes Philip Coggan. The investment adviser will be Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong and the stockbroker to the issue will be SG Warburg Securities. Fund managers have been attracted to China in recent years because of the country's high economic growth and its potential as it slowly introduces capitalism. There are a limited number of shares on China's stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzen but many managers invest in Hong Kong-listed companies with Chinese operations. The new trust is expected to be launched at the end of September.</p>

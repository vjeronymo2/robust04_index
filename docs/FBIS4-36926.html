			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 14, IRNA -- OPEC should postpone its  September meeting in a bid to boost the oil prices, Oil Minister  Gholam Reza Aqazadeh said here Tuesday.    Referring to the OPEC oil ministers meeting in Vienna on  Wednesday, Aqazadeh told the Persian daily ETTELA'AT that Iran  would support every proposal which tended to help boost the  prices.    He said the meeting has two important topics in its agenda,  namely selection of the future secretary general of OPEC, and  determination of the OPEC production ceiling.    On the former topic, he said there were two candidates from  Iran and Venezuela for the post, and that from historical and  qualitative points of view iran considered it its to be selected  as the next OPEC secretary general.    Elsewhere, he said since Iran and Saudi Arabia produce half  of the OPEC oil output, adoption of a joint stance by the two  countries would certainly help OPEC to make a firm decision.    "Experience has shown that the two countries' agreement has  had great impact on strengthening the prices," he noted.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers despite witching hour Wall Street US stock markets, aided by higher equity prices overseas, recovered from three days of losses yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.23 at 3,285.35 in turnover of 234m shares. Other leading indices also ended firmer. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.71 at 403.67, the Amex composite up 1.90 at 379.39 and the Nasdaq composite 5.03 higher at 554.20. After falling 80 points, or 2.4 per cent, in just three sessions, analysts were expecting the Dow to bounce back yesterday. Overnight gains on foreign stock markets provided the necessary excuse for a firm opening, and with many investors judging that domestic equities had been oversold in recent days, a steady stream of buyers lifted share prices across the board. Some investors remained wary of the effect on prices of the afternoon 'triple-witching hour', when futures and options contracts on stock indices and underlying stocks expire simultaneously. Most of the leading stocks were higher in busy trade. IBM added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 95, Merck put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 48 1/4 , Bethleham Steel firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 56, General Motors rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 43 7/8 and Philip Morris climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 72 5/8 in turnover of 2m shares. Dow Chemical fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 57 1/4 on the news that its joint venture with Corning, Dow Corning, will take a Dollars 45m pre-tax charge for the discontinuation of its controversial breast implant product. Corning was untroubled by the news, and rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 37 1/4 . Conner Peripherals slumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 18 1/2 in turnover of 2m shares after unveiling plans to expand its product line. The stock was also damaged by a downgrade from broking house Bear Stearns, which put the stock on its 'hold' list. IMC Fertilizer also bucked the trend, dropping Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 on a warning from the company that it expects fiscal fourth quarter net income to be hit by depressed product prices. EQK Green Acres fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 8 after the company cut its quarterly dividend to 27.5 cents a share, from 34.5 cents a share, as part of a financial restructuring programme. Telefonos de Mexico continued to recover from losses incurred earlier in the week on the heels of big declines in its home market. Telmex added another Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 47 3/4 in turnover of 2.6m shares. On the Nasdaq market, Heart Technology plummeted Dollars 3 1/8 , or 21 per cent, to Dollars 11 5/8 , in heavy trading after asking customers to suspend use of its coronary rotablator after three such devices reportedly failed. Going the other way were CK Federal Savings, up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 20 1/2 on the news that SouthTrust had signed a letter of intent to buy CK Federal in a stock swap valued at Dollars 32.7m. Canada TORONTO share prices closed lower in moderate trading. According to preliminary figures, the composite index fell 6.28 points, or 0.19 per cent, to close at 3,350.89. Declining issues edged advances 276 to 252. Volume was 21.602m shares, from 26.511m shares, and trading value fell to CDollars 250.2m from CDollars 308.4m. On the week, the composite index lost about 57 points. The gold group posted the day's biggest decline, falling 1.9 per cent. The sub-group's most heavily weighted stocks, American Barrick and Placer Dome, were off  5/8 to 32 1/8 and off  3/8 to 12 1/2 , respectively.</p>

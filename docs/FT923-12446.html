			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Gardening: Sow your seed in other beds - Artful gardeners can farm out second crops so that flowers can be at their best in autumn EVERY gardener knows about bedding out: hot bedding is another matter. It does not rely on rows of orange-flowered marigolds or bright fiesta pansies: it works on that sound hospital principle: pack them in, never leave a bed sitting empty, move a newcomer into a space as soon as somebody else has died in it. Hot bedding is my answer to this extraordinary season. Almost everything is still three weeks ahead of schedule and by late July there will be very little to anticipate. I have pink flowers on the schizostylis, whose normal season is September; blue plumbago is opening its buds and the roses' first season ended two weeks ago. The first round of bedding plants are the one touch of normality. The early dry weather slowed them up and the recent rain has only now set them racing ahead. Soon, they will need positive reinforcement, best found in plants for the gaps where early flowers have faded. Here, hot bedding comes into play. It is time to cut down the campanulas and verbascums: during this weekend my second round of white tobacco plants and the admirable white cosmos daisies will drop into place, young enough to last until late October. If the season is lop-sided, distort it in your favour. It is too late to sow fresh annuals for autumn flowering but there are still some strips and boxes of unsold bedding on display which are worth buying and untangling. Meanwhile, remember to arrange for your own next summer. Hot bedding may sound laborious but I recommend the second principle of modern self-care: farm the problem out; privatise it and let outside suppliers take up the strain during the peak season. It rather suits them. All over Britain, villages now have smallholders who grow petunias and fluffy daisies in varying shades of municipal beastliness for purchase in early June. When their main crop has sold out, the plastic tunnels in which they raise all these plants are left sitting idle. There is usually a six-week gap between the last of the orange tagetes and the start of the family holiday. Approach a local smallholder with your own choice of seeds in late May; avoid the wretched dwarf tobacco plants; ask them to sow what you want to use as secondary bedding and return to pick it up at a reasonable height in mid-July. In the past, grand French ladies would farm out their young children to be reared in the village; nowadays, artful English gardeners can farm out their second crop of flowering children and bring them back from somebody else's plastic tunnel in July, expecting them to be at their best in the autumn. Hot bedders need not confine themselves to annuals. Ambitious gardeners have even been known to hot-bed their Michaelmas daisies. These plants are usually dull until their late flowers appear: if you water them well they can be grown in deep pots until late July and then dropped into gaps in a border just before flowering. Keepers of large public borders often use the same trick with late-flowering lilies. On a small scale, it works wonderfully in town gardens which only need two or three sunken pots of spotted pink and white speciosum lilies to bring sudden life to a border of passe paeonies or early camellias. Out goes one performer, in comes another. The neat trick here is to exploit the defences of a sunken pot and to grow lime-hating plants in a lime-free potting compost, sunk into gardens with a more alkaline soil. For a few months these sunken introductions change the range of your flowers. The simplest trick of all is to hot-bed bulbs. The godsends here are the autumn crocus and its tall relation, the colchicum. Both of them should be ordered now for delivery and planting within the next two or three weeks. I think that they are invaluable but far too few gardeners exploit them. The easy blue crocus speciosus is still an extraordinarily cheap plant and it will fill any gaps at ground level, not least the bare spaces at the front of a rosebed which is probably developing black spot. The flowers appear in early September without the leaves: you have to put up with leaves only during the following spring but you only need a few groups and you can lose them next year among the other spring-flowering forms. This autumn crocus grows happily in Mediterranean weather but expatriate gardeners seem to ignore it and think only of wild cyclamen as the autumn advances. As a contrast, I recommend a very few clumps of the white-flowered colchicum. The white variety is not the cheapest but two or three groups of five go much further than the less impressive forms. Like the autumn crocus, the flowers appear naked, in too much of a hurry to remember their green pyjamas. Perhaps you have a circle of bare earth round a young tree: colchicums flourish in this space, as you can see in the autumn at Wisley, where they flower freely in bone-dry soil round established trees. Again, they love life in the Mediterranean. This accelerated season is beginning to make gardeners moan, as if the summer is already over in a month. It is much better to use your wits than to go on complaining. If a border has peaked too early, move in some new inmates, hot bed it and have two seasons in one. Gardening is a perpetual game against a cussed opponent called Nature. If her moves were always kind and predictable it would soon lose some of its fascination.</p>

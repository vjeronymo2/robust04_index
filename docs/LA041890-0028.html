			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELFARE OFFICES  </P> <P> When, as a journalist, I was researching homelessness in downtown Los Angeles  it became clear to me that the Department of Public Services located it offices  in large part as a form of social engineering; that is, it attempts to move the  homeless from one place in the city to another by moving services from place to  place.  </P> <P> It should be noted, too, that welfare workers are quick to cut off services to  people who miss or are even a few minutes late for scheduled appointments.  </P> <P> They are then required to wait several weeks before receiving welfare again and  must apply all over again. Putting an office farther away, and requiring long  bus rides and transfers to reach it, guarantees that large numbers of people  will mess up in one way or another and miss their appointments. That means that  either the homeless must move closer to the office or that the welfare rolls  will dwindle.  </P> <P> PETER MARIN  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

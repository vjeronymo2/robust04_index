			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AVOCADO LEAGUE BASEBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> SEVERAL TEAMS SEEM READY TO CHALLENGE DEFENDING CHAMPION CARLSBAD  </P> <P> Carlsbad High School has plunged from the elite to the mediocre.  </P> <P> A year ago, the Lancers finished atop the Avocado League standings with a 13-1  record (20-5 overall). So far this spring, they are 6-6.  </P> <P> And while Carlsbad seems to be falling to the middle of the pack, other teams  are displaying upward mobility.  </P> <P> San Pasqual, Escondido, Oceanside and Rancho Buena Vista are poised to wrestle  the title from Carlsbad -- and Ramona might not be far behind.  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P> <P> Last season: 20-5, 13-1 league (first).  </P> <P> Coach: Joe Pimentel.  </P> <P> Top returners: Buck Taylor (senior, C); Scott Karl (senior, 1B); Jeff Myers  (senior, 1B); Larry Griffith (senior, 2B); Bryan Black (junior, CF).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Bryan Vasey (sophomore, SS); Geoff Stadnyk (sophomore, OF/1B);  Jeff Westbay (junior, P); Jeff Jarred (junior, 3B); Chris Greene (junior, RF).  </P> <P> Outlook: Pimentel insists his team has yet to put together "back-to-back games  in which we've played really well." The main problem, he says, is a lack of  leadership. There is no one yet to fill the shoes of graduated shortstop Tim  Granich (Loyola Marymount) and catcher Adrian Lopez (Palomar College).  </P> <P> El Camino  </P> <P> Last season: 5-18, 4-10 league (seventh).  </P> <P> Coach: Adrian Leon.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Ricky Spears (junior, C); Todd Swanson (senior, CF); Scott  Hertweck (senior, P); Reggie Carter (senior, 3B/2B).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Bobby Wamble (junior, 1B); Fred Hernandez (junior, SS); Jerry  Almada (sophomore, OF/3B).  </P> <P> Outlook: Last year's 4-10 league mark might not look great, but it represented  an about-face from 1987, when the Wildcats were winless. The Wildcats have won  four of 11 so far this season. "I think we're vastly improved over what we were  last year," Leon said. Hernandez moves from third to shortstop and will anchor  the infield. Swanson, point guard for El Camino's basketball team, also will be  a leader here; he has an average over .500. Spears has four home runs, all  since being moved to leadoff.  </P> <P> Escondido  </P> <P> Last season: 15-11, 9-5 league (third).  </P> <P> Coach: Bill Kutzner.  </P> <P> Top returners: Tom Afenir (junior, C); Robert Erp (senior P); Gerald Cabral  (senior, SS); Brian Frank (senior, 1B).  </P> <P> Top Newcomers: Robert Chavez (junior, P); Bryan Klungsetter (junior, P); Mike  Garcia (junior, P); Brent Reynolds (senior, P).  </P> <P> Outlook: If it's true that you can't have enough pitching, Escondido should win  the section championship. Reynolds has an ERA of 1.50 in 20-plus innings.  Garcia, pitching for the first time in two years, shut out Marian during Mike  Morrow/Lions tournament play last week. Strong defense at two positions --  Cabral at shortstop and Afenir catching -- should help the pitching staff keep  its ERA down. "That's where I like to begin my teams -- at catcher and at  shortstop," Kutzner said.  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P> <P> Last season: 8-17, 3-11 (eighth, last).  </P> <P> Coach: Dave Barrett.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Fred Armijo (senior 3B); Angel Torres (junior, SS); Steve Larson  (senior 2B); Rico Lopez (senior, DH/C).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Andrew Acevedo (junior, P); Saul Gutierrez (sophomore, P); Bill  Precht (junior, P); Ben Pai (junior, P); Kenya Hunt (junior, P); Sibian  Fuimaono (senior, DH).  </P> <P> Outlook: Like Escondido, Oceanside is well-stocked with pitchers. Unlike  Escondido, Oceanside does not have a senior pitcher. Hunt -- 6-feet-5 -- is the  hardest thrower on the staff. Acevedo already has a 13-strikeout performance  (against Temecula Valley). Precht is a relief specialist with a 1-0 record and  two saves. Lopez should lead at the plate. He batted .350 in league last year,  .450 in 1987 and is over .400 this spring. Fuimaono is batting over .350 and  has two home runs.  </P> <P> Ramona  </P> <P> Last season: 10-13, 4-10 league (fifth).  </P> <P> Coach: Giff Asimos.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Chris Gunnett (senior, P/CF); Ty Wilson (senior, 1B); Jason  Waite (senior, P).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Troy Wood (senior, 3B); Jason Gonzales (senior, 2B).  </P> <P> Outlook: The Bulldogs are 5-3 under their first-year coach. Their offense has  come from Wilson (three home runs), Wood (three homers), Dart (batting more  than .500) and Gonzales (who has some base-stealing potential with 4.5 speed in  the 40). Ramona scored in double figures in its first four games of the season.  </P> <P> Rancho Buena Vista  </P> <P> Last season: 8-17, 4-10 league (sixth).  </P> <P> Coach: Steve Hargrave.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Jon Robirds (senior, 1B/P); Robert McLeod (senior, P/LF); Lonny  Maniscalco (senior, RF); Greg Anderson (senior, DH); Steve Valencia (junior,  2B); Jason Schmeiser (junior, SS).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Kevin Lippert (junior, C); James Gore (sophomore, CF).  </P> <P> Outlook: After suffering through the growing pains of a first-year school a  year ago, the Longhorns now have a wealth of experience. McLeod is the big  star, 4-0 pitching and a top hitter. In the Eldorado tournament in Las Vegas  last week, he went nine for 14 with two doubles, six runs and seven RBIs. Gore,  a transfer from Washington, has been a pleasant surprise. He hit over .700 in  the tournament and scored 12 runs in four games. And he's the No. 9 hitter. Key  statistic: Last year, the Longhorns hit .208. So far this season, they're at  .320.  </P> <P> San Marcos  </P> <P> Last season: 13-9, 8-6 league (fourth).  </P> <P> Coach: Ron Layton.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Gordon Sanchez (senior, C); Toby Lehman (senior P/OF).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Joe Balardeta (senior, DH/3B); Steve Kundringer (junior, OF/IF);  Eric Morton (sophomore, 3B/1B).  </P> <P> Outlook: Since returning from a shoulder injury, Sanchez has gone eight for 15  with two home runs. Kundringer has been on base in his last nine at-bats. The  pitching, sporadic thus far, must find itself if the Knights are to finish  among the top four.  </P> <P> San Pasqual  </P> <P> Last season: 15-9, 11-3 league (second).  </P> <P> Coach: Bill McAllister.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Kevin Herde (senior, P/3B/C); Mike Escarcega (senior, P/3B); Jim  Clayton (senior, SS).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Tony Medina (senior, C); Dave Vejtasa (junior, 1B); Eric Marsh  (junior, LF); Tim Young (junior, P).  </P> <P> Outlook: Escarcega tied a section record at the beginning of the season,  hitting safely in 12 consecutive at-bats. Escondido's Andy Martin set the  record three years ago as a sophomore. Thus far, Escarcega is 24 for 37 (.649).  Herde, like Escarcega a top college prospect, is 14 for 36. As a team, the  Eagles are batting .340. "That's a real pleasant surprise," McAllister said.  "Because one question I had going into the season was whether or not we could  hit the ball." The pitching, which McAllister had no questions about, has  faltered somewhat. The Eagles have scored 57 runs in the past five games, but  they have allowed 38.  </P></p>

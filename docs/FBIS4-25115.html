			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kimihiko Yoshida; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 17 May </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] Beijing -- Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], held a news conference  after holding talks with Li Shuzheng, head of the CPC  International Liaison Department, on 16 May. Giving a bitter  smile, Kubo said: "There has been no major change since April of  last year when an SDPJ delegation visited China." He made the  remarks because, although Kubo called on China to actively serve  as a mediator in the issue of DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected  nuclear arms development, he failed to get a satisfactory  reaction from Li, as the SDPJ delegation did last year. On the  contrary, Li admonished Kubo, stating that "putting pressure  will heighten the tension." It seems that Kubo -- who  persistently maintained the need "to cooperate with China" in  dealing with the North Korea issue in previous policy  consultations of the ruling coalition -- was disappointed with  China's reaction.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE TRANSIENT CONVICTED OF KILLING GIRLFRIEND'S MOTHER  </P> <P> A 24-year-old Oceanside transient was convicted Wednesday of the first-degree  murder of his girlfriend's mother in October, 1988, and now faces either the  death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole.  </P> <P> The Vista Superior Court jury deliberated two days and decided that Kurt  Michaels murdered JoAnn Clemons of Escondido under special circumstances: lying  in wait, for financial gain and during the commission of a robbery or burglary.  </P> <P> The woman was asleep in her apartment at the time she was stabbed to death.  </P> <P> The jury will return to Superior Court Judge J. Morgan Lester's courtroom  Monday to begin the penalty phase of the trial.  </P> <P> The prosecutor alleged that Michaels killed the 41-year-old woman so her  daughter could collect her life insurance. The jury agreed, and also convicted  Michaels of both burglary and robbery.  </P> <P> Michaels, a former Marine who served as his own attorney but had the help of an  assisting attorney, admitted he killed Clemons -- but argued that it was to  prevent the woman's continued physical and sexual abuse of her daughter,  Christine. The younger woman backed up Michaels' story in her testimony.  </P> <P> But Michaels insisted he is not a candidate for the gas chamber.  </P> <P> Because of a gag order, neither Michaels' assisting attorney, Mark Chambers,  nor the prosecutor, Jeff Brodrick, would discuss the verdict.  </P> <P> For her role in the killing, Christine Clemons, 18, pleaded guilty to  second-degree murder and was put in the custody of the California Youth  Authority until she turns 25.  </P> <P> A third defendant in the case, 20-year-old Darren Popik, was convicted in  December of first-degree murder for his part in the slaying and was sentenced  to life in prison without possibility of parole.  </P></p>

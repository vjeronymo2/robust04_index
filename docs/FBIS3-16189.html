			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Anna Bakina, Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Moscow/Almaty, 15 Mar -- In the view of experts,  the fire at the Baykonur cosmodrome, which occurred on the  morning of 7 March, will have no effect on the cosmodrome's  normal work, let alone on the forthcoming launch of the next  "Progress" cargo spacecraft on 18 March. The fire engulfed an  extension to the second assembly and testing block (MIK-2). The  fire gutted five rooms where, in addition to everyday  appliances, special equipment was housed. Fortunately, the  cosmodrome has replacement equipment.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the press center of  the Military Space Forces that the fire could have been caused  by a faulty electrical appliance or carelessness with fire. In  general, staff negligence was to blame.    The fire is not the only sorry event at the cosmodrome  recently. A little earlier, an officers' garrison building  burned down here. This kind of incident seems to becoming usual  at Baykonur. However, extinguishing fires has to be done under  extreme conditions: there is an acute water shortage at the  complex. Added to that, the approach routes, both road and  rail, become blocked by snow which often prevents even lorries  carrying food from getting through to the cosmodrome.    However, the situation has another side as well. Replying to  a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, it was stated at the  press centre of the Military Space Forces that it is now simply  unprofitable to deliver new vehicles and equipment to Baykonur  because, under the present circumstances, everything that comes  on to the territory of Kazakhstan automatically becomes the  property of that state. The signing of the relevant treaty on  the status and future of the cosmodrome is being dragged out  because of disagreements between Kazakhstan and Russia over  leasing period and the size of rental payments.</p>

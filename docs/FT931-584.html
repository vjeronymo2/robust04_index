			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / French conservative parties rout the left in election run-off FRANCE'S centre-right coalition last night swept to victory, leaving the outgoing Socialists and other leftwing parties with fewer than 100 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly. With 569 seats counted, the RPR Gaullists and the centre-right UDF parties had won 458 seats and the Socialists had only 53. Several ministers of the outgoing Socialist government lost their seats. Within the victorious coalition, the Gaullist RPR party had a clear lead in seats over its UDF partner, making it highly likely that President Francois Mitterrand will choose the new prime minister from within the RPR's ranks. The president will today receive the resignation of Socialist prime minister Pierre Beregovoy, who at least saved his own parliamentary seat. Mr Mitterrand is in theory free to pick the prime minister of his choice. In practice, he is likely to have to choose a premier from the party that has gained most seats. Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader whose main ambition is to succeed Mr Mitterrand in the presidency in 1995, indicated that he did not expect to be the new premier. The new government would have 'all my support', he said. Mr Chirac's preferred candidate for the premiership is Mr Edouard Balladur, the RPR finance minister in the conservatives' first cohabitation government under President Mitterrand. After the Gaullist lead was confirmed, former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader, said: 'I do not see under what circumstances I would have a role in this (new) government.' The Socialists were likely to end with fewer than 60 seats, compared with the 266 which they and their minor allies had held in the last parliament. The Socialist rout was dramatically underscored by the defeat of Mr Michel Rocard, who hopes to be the party's standard-bearer in the 1995 presidential contest, although an opinion poll showed most voters believed he should give up the race. Another Socialist heavyweight to fall last night was Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, who failed to keep his Dordogne seat. He is considered likely to go to the Elysee Palace as a presidential adviser on foreign policy, expected to be a contested area in Mr Mitterrand's cohabitation with the conservatives. Two of President Mitterrand's Socialist favourites, Mr Bernard Tapie and Mr Jack Lang, respectively the ministers for cities and for education, kept their seats. The turn-out appeared to be no higher than the 68.9 per cent in last week's first round of voting. The outgoing Socialist government thus failed in its call on leftwing voters and abstentionists to rally behind it to limit the size of the centre-right landslide, which in the first round saw 80 seats going to the conservatives and none to the left. Under the French parliamentary system, in which 58 votes are needed to launch censure motions against the government, the Socialists have barely done well enough to perform as an effective opposition. But they will get support from the Communists who were assured of retaining at least 23 of their 25 seats, thanks largely to the heavy geographical concentration of their supporters. Mr Georges Marchais, the Communist leader, was re-elected. The extreme rightwing National Front, led by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen who has failed to enter parliament, lost its only seat.

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / ERM pressure builds as threat to franc grows: Bundesbank urged to consider problems of other EMS members PRESSURE on the European exchange rate mechanism looks set to build again this week ahead of Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank central council. Mr Pedro Solbes, Spanish finance minister, urged the Bundesbank to take the problems of other European Monetary System members into account. 'The EMS cannot live in a situation of permanent crisis,' he told the Financial Times. Large-scale intervention by the Bundesbank and Bank of France on Thursday and Friday of last week did no more than hold the French franc at just over 1 centime above its lower intervention point in the ERM. In active trading in Tokyo early today, the franc edged down from an opening level marginally below FFr3.40 against the D-Mark. Foreign exchange market operators now say that only a significant cut of perhaps 1 percentage point in German interest rates will save the franc. However, it is doubtful whether the Bundesbank could agree to such an easing of credit conditions in the face of continued inflationary pressures in Germany. Although the Bank of France and Bundesbank have a formidable reputation for defending the franc and giving speculators a 'bloody nose', developments in financial markets late last week were inauspicious for the French currency: Market assessments of the scale of a Bundesbank rate cut required to alleviate the crisis rose steadily on Friday, from around half a percentage point in the morning to a full point by the end of currency trading in Europe; Equities in Paris advanced on Friday, showing that investors there expect the government to cave in to speculators and cut interest rates in the same way the British government did after last September's departure of sterling from the ERM; Conservative bond market investors and pension fund managers were reported to be moving funds out of the French into the German bond markets in the expectation of a currency gain from a franc devaluation or suspension of the ERM; New York hedge fund managers confirmed that they had so far played hardly any role in the latest round of speculation against the franc. But some made clear that they were preparing to act this week unless there were clear signs of the Bundesbank lowering interest rates. Market analysts also say that the French banking system is in a less strong position than before to support the French government's efforts to shore up the franc through higher rates. French banks co-operated with the government by not passing higher interest rates to corporate and individual borrowers in the crises of last September and early this year. Banks are less able to take such a strain after suffering losses this year. Moreover, the French government is in a worse position to 'twist arms' among the state-owned banks because it is preparing them for privatisation and cannot risk destroying their profitability. The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, whose government has repeatedly vowed to defend the franc's status in the ERM, is due in London today with President Francois Mitterrand. That message is likely to be repeated in their talks with the prime minister, Mr John Major.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A WEEK TO WATCH  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Highlight events. . .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Today: Edouard Balladur flies into London to meet John Major Preliminary German inflation rate for July (mid-month to mid-month): due   this week West German import prices for June (key inflation indicator): due this   week Spanish unemployment figures, which could put pressure on the peseta:   due this week Thursday: regular Bundesbank council meeting in Frankfurt  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

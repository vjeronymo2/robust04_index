			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Regulator probes debt links in Bronfman group CANADA'S financial services regulator has asked banks, trust companies and insurers to provide full details of their exposure to the vast industrial and financial empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family. The request, made earlier this week, comes amid uncertainty in financial markets about the ability of companies in the intertwined Bronfman group to withstand recent problems at Bramalea, a property developer, and Royal Trust, Canada's second biggest trust company. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions described the request as 'a monitoring activity which should not be construed to shock'. The information, which must be provided by today, will be confidential. Mr Bob Harding, president of Hees International Bancorp, the group's merchant banking arm, said yesterday that the superintendent's request 'is not something that's troublesome to us. We're financed through independent public companies'. According to analysts, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion Bank have the heaviest exposure to Bronfman companies. The group has not disclosed the extent of its borrowings or off-balance sheet financing. However, banks have stressed that the bulk of their outstanding loans are to publicly-listed operating companies, such as Noranda, the resources group, John Labatt, the brewer and Bramalea and Trizec, the two real estate developers. Some banks have announced write-downs on their loans to Bramalea, which filed for bankruptcy protection last December with debts of CDollars 5bn (USDollars 3.9bn). Royal Trust is seeking an infusion of equity. However, outsiders concern centres on the Bronfmans' inner holding companies, such as Hees International Bankcorp, Edper Enterprises and Pagurian. In response to market nervousness, these companies have wound down virtually all their commercial paper programmes. Noranda moved earlier this week to insulate itself from concerns about the strength of the rest of the Bronfman group by raising almost CDollars 1bn from the sale by instalments of its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry company.</p>

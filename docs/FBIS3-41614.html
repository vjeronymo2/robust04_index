			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Russian State Committee for </F> Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision Concerned Over  Children's Health'' -- from the ``Retsept'' section p i]    [Text] The Russian State Committee for Sanitary and  Epidemiological Supervision [Gossanepidnadzor] has expressed  extreme concern over the state of health of Russians, especially  children. In the words of Gossanepidnadzor Chairman Yevgeniy  Belyayev, in the first nine months of this year the number of  cases of measles in Russia has increased by 320 percent in  comparison with the same period of last year, cases of whooping  cough by 29 percent, and cases of epidemic parotitis by 31  percent.    There were 10 outbreaks of dysentry, abdominal typhoid,  hepatitis, and salmonella recorded in the country in 1993, as a  result of which around 7,000 people fell ill. Diphtheria has  reached epidemic proportions: The number of people suffering  from this infection has reached 5,000; around 300 have died,  including 50 children.    This situation, in Yevgeniy Belyayev's opinion, has been  brought about by the unsatisfactory state of the environment, a  reduction in the immunity levels of Russians, the low level of  inoculation among adults and children, and a shortage of  vitamins and preventive medicines. According to the information  of the ``Kedr'' constructive ecological movement, which actively  cooperates with the country's sanitary and epidemiological  services, around 60 million Russian citizens today live in  conditions permanently exceeding the maximum permissible  concentrations of noxious substances. Levels of atmospheric  pollution exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations by a  factor of 10 are periodically registered in more than 80 cities  and industrial centers. Around 28 cubic km of contaminated  effluent are discharged into Russia's water reservoirs each  year, of which 8.4 cubic km have not been purified. Highly  toxic organic compounds, heavy metal salts, phenols, and  petroleum products are discovered in water sources.    In the words of Anatoliy Panfilov, chairman of the ``Kedr''  movement, the threat to the health of the population, above all  to children, has prompted the movement's members to put forward  an initiative on purchasing abroad a large quantity of medical  preparations to boost immunity, as well as equipment to produce  them in Russia. After acquiring the necessary medicines, the  Gossanepidnadzor specialists, in conjunction with activists of  the ``Kedr'' movement, will deliver them to citizens most in  need of them in the unfortunate regions.</p>

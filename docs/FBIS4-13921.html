			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement it issued today, the General Labor  Federation reaffirms its call for peaceful demonstrations on 26  April. The GLC said the government has totally alienated itself  from the people, opening a wide chasm between itself and the  overwhelming majority of the Lebanese people.    The GLC accused the government of circumventing the demands  of the working class and its trade union movement and of  inventing new trade union organizations and platforms to attack  the GLC. At the same time, the government is trying to appear  as if it is concerned about the workers' demands.</p>

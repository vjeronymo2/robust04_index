BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AQUINO SIGNS OIL-DRILLING PACT  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino today signed a service contract with Royal Dutch Shell  and Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. for the exploration and  development of potentially rich natural gas deposits in the Camago area off  northern Palawan Island.  </P> <P> National Power Corp. Chairman Ernesto Aboitiz said test wells in the region  indicate an initial yield from the field equivalent to 160,000 barrels of oil a  day.  </P> <P> On the Manila Stock Exchange, stocks posted gains for the second straight day,  buoyed by news that tests over the weekend conducted by Houston-based Alcorn  Petroleum Inc. yielded up to 6,116 barrels of oil.  </P> <P> The Philippines imports 95% of its oil needs and, despite exploration, has yet  to strike a major oil or natural gas field.  </P></p>

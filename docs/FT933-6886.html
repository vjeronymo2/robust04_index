			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Effects of options on price trends Sir, Christopher Green's letter questions the effects of options on the copper market ('Options rise can stabilise copper market', August 17). While agreeing with him that options provide a valuable service to the base metals industries, I would maintain my contention, quoted by Kenneth Gooding in his article 'Copper market responds to 'rogue' element' (August 13), that buying and selling by grantors of options can influence the behaviour of the price in a manner that is indifferent to supply and demand. By having to buy on a rising market and sell on a falling one in order to protect themselves, granters of options have always contributed to existing price trends. The volume of such options-related buying and selling has now increased to the level at which they can exaggerate such price movements, thus increasing the market's instability. Any operator in the market who is in a position to deliberately institute a significant movement in the price may well find his efforts powerfully, if involuntarily, reinforced by the many granters of options who have no alternative but to follow suit. Needless to say, these conditions are not unique to the copper market. Martin Thompson, RTZ, 6 St James's Square, London SW1Y 4LD</p>

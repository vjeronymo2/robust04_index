			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / International Company News: Salomon closer to reaching a settlement on bond offences SALOMON Brothers expects to reach a settlement with the US government of issues relating to the Wall Street firm's illegal activities in the bond markets within the next few months. Mr Robert Denham, Salomon's chief legal counsel who spoke along with senior executives to a meeting in New York yesterday of institutional investors and analysts, would not specify what form the settlement might take. It is likely, however, that current negotiations with government agencies will lead to a series of fines and penalties being imposed upon the firm for its violations of Treasury rules in 1990 and 1991. Last year Salomon set aside Dollars 200m to cover possible liabilities from the bond auction-rigging scandal, and government fines could take up a significant portion of the reserve. The remainder will go towards settling the 44 lawsuits filed against the firm by individuals and companies who allege they suffered losses because of Salomon's misdeeds. Yesterday's meeting, attended by Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who took over as interim chairman when the scandal broke last August, and Mr Deryck Maughan, the firm's chief operating officer, was aimed at restoring confidence in the firm and explaining some of the changes that have been made since last summer. Mr Maughan took the opportunity to deny press reports that there had been a wave of recent defections from Salomon. He revealed that 335 employees have left the firm voluntarily since August, only slightly higher than the 326 who departed in the same period a year earlier. Although Mr Maughan expected more departures following this week's special bonus payments to managing directors (made under compensation schemes launched in 1986 and 1988), he thought no more than 'five or ten' would leave in the coming weeks. Of changes made since last summer, Mr Maughan confirmed that Salomon has stopped speculating in US equities for its own account to reduce trading risk. He also said the firm reduced its balance sheet by Dollars 37bn (to Dollars 100bn) between June and September to put Salomon's finances on a more secure footing. Mr Maughan revealed that the firm's business most damaged by the scandal was US equity underwriting. The fourth quarter of 1991 was 'a once-in-a-decade opportunity, and we were on the bench' because US companies were reluctant to grant lead managership of stock issues to Salomon while it was under investigation by the government.</p>

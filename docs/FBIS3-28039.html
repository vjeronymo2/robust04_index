"Loyalty to the socialist cause and resolute  anti-imperialist  position maintained by the WPK gives a great encouragement to  the communists of the world who are struggling for socialism,"  he stressed, and went on:    "The Workers' Party of Turkey [WPT] deems it great happiness  to have friendly relations with the powerful WPK, greatest in  the world.

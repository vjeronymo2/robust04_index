			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [MOSCOW NEWS correspondent Irina Lagunina interview with </F> Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, date and place not  given, followed by MOSCOW NEWS commentary: "Russia-NATO: Will  Moscow Secure `Special Relations'?"; first paragraph is  introductory paragraph]    [Text] After numerous proposals regarding Russia's  participation in NATO, Boris Yeltsin suggested in Bonn what is  expected to be the final variant: Moscow will sign a  presentation agreement on joining the Partnership for Peace and  simultaneously will create an additional protocol specifying  this program. In this connection RF Foreign Minister Andrei  Kozyrev gave an interview to MN diplomatic analyst  Irina Lagunina on the fate of the Partnership, Russia and NATO.    "We have nothing against the framework document as such, nor  did we have anything against it from the very beginning. It is a  different matter that it is not quite sufficient. Our public  opinion, perhaps thanks to the mass media, tends to believe that  the Partnership means very serious relations for many years. In  fact, however, this three-page framework document is not only  not a wedding, but not even an invitation to the movies.    "When a crisis broke out around Gorazde, man in the Duma  started saying: we are signing a treaty on the Partnership, but  NATO has not even consulted us over air strikes. But in fact the  framework document does not even make provision for such  consultations.    "Thinking of how to combine the expectations generated by  the  very words Partnership for Peace with the real content of the  program, we have come to the conclusion that there is a need to  speak about closer cooperation with NATO. Moreover, as we see  it, it is Moscow that must draw up a more in-depth program of  relations -- in the given case it comes forward as the  "customer" and singles out the lines which it considers to be  the most interesting and useful for itself.    "Now such a document has for the most part been created.  However, it still calls for discussion in NATO and with the  other states-partners in order to build relations on the basis  of reciprocity. As regards the main lines of cooperation in  which Russia is interested, they are as follows:    "First, cooperation between military departments, commands  and headquarters on account at the fact that these are relations  between the two mightiest war machines with global potential and  global responsibility.    "Second, the problems of conversion. Moscow has a stake in  getting both additional investments and technological exchange  in the framework of partner relations with NATO. The current  Partnership for Peace program, however, envisages at best  seminars on conversion.    "Third, expanded cooperation in fields such as the  maintenance of peace, the conduct of joint maneuvers and  exercises. And, lastly, political consultations and, possibly,  mutual coordination of positions."    MN Commentary    It should be presumed that it is these four points that form  the basis of the protocol drafted by Moscow. The most heated  debates will undoubtedly be triggered by the last point, as  political consultations are not envisaged in the Partnership for  Peace program. However, the latest Bosnian crisis has shown that  they are indispensable, especially if NATO intends to continue  engaging in peace-keeping activities.    All the signs point that the draft protocol has been  compiled  jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of  Defense of the Russian Federation. On the whole it runs counter  to the sentiments of some Russian circles which still believe  that after the disbandment of the Warsaw Treaty Organization,  NATO must also dissolve itself, and therefore it is not worth  strengthening this organization through a partnership with  Russia. The document is rather consistent with the directly  opposite view: there are still many threats in the world, and if  there is a military structure possessing sufficient organization  and might for combatting them, there is a need to find a role  for this structure.    Contrary to expectations and rumors, Kozyrev makes no  mention  of Russia's "special responsibility" in the CIS. Moscow has  evidently decided not to introduce into the protocol additional  points of dispute. All the more so since many member-states of  the CIS have already signed the Partnership. A realistic  analysis has shown that the North Atlantic Alliance is not yet  ready psychologically, organizationally or physically to spread  its military-political influence to the space of the former  Soviet Union even if the CIS states wished this.    The additional protocol will be presented to NATO for  consideration by Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev on May  24 during his visit to Brussels.    The problem for Moscow that, have delayed the signing of the  framework document, Russia now simply cannot confine itself to  this step alone, and the signing of any other agreement is not  envisaged in the framework of the Partnership. Judging by the  results of the meetings in Geneva between Andrei Kozyrev and  Warren Christopher, the United States understands this problem.  This does not mean, however, that any easy time will be in store  for the Russian protocol in Brussels.</p>

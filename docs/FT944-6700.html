			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Chechnya threat to Russian lives: Breakaway republic warns that captured fighters face execution The breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya has threatened to execute the 70 Russian fighters it claimed to have captured in recent skirmishes unless Moscow admits it is directly involved in trying to destabilise President Dzhokhar Dudayev's regime. The threat will further inflame tensions with Moscow; some western diplomats suggest it could provoke the open hostilities with Russia about which the Chechen authorities have been complaining. President Boris Yeltsin yesterday held an extraordinary meeting of his security council to discuss Chechnya, which declared its independence from Moscow three years ago. Mr Pavel Grachev, defence minister, denied the Russian army had directly supported the Chechen opposition forces, which launched an assault against Grozny, the republic's capital, on Friday. However, he added that if Russia did intervene 'one airborne regiment would be enough to resolve all questions in two hours'. So far, Russia has refrained from direct intervention fearing such a move would tarnish its image abroad and threaten to unleash a Chechen terrorist campaign within Russia. But the government has repeatedly urged Chechnya to come back into the fold, and has recognised the provisional council of opposition forces as the republic's rightful government, providing it with moral and financial support. Chechen officials said 300 opposition troops had been killed and 200 taken prisoner in the latest fighting in Grozny. They said 70 prisoners were serving Russian servicemen. 'If Russia does not recognise these soldiers as prisoners of war they will be tried by the laws of the shariat (Islamic rule). I will not lift a finger to stop this process,' Mr Dudayev said, indicating they could then be executed. Russian officials have denied serving soldiers were involved although they have conceded it was possible that former servicemen had been hired as mercenaries by the opposition forces. Mr Grachev said that, according to his information, mercenaries from the Baltic states, Afghanistan and Russia had been hired by Mr Dudayev. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the Chechen opposition leader, warned Grozny's population that they might soon be bombed and urged them to evacuate all children although the capital was reported to be quiet yesterday. Mr Khasbulatov, the former speaker of the Russian parliament and one of the leaders of the failed uprising against Mr Yeltsin in October 1993, is now being backed by Moscow.</p>

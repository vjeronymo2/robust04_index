Kohl said today at the start of a German-Indian  economic conference at the Bonn Chancellery, in the presence of  Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narisimha Rao, that this conference  underlined the "special importance" that the German Government  attached to relations between the two countries.    Rao arrived in Germany for a two-day visit to Bonn on 2  February. Kohl welcomed the prime minister with military honors  this morning at the Chancellery. Afterward they met for talks.  Rao is also to visit Berlin on the 4th and 5th February.    At the economic conference, the chancellor said that  relations between Germany and India in the science and  technology areas had always been very close and are  characterized by cooperation in a spirit of trust on many  projects. Kohl announced that it was agreed today to set up a  high-level German-Indian Commission for Science and Technology.  Mutual economic relations had developed "gratifyingly" in the  past few years. Today, Germany was India's second most  important supplier and fourth most important market. German  investments in India were "considerable, but could still  increase."    Rao welcomed German industry's Asian offensive. This project  was appropriate to the positive economic developments in Asia,  he said.    The economic conference, the climax of Rao's visit, was  opened by Siemens head Heinrich von Pierer, the chairman of the  Asia-Pacific Association of German industry. A large number of  Indian and German business representatives took part in the  conference. [passage omitted]</p>

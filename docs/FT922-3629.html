			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Receivers blame move by Libya for failure of AWD AN UNDISCLOSED deal to supply 2,000 trucks to Libya, which the country failed to complete, was primarily responsible for AWD, the former Bedford trucks business, going into receivership last week. When Libya did not sign a Pounds 117m letter of credit, it was 'the straw which broke the camel's back', joint receivers Mr Tony Thompson and Mr Roger Oldfield, of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, acknowledged yesterday. Intermediaries between Libya and the company say they believe the reasons for the Libyans' failure to complete the deal are political. But they have not been able to establish whether it represents retaliation by the country's ruler, Col Muammer Gadaffi, against United Nations sanctions. These were imposed in April because of Libya's refusal to hand over for trial two men suspected of involvement in the Lockerbie bombing. Under the agreement, Libya was to have taken delivery of the 2,000 trucks within a 12-month period starting this year. It would have thrown a lifeline to AWD, most of whose workforce had been idle since January as a result of the recession in the UK truck market and the failure to complete another large foreign supply agreement - 2,000 trucks for Iran. AWD's management called in the receivers last week. The company, based in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, and controlled by Mr David JB Brown, the entrepreneur, and his family, is understood to owe its bank and other creditors about Pounds 50m. Truck production is being resumed at the plant today, but at a much reduced level and with only 150 employees. The other 502 were made redundant on Monday. The Iranian deal, first announced last November, was said to be worth Pounds 70m to AWD. It is now known that AWD's directors were hoping that deal would maintain the company's viability until the Libyan contract came on stream. All the trucks would have been built at Dunstable, with the Iranian project involving neither local assembly nor AWD taking an equity stake in an assembly joint venture. The receivers say several 'substantial' companies are interested in buying AWD as a going concern. Mr Thompson said that the Iranian deal was 'still close to completion' and that the Libyans 'still apparently want to do a deal'.</p>

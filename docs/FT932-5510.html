			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / EC to look for international links in racist attacks THE European Community is to investigate whether the recent spate of racist attacks on foreigners across Europe is being fomented by groups organised across national borders. Spurred by the arson attack at Solingen in Germany, and Tuesday's burning of a Turkish-owned electronics factory near Lyons in France, EC interior ministers meeting in Copenhagen yesterday set up a working party to find out whether the extreme right across Europe is co-ordinating an assault against immigrants. 'We cannot give in to a centuries-old virus that obviously isn't dead,' said Ms Ien Dales, the Dutch interior minister. The decision came on the heels of an agreement by ministers to crack down on illegal immigrants and bogus asylum-seekers in the Community. It also coincided with further wrangling about the failure of all 12 EC member states to implement the European single market's injunction to grant free movement of people within the Community. The few officials at yesterday's meeting who were prepared to talk about the investigation were unsure whether there was concrete evidence to suggest an international grouping was organising pan-European racist attacks. 'The incidents are now so frequent that people fear there may be co-ordination,' said one Dutch official. Mr Erling Olsen, the Danish justice minister, said: 'We do not want to take the risk that it is co-ordinated.' The initiative dovetails with an informal discussion held by interior ministers last month at Kolding, Denmark, on whether there is 'any added value in a common European response to racism and xenophobia', as a European Commission official put it. But ministers yesterday for the first time elevated their concerns about the spread of racism to the same status as concerns over terrorism and organised crime. These are the subject of a secretive, six-monthly 'threat analysis' by EC interior ministers convened as the Trevi group to share intelligence and co-ordinate their response. Racism 'is now permanently on the Trevi agenda', a Dutch official said. The object at national level, he added, would be 'to dig in to each incident, to get to the bottom of every attack'. This should reveal whether the attacks were co-ordinated, but would be worthwhile anyway, he suggested. He and other officials insisted that tighter application of laws against illegal immigration helped the cause of genuine asylum-seekers and would enable EC states to take action to protect legal immigrants against attack and discrimination. Common standards on immigration, officials also argued, were essential to allow free circulation of people inside the Community. Europe tries to shut the floodgates, Page 3</p>

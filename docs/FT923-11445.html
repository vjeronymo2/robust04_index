			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Danger to certain projects from spending cuts CUTTING public expenditure over the next three years will involve ruthless scrutiny of some cherished projects: Social security: at 30 per cent of public expenditure, the largest component but also the hardest to cut given Conservative manifesto commitments. State pensions (more than 10 per cent of public expenditure) and child benefits will be uprated in line with inflation. Leaks have suggested that growth in unemployment benefits could be eased by reducing eligibility from one year to six months but most savings would be consumed by increased income support. Health and social services: Pounds 36.8bn. The Conservative manifesto promised 'year by year to increase the level of real resources committed to the NHS'. This makes it hard to cut much more than Pounds 500m of the increases planned for the next few years. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, believes her Pounds 800m budget for switching responsibility for care in the community to local authorities is inviolate. Local government: consumes about a quarter of central government expenditure. Most of it goes on the general support grant to cover housing, police, environment, roads and so on, which is easy to cut. However, the new council tax arrives next April, with ministers anxious to avoid the sort of cuts which partly accounted for the hefty bills in the first year of the poll tax and so discredited it. Capital grants for housing - already heavily cut in real terms - offer an easy target at around Pounds 2bn, but would be hard to sell. Defence: 10 per cent of the total. If reduced to the level of comparable European countries, the 25 per cent cut across the board would save Pounds 6bn a year. The 1990 Options for Change review has already sharply reduced numbers in the Army. The Royal Navy has taken ships out of service and extended refits, but could cut some of 13 Type 23 frigates ordered at Pounds 180m each. Vulnerable RAF projects include the Pounds 700m mid-life update of the Tornado aircraft (especially if the European Fighter Aircraft, needing Pounds 7bn from the UK, goes ahead). The Trigat anti-tank missiles (Pounds 425m) have already seen the production phase cut from spending plans, and the decision on buying the medium-range surface-to-air-missile MSAMS (roughly Pounds 500m) has been delayed six months to June 1993. Education: only Pounds 8.3bn of more than Pounds 30bn spent on education is directly controlled by central government. With the largest component - teachers' pay - recently subject to an independent pay body review, large savings would mean teacher redundancies, a reduction in capital budgets or cuts in higher education. With the first two, local councils would have to do much of the cutting, since they control most school education (for now). Transport: Pounds 6.6bn and falling. Construction costs have dropped to such a low level that big cuts can be made in the Pounds 2bn-a-year national roads budget without drastically affecting the number of miles being built or repaired. A cut of 20 per cent would not only produce savings of Pounds 400m a year but could also prove popular with the green lobby. But cutting British Rail or London Underground investment would be painful and controversial. Reporting by John Willman, Andrew Adonis, Daniel Green and Richard Tomkins</p>

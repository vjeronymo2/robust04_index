			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Saarland Minister President Oskar Lafontaine </F> by Rolf Kleine; place and date not given: "Lafontaine -- Lower  Wage Earners Should Pay Less Taxes"]    [Text] [Kleine] Finance Minister Theo Waigel wants to cut  the budget by 5 billion marks this year. Will this be enough?    [Lafontaine] No. The government's monetary policy is  careless  and unjust. Public debts are exploding and the costs are just  passed on to the little people.    [Kleine] What do you suggest?    [Lafontaine] The worrying increase in public debts has to be  stopped. This is a precondition for overcoming mass  unemployment.    [Kleine] More specific?    [Lafontaine] For the Social Democratic Party of Germany,  investment and jobs are a priority. The budget cannot be  restored without taking unpopular decisions.    It is necessary to cut superfluous tax subsidies, as well as  personnel costs and defense expenditures.    It is also necessary to fight industrial crime, subsidy  fraud, and illegal work and take firm measures against the  misuse of social benefits.    [Kleine] No further tax increases?    [Lafontaine] For people earning average incomes, the  breaking point has long been reached. This is why we want to  lower taxes on wages and salaries so that the tax burden on low  and medium incomes gets back to tolerable proportions.    In order to strengthen companies' investment capacity and to  lower the unjust gap, higher taxes on high private incomes and  property are, however, an absolute must.    Yet, the tax burden on industry must not get any higher.  This is a concept that is also accepted by industry.</p>

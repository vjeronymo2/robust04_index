			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (36): Boost for 'talking books' library helps 70,000 visually impaired - User View PROVIDING a constant supply of 'talking books' for its 70,000 visually impaired members poses some problems for the Royal National Institute for the Blind which are beyond the scope of most library applications. Its 8,700 titles, all recorded by professional actors, readers, and broadcasters, result in around 300,000 cassettes, from which stock the RNIB sends out around 13,000 tapes daily. By 1989, keeping track of who had received what was stretching the existing Ferranti system to its limits, and no ready-made application could meet the Talking Book Service's needs. The production centre at Peterborough had standardised on the Pick database, with the assistance of consultancy Clark Whitehill. The Talking Book Service decided to stay compatible, and brought in a consultant to help with programming. Now it has an off-the-peg system, used by about 20 'customer care' staff who are able to formulate their own enquiries. 'The system has made us much more efficient,' explains Talking Book Service manager, David Mann. 'Not only have we cut down on turnaround time by half, but we've been able to computerise subscriptions. 'We run the system with the same number of staff, but with no frustrations, and they have access to a much wider range of information. It's more flexible: we can produce lots of analytical reports.' The database has enabled the RNIB to look at other possibilities: cross references, browsing, and catalogues, even tracking specific readers so that it is possible to offer them a suitable 'pick-list' of fresh titles likely to suit their particular tastes and interests. The RNIB's Talking Book Service in London is contactable on 081.903 6666.</p>

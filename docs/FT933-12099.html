			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / European Bonds: Prospects depend on the ERM's fate ONCE again, the prospects for European bond markets are bound up with the fate of the exchange rate mechanism, which many economists and investors think will stand or fall depending on events this week, or over the next few weeks. The first test is the release of German inflation figures for July, which are due to be announced today, although there were market rumours on Friday that their release could be delayed, because of fears over market reaction. 'If the figures are bad, the ERM will be attacked with renewed force,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets. A deterioration following last month's inflation figure of 4.2 per cent is expected, but a substantial worsening will make it harder for the Bundesbank to offer more than a token easing of German interest rates. Analysts say that at this stage in the crisis a substantial easing of German rates, perhaps as much as a full point, is needed to have any real stabilising effect on the currencies still in the ERM. Market participants will be watching for a move to ease rates at both the repo early in the week and the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, the last before council members break for a month (although the Bundesbank could still ease other rates). Even if the Germans do cut rates this week, the ERM still faces further potential pressure at the beginning of August, when a series of German economic data including production and employment are due. Some analysts believe that under these conditions the ERM has become untenable. 'The shelf-life of the ERM is pretty limited,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, who argues that it is not feasible to maintain interest rates at double-digit levels when there is double-digit unemployment, as is the case in several European countries at the moment. Paradoxically, in the case of either a breakdown of the ERM or a maintenance of the status quo, investors and economists favour higher yielding European bond markets. 'An ERM break-up would be dire for the Bund market,' according to Ms Cottrell. Although the D-Mark would strengthen as a result, Ms Cottrell believes a stronger currency 'would threaten the prospects of economic recovery'. German bonds have benefited from the perception of the D-Mark as a safe haven, causing yield spreads of other European bonds to widen against Germany. But this process could now be reversed. Mr Philip Saunders, fixed-interest director of Guiness Flight, the investment management firm, said he is 'not enamoured' of the German market, even though he thinks that the Bundesbank will ultimately come down on the side of the ERM. Instead, he has hedged the currency component of other European bond holdings into sterling. 'If you remove the currency-flight part of the equation, then there don't seem to be good reasons to buy Germany,' he said. Mr Robert Gambi, manager of international bonds and currencies at AMP Asset Management, holds a similar view. 'The current turmoil is providing us with a great opportunity to become overweight in other (European bond) markets.' For example, he recently established a new position in Danish bonds, hedging the currency exposure back into D-Marks. Both economists and investors are taking the view that the non-D-Mark bloc could be poised to stage a strong rally. A number of analysts favour Italy, untrammelled by the ERM, which has already staged a recovery in recent weeks, and the French bond market remains a favourite, though investors may not want to take on exposure to the French franc at the moment.</p>

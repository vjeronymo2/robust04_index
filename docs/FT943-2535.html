			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Delays in Kuala Lumpur Travellers to and from Kuala Lumpur have been facing frustrating delays due to radar problems at the city's airport, writes Kieran Cooke. A recent fire - the third in 18 months - has knocked out an important radar installation and air traffic controllers have had to resort to manual tracking, which has led to the rescheduling of many flights. Departing flights are frequently being delayed for more than an hour - incoming passengers, particularly on shuttle flights from Singapore, also face problems. It is likely things will not return to normal until next month. Malaysia's department of civil aviation has reported two near misses at Kuala Lumpur since the radar went out of action. In the latest incident the department blamed a Singapore Airlines pilot for not following certain air traffic procedures during a landing approach.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Chemists call for right to sell more drugs over the counter BRITAIN'S high street chemists have called for the right to add 51 popular drugs to the list of products they can sell over the counter without a doctor's prescription. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society, which represents and licenses pharmacists, says the drugs - which include Glaxo's anti-ulcer medicine Zantac, the world's best-selling drug with annual sales of Pounds 1.6bn - had a proven track-record of safety. Its recommendation follows a meeting last week between the Medicines Control Agency, which licenses drugs in the UK, and industry associations to discuss speeding-up procedures for switching drugs from prescription to over-the-counter status. The drugs include Zantac's arch-rival Tagamet, marketed by SmithKline Beecham. Other leading products include Wellcome's best-selling herpes treatment Zovirax, which has already received OTC licences in Germany and New Zealand, its antihistamine drug Semprex, Schering-Plough's antihistamine drug Clarityn and SmithKline's antibiotic ointment Bactro-ban. Fisons' two asthma treatments, Intal and Tilade, are listed as are Pfizer's arthritis drug Feldane and the US group's anti-fungal treatment Diflucan. The recommendations come at a time when governments, anxious to contain rising health costs, are increasingly keen to switch prescription medicines which are largely paid for by government into OTC products paid for by patients. Companies are keen to switch because they can extend drugs' revenue stream after their patents expire. In some cases, sales can be multiplied more than fivefold, although the marketing costs of OTC products are higher than those of prescription medicines. A number of pharmaceutical groups are teaming up with consumer products companies to help them switch their products. These include SmithKline Beecham with Marion Merrell Dow of the US; Procter &amp; Gamble, America's leading OTC company, with Syntex of the US; and Johnson &amp; Johnson with Merck, both of the US. Wellcome has said it is looking for a European OTC partner.</p>

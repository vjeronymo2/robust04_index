			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Mazda reopens talks with Ford Mazda, the Japanese carmaker, yesterday said negotiations had resumed, after a year's suspension, on possible European co-operation with Ford, the US carmaker. Ford has a 24.5 per cent stake in the Japanese company and earlier this year strengthened its representation on the Mazda board. It had been expected that Ford and Mazda might renew discussions on the possible production by Ford in Europe of Mazda badge cars for sale in European markets. However, Mazda said no specific projects or details of co-operation had been decided, and Ford of Europe executives insisted that no fresh initiatives had been launched. Senior Ford executives said earlier this year that European production for Mazda would be one of the priority issues to be examined as a result of the closer relationship between the two companies. The prospect of Mazda being drawn into closer collaboration with Ford has also been revived following the 'globalisation' programme announced several weeks ago by Ford. Ford is restructuring its operations into 'world' car divisions in which Europe is taking the lead in designing and developing small and medium-sized cars for production worldwide. Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman, has held out the prospect of Mazda becoming part of these world operations. European collaboration talks between Mazda and Ford were suspended in March last year after the two companies decided a co-operative deal being discussed at that time was not to either's advantage. Co-operation between Mazda and Ford then was considered within a certain framework and focused on a specific car model, Mazda said. For that particular model, the companies decided a deal was not attractive. However, talks have restarted on a different basis and a variety of options are likely to be discussed, including joint venture manufacturing and own-equipment manufacturing in which Ford would make cars to be sold by the Japanese car company with the Mazda badge. Mr Yoshihiro Wada, president of Mazda, however, denied speculation that Mazda will commission Ford to assemble small cars in Europe at Ford's UK manufacturing plant. The Japanese car company, which has seen its European sales battered by the high yen, has been eager to find a way of making its cars in Europe. 'The European market follows the US market in importance to Mazda, so local sourcing is crucial,' Mazda said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau 5 April, TASS -- A round of talks begins in  Chisinau today between Russia and Moldova on the status and  withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army from Moldovan Territory.    According to observers, this round is unlikely to produce a  breakthrough because the sides differ too much on this issue.  Chisinau insists on the prompt withdrawal of the Russian troops,  while Russia and Transdniestria believe that the withdrawal must  be conditioned on granting a special legal status to the  left-bank regions of Moldova. The final say should belong to  the parties concerned.    "The Russian delegation intends to discuss an agreement on  the legal status, procedure and the time table of the presence  of our troops on Moldovan territory. We have brought along a  number of interesting proposals and hope that the Moldovan  delegation will heed them," the Russian delegation head,  ambassador at large, Vladimir Kitayev told ITAR-TASS.    "Chisinau's position with regard to the 14th Army remains  the  same -- it must leave the Republic," said Moldovan delegation  leader, the ambassador of Moldova to Russia, Anatoliy Tsaran.  This question will be central in our negotiations. The  original deadline named by the Moldovan side for the withdrawal  of the Russian Army -- 1 July 1994 -- will certainly need  revising since no agreement on it was reached during the  preceding rounds.    "We also hope to agree on the problems of jurisdiction and  property of the Russian Army and Moldova's contribution to the  necessary arrangements for its accommodation in the new area",  the Moldovan ambassador said.    Anatoliy Tsaran expressed the hope that the Transdniestrian  position with regard to the withdrawal of the 14th Army will not  be as tough as before after the recent parliamentary elections  in Moldova.    Transdniestria's Vice-President Aleksandr Karaman told  ITAR-TASS that Tiraspol objects to the withdrawal of the Russian  14th Army before the Dniester problem is settled.    "Chisinau and Tiraspol are now studying the Russian  proposals  about granting a special legal status to the left-bank regions.  We find these proposals highly constructive," Karaman said. "We  have long since proposed to Chisinau to make the republic a  demilitarised zone and disband military formations on the both  banks of the Dnepr. This move would ease the tension in the  region and permit the withdrawal of the 14th Army from Moldovan  territory without apprehension," he said.</p>

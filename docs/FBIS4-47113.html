			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on conference of Kalinskiy Rayon Organization of </F> CPRF in Moscow: "Communists Are Engaged in Uncompromising  Discussion on the Eve of the All-Russian CPRF Conference"]    [Text] The latest round of rayon report and election  conferences of the CPRF took place in Moscow last Saturday. The  conference of the communists of Kalininskiy Rayon was held in  the 40-Let Oktyabrya Cultural Center. The stage was decked with  flowers, the banner of the rayon party organization, and a bust  of Lenin. Comrades who had recently been accepted as party  members were issued their party cards by O. Shenin and G.  Zyuganov and were congratulated on this momentous day in their  life.    There was an uncompromising discussion of current party  events. The work of communists since the special 30th conference  was analyzed in depth in the party raykom report by Secretary S.  Penkov and in the subsequent debates. Speakers focused attention  on the restoration of the structures of the rayon party  organization and the reinstatement of primary party  organizations. Intraparty ties were strengthened, and contacts  were established with other parties and movements with  communist, socialist, and patriotic aims.    The communists of the rayon have taken an active part in all  the rallies and demonstrations organized by the opposition in  Moscow. They have conducted indoctrination and explanatory work  among workers and the population. They gave the editors of  PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, and GLASNOST financial assistance  and distributed these and other opposition publications.    There was also some self-criticism in the speeches, however,  in reference to certain shortcomings and omissions. According to  communists, the biggest obstacles impeding the growth of party  ranks are the continued absence of a CPRF program and the  endless arguments over its relationship to the UCP-CPSU.    O. Shenin and G. Zyuganov addressed the conference  participants and answered their questions.    During the discussion the communists approved resolutions  "On  the Results of the Rayon Party Organization's Work in the Report  Period and Its Primary Objectives" and "On United Action by the  Communist Parties of the Russian Federation and on Their  Relationship to the UCP-CPSU" and other documents.    The administrative bodies of the party organization and  delegates to the Moscow municipal party conference were elected  at the conference and candidates were nominated to serve as  delegates to the All-Russian CPRF Conference.</p>

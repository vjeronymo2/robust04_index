			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own"-signed report: "Bulletin"] </F>   [Excerpts] On 23 May, a meeting of the Georgian Workers  Communist Party, the Georgian Union of Communists, the political  organization "Stalin," and the international organization  "Remembrance of Stalin" was held in the conference hall of the  Officers House in Tbilisi.    Major General Panteleimon Giorgadze, member of the bureau of  the Georgian Workers Communist Party Central Committee,  delivered the opening address. He congratulated those  participating in the meeting on the unification of  socialist-oriented parties and organizations in Georgia and  wished them fruitful labor in the struggle for Georgia's happy  future.    Those participating in the meeting unanimously supported the  proposal made by Communist Pilipe Makharadze that the  socialist- oriented political parties and organizations in  Georgia unite to form one party that would be called "the  Georgian United Communist Party." He pointed out: "Our  strength and invincibility lies in unification. In order to  form the right and effective leadership of the united parties,  it is necessary to create a provisional political council in the  period prior to the congress; this council will, at the same  time, supervise preparations for the party congress."    On his proposal, those participating in the meeting -- there  were 452 Communists present -- adopted the decision that the  current meeting of socialist-oriented parties and organizations  should be called the United Congress of Parties Adhering  to Socialist Ideas.    A decision of the congress participants confirmed KOMUNISTI,  the press organ of the Georgian Workers Communist Party, as the  Georgian United Communist Party paper. [passage omitted]    Following discussion of the question, the congress adopted a  resolution and elected the members of the Georgian United  Communist Party Political Council.    At the same time, a Georgian United Communist Party  Political  Council session was held at which the rules of the party were  approved by a majority of votes. The rules are published in  this edition of the paper.    At the session, Panteleimon Giorgadze was elected chairman  of  the Georgian United Communist Party Political Council.    The following were elected deputy chairmen: Sergo Rigvava,  Grigol Oniani, and Vilhelm Makharadze. [passage omitted]    On 3 June 1994, a Georgian Workers Communist Party Central  Committee plenum was held. The plenum discussed organizational  matters.    1. Ivane Tsiklauri was released from his duties  as first secretary of the Georgian Workers Communist Party  Central Committee and was removed from the bureau.    2. Shalva Berianidze was released from his duties  as secretary of the Georgian Workers Communist Party Central  Committee and removed from the bureau.    3. Panteleimon Giorgadze was elected first  secretary of the Georgian Workers Communist Party Central  Committee, Vilhelm Makharadze was elected second  secretary, and Manana Kevanishvili secretary.</p>

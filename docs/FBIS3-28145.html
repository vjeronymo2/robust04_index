			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Three Scenarios for the </F> Japanese-U.S. Economic Framework Talks on the Eve of the Summit  Meeting"]    [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa will attend the  Japanese-U.S. summit talks set for 11 February after having  overcome the difficulty in initiating political reform.  Japanese-U.S. negotiations on such individual sectors as  government procurement, automobiles and auto parts, and  insurance which need to be settled prior to the summit talks are  still encountering rough sailing. The government plans to swap  the microeconomic individual sectors for macroeconomic stimulus  measures by announcing a package of stimulus measures prior to  the prime minister's visit to the United States. The U.S.  Government's pressure on Japan, however, is moving in the  direction of increasing. ASAHI SHIMBUN has analyzed the future  of the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks using three  scenarios.  <H5>  Failure </H5>   What most concerns a senior Foreign Ministry official is  having the working-level negotiations end after failing to  hammer out any agreement, with this inconclusive finish leaving  both sides unable to find ways to resume the negotiations at the  summit talks.    The most contentious point in the Japanese-U.S. negotiations  on individual sectors is setting "objective criteria" to measure  the openness of the Japanese market. The United States has  pressed Japan to set targets designed to increase the share of  foreign goods on the Japanese market to the level of the rest of  the G-7 industrialized nations. In response, Japan has rejected  the U.S. demand by saying, "We cannot accept the U.S. demand for  setting numerical targets." In this way, the two countries have  been locked in a showdown over the question of setting numerical  targets.    A high-ranking U.S. Government official has attacked  Japanese  bureaucrats by saying, "Japanese bureaucrats do not understand  the Hosokawa government's aims in reform." The same  high-ranking U.S. Government official also has urged Prime  Minister Hosokawa to make a political decision. During a 29  January meeting, however, Prime Minister Hosokawa and Hiroshi  Kumagai, minister of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry, confirmed anew the principle that "matters to be  discussed at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks should  be confined to what the government can do using its authority,  and Japan will not set any numerical targets."    If President Clinton sticks to the U.S. demand for setting  numerical targets against the backdrop of mounting congressional  pressure on Japan, it is highly possible that the Japanese-U.S.  economic framework talks will end in failure. An end to the  Hosokawa-Clinton honeymoon could cast a shadow on the future of  the Hosokawa government.  <H5>  Compromise </H5>   The second case is: An agreement cannot be reached at the  working-level negotiations on how to handle "objective  criteria," and the unresolved proposals of both sides are  included in the agenda of the summit talks. A compromise then  will have to be formulated "based on the relationship of trust  between Bill and Mori." They will probably decide on some  specific "objective criteria," while with regard to the  interpretation of such criteria, Clinton will say, "even if  numerical targets are not met, there will not be any sanctions,"  and Hosokawa will use an expression such as "we will make  efforts so that reforms to open the Japanese market will be  reflected in the numerical objective criteria," thus reaching an  accommodation.    In that case, the United States can tell its citizens,  "Japan  accepted numerical objective criteria," while Japan can explain  that "we were able to avoid setting numerical targets."    Even in this case, however, the deadlocked automobile  negotiations would be very difficult to resolve. While the  United States demands that the Japanese automobile industry  extend its commitment to purchase U.S.-made auto parts under a  plan covering up to fiscal year 1994, Japan refuses to include  this in the negotiating agenda, claiming "this should be left to  a cooperative approach between the private sectors."  <H5>  Agreement </H5>   There are also rumors about a "small package" agreement  covering only issues where agreement can be reached, and  shelving conflicting points. The new economic framework talks  will continue up to summer 1995, and during this period, summit  meetings are to be held every six months. Therefore, it is not  impossible to set aside some issues for future discussion.    This will depend on whether the economic-stimulation  measures  to be drawn up this week will receive highly favorable marks  from the United States. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has  pressed the Japanese Government by saying that "income tax cuts  will have to be of a very considerable scale, and if they  precede a consumption tax increase for only a short period, then  this will not be effective." In this regard, it will be  necessary for Hosokawa to overrule the Finance Ministry's  "principle of fiscal balance."    In this case, numerical targets can be shelved, while on the  other hand, an action program for government procurement,  covering not only the present areas under negotiation but also  extending to the liberalization of the market as a whole, will  be compiled to win U.S. approval.    Which scenario comes to pass depends not only on the  substance of the upcoming pump-priming measures but also on how  the United States looks at the future of the Hosokawa  administration. Because both sides by all means would like to  avoid a breakdown in the negotiations, it is expected that  efforts to reach an internal consensus -- and that negotiations  between Japan and the United States -- will continue up to the  last minute to achieve, at least, a precarious compromise or a  small package agreement.</p>

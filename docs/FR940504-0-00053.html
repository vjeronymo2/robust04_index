			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS has also considered whether the 11 percent incidental harvest rate is the minimum necessary to prosecute other fisheries. Because the bycatch in non-salmon fisheries, such as the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery, is almost exclusively chinook salmon, the bycatch of coho salmon in non-salmon fisheries is not a large concern. The Council determined that harvestable numbers of Central Valley and Klamath River fall chinook stocks warranted a chinook fishery on these stocks. In order to minimize the impacts on OCN coho salmon during these chinook fisheries, the Council recommended, and NMFS provides in this action that no coho retention be allowed. Thus the only mortality to coho salmon will be the result of hooking mortality from chinook fishing. In addition, the Council adjusted the geographic distribution of the fisheries so that the majority of chinook fishing occurs to the south, primarily off California, where the catch of OCN coho is the lowest. The Council recommended this geographic shift to the South to protect coho. However, this shift occurs at the expense of Oregon fishermen, who now will not have the opportunity to harvest as large a proportion of Klamath River fall chinook stocks as they might have absent coho conservation concerns. Finally, the States of Oregon and Washington have closed the Columbia River Buoy 10 fishery for coho salmon, and Oregon has taken additional restrictive actions in estuarine and freshwater fisheries to minimize the impacts of fishing on OCN coho. Based on these actions, NMFS believes that the 11 percent ocean and freshwater harvest rate is the minimum harvest rate necessary to prosecute other fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Commercial Troll Fisheries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Retention of coho salmon is prohibited in all areas due to the projected record low coho abundance. All seasons listed below apply only to salmon species other than coho. Chinook quotas are being implemented in the area between Florence South Jetty and House Rock, OR, to ensure that the ocean impacts on Klamath River fall chinook do not exceed those that have been modeled. Specifically, commercial troll fisheries will be limited to quotas of 12,000 chinook during May and June in the area between Florence South Jetty and Humbug Mountain, 1,500 chinook during May in the area between Sisters Rocks and House Rock, 800 chinook during August in the area between Sisters Rocks and Mack Arch, and 10,000 chinook during September and October in the area between Cape Arago and Humbug Mountain. Troll fisheries in other areas south of Cape Falcon are not limited by any chinook quotas, because of the minor contribution of Klamath stocks to the fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Point San Pedro, CA, to the U.S.-Mexico border, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will be open May 1 through June 11, then reopen July 1 through September 30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Point Reyes to Point San Pedro, CA, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will be open June 15 through September 30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Point Arena to Point Reyes, CA, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will be open August 1 through September 30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Horse Mountain to Point Arena, CA, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will be open September 1 through September 30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Sisters Rocks to House Rock, OR, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will open the following days, until May 31 or attainment of the chinook quota, whichever occurs first: May 1&hyph;2, 5&hyph;6, 10&hyph;11, 14&hyph;15, 18&hyph;19, 22&hyph;23, 26&hyph;27, and 31. The days open may be adjusted inseason, if necessary, to manage the fishery. Gear is restricted to no more than four spreads per line, with the open area restricted to 0&hyph;6 nm from shore.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Sisters Rocks to Mack Arch, OR, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will open August 8 and continue through August 31 or attainment of the chinook quota, whichever occurs first. This is a experimental fishery designed to determine the stock composition in the area in August, with particular concern for southern Oregon and Klamath chinook. It will be open to a limited number of fishers who must first preregister by July 1 with the ODFW office in Newport for selection by a random process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Florence South Jetty to Humbug Mountain, OR, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will open May 1 and continue through June 30 or attainment of the chinook quota, whichever occurs first. Gear is restricted to no more than four spreads per line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Cape Falcon to Florence South Jetty, OR, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will open May 1 through June 30, with gear restricted to no more than four spreads per line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Later in the season, the area from Cape Arago to Humbug Mountain, OR, will open for all salmon except coho on September 1 and continue through October 31 or attainment of the chinook quota, whichever occurs first. Gear is restricted to no more than four spreads per line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Cascade Head to Cape Arago, OR, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will open September 1 through October 31, with gear restricted to no more than four spreads per line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Cape Falcon to Cascade Head, OR, the commercial fishery for all salmon except coho will open October 1 through October 31, with gear restricted to no more than four spreads per line. A subarea in state waters at the mouth of Tillamook Bay will be closed to commercial troll fishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recreational Fisheries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Retention of coho salmon is prohibited from May 1, 1994, in all areas, due to the projected record low coho abundance.

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Haiti's president, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, has fired two widely criticized  Cabinet ministers in one of the highest-level personnel moves since  rank-and-file soldiers brought him to power eight months ago. The government  decree, read over state radio, came less than six weeks after the president  narrowly escaped an attempt by some officers to oust him. The two Cabinet  members, Foreign Affairs Minister Serge Elie Charles and Information Minister  Anthony St. Pierre, caused a public outcry for their role in granting a safe  conduct pass out of Haiti in December to former Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck  Romain. Romain was indicted in connection with a massacre of church  parishioners in November, 1988.  </P></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Cabinet sets emissions timetable THE government yesterday set a new timetable for reducing the UK's emissions of greenhouse gases. It declared its aim of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by the year 2000, rather 2005, the previous target. The cabinet said the new target was demanding and it would press ahead with reducing emissions on condition that other countries take similar action. 'It is hoped that all industrialised countries can make a similar commitment at the final session of the Climate Change Convention negotiations currently taking place in New York.' the statement said. However environmental groups were quick to point out that, without specific policies, targets to reduce emissions are meaningless. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said: 'In 1990 the government said it would take 15 years to stabilise emissions. But since then, carbon dioxide emissions in the UK have risen by 2 per cent even while GDP has fallen. Investment in energy conservation has dropped by 28 per cent.' Meanwhile, the cross-party House of Lords European Communities committee has urged the government to oppose the carbon/energy tax proposed by the European Commission. In a report published today, the committee argues that the proposed tax  - initially Dollars 3 per barrel of oil equivalent in 1993 and rising by Dollars 1 a year to a maximum of Dollars 10 by 2000 - would encourage switching to natural gas and nuclear energy at the expense of coal and oil. While it did not rule out the use of fiscal instruments to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, the committee stressed the proposed tax was 'a unilateral response to a global problem'. Compliance with a government proposal to speed up reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is likely to increase costs for both the motor industry and motorists, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday.</p>

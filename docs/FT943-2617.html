			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Council states terms for probe into 'Monklandsgate' Monklands district council in Scotland said yesterday that legal advice on powers and costs would determine whether a public inquiry was held into allegations about the way it is run. The ruling Labour group on the council agreed this week to seek an inquiry in response to pressure which has built up over the past 2 1/2 years. It boiled over in June during the bitter by-election campaign in the Monklands East parliamentary constituency, which was held until his death by John Smith, the Labour leader. It was widely believed during the campaign that the Scottish National party had a strong chance of winning the seat. The council has faced allegations - described locally as 'Monklandsgate' - that it has favoured the predominantly Roman Catholic town of Coatbridge over the largely Protestant Airdrie in the allocation of capital expenditure and council jobs. Earlier this year Mr Smith challenged Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, to hold an inquiry into the allegations, which were taken up by English Tory MPs. However, the government has said it would not be justified in holding an inquiry. The Labour group's decision to seek an inquiry is the result of an initiative by Mrs Helen Liddell, who won the seat in the by-election with a drastically reduced majority and confronted the issue during the campaign. She says that people with claims or charges against the council should come forward with evidence.</p>

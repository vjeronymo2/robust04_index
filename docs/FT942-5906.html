			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Leading Article: A Europe of many layers Purists might query whether Mr John Major is well-advised to discuss the future of Europe in language reminiscent of that of a Formula One racing commentator. Yet the UK prime minister's speech on Tuesday night, espousing a 'multi-track, multi-speed' Europe, was in many ways a statement of the obvious. The Maastricht treaty endorses the concept of European integration proceeding at varying paces. By gaining exemptions from the Maastricht arrangements over social policy and monetary union, the UK has already enshrined the principle in European law. Since the 1992-93 collapse of the narrow-margin ERM, patterns of EU monetary co-operation, for instance, have become still more heterogeneous. Over home affairs, as well as defence and foreign policy, different EU groupings are carrying out inter-governmental co-operation in different ways. As the EU grows, perhaps to 16 countries next year and more than 20 by early next century, the tendency towards greater diversity is likely to strengthen. At a time of rampant electioneering, it was perhaps not surprising that Mr Major's self-evident remarks should have been seized on as a novel statement of government policy. Almost inevitably the prime minister's remarks attracted catcalls from the opposition that he is irredeemably abandoning the UK to the 'slow lane' of Europe. Mr Major's problems are partly of his own making, but they also reveal how Britain is ensnared by contradictory fears about the development of Europe. The chief difficulty with the prime minister's rhetoric is that he is trying to send different messages to separate audiences. As a result, both messages and audiences become confused. Overt move Talk about opting out of layers of European integration may assuage Eurosceptics' concern that Britain's interests could be undermined by policies foisted on it from the Continent. Yet such comments disconcert those who are worried that an overt move towards political and monetary union by a group of countries led by France and Germany could cause Britain serious economic damage. Equally, Mr Major's trumpeting of a 'multi-speed' Europe conflicts with his insistence during the last three years that Britain maintains a well-regarded place at the topmost tables of European decision-making. Even in the contorted world of Europolitics, theories of black hole physics do not apply. Mr Major cannot both be 'at the heart of Europe' and simultaneously walk away from it. Independent policies At a broader level, Mr Major's statements over Europe mirror ambivalence in many EU capitals over the continent's future. By underscoring the advantages of Britain's retention of more independent social and monetary policies, Mr Major wants to lend weight to those in other EU countries who doubt the wisdom of a federal Europe. These doubts certainly exist, and they have grown since 1991. As demonstrated by the opinion poll in yesterday's Financial Times carried out across the 12 EU members, the German electorate, in particular, has become increasingly opposed to closer integration as laid down by Maastricht. Recent French government proposals for intensified co-operation by a Franco-German 'core' appear, at least in part, to reflect worries in Paris about a slippage in Germany's Maastricht commitment, above all over monetary union. Some of these German doubts are, it seems clear, also felt at the highest level in Paris. It is worth recalling that, before he became prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur publicly voiced scepticism about attempts to 'bind' Germany to western Europe through devices such as Maastricht. In view of the elections in Germany and France over the next 12 months, the clouds which hang over the direction of European policies are unlikely to lift until the EU is much closer to the Maastricht review conference in 1996. In the meantime, the EU will be well served if a consensus gains ground that, in many spheres, the degree of integration should be closely tailored to individual members' political preferences and economic capacities. Whatever his motives, Mr Major has made a sound point.</p>

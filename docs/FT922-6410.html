			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / French, German farmers denounce EC reforms FRENCH AND GERMAN farmers yesterday greeted the European Community farm policy reforms with outrage. Demonstrations, which broke out in France after Thursday night's agreement, continued as farmers set fire to bundles of straw and tyres at crossroads and protested in front of public buildings in several provincial towns. In Rouen, a demonstrator and a policeman were slightly injured after about 100 farmers set fire to a police post at the entrance to a government office. Demonstrators pelted the US consulate in Bordeaux with eggs but none of the outbursts caused serious damage. The farm unions, which had hoped for more vigorous protests, forecast further action in coming days. German farmers called an emergency meeting of their executive council to decide on further action, and warned that the reforms could mean 'the structural collapse of whole regions'. The reform package includes a 29 per cent fall in cereal prices over three years, a 15 per cent decline in beef price supports, with compensations on offer. Larger farms will have to take 15 per cent of their land out of production to get such payments The deal was denounced as a 'folly, an economic and political mistake' and meant 'agricultural Europe would become an American colony,' according to Mr Raymond Lacombe, president of the Federation Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles, the main farm union. He said the price reductions and compensations would encourage 'industrial' farming for some and leave everyone else 'poverty stricken and marginalised'. The German farmers' union, the DBV, declared that 'such a total transformation' of the system was 'both wrong and disastrous.' Mr Ignaz Kiechle, Germany's agriculture minister, in an attempt to mollify the farm lobby, insisted that compensation payments for European farmers must continue 'indefinitely' to make up for the drastic cuts in cereal prices agreed in Brussels. The EC reform package must be accepted in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks as the bottom line, he insisted. The compensation payments were quite simply non-negotiable. Mr Kiechle was given explicit public support by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who issued a personal statement declaring that the EC agricultural reform 'was not possible without substantial price cuts, especially for cereals'. Mr Kohl said the deal created the preconditions for a successful end to the Gatt talks, and asked the other Gatt partners to show a 'readiness to compromise.' Mr Louis Mermaz, the French farm minister, echoed this, insisting that the package was not for renegotiation. He tried to console farmers by arguing that incomes would 'not only be maintained but will even be improved because the fall in prices will be fully compensated for by aids, whatever the size of farm'. Meanwhile, Mr John Gummer, UK minister of agriculture, warned that consumers faced a continuing rise in food bills, in spite of the EC agreement. However, he estimated that over a three-year period prices would be 2 per cent lower than they otherwise would have been. Mr Gummer was praised in the House of Commons by government supporters for the substantial British contribution to the reform package.

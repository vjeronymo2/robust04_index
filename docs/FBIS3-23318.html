[passage omitted]    BKA President Zachert stressed his agreement with the  minister on plans for an organizational reform of the BKA. Many  measures, which are now to be implemented, had been discussed  long before the operation. Kanther cited the reduction to nine  departments, the merging of the departments for left-wing and  right-wing terrorism in the BKA branch in Meckenheim (near  Bonn), and a more intensive delegation of the president's  international obligations to subordinate officials. [passage  omitted]    Nehm rejected reports that liaison man Klaus Steinmetz, who  was uncovered during the operation, was a member of the RAF  command structure [see previous Terrorism Report]. His  authority had a corresponding note from the BKA, but the  suspicion had proved to be incorrect during subsequent  investigations, the chief federal prosecutor said. The  questions that had been raised have been "answered in such a way  that no criminal accusations against Steinmetz were made."</p>

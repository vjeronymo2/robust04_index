			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Five Heron creditors challenge refinancing FIVE CREDITORS of Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and trading group, have carried out a threat to challenge its refinancing proposals in the courts. They opposed an application to the UK courts to sanction the schemes. Each side now has to file further evidence and a hearing is expected in the week beginning July 26. Heron had hoped that the schemes would be ratified by the end of this month. The five, which together claim to be owed Dollars 42m (Pounds 28m) by Heron, are led by Mr Simon Shane, against whom Heron has filed a complaint in New York, alleging 'breach of duties and obligations, fraud and negligent misrepresentation'. Heron said yesterday: 'Mr Shane has a vested interest in attempting to interfere with Heron's restructuring thus forcing Heron into formal insolvency proceedings which would be to the detriment of creditors as a whole.' The proposals, involving the restructuring of Heron's Pounds 1.4bn of debt, were approved by large majorities of creditors at three meetings in the last two weeks. They have also been accepted by Heron's 82 banks. However, the schemes have to be ratified by the courts in the three jurisdictions where the creditors meetings were held. Heron said that it was taking the legal intervention seriously, but felt that the courts would take account of the votes by creditors at the meetings. At the UK meeting, of those creditors who voted more than 80 per cent by value and 75 per cent by number were in favour. Mr Shane's legal representative spoke at that meeting, raising the issues which are now being put to the court. The five creditors include First Eastern Developments, a Bermuda-based property consultancy headed by Mr Shane, and an associated company, Stratagem Development Corporation, which is suing Heron over a property development in New York. Heron is counter-claiming. The five creditors said that the documents sent to creditors explaining the proposals gave insufficient information for creditors 'to reach a decision on the merits of the schemes'. They also claimed the the proposals, which involve the issue of bonds representing senior and junior debt, could have 'serious consequences for certain categories of US creditors' because the securities will not be registered in the US.</p>

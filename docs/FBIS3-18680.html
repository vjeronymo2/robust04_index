Russia's influence on the Serbs in the conflict is of  considerable importance. Without Moscow's participation there  will not be a solution, Kinkel said in a short debate in the  Bundestag on Thursday [3 March]. As a result of the Russian  efforts, the chances for the reopening of the airport of the  beleaguered city of Tuzla have increased. The foreign minister  said that his hope for a peaceful solution has increased since  NATO's combat mission. Deputy Peter Glotz of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] conceded that the West was  recently pursuing a serious political approach to solutions.</p>

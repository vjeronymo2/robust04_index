			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Shares fall in building companies BRITISH construction and building material shares fell steeply again yesterday as bad news continued to pour out of the housebuilding sector. The share price of English China Clays, the world's largest producer of china clay, dropped almost a sixth to 371p after the company announced an unexpected Pounds 11m provision against its UK housebuilding division. Taylor Woodrow's share price, which had fallen by almost two-thirds since May, fell a further 18 per cent to 35p after the company announced it had made a Pounds 16m first-half pre-tax loss. On Tuesday, Wimpey, Britain's second largest housebuilder, announced it was halving its interim dividend.

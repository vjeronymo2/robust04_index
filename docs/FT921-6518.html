			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris resume upward march SENIOR BOURSES resumed their upward march after Tuesday's brief setback, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT had a strong day, as trading concentrated on Volkswagen and second-liners. The DAX index closed up 14.97 at 1,737.27, the day's high, while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 2.60 to 704.29. Volume rose to DM7.6bn from DM7.3bn. VW gained DM5.50 to DM362.00 as the market was caught short by a rush of buy orders. The stock was also lifted by reports that the new Golf was virtually booked out until the end of September and that the company was introducing extra shifts to meet demand. However, analysts cautioned that the new Golf was aggressively priced, which suggested little enhancement to profit margins. Among second-liners, Henkel closed DM11.40 at DM608.90 and Altana gained DM20 to DM670. Schering added DM18.50 to DM867. PARIS also ended at the day's high as international investors resumed their buying of cyclical stocks, encouraged by the stronger dollar. The CAC-40 index added 27.78 or 1.4 rate turnover of FFr2.8bn. Among the index heavyweights, Elf added FFr7.40 to FFr386.50, Michelin put on FFr5.10 to FFr170 and Peugeot rose FFr17 to FFr747. The supermarket group Casino climbed FFr9.40 to FFr168.40 in good volume of 245,900 shares and the retailer Promodes rose FFr96 to FFr3,125 on rumours that the two will merge. Hachette jumped FFr16 or 9.9 per cent to FFr178 on reports that it will reduce its stake in the troubled television company La Cinq from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. The drinks company Remy Cointreau gained FFr14.90 or 7.8 per cent to FFr204.90 on light volume of 6,475 shares. BZW, which is believed to be involved in Remy's share placement, is presenting the company in London on March 13 and in Paris on March 16. MILAN lost early gains. The Comit index fell 2.3 to 542.74 in turnover estimated at L90bn after L125.7bn. The session started strongly with Fiat gaining L81 to L5,131 and other stocks in the Agnelli group rose, IFI adding L100 to L13,300. But weakness in insurers and banks spread to the rest of the market. La Fondiaria dropped L1,040 or 2.7 per cent to L37,800. Credito Italiano fell L195 to L2,100 on fears that it will have to offer a higher price to take control of Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura. AMSTERDAM saw strong foreign buying in Akzo, mainly from US and UK investors, after the chemicals group reported a 13 per cent drop in 1991 net profit. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 126.4. Akzo's results were at the lower end of expectations, but analysts believe that the group has good earnings potential this year. The shares closed at a record high, up Fl 2.8 or 1.9 per cent, at Fl 150.50. ZURICH was lifted by Frankfurt and London and the SPI index closed up 5.1 at 1,141.8. Oerlikon-Buehrle bearers closed up SFr38 or nearly 11 per cent to SFr386 after the industrial and armaments group reported a smaller than expected operating loss for 1991. COPENHAGEN fell in quiet trading, the CSE index down 0.45 at 349.61, writes Hilary Barnes. Baltica Holding, down DKr20 on Tuesday after reducing its profits forecast, rose DKr7 to DKr352 while Novo Nordisk fell DKr4 to DKr525. STOCKHOLM drifted, the Affarsvarlden General Index inching ahead 0.1 to 927.3 in volume of SKr372m. Astra put on SKr7 to SKr577. SE Banken closed up SKr1.50 at SKr46.50. MADRID moved narrowly ahead, the general index closing up 2.8 at 262.34. Telefonica continued to rise, gaining Pta35 or 3 per cent to Pta1,150. Utilities were firm. BRUSSELS was boosted by an afternoon fall in bond yields. The Bel-20 index closed up 4.35 at 1,197.99 in heavy turnover of BFr1bn. GIB rose BFr38 to BFr1,390 with nearly 160,000 shares traded.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 26  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open      10 am     11 am   12 pm     1 pm    2 pm      3 pm   close 1159.91  1160.55   1161.21  1161.12  1162.13  1161.82  1166.27  1165.89  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Day's High  1166.91    Day's Low  1159.65  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Feb 25     Feb 24     Feb 21      Feb 20     Feb 19        1156.42     1163.91    1154.51     1149.62    1140.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

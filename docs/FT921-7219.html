			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: HK stock clearing system closer A CENTRAL stock clearing system for the Hong Kong stock market could be operational before the summer following agreement between the regulator and representatives of the market. Mr Paul Chow, the exchange's chief executive, said agreement on all outstanding issues had been reached between the exchange, the Securities and Futures Commission - the colony's financial watchdog - and the Hongkong Securities Clearing Company, the entity which will operate the system. This agreement has paved the way for the SFC to recognise the clearing company formally. It is hoped the new system will be operational on a trade-for-trade basis within eight to 12 weeks. After the colonial government has enacted its Securities (Clearing Houses) Bill, market risk will be centralised within the company. However, brokers will be required to take out professional indemnity insurance and make monthly transaction reports. Governance of the clearing house has been one of the main stumbling blocks to agreement, with the SFC and government wanting to see sufficient outside representation on its board. The board will consist of 22 members: 11 from the exchange; five appointed by the financial secretary; five from the banks; and the chief executive of the clearing company.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA SUSPENDS ITS INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> It is sad news to read ("Lithuanians Give In, Agree to Moratorium," Part A,  June 30), that the Lithuanians had to give in to Mikhail Gorbachev's demands to  suspend their declaration of independence. It is noteworthy that the moratorium  was passed almost exactly by the minimum required of the two-thirds majority  vote, versus the 95% vote by the same body when restoration of independence was  declared.  </P> <P> I am certain that this would not have happened if this Soviet-occupied nation  had any hopes for support and recognition of its independence from Western  democracies. Instead of that Lithuania received only sympathy and evasive  gestures.  </P> <P> This free neutral nation, along with Estonia and Latvia, was occupied in 1940  by the Soviets as a direct result of the secret agreement between Hitler and  Stalin. Now it is being sold out again to Gorbachev by President Bush, West  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand. Did  anything really change in the last 50 years?  </P> <P> KEST A. MIKENAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

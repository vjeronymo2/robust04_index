			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Osborne &amp; Little Pounds 2.6m in profit The improvement seen in the first half continued into the second at Osborne &amp; Little, the wallpaper and fabrics group, and enabled it to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.6m for the year to March 31. There were losses of Pounds 98,000 last time. Turnover amounted to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 17.9m) and the pre-tax result last time was after a Pounds 1.2m loss on the disposal of discontinued operations. Earnings per share of 26.44p (8.12p losses) were helped by the company buying in a further 300,000 of its shares for cancellation, in addition to the 705,000 bought in March 1993. It intends to purchase a further 600,000 if earnings can be expected to be further enhanced. A proposed final dividend of 4p (2.6p) lifts the total to 6.5p (4.6p).</p>

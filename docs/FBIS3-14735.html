As reported, during the visit Geydar Aliyev met with the  leadership of Great Britain. Treaty on Friendship and  Cooperation, as well as a packet of protocols about the  intentions were signed.    At London press conference on February 24 Geydar Aliyev  assessed the visit as a "successful".    Commenting on the treaty, signed in Moscow by Defense  Ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia, Geydar Aliyev said that  "this document infringes upon Azerbaijan's interests, but we  signed it for the sake of peaceful regulation of the conflict".    Answering the question of the journalists about the  perspectives of peaceful regulation of Armenian-Azeri conflict,  Aliyev said "we adhere to the peaceful regulation, but the  recent reports about the Armenian offensive on Tauzskiy region  of Azerbaijan testify that Armenia is not ready for the peaceful  regulation of the conflict". Aliyev also said that "in the light  of the new Armenian attack upon the territory of Azerbaijan, the  prospects of signing a long-termed peace agreement becomes  hardly probable".</p>

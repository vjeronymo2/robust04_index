			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar Television Network  in Japanese at 1108 GMT on 22 May, in its "Sunday Project"  program, carries a 37-minute interview with Yohei Kono,  president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], by political  commentator Soichiro Tahara.    Tahara first mentions a comment by Wataru Kubo, secretary  general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is  approved.    Kono says: "After the current cabinet resigns en masse, we  have to look at the question of who will lead the next  administration. We have to talk about whether we will be able  cooperate with each on matters of policy. We are now working  through our respective Diet policy committees to find out if we  can cooperate with the SDPJ on Diet policy matters."    He is then asked for his thoughts on the next general  election.    Kono says: "The next election should be held under a system  of single-seat and proportional representation because we have  promoted political reform this far.    "However, the problem is that we will have to hold the  election under the multiple-seat constituency system if the Hata  administration dissolves the Diet right now."    Tahawa presses Kono to explain more fully the LDP's plans if  it forces the Hata administration to resign and then forms the  next administration before a general election is called.    Kono Says: "It depends on the quality of the new government.  Mr. Tahara, I think we can say it will still be a minority  government if the LDP single-handedly takes power. We will have  more Diet seats than the current administration and, unlike the  current administration, we will be able to unify opinions more  easily because it will be a single-party government.  Nevertheless, it will be a minority government. This means we  will seek the judgment of the people after making preparations  for an election."    He is asked if the next cabinet, either an LDP one or an  LDP-SDPJ coalition, will be merely a caretaker cabinet which  looks after preparations for the next election.    Kono says: "Although it is important to seek the judgment of  the people, I should not say at this stage that we would hold an  election at any cost tomorrow or the day after tomorrow."    Asked to explain differences between the policies of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa  and his own, Kono says: "It seems Ozawa is saying the people  exist for the nation, that priority should be given not to the  people but to national interests. We maintain, however, that we  will build a nation for the people."]    On reorganization, which he made at a news conference in  China on the possibility of returning to the coalition.    Asked what he thinks of Kubo's comment, Kono says Kubo also  feels the current political situation, in which the country is  led by a minority government, is abnormal and that the Hata  cabinet should resign en masse. He also points out that Chief  Cabinet Secretary Kumagai, following Kubo's remark, hinted at  the possibility of the government dissolving the cabinet if the  SDPJ comes back into the coalition.    Kono then says: "As the chief cabinet secretary's remarks  indicate, the current administration would do anything as long  as it can remain in power."    He is then asked if the LDP will change its strategy if the  SDPJ returns to the coalition.    Kono says: "The SDPJ is a big party, so there are many  different opinions among its executive department members,  including Kubo and Muryama."    Tahara then asks Kono to explain the LDP's strategy once it  has called for a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet. Kono  provides a lengthy critique of the minority government and its  inability to manage state affairs, and says the cabinet should  resign en masse immediately after the fiscal 1994 budget is  approved.    Kono says: "After the current cabinet resigns en masse, we  have to look at the question of who will lead the next  administration. We have to talk about whether we will be able  cooperate with each on matters of policy. We are now working  through our respective Diet policy committees to find out if we  can cooperate with the SDPJ on Diet policy matters."    He is then asked for his thoughts on the next general  election.    Kono says: "The next election should be held under a system  of single-seat and proportional representation because we have  promoted political reform this far.    "However, the problem is that we will have to hold the  election under the multiple-seat constituency system if the Hata  administration dissolves the Diet right now."

We maintain, however, that we  will build a nation for the people."    On reorganization in the political world, Kono says the  system of two major parties proposed by Ozawa will not be able  to meet people's demands.    "I think there should be many parties," he says.    Asked about revising the constitution, Kono says: "I think  the time is not ripe enough to revise the constitution."</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fisons' chairman rejects call for merger FISONS' chairman, Sir Patrick Egan, yesterday rejected calls at the group's annual general meeting for the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment company to merge with another group. A shareholder said the new management had 'totally lost credibility' following the decision to cease developing tipredane, a potentially important asthma treatment, and what Sir Patrick admitted had been a disappointing year. The shareholder said: 'Maybe now is the time to consider a merger so shareholders can look forward to some future growth.' Sir Patrick said the company was continuing to put its house in order. 'We are confident we now have the right strategies and capital investment in R&amp;D to create further growth for shareholders,' he explained. He added that the group would continue to look for collaborative alliances. He warned, however, that Fisons' growth during the first half of 1993 would be held back by the recession on the Continent and pressure on margins scientific instruments This business had had a very difficult time last year, said Sir Patrick. Meanwhile, the group announced it had agreed to sell its North American horticulture business to Macluan Capital Corporation, the Vancouver-based group, for Dollars 60m (Pounds 39m) cash. The Fisons business had turnover of about Dollars 85m last year and operating profits of about Dollars 14m. Proceeds would be used to reduce borrowings. The UK business and two small Continental operations were still for sale. Sir Patrick claimed they were trading profitably, and warned he would prefer to keep them rather than sell them at knock-down prices. Tilade, Fisons' latest asthma treatment, would be launched this month, said Sir Patrick. He said he expected a licence for the product in Japan later this year.</p>

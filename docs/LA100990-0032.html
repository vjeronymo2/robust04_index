			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD'S 'WINDFALL'  </P> <P> A windfall is defined as "an unexpected or undeserved stroke of good fortune."  The Times unfortunately chose the word "windfall" to describe the potential  increase in state and federal funding that the city of Oxnard may receive due  to the preliminary population count released by the U.S. Census Bureau.  </P> <P> As noted correctly by The Times, the preliminary count shows Oxnard with a  population of 137,468 -- significantly higher than the State Department of  Finance estimate of 129,980. However, this preliminary figure is neither  unexpected nor undeserved. We have long maintained that Oxnard's population was  severely undercounted in the 1980 census and, as a result, tax dollars that  have been paid by Oxnard residents over the years have been flowing from our  large, ethnically diverse, lower-income residents to other cities that have  wealthier, easier-to-count communities.  </P> <P> The correction of such an inequity can in no way be considered a "windfall,"  any more than the return of stolen property to its rightful owner would be a  windfall for the victim of a theft.  </P> <P> The city of Oxnard funded an aggressive program to reach out to our homeless,  minority and non-English-speaking populations to encourage participation in the  census, a program that still continues.  </P> <P> It must be emphasized that the figures are preliminary, and that the census is  not over yet. We are presently reviewing the housing-unit figures provided by  the Census Bureau, and will be presenting to the bureau a response reflecting  some concerns we have with their preliminary figures. For example, the figures  from the Census Bureau assert that nearly 25% of the housing units in the  Oxnard Shores area are vacant, and that more than 11% of the units in the city  of Port Hueneme are vacant. We have questions about these figures, as well as  concerns that all of the hundreds of doubled-up families (whose addresses we  provided to the Census Bureau) be included in the final census count.  </P> <P> If you or anyone you know hasn't been counted, call us at 984-4609, or the  Census Bureau at 1-800-999-1990 (English) or 1-800-CUENTAN (Spanish) to make  sure you are included.  </P> <P> KARL LAWSON  </P> <P> Coordinator, Oxnard/Port Hueneme  </P> <P> Census Outreach Program  </P></p>

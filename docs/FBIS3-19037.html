			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanover (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel has noted "considerable common ground with the SPD  [Social Democratic Party]" on foreign policy, for example on  European policy. Speaking to the Hannover NEUE PRESSE (Friday  [11 March] edition), Kinkel referred however to the dispute over  international deployments by the Bundeswehr. This is an  absolutely central issue, over which Germany risks being damaged  by the SPD's blockade. The SPD must "force itself to make a  turnaround" on this, Kinkel demanded. Even a clarification by  the Federal Constitutional Court does not "release the SPD from  its share of the responsibility to find the necessary political  solution on the necessary amendment to the Basic Law on  Bundeswehr deployment." The Federal Republic has every reason  to strengthen the United Nations in terms of organization,  personnel, and finance, Kinkel said. Germany has no cause to  "humble itself." It must represent its interests, but it also  has to realize that these interests are linked to those of other  states. "We adhere to our culture of restraint," the minister  added.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Campbell aims to clinch third Conservative term CANADA's ruling Progressive Conservative party last night chose Ms Kim Campbell as its leader and the country's first woman prime minister. Ms Campbell, a blunt-speaking 46-year-old lawyer from Vancouver, won against four other candidates on the second ballot of a party convention in Ottawa. She secured 53 per cent of the votes cast by 3,452 delegates on the final ballot. Her nearest rival was Mr Jean Charest, the environment minister. The other three candidates withdrew after the first ballot. Ms Campbell had originally been regarded as a firm favourite to win the contest because of her credentials as a bilingual woman candidate from British Columbia. But her lead narrowed before the convention after she was characterised as a prickly intellectual whose command of French was not as fluent as first thought. Ms Campbell, currently defence minister, will take over from Mr Brian Mulroney and announce a new cabinet within 10 days. Her immediate priority is to secure a third consecutive mandate for the Conservatives in the next general election, which a senior party official said would probably be called in September. The Conservatives and the opposition Liberals are running neck-and-neck in opinion polls. Ms Campbell, who was hailed during the convention as 'a new sensation' in Canadian politics, indicated that she would try to distance herself from the record of the unpopular Mulroney government, without making any radical changes in policy. In her keynote speech, she promised 'a new agenda for government and a new approach to politics'. She pledged 'not to duck our problems but to confront them'. But she has given few specifics, beyond a commitment to eliminate the federal budget deficit, which totalled close to CDollars 35bn (Pounds 17.8bn) last year, within five years. She also pledged to 'reduce the size and scale of government'. Ms Campbell has backed the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. A senior adviser said yesterday, however, that her early initiatives may include an adjustment programme to help workers whose jobs are threatened.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT  </P> <P> The latest coup attempt in the Philippines has failed again. This time, though,  the coup's underlying message is getting increasingly loud and clear: The Cory  magic is no more, and it's time to listen to the rebels' demands. At least,  those legitimate ones. They have two: Stop the widespread corruption in the  government, and destroy the communist threat.  </P> <P> Of course, Corazon Aquino still has the support of the majority of her people,  but this support has been eroding at an increasingly rapid and alarming pace,  mainly because of her failure to check corruption in the government.  </P> <P> The prevailing feeling is that there is simply too much corruption, both in the  civilian government and the military sector, much like the type which  characterized the 20-year Marcos rule. The late Ferdinand Marcos' lengthy term  saw the birth and institutionalization of graft and corruption, so much so that  it regrettably became a way of life among Filipinos.  </P> <P> At the outset, the Aquino administration was seemingly bent on driving  corruption out of the government service. For a while it was successful,  primarily due to the effort of those honest people that she appointed to help  her rid the nation of corruption. A year later, it started to fail miserably,  largely because Aquino's ruling party decided, for political convenience and to  achieve some semblance of stability, to take into its fold the very same  corrupt politicians, feudal lords and military leaders that the Marcos regime  spawned and coddled. Inevitably then, it became business as usual for these  corrupt men.  </P> <P> Ironically, corruption and the growing communist threat were the two main  issues Aquino used during her campaign against Marcos in 1986, issues which are  haunting her now. Fortunately, it is not yet too late for Aquino to restore her  lost appeal. According to the latest polls, the Filipino people still trust her  as a person. The polls also disclosed that it is not she, but her close  relatives and their political cohorts against whom the Filipino people are up  in arms -- summarily accusing them of rampant corruption and  influence-peddling.  </P> <P> DANTE A.

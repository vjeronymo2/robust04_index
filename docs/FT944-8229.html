			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ricoh ahead despite slack investment Ricoh's lead in digital copiers and its cost-cutting measures helped it to raise non-consolidated profits strongly in the first half, in spite of sluggish capital investment. The Japanese manufacturer of office automation equipment posted a 63 per cent rise in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y10.1bn (Dollars 103m) from Y6.2bn a year earlier. The increase came on the back of a 3 per cent rise in sales to Y305.3bn from Y295.2. Ricoh suffered from slack private capital investment in Japan and the impact of a high yen on exports. Nevertheless, it was able to increase sales in most of its leading product lines. Sales of copiers, accounting for 68 per cent of the company's sales, increased at home and overseas, climbing 8 per cent in total. Information equipment enjoyed a rise in demand both in domestic and export markets, with sales increasing 5 per cent overall. The company forecasts full-year sales to rise 3 per cent to Y616bn from Y596.8 and recurring profits to rise 40 per cent to Y20.5bn from Y14.6bn. Net income is forecast to increase 77 per cent to Y12.7bn, compared with Y7.2bn</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eirik Ramberg: "Conservatives Want Stricter </F> Asylum Measures" -- introductory paragraph in boldface as  published]    [Excerpt] The Conservatives feel that Norway should  tighten its policy towards those who seek asylum on its  shores.    Many of the asylum-seekers coming to Norway are actually  economic refugees. These should not be allowed to take the  places of other refugees who really need them. Norway should not  take in fewer refugees, but more of those Norway does admit  should be on the UN High Commissioner's refugee list. "These are  the ones who need asylum most," said Anders C. Sjaastad  (Conservative), vice chairman of the Justice Committee in the  Storting.  <H5>  Supports Approval </H5>   The Storting will discuss refugee policy at today's session.  The government made three statements concerning the situation  last week. The groundwork for today's debate was laid by  presentations on government policy made by Foreign Minister  Bjorn Tore Godal, Districts Minister Gunnar Berge, and Justice  Minister Grete Faremo.    The Labor Party, the Conservatives, and Progress Party will  ensure that a quorum is present in the Storting for the  government resolution that will open the way for sending Kosovo  Albanians back to their homeland and make visas obligatory for  Bosnians. Today's debate will take the form of a preliminary  exchange of ideas on a comprehensive refugee policy. Only after  the government has presented its report to the Storting can a  set of guidelines be formulated on the issues of temporary  residence for refugees and the right to asylum.  <H5>  Integration? </H5>   Sjaastad, the Conservative spokesman on justice issues,  favored the principle of temporary residence for refugees  provided that they return to their homeland as soon as it is  feasible to do so.    "It is clear enough that the question of integration into  Norwegian society will be difficult. Refugees need to have the  opportunity to adapt to daily life in Norway. But long-term  undertakings such as job training or extensive education should  be looked at more closely in terms of appropriateness," Sjaastad  told AFTENPOSTEN.    He stressed that one must meet the challenge of an  increasing  number of refugees "with a somewhat open mind."    "We are dealing with people. It is important that attention  be paid to individual needs," Sjaastad said.  <H5>  Dividing Line </H5>   The political dividing line in refugee policy, at least in  the concrete issues of visa requirements for Bosnians and the  return of the Kosovo Albanians, corresponds to the EU [European  Union] division. Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa, the Center Party  second in command and the leader of the parliamentary delegation  to Kosovo, felt that the government was undermining the right to  asylum. Lisbeth Holand (Socialist Left Party), spokesman for the  Justice Committee, concurred and Kjell Mange Bondevik, chairman  of the Christian Party, said the Kosovo Albanians must be  accorded temporary residence in Norway on the same footing as  the Bosnians.

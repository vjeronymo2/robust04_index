			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Leading Article: More knocks for the PIA Few disinterested observers would argue with the Treasury select committee's assertion that the British retail financial services industry has for too long been characterised by incompetence and mis-selling. The irony is that the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), a watchdog that has not yet even been recognised by the Securities and Investments Board, has attracted louder and more damaging criticism than the existing regulatory bodies that so signally failed to check the abuses that have come to light. The risk, amidst all the hullabaloo that now surrounds the future of the PIA, is that the need for more rigorous and speedy investor protection will be overlooked. The credibility of the PIA's chairman, Mr Joe Palmer, has undeniably been damaged by an unfortunate gaffe before the select committee and by misdemeanours committed by Legal &amp; General, which he used to run. Yet it is not clear that the committee is right in thinking that a new chairman would help at this point. Any new candidate would be unlikely to command universal confidence. The job calls for an understanding of the industry, the respect of consumer groups and the public, and a deft hand in dealing with politicians. Even if such a paragon could be found, the loss of yet another chairman, after the departure last year of Sir Gordon Downey, would in itself be damaging. The priority at this point should be to implement those of the select committee's recommendations that are designed to put this rickety show on the road as quickly as possible. Calls for changes in the balance of the PIA board to strengthen public interest representation, close monitoring of commission-only salesmen and individual registration of salesmen and advisers are eminently sensible. Should Mr Palmer fail to deliver on such minimum requirements of the committee within a reasonable time of the PIA being recognised, then the case for replacing him will be unanswerable. The wider question concerns the logic of the SIB's continuing role in retail regulation. This is, in effect, a fifth wheel on the regulatory coach, which opens up undesirable scope for regulatory arbitrage. The PIA is not a self-regulatory body along the lines originally envisaged by the Financial Services Act. The objection to it both setting standards and regulating practitioners is no longer relevant; and the case for an intermediate body, the SIB, between the PIA and the Treasury has lost its rationale. But if the PIA were to become a 'designated agency', such as the SIB, it would not have legal power to go down the desirable path of individual registration or to impose fines. That, along with technical legal problems, means that legislation would be necessary to knock the structure into coherent shape. But the Treasury prefers to hide behind the protective shelter of the SIB. In view of the magnitude of past failures in the area, that is a bridge the government must eventually cross.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Algeria wins a breathing space: Islamic party leader arrested - Authorities maintain tight control A WEEK after returning from 28 years' exile to run Algeria's emergency council of state, Mr Mohammed Boudiaf has for the moment headed off a threat of serious civil strife. By a skilful mix of concession and repression, and exploiting his untainted political credentials, this 71-year-old veteran independence leader has won an important breathing space. He has successfully countered the pressure from the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which was denied certain victory in the second round of the country's first multi-party elections that should have been held on January 16. Security forces last night arrested Mr Abdel Kader Hachani, the acting leader of the FIS for inciting soldiers to desert the army. The arrest was on the orders of Gen Khaled Nazzer, the minister of defence and Algeria's military strong-man. Also detained for questioning were the editor and deputy editor of Khabbar, the Arabic language newspaper sympathetic to the FIS and the only one to have published the Front's political statements. The call to desert was issued over the weekend by the FIS ruling council, the Majlis-es-Shura, which was addressed by Mr Hachani. Mr Hachani's arrest was widely predicted and he had been telling colleagues he expected such a reaction from the authorities. The authorities this week again refused to release from jail Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali ben Hadj, the two senior FIS leaders imprisoned since June. The military-backed government has also continued to round up FIS supporters. The FIS claims more than 500 have been arrested since the military clampdown last week. There have also been two reported instances of members of the security forces being killed outside Algiers. But the FIS has been careful to avoid a confrontation either by calling a strike or by bringing its people on to the streets. Within the past few days the army has returned to barracks, leaving only a discreet presence of tanks outside key buildings. But it has retained a tight cordon on roads leading to the capital at night. The authorities have kept the FIS guessing whether or not the organisation would be banned. They have also been careful to allow the press to speak freely: however the bulk of the press has been inimical to the FIS's declared aim of establishing an Islamic society. Mr Boudiaf's return from exile in Morocco was negotiated by the six members of the Higher Executive Committee. The latter was formed in the wake of President Chadli Bendjedid's resignation on January 12 and is the real decision-maker. Before agreeing to lead Algeria in such dramatic circumstances after being so long opposed to what he described as a military dictatorship, Mr Boudiaf secretly visited Algiers. The conditions he set for his return remain undisclosed. But it has been clear from the outset he intends to be more than a mere puppet. At the same time, the formation of the Council of State as a consultative body composed of an astute mix of respected public figures unifying the country's complex regional and religious activities, has signalled the authorities' desire to operate by consensus. In his only public statement, Mr Boudiaf warned the FIS that in a country where Islam was the state religion no single group could claim it had a monopoly. Equally significant, he was withering about the national liberation front (FLN), which has dominated Algerian political life since independence. The other main lay party, the Social Front (FFS) headed by Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, the veteran Kabyle leader, has also sought dialogue with the FIS and protested against the annulment. But Mr Ait Ahmed's opposition remains token since he is opposed to imposition of full Islamic rule. The FIS appears unable to decide whether to play for time and accept it must operate under new rules or go underground. Against this background, Algeria's new rulers believe they can count on a significant element in the FIS vote having been a protest against corruption and the FLN's abuse of power rather than a conviction to install Islamic fundamentalism. But this protest vote, if that is what it was, will only be weaned from the FIS by quick measures which address popular grievances of housing and employment.</p>

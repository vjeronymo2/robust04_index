			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igoro Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a letter to Latvian  President Guntis Ulmanis which expresses confidence that Latvia  will not view the agreement with Russia on the schedule and  terms of the temporary use of Russia's radar in Skrunda as  "humiliating or imposed," the Latvian president's office  announced.    IF Note: During talks in Moscow on Monday, the Latvian and  Russian delegations came to an agreement that the radar would  function over the next four years and would be dismantled during  the 18 months following the expiration of that term.    If Latvia accepts these terms, Russia will remove its troops  from Latvia by August 31, 1994. Earlier, Russia had intended to  use it over the next five years. Latvia insisted on three years  plus one more year for the dismantling of the radar.    During a Latvian governmental delegation's visit to  Washington last week, U.S. secretary of State Warren Christopher  recommended that Latvia and Russia come to terms on the  temporary use of the radar in the village of Skrunda.    Clinton wrote in his letter that a compromise would be the  best solution, as it will ensure the Russian troops' withdrawal  this year.    He also expressed confidence that the work done during the  Latvian delegation's visit to Washington had ensured progress in  the Latvian-Russian talks and helped improve relations between  these two states.</p>

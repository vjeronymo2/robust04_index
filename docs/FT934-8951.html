			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Schering forecasts 3% decline SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, expects to pay an unchanged dividend of DM13 for 1993, on net profits likely to be down by about 3 per cent on last year's DM262m (Dollars 155m), Mr Klaus Pohle, finance director, said yesterday. At the nine-month mark earnings were DM194m compared with DM201m in 1992, according to an interim report. The company blamed the fall on increasing competition and prices pressure in the drugs business, and falling plant protection sales. Turnover in Germany, hit by recession and health service reforms, fell 12 per cent to DM694m, while foreign business grew 4 per cent to DM3.36bn. The company's shares, which have performed strongly since its multiple sclerosis treatment, Betaseron, was approved by the US authorities last July, lost DM15 on the Frankfurt stock exchange, closing at DM1,080. Schering stock has also benefited from the company's sharpened focus on the pharmaceuticals business. In its most recent move, it agreed to merge its plant protection operations with those of Hoechst, retaining only a minority stake. According to Mr Pohle, sales of Betaseron in the US next year are likely to exceed DM300m compared with DM30m in the current period. Approval for its use in Europe is not expected before 1995. Meanwhile, the VCI federal chemicals industry association forecast another poor year for the sector in 1994. Although volume sales might improve, turnover and profits would remain unsatisfactory, it said. For the current year, it expected volumes to fall 3.5 per cent and industry-wide turnover to drop almost 7 per cent. With an eye on the current wage negotiations, the association warned of more job cuts to come after 30,000 this year. Unit labour costs in the first eight months of 1993 were more than 3 per cent up on the year, while average productivity had risen only 0.3 per cent.</p>

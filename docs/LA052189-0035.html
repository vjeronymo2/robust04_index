			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUTS, GLORY AND THEIR EGOS  </P> <P> Re "Guts, Glory and No Regrets" (May 10): After reading Josh Getlin's article  on Col. David Hackworth, U.S.A.-retired, one concludes that the difference  between Gen. George Patton and Hackworth can be summed up briefly: both had  tremendous egos and both served their country with optimal distinction.  However, Patton put country above ego in the final test, and that makes all the  difference in the world.  </P> <P> MICHAEL SUOZZI  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

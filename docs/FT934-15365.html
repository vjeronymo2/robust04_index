			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Premier Health losses widen Premier Health Group - the nursing management company formerly known as Acsis - had a difficult first half, turning in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.2m for the six months to June 30, against a Pounds 285,000 deficit for the comparable period last year. There were same-again losses per share of 0.4p and, as last time, no dividend will be paid. Turnover on continuing activities was Pounds 6.27m (Pounds 6.53m). Before the refinancing and restructuring completed in September, the company had borrowings of Pounds 12.6m and was in breach of its covenants and repayment agreements. The group now has overdrafts of Pounds 275,000, cash of Pounds 372,000 and long term borrowings of Pounds 3.2m. The pre-tax figure was struck after refinancing costs of Pounds 523,000 and an exchange loss on long-term borrowings of Pounds 149,000 (gain of Pounds 172,000). Interest charges were reduced to Pounds 179,000 (Pounds 541,000). There was a profit of Pounds 239,000 arising from the closure of a discontinued business.</p>

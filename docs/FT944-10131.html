			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Watchdog to probe Carrefour share fall The French market watchdog yesterday launched a formal inquiry into Carrefour, one of the country's leading hypermarket chains, in the wake of a sharp drop in the company's share price following rumours on the Paris bourse. The rumours appeared to be the cause of a drop of up to 8 per cent in the price of the shares yesterday, following a decline the day before of 4.7 per cent. The Commission des Operations de Bourse confirmed last night it was investigating Carrefour on two grounds: the market in the shares, and two pieces of price-sensitive information it had received two days earlier. It refused to give details of what the information concerned. However, Carrefour said the share price fall appeared to have been caused by two rumours: that it was to announce an increase in its capital in an effort to buy Caro, a distribution company, and that it had offered bribes to the Communist party. The group flatly denied the two rumours yesterday and said it would welcome and co-operate fully with an inquiry by the COB. It said it had no plans to buy Caro, with which it said it had no connection. The company added that it had no detailed knowledge of the background to any bribes, but firmly rejected suggestions any money had been paid to the Communist Party.</p>

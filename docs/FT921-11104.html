			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Appointments: Greencore adds to youthful team Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods company dogged by scandal last year, is hoping to distance itself from past events with a new, vigorous - and very young - management team. As from the beginning of this month, David Dilger, 35, formerly chief executive of Food Industries, becomes chief operating officer, under Gerry Murphy, also 35, the chief executive who joined last October. Food Industries was acquired by Greencore last August - a takeover battle in which Dilger and other board members, in recommending the Greencore offer, took sides against beef baron Larry Goodman, then 68 per cent stakeholder in Food, who wanted to stick out for a fatter price. Dilger and Goodman have apparently not spoken since. When Chris Comerford resigned as chief executive last September following allegations that he had failed to disclose his personal stake in a Greencore subsidiary, the high-flying Dilger had been tipped as Comerford's likely replacement - before Murphy, also an Irishman and friend of Greencore chairman Bernie Cahill arrived back on the scene in the Republic from Pillsbury. Dilger acknowledges the task ahead in restoring the com-pany's reputation outside as well as staff morale inside. The company secretary also quit last year. His replacement is Benjamin Power, 49, who will also join the board. Power was director and company secretary of W &amp; R Jacob, the Dublin biscuit-maker bought by BSN of France last year. ***** Robert Noonan, Irish-born property developer and rugby fanatic, is trying his hand at office technology, as chairman and chief executive of Office &amp; Electronic Machines. Noonan, boss of Essex property group Danbury, and known as one of the more aggressive operators even in his field, is said to like a challenge. Asked whether OEM will be a full-time job, he remarks that everything he does is full time. Shortly before Douglas Hawkins, the previous chairman and chief executive, resigned, Noonan had purchased a 14 per cent stake in the languishing OEM, thinking it was a company 'worthy of a certain amount of effort'. Hawkins resigned as chief executive at the beginning of January, to return to the City as an electronics analyst. At that time, Hawkins had said he was staying on as chairman. 'I don't know why he hung about,' says Noonan with his usual charm.</p>

Ten unions, representing about 60 per cent of TUC membership, took part in the study commissioned by the TUC and published yesterday. Researchers say the unions' employment practices are unsatisfactory. Monitoring of employees by ethnic background is limited and there is little training for recruiters. The GMB, TGWU and MSF general unions; Nupe and Nalgo public-service unions; Usdaw, the shop workers union; NCU, the communications union; IRSF and NUCPS, the Civil Service unions; and the FBU, the fire fighters' union, took part.</p>

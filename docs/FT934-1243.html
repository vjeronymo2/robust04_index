			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Budapest storming towards Christmas East Europeans had a word for it in the bad old days of the command economy: 'storming', the frenetic effort to fulfil plan targets in the last days of a month or year. Some things do not change. In this week before Christmas, investment and common-garden bankers, executives, lawyers and brokers are racing to beat deadlines as breathlessly as communist-era coalminers and steelworkers ever did. Lawyers are pulling all-nighters at Baker &amp; McKenzie. 'You can cut the atmosphere with a knife,' says Mr Peter Magyar, partner at the law firm. 'Everybody is just incredibly tense.' The Kempinski, Budapest's premier hotel, crawls with 'stormers' desperately trying to complete deals in time to get away for Christmas or at any rate before the new year. So what is going on? The capitalist financial year is proving as hard a taskmaster as the communist plan period and, in age-old Hungarian fashion, everything has been left again to the last minute. Hungary's generous investment incentives giving five-year tax holidays expire on December 31. So privatisers, foreign buyers and their advisers are trying to rush through transactions before the new year. 'I've never had so many deals going on at the same time,' says Mr Peter Kadas of investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston. The privatisation timetable for Matav, the Hungarian state telecoms company, is so tight that participants call it insane. 'I wish they would learn that Christmas is the season for relaxation,' says Mr Ed Mattix of US West, one of the telecoms companies bidding. Hungary's bankers too are busy preparing for extraordinary general meetings next week at the three largest, and deeply troubled, commercial banks. Shareholders have to agree to the terms of a government bail-out to restore their capital before closing the 1993 accounts. Not everyone is storming, however. Most Hungarian manufacturers close down over between Christmas and the New Year and factory workers can take it easy. The communists had another expression: capitalist exploitation. This is capitalism. But who is exploiting whom?</p>

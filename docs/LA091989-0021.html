			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROCKWELL MUST LIST ACCIDENTS, SHOW CRISIS PLAN;  </P> <P> DISCLOSURE ORDERED BY NUCLEAR OFFICIAL AS PART OF LICENSE RENEWAL REQUEST  </P> <P> A federal nuclear official reviewing Rockwell International's request for  renewal of a nuclear materials license at its Santa Susana lab has asked the  firm for information about past chemical and radioactive releases and about  emergency plans to cope with a serious accident.  </P> <P> The requests by Peter B. Bloch, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission law judge  presiding in the case, came in orders issued Friday and Monday.  </P> <P> In one order, Bloch asked Rockwell to provide a chronological listing of "all  significant chemical and radiological contamination incidents or releases at  Santa Susana Field Laboratory . . . since 1969." He also asked for specifics on  the substances spilled or released, the causes and corrective actions taken.  </P> <P> Bloch said Monday he specified 1969 to get a record spanning 20 years.  </P> <P> In the other order, Bloch asked Rockwell for information on the need for  off-site emergency plans in the event of an accident.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Reasonable Request'  </P> <P> "We'll give him everything he wants," Paul Sewell, a spokesman for Rockwell's  Rocketdyne division, said Monday. "It's a perfectly reasonable request."  </P> <P> Concerning the emergency plan request, Sewell said Rockwell has an on-site  "radiological contingency plan which satisfies" NRC regulations. "We're  reviewing our plan now to see what references are made to any off-site  emergency," he said.  </P> <P> Bloch asked that the information be provided "at or prior to" a Sept. 29  hearing in Van Nuys on the license renewal application.  </P> <P> That hearing and a second one next week are in response to letters and  petitions signed by 38 opponents of Rockwell's request for a 10-year license  renewal. The opponents contend Rockwell has not managed Santa Susana safely and  that a nuclear complex has no place in a densely populated area.  </P> <P> Rockwell says it has safely operated the field laboratory, which sits on a  plateau in a rugged area of the Simi Hills west of Chatsworth and southeast of  Simi Valley. The 2,668-acre site has been used mainly to test rocket engines  for NASA and the Air Force, but a 290-acre portion has been devoted to nuclear  research and development for the U.S. Department of Energy and its predecessor,  the Atomic Energy Commission.  </P> <P> Both hearings are scheduled for Room 120 of the Van Nuys State Office Building  at 6150 Van Nuys Blvd.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public to Take Part  </P> <P> At the Sept. 28 session, scheduled from 7 to 10:30 p.m., Bloch will hear from  the public, but the hearing is informal and comments will not be part of the  official record.  </P> <P> On Sept. 29, at 9:30 a.m., Bloch will consider whether to designate the  opponents full parties in the case. If granted that status, they would be able  to file written evidence and critiques of the application that Bloch would have  to consider in the license decision.  </P> <P> The license covers the "hot cell" at Santa Susana, a heavily shielded area  where Rockwell performs nuclear experiments and recycles nuclear fuel. The  recycling involves snipping open used nuclear fuel rods to remove plutonium and  other radioactive materials, which are then packaged and shipped to government  reservations for use in reactors or atomic weapons manufacture.  </P> <P> The hot cell license expired earlier this summer but has been continued pending  NRC review of the renewal application.  </P> <P> Other nuclear activities at Santa Susana are not at stake in the case because  they are not licensed by the NRC. Much of the nuclear work has been exempt from  licensing under provisions of the Atomic Energy Act that allow the Department  of Energy to function both as customer and regulator.  </P></p>

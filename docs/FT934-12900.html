			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Economy in Germany 'to grow 1.5%' THE GERMAN economy will rebound from recession next year, growing 1.5 per cent after shrinking by the same proportion in 1993, according to a majority report from the country's six leading economic institutes. In their traditional autumn forecast, published today, they predict 1 per cent growth in the west and a 7 per cent rise in the east, based mainly on a recovery in trade and on assumptions that average pay will rise 2 per cent. However, dissenters at Berlin's DIW institute expect a further fall of 0.5 per cent in the west and growth of only 5 per cent in the east. The institutes, which last year underestimated the strength of the slump and forecast 1 per cent pan-German growth, said exports and imports would each grow 3.5 per cent, after declines this year of 8.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. On the deficit side they warned of a sharp rise in unemployment and were sceptical of the government's plans to cut public spending. Driven mainly by a rise of 340,000 in the jobless total in the west to 8.4 per cent, aggregate unemployment was likely to rise to 9.8 per cent, or 3.8m. The report added that the federal budget deficit was likely to rise by DM3bn to DM110bn (Pounds 44.5bn). 'The ratio of state spending to gross domestic product will probably rise to 51.5 per cent,' it said, noting that this compared with around 45 per cent before unification in 1990. Warning Bonn that investor confidence would be harmed if it did not act, the report said: 'So far there is no convincing medium-term consolidation strategy.' The coalition government's fiscal policy was based on increased tax revenues and welfare contributions, it charged. There was no alternative to forcing spending cuts and reducing consumption-oriented hand-outs. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said at the weekend that the report confirmed the government view that the economy was recovering, although in a routine monthly study, published yesterday, the Ifo institute from Munich reported waning optimism in industry after a further decline in capacity utilisation in September. Orders on hand had fallen despite reduced output, investment goods manufacturers reported a clear worsening, gloom was spreading among building contractors, and retailers reported falling demand.</p>

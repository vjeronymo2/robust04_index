			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / One man's direct line to Pounds 42m: Peter Wood's bonus and his new idea Mr Peter Wood, the highest paid British company director, is to be given Pounds 24m to abandon a pay bonus scheme, which brought him Pounds 18.2m this year and has proved an embarrassment to his employer Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Wood gained the payments, totalling Pounds 42.2m, as chief executive of Direct Line, the insurance subsidiary that he founded. It has become the largest UK private motor insurer. Mr Wood agreed with Royal Bank a Pounds 13m payment for giving up his bonus scheme, an additional Pounds 4m for accrued bonus until January, and a further Pounds 7m pension contribution. In future, he will receive only a Pounds 350,000 index-linked annual salary. Royal Bank also disclosed yesterday that it was setting up a new company with Mr Wood to provide 'non-standard' insurance for people in higher risk categories, such as drivers of fast cars or householders in crime-affected areas. Mr Wood will invest Pounds 1m to buy 40 per cent of the equity in the new company, while Royal Bank will invest Pounds 1.5m in equity and a further Pounds 22.5m in preference shares. Mr Wood will be non-executive chairman and hold majority voting rights. Mr Wood's bonus scheme was devised in 1990 when Royal Bank bought his 25 per cent stake in Direct Line. It has brought him big rewards from the growth of the business, which announced trebled pre-tax profits of Pounds 50.2m. He earned Pounds 1.6m in bonus pay in 1991 and Pounds 6m last year, attracting increasing public attention. However, some analysts believe that his original stake could be worth Pounds 250m if Royal Bank decided to float Direct Line. Royal Bank's shares rose sharply as the disclosure dampened speculation over a flotation. Mr George Mathewson, the bank's chief executive, said the bank wanted to keep Direct Line's earnings and had 'no intention' of floating it. Mr Wood will invest Pounds 10m in Royal Bank shares, which he will hold for at least five years. This makes him the second largest individual shareholder behind the Moffat family, former owners of the AT Mays travel agency which Royal Bank took over. He said he had worked just as hard since receiving a Pounds 6m bonus last year. 'I enjoy it. You are either a workaholic or you are not.' Lord Younger, Royal Bank's chairman, said the bank was forming the new joint venture 'to exploit Peter's talent and expertise'. The pay arrangement would be put to shareholders at its annual meeting in January.</p>

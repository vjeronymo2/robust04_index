This proposed action by the DEA Deputy Administrator is based on data gathered and reviewed by the DEA. If finalized, this proposed action would impose the regulatory control mechanisms and criminal sanctions of Schedule I on the manufacture, distribution, and possession of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be submitted on or before January 19, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and objections should be submitted to the Deputy Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, D.C. 20537, Attention: DEA Federal Register Representative. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Howard McClain, Jr., Chief, Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, D.C. 20537, Telephone: (202) 307&hyph;7183. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On January 6, 1994, the Acting Administrator of the DEA published a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 671) amending &sect;1308.11(g) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). This final rule, which became effective on the date of publication, was based on findings by the Acting Administrator that the temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Section 201(h)(2) of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2)) requires that the temporary scheduling of a substance expires at the end of one year from the effective date of the order. However, if proceedings to schedule a substance pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1) have been initiated and are pending, the temporary scheduling of a substance may be extended for up to six months. Under this provision, the temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA which would expire on January 6, 1995, may be extended to July 6, 1995. This extension is being ordered by the DEA Deputy Administrator in a separate action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The DEA has gathered and reviewed the available information regarding the trafficking, actual abuse and the relative potential for abuse for 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA. The Deputy Administrator has submitted this data to the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health and Human Services. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Deputy Administrator also requested a scientific and medical evaluation and a scheduling recommendation for 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA from the Assistant Secretary for Health. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified the DEA that there are no exemptions or approvals in effect under Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA. A search of the scientific and medical literature revealed no indications of current medical use of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA is structurally similar to the Schedule I phenylisopropylamine hallucinogens, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (DOB). Like DOM and DOB, 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA displays high affinity for central serotonin receptors and is capable of substituting for DOM or DOB in drug discrimination studies conducted in rats. These data suggest that 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA is a psychoactive substance capable of producing effects similar, though not identical, to DOM and DOB. Data from human studies indicate that 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA is orally active at 0.1&hyph;0.2 mg/kg producing an intoxication with considerable euphoria and sensory enhancement which lasts for 6 to 8 hours. Higher doses have been reported to produce intense and frightening hallucinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DEA first encountered 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA in 1979. Since that time, several exhibits of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA have been analyzed by Federal and state forensic laboratories in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas. Clandestine laboratories producing 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA were seized in California in 1986 and 1994 and in Arizona in 1992. It has been represented as 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and has been sold in sugar cubes as LSD. Recently, 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA has been promoted as an aphrodisiac and distributed under the product name of Nexus. DEA has seized several thousand dosage units of this product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator, based on the information gathered and reviewed by his staff and after consideration of the factors in 21 U.S.C. 811(c), believes that sufficient data exist to propose and to support that 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA be placed into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a). The specific findings required pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811 and 812 for a substance to be placed into Schedule I are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

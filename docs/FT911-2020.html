			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Budgens revamp team finds the odds stacked high - The muted response to board changes at the high street grocer WHEN institutional shareholders yesterday successfully ushered a turn-round team on to the board of Budgens, the troubled high street grocery chain, and forced the resignation of Mr John Fletcher as chairman, they might have hoped for a more enthusiastic response from the market. Mr Fletcher's removal and the installation of Mr John von Spreckelsen, the new chief executive, was followed by an 11 per cent fall in the share price rather than a surge of optimism that sometimes greets the arrival of fresh talent. Uncertainty remains because Mr Fletcher's compensation for early termination of his five-year contract and the new team's remuneration are still to be decided by the new non-executive directors. But there is deeper concern that Mr von Spreckelsen and the institutions Electra, IEP and Gartmore - who in a rare victory managed to oust a sitting board without making a full bid for the company - may have underestimated the problems in Budgens' trolley. Not least of these is a growing feeling among food retail experts that Budgens is on the wrong end of long-term structural changes in UK food retailing. Increasingly aggressive store development from the likes of Tesco, which earlier this year raised Pounds 572m in a rights issue to keep its momentum going, could well put Budgens under intolerable pressure, some analysts say. The company's immediate problem remains its balance sheet. Problems with the launch of its new distribution depot at Wellingborough, Northants, in 1989 have left Budgens highly geared on its 94 stores and head office in Ruislip, London. The sale of 51 stores to Betta Stores last May reduced the debt to Pounds 30m and gearing to about 50 per cent. But any more store disposals moves the company further away from the critical volume that it needs to defray overheads at Wellingborough. That plant was designed with capacity for Pounds 370m of retail sales, but is only operating at 65 per cent of this, including space leased to Betta Stores, according to Mr Fletcher. The poor property market has meant that a plan to move the head office from Ruislip, freeing up 10 acres of freehold property, has been deferred and most of the buildings are on short-term let. More fundamentally, food retailing experts question the concept of the Budgens-style convenience store in the high street supplying shoppers between their major weekly visits to the out-of-town superstores. Apart from Cullens and corner shop owner-operators no one has made a success of this business. And if anything the competition is getting stiffer from the superstores. New check-out computer systems have armed Tesco and J Sainsbury with far more immediate knowledge of what the consumer wants. Their sophisticated distribution networks have also removed the need for each branch to carry large stocks in warehouses. As a result they are increasingly moving towards just-in-time delivery, not only at the superstores but also at the smaller high street stores and are increasing their ratio of shelf to warehouse space. High street shops which Tesco and J Sainsbury had placed lower on their priority lists are now being revamped and are attacking the niche Budgens was trying to develop. They have the added advantage of commanding the kind of brand loyalty and franchise strength that Budgens has only been able to dream about in recent years. Budgens is also unlikely ever to be able to compete with the superstores head on. It pays higher rents in the centre of towns and it buys from manufacturers on far less favourable terms than its large out of town competitors. Mr von Spreckelsen embarked yesterday on a top to toe review of the business. He will be trying to translate the experience he gained turning around Kafu Wasmund, the Bremen-based supermarket chain with 280 stores in 1989, and before that with Bowater Freight Services. He will be relying heavily on Mr Clark who put in 19 years with Tesco and a further five with Asda. Mr Clark said yesterday that until the board changes Budgens had hoped to open more stores rather than close them, but that the review would not rule out closures. The review is likely to recommend further efforts to dispose of the Ruislip property and will probably aim to develop greater liaison with other convenience stores to raise capacity utilisation at Wellingborough. The trouble with food retailing is that unless stores are being opened, rather than closed as Budgens' balance sheet probably demands, there is little chance of the business growing.</p>

[passage omitted]    [Munoz] [passage omitted] The PPD is a new party that has no  connections to any previous or current governments. We are  going to change the country politically and socially. States  that control their economic systems are more likely in the  long-term to create more problems than they resolve. This is  best exemplified by the defunct Soviet Union, although our  country is also a good example.    We all witnessed the statism that was in place over the past  two decades. Panama, because of its history, nature, and  geography, has had an economy different from that of other  countries. The only way we can continue growing is by meeting  our needs and by looking after the welfare of our citizens, and  not by trying to satisfy or accept the demands imposed by other  nations. The size of our bureaucracy must be reduced as much as  possible to eliminate positions that have redundant duties and  to prevent bureaucratic delays.    In the long-term, the only way to improve the standard of  living for the Panamanian people is by way of education, which  must include diverse disciplines, such as the humanities, arts,  technology, and science. In the short-term, the only way to  improve living standards is by creating jobs immediately, and  this is best done via state investment. State investment  generates a great deal of manual labor and jobs.    Our platform on the Panama Canal, military bases, foreign  debt, agriculture, transportation, justice, and other issues  will be discussed at the forums to which we have been invited.  We will attend all of these, except those that may be  manipulated to promote a particular candidate. Panamanians are  the only ones that will decide who the winner will be on 8 May.  Thank you very much.    [Eisenmann] Our next speaker will be Samuel Lewis Galindo,  candidate for the Solidarity Party [PS] and the National Unity  Mission [MUN]. [passage omitted]    [Lewis Galindo] Good evening, fellow Panamanians.  Panamanians are facing a difficult crossroads. PS and MUN have  shown the country a comprehensive development plan that proposes  the modernization of all organizations of the Panamanian state.  This program proposes the government's decentralization,  granting broad and true authority to the governors in order that  they become the foremost authorities in the provinces. We also  will give honest assistance to corregimiento representatives,  because they are more aware of the needs of the people in  low-income areas.    Our comprehensive development plan also touches on the  administrative career. Public employees must have the same  guarantees, security, and incentives that private sector workers  do thanks to the union bargaining agreements. We have proposed  an all-out war against unemployment. We have talked about and  continue to uphold the need to have an emergency plan that gives  immediate jobs to 50,000 Panamanians. These 50,000 Panamanians  would be recruited directly from low-income areas. In this way,  we would be tackling the social problem and the unemployment  problem.    We are basing our foreign policy on one word -- dignity. We  cannot permit ourselves to move from being an enclave managed by  a foreign power -- in this case, the United States -- to an  enclave currently managed by an elite that caters solely to  self-interests. The profits generated by the canal and its  bordering areas must benefit all Panamanians. We are not going  to create two different castes on our own territory. Canal  revenues must be invested mainly in education, which constitutes  the best investment the Panamanian Government can make.    All of these plans can only be implemented if there is a  national consensus. We do not foster hatred, engage in  fruitless disputes, or have a past of which we are ashamed.  Having said this, I believe we can implement these plans with  Panama's militant forces, such as the unions, farmers, teachers,  nurses, and all others who believe they have a civic duty to  support a program such as ours. I ask them: Can others carry  out these plans? Can others who speak and promote hatred rather  than unity among Panamanians achieve these goals we have  presented? Along with my party and its candidates, I need your  help. We need your votes. We need you to help us reach power  to enable us to serve Panama and not to simply take advantage of  the nation. Thank you very much and good evening.    [Eisenmann] We have just heard from Samuel Lewis Galindo.  Ernesto Perez Balladares, the next candidate to speak,  represents the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], PALA [Labor  Party], and Liberal Republican Party. [passage omitted]    [Perez Balladares] Fellow citizens, the country cannot  continue living in the past or continue to waste its energy on  political recrimination, revenge, persecution, or the settling  of accounts. I have been, and I am sure I will continue to be,  the target of insults and slander. Nevertheless, this will not  make me turn away from the path I have chosen. No matter how  many provocations I have to face, and no matter how frequent the  harassment becomes, I reiterate my pledge to citizens that I  will not permit, much less encourage, political persecution  against today's political adversaries or the representatives of  the current government.    Our proposal is designed to resolve the Panamanians'  fundamental problem -- namely, unemployment -- with initiatives  that do not necessarily entail state expenditures. The  construction of infrastructure projects necessary for  development, such as roads to bring produce to markets, as well  as the Panama City-Colon, David-Paso Canoas, and  Chorrera-Arraijan highways, must be joint efforts shared between  the government and private enterprise. We already have concrete  proposals for this.    I only mention this because these projects are a priority  and  at the same time create jobs in the short-term. Nevertheless,  our platform is much broader. It includes training programs and  the modernization of education to guarantee adequate training  for the jobs of the future. It also entails the best use of the  reverted areas of the canal in order that this wealth, which  belongs to all of us, will benefit everyone.    I cannot initiate any government action without attending to  the people's basic needs. For me it is unacceptable to have the  government earmark more than $1 billion for the payment of debts  to international financial organizations while not having the  same concern in looking after the large segments of the  population in urban and rural areas which do not have a water  supply system, or if they do, they only have it for limited and  unscheduled periods of time.    This country cannot begin the 21st century without having  resolved such a fundamental and basic problem for the health and  well-being of the population. I do not plan to evade  international obligations, and I understand the course the  economy is taking very well. Therefore, I can categorically  state that it is possible to honor international commitments and  at the same time deal with the people's most urgent problems.  It is also possible to modernize the economy without leaving  agricultural producers without protection. Economic opening must  be carried out gradually by discussing national interests and  applying clear and specific regulations.    In addition to training programs for the future, a coherent  and comprehensive government plan should include immediate  initiatives to prevent young people from becoming victims of  vice, worsening the already worrisome problem of family  disintegration. A single institution should centralize efforts  to promote sports, develop cultural programs, and foster family  values among young people.    If we are going to directly attack the generalized  corruption  we are experiencing today, there must be exemplary and harsh  punishment for the guilty. Nevertheless, we must also invest in  the comprehensive upbringing of the men and women of the future.  In the same way that drug trafficking is combated in the  streets and in the ports, we have to adopt heroic measures to  prevent money laundering in all of its forms, especially within  the Colon Free Zone and within the financial system, because the  very existence of those sources of employment and wealth depend  on the decisions we make to clean up these areas.    We are also concerned about the lack of security that  worries  every sector of society. The Panamanian people have ended up  being frightened men and women because we always feel threatened  by the possibility of being robbed, kidnapped, raped, or  murdered. We plan to return security to everyone, not because  it is a requirement for investment, but because it is an  inalienable right of all Panamanians.    Our decision not to stir up the past does not mean we will  not try to correct the injustices that have been committed. One  of them, if not the main one, is the infamy of increasing the  retirement age for men and women. With a little more  creativity, with greater leeway in negotiating, and, most of  all, with more social sensitivity, the retirement age problem  can be studied more thoroughly and better solutions can be  sought.    Fellow citizens, I foresee better days for the country. Our  commitment to democracy means there will not be a return to  authoritarian forms of power or to practices incompatible with  respect for human rights. To what we do indeed have to return  to, and return to soon, is a government that leads the country  by way of consulting the people, not at the time of elections,  but when decisions are made.    [Eisenmann] The next candidate who will speak is Ruben  Blades, candidate of the Papa Egoro Movement. [passage omitted]    [Blades] For 90 years of republican life, the nation's  political parties have failed in the task of resolving the  Panamanian nation's fundamental problems. Papa Egoro, which was  born as an independent movement, made the decision to become a  political party to legalize its participation in the electoral  process which will end on 8 May. Our objective is to reach  government to govern with responsibility and correctly manage  our country. This is what makes us different from the other  political parties. They have not governed and do not want to  govern. They want to reach power to repeat what they have  always done. The traditional political parties are no different  from one another. The results of their experience in the  government clearly shows this. All of them are part of the  failure to which they led the country's public administration  today and yesterday.    The only way to fulfill our principles and objectives for  the  country is to continue being independent. We continue to be  free of ties to the present and past petty politicking, and,  above all, we have no hatreds, selfish ambitions, or desire for  revenge, which are the things that prevent true national  reconciliation. National reconciliation is the only thing that  can guarantee that all Panamanians have the opportunity to work  as a great national team for a better future.    The system of petty politics that prevails in the country  wants you to believe that our project is impossible because we  are a new party. It wants you to believe that the only thing  that is important is to have the so-called political experience.  It only wants you to believe that decency is madness and that  the existing corruption is the product of involuntary mistakes,  as if the act of governing were a game without referees or  penalties and where one can cheat. They want you to believe  that in these elections we can only choose between two options  of the past, both of which have failed.    The Papa Egoro Movement has not been created to replace a  government with another. It has been created because the  country needs and wants to change the way that things have been  done so far. We propose concerted efforts in the national  interest and the participation of the best men and women from  all parties and leanings to form an honest and capable  administrative team unprecedented in Panama. The Papa Egoro  Movement offers itself as common ground where all Panamanians  can sow the seed of national hope and see the growth of the tree  that will shelter all of us with prosperity, health, and  confidence in the future of our mother earth. This is possible  because the Papa Egoro Movement does not owe its existence to  any special group. The Papa Egoro Movement does not have to pay  any political debts, nor does it owe positions or privileges to  anyone because of financial support. This is what makes a party  truly independent.    Do you know the real responsibility we face in the 1994  elections? We need to change the reality of a country that is  used to voting against something or someone and not in favor of  good proposals. Unfortunately, in our country the presidents  have been generally elected as an act of choosing a lesser evil  rather than choosing the best. Let us not commit the same  mistake.    Finally, remember you will not only be voting for a  president. Each vice president is a possible president and,  therefore, will govern and publicly represent the majesty of the  country. In this sense, we must carefully study what each  presidential slate offers. Do you know who are the vice  presidential candidates of the various parties? Do they  adequately represent the capacity, honesty, sincerity, and  dedication to work for all Panamanians? Do they represent a new  image that will enable our country to again be credible and that  will make us confident and proud of ourselves? The country can  speak with pride about Fernando Manfredo and Ricardo Bermudez,  who form part of our work team.    People, our intention is pure, our effort is sincere, and  our  dedication is absolute. The Papa Egoro Movement represents the  possibility of victory of decency and true civic spirit. Papa  Egoro really represents everyone's victory. Thank you very much.    [Eisenmann] We just heard from Ruben Blades. Now Eduardo  Vallarino, presidential candidate for the Christian Democratic  Party, will take the floor. [passage omitted]    [Vallarino] [passage omitted] Our government plan is founded  on the firm conviction that the single most important asset a  country can have is its people, and only by giving them the best  possible opportunities can sustained and sustainable development  be achieved. Under our government plan, creating jobs is a top  priority to halt the family disintegration process that  unemployment entails. It is the private sector, however, that  can and must provide the most and best job opportunities. This  requires a more competent government economic policy and  improvements to Panama's current judicial stability image.  Therefore, these two issues are priorities. High employment and  progress rates are sustainable only if we have a healthy  population. Therefore, health and malnutrition are also priority  matters. [passage omitted].    We submit that health investment, particularly preventive  heath care, will require an even greater effort by the  government. The number of health care centers operating  properly must continue to increase throughout the country. A  health plan requires a competent social security system. We  propose the greatest possible independence for the Social  Security Fund to isolate it from political interests.  Furthermore, not only are we offering to restore the retirement  benefits and ages that were changed, but we also propose to  increase coverage in certain services through the implementation  of an operationally independent administration. [passage omitted]    We are addressing the housing problem starting with the  premise that neither the government or the private sector have  the financial capability to balance the enormous housing deficit  at a price accessible to the majority of Panamanians. Based on  this, our proposal is directed at promoting self-help and loan  programs to provide homes for the poverty stricken sector. The  state must provide priority attention to the more acute housing  problems to provide solutions for those living in extreme  poverty, at a price they can pay. [passage omitted]    Sound preschool, elementary, and junior high school  education  must be made available to the greatest possible number of  students. A significant level of participation by the private  sector will be necessary in high school and technical education.  [passage omitted]    Security for the Panama Canal requires a specialized police  force. We do not need an army because outside threats are  covered in the Panama Canal treaties and should be included in a  wise foreign policy. The Panama Canal and its reverted areas are  the single most important challenge for the new government. The  canal administration must be isolated from partisan greed. The  canal's work force must be protected and well compensated so the  best Panamanians can feel secure working for the commission. The  reverted areas are our main opportunity to really take advantage  of our geographical position. This will only be true if we use  it to replace and surpass the benefits we now receive from the  U.S. military presence. [passage omitted]    [Eisenmann] We will now hear from Ruben Dario Carles,  presidential candidate for the National Renewal Movement, the  Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement, and the Civic Renewal  Party. [passage omitted]    [Carles] Fellow citizens: On 8 May, we will all go to the  polls and make a very important decision for the present and the  future of all Panamanians. For the first time in 25 years, we  are going to freely elect the government we want. That  government will have the enormous responsibility of guiding our  future and prepare us for the present challenges. What is at  stake is far too delicate not to be taken seriously. Not only  does the consolidation of democracy as a system of government  depend on the decision we make, but also our well being,  prosperity, and future, and that of our children.    In choosing a president, we must take into account each  candidate's qualities as a statesman, their background, moral  authority, government proposals, and the team he or she will  work with to meet their goals toward a better life for all and  particularly for our children. It is equally important to know  each candidate's past as well as their views on the future to  elect the best president. Neither I nor those who accompany me  in this quest have absolutely anything to hide or fear from our  past. It is no secret to you that any government program is  worthless if the candidates, the work teams, and the government  teams behind it lack the necessary personal qualities to direct  and execute it. We have the experience, efficiency, character,  and the personal will and honesty that the nation demands of its  president. The people can rest assured that the proposed  government plan will in fact be completed.    Our civic and democratic convictions explain why we were  never repressed during the 21 years of the military dictatorship  this country endured. We never collaborated with generals,  colonels, or lieutenants. I, along with my compatriots,  experienced exile and was stripped of my civil rights. The  seriousness of our government programs assures us sufficient  national and international trust to attract investments. Without  such investment there will not be enough new jobs to improve the  quality of life of all Panamanian families within the urgent  timeframe we require.    My friends, job and housing shortages, limited public  transportation service, the absence of urban sanitation, the  deficiencies in basic services such as health, education, social  security, water, power, and the administration of justice are  problems that cry out for immediate solutions, decisions, and  investment. We will maintain the present number of jobs in the  agricultural and livestock sector by controlling basic products,  specifically meat, milk, rice, sorghum, corn, beans, potatoes,  and onions. We will do so in an effort to find efficient and  reasonable costs for the farmers and fair prices for the  consumer.    There is no need to tell you how important the public force  issue is for all of us. We guarantee that it will be directed  and led by civilians. We will also protect the environment and  create thousands of jobs in programs and plans dealing with the  reforestation of the country. We will sponsor tourism and  ecological tourism as well as processing zones for exports and  centers for the transshipment of merchandise. We must solve the  foreign public debt but we must seek options that protect the  interests of the majority of the Panamanians first of all.    You know that only serious decisions and specific and  realistic investments will allow us to create jobs, build  houses, equip the public transportation, improve education, and  protect our existing services infrastructure, including the  financial system, the regime of anonymous societies, and the  Colon Free Zone. Decision, leadership, investment, more  efficiency and honesty in the public administration sector, plus  a constant struggle against corruption, impunity, drug  trafficking, and money laundering is virtually all the country  needs. [passage omitted]    [Eisenmann] Everyone knows all the candidates were invited  to  participate this evening. Mrs. Mireya de Gruber declined our  invitation. Dear viewers and listeners, we hope you will tune in  on Monday, 28 March, when we will present the first televised  presidential debate in Panama's political history. It will be  broadcast in national radio and television network. On behalf of  ILDEA and the media committee for presidential debates, have a  good evening.</p>

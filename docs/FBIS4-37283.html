			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, June 18, IRNA -- A spokesman for  Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami (Islamic Party) of  Afghanistan Ghariburrahman Saeed [name as received] here  Saturday [18 June] rejected Herat Governor Esmail Khan's  proposal on Friday concerning convention of a session in Herat  attended by Afghan party leaders.    Talking to IRNA in Peshawar Saturday Saeed said that  convening of any seminar and participation in it would be  "useless" and the sole way out of the current crisis is Afghan  President Borhanoddin Rabbani's stepping down from power.    He called on Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to end the  ongoing crisis in Afghanistan by forcing Rabbani to abide by  Islamabad agreement and quit power.    Based on the agreement, signed by Afghan Mojahedin groups  here on March 8, 1993 in presence of representatives of Iran,  Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, Rabbani should abandon the  presidential post by June 28 or would be compelled to do so by  the said countries.    Esmail Khan along with governors of 15 other Afghan  provinces  had launched efforts from early last week to find a solution to  put an end to the differences between Afghan Mojahedin groups.    He had in his proposal called on Afghan belligerent parties  to participate in a conference in Herat to explore a peace  formula.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Observer: Rescue mission Why is Stanislas Yassukovich, one of the grand old names of the euromarkets, joining the board of the Bristol and West Building Society? After a high-flying international banking career with the likes of White Weld and Merrill Lynch, his appointment to the board of a second-division UK building society seems a bit of a come down. Of course, Yassukovich, who has always had a much wider range of outside interests than the average Eurobanker, does not see it that way. His estate is in the Cotswolds and he says he is getting increasingly interested in retail financial services. For the Bristol and West, desperate to get back into the race with the nearby Cheltenham and Gloucester, Yassukovich is quite a catch. There have been persistent rumblings of discontent among shareholders about the inbred board and it was expected to resurface at the society's annual meeting on Monday. Yassukovich's appointment should defuse it once and for all.</p>

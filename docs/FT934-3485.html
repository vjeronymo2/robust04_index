			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record levels maintained after strong recovery - Market Report Profit-takers were successfully resisted on the UK stock market yesterday in a more active trading session. Marked selling pressure early in the day took the FT-SE 100 Index down nearly 18 points, but traders were caught out by the strength of a rally which left the index unchanged at the peak of 3,237.3 reached on Monday. The rally across the wider range of stocks took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index up 2.2 to a new high of 3,568. No new factors appeared to influence the stock market; sterling and UK bonds eased slightly, although both closed in London above the day's lows. But confidence that UK base rates will be reduced in the new year remained undimmed. The late rally, which took the Footsie briefly into positive territory, was complicated by a clash in the derivatives markets, where a US securities house unravelled an off-market package written for a single client. The resulting turmoil in equities caused some confusion among the blue chips and boosted the day's Seaq volume total to 686.4m shares from the previous session's 601.9m. On Monday, retail volume was worth Pounds 1.2bn. Stock Exchange statistics confirmed that November was a very successful trading month for the London-based securities firms. UK equities worth Pounds 52.6bn were traded in what now proves to have been the busiest month since July 1987, just before the market crash of October that year. The stock market stood up well yesterday to a shrinking of the premium on the December contract on the Footsie. The futures premium has been a significant driving factor behind equities since just before Budget Day. Traders were not disturbed by yesterday's reduction in the premium, which is normal as the contract approaches expiry. Another cut in mortgage rates by a leading home lending group kept interest rate optimists on the alert. Bank stocks, which have benefited very strongly from the view that rate cuts will work wonders for their unperforming loans, attracted renewed buying in the second half of the session. Store shares, however, shed a few pence in what was little more than a profit-taking pause. Sector analysts are now looking for signs of the consumer spending pattern in the months leading up to Christmas. Most share sectors moved narrowly around overnight levels, with the electricity utilities outstanding following dividend statements. But profit-taking among the consumer stocks, which have advanced strongly since the Budget offered relief from fears of adverse tax moves, brought widespread falls. Publishing shares, which have outperformed over the past week, also came in for profit-taking pressure. Equity strategists continued to express satisfaction with the outlook for UK stocks, although some turned their attention overseas. Strength overnight in the Hong Kong market helped some London shares, but there were further worries over Tokyo. London-based securities firms take differing views on the Japanese market. Some still see weakness there as a potential threat to global investors. However, NatWest Markets has upgraded its weighting recommendation on Japanese equities from underweight to neutral, arguing that prospects of cuts in both income tax and the discount rate should raise recovery hopes. Goldman Sachs takes a similar line, although cautious on 'uncertainty about economic recovery'.</p>

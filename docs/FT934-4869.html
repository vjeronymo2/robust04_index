			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Israeli army reinforces West Bank The Israeli army rushed troop reinforcements to the West Bank yesterday after Palestinian gunmen shot dead an Israeli woman on the main street of the town of al-Birah. Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist movement which opposes the autonomy deal between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation due to take effect in the territories on December 13, took responsibility for the murder. It vowed to continue attacking Israelis in revenge for the recent killings of some of its leaders by Israeli troops. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, noted: 'Every incident like this. . . damages the belief of many in Israel that peace is possible.' Nonetheless, Mr Rabin, who continues his European visits with a trip to London today, said he intended 'simultaneously to fight terror and to move forward in implementing' the autonomy accord. Yesterday's shooting took place when the car carrying a Jerusalem kindergarten teacher to her school in the West Bank's Beit El settlement broke down on the outskirts of nearby al-Birah. Gunmen opened fire on the vehicle with automatic weapons. In protest, Jewish settlers briefly blocked a main West Bank road, and have vowed to block all thoroughfares in the territories for several hours today, paralysing Palestinian movement. At a meeting with Israeli army officers, settler leaders accused the military of failing to protect them. They have already announced plans to set up their own security force to guard settlements once the autonomy period begins, and yesterday they unveiled a programme of dozens of new settlements, in defiance of government policy, in order to frustrate Palestinian efforts to create an independent state in the occupied territories. The Gaza Strip, where clashes on Tuesday left one Palestinian dead and more than 60 injured, was calmer: the army suspended its hunt for 'wanted' Palestinian militants, and declared the area a 'closed military zone' to keep journalists away. Reuter adds from Brussels: Mr Rabin yesterday met Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, and won early European Union support for upgrading a 1975 co-operation agreement with the 12-member bloc. Mr Rabin said Israel was interested in updating its relationship with the EU in a bid to advance Israeli industry and agriculture.</p>

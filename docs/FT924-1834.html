			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: New plan for coal early next year THE government intends to put forward fresh proposals for the coal industry in late January or early February, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said last night. He told the Commons trade and industry committee he hoped MPs would have time to debate the proposals before March 31. That is the date by which British Coal must negotiate long-term contracts with the electricity industry to replace those that are expiring. Mr Heseltine's remarks came as a senior Labour MP claimed that five of the 10 collieries where mining has stopped, pending completion of the government's review of the coal industry, were profitable. Mr John Evans, MP for St Helens North, said the five pits should remain as part of a viable coal industry. He was supported by Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, Tory MP for Batley &amp; Spen. 'We are being told that all those mines are not loss-making - nor do they have the bleak future British Coal says they do,' Mrs Peacock maintained. Mr Heseltine told MPs no pits would be closed irrevocably before the energy review had been completed. 'I hope events will come together in a way that will provide an opportunity for debate,' he said. MPs are worried that British Coal will shut pits or refuse to license them to others for fear of creating competition for its own operations. Mr Heseltine agreed there was a potential conflict of interest and said he might become involved in decisions, but he warned that any steps to enlarge the coal industry would have to take into account available markets.</p>

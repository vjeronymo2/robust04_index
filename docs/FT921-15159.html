			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Philippines close to IMF agreement THE Philippines has provisionally agreed with the International Monetary Fund the main points of its 1992 economic programme, except for additional spending following the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano last year, Mr Jesus Estanislao, finance secretary, said yesterday. Mr Estanislao said he hoped the IMF would give approval in February. He made clear, however, that success depended on the government's ability to persuade the Senate to approve tax reforms to increase revenue, letting the government meet IMF targets. The IMF has suspended payments from a Dollars 900m loan package agreed last year, and its refusal to endorse the Philippines has delayed other debt rescheduling agreements. Mr Estanislao said approval of at least some tax measures was crucial.</p>

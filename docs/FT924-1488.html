			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Switzerland (7): The yield curve looks up / Peter Montagnon examines the bond market THE SWISS foreign bond market has enjoyed something of a renaissance since the summer, as the franc yield curve has returned to normal after a long period of inversion. New-issue activity has leapt ahead after a first half which saw only SFr9bn (Pounds 4.1bn) of new issues, compared with SFr14.5bn in the same period of 1991. Between July and October, however, the pace of new issues jumped to around SFr11bn, roughly the same pace as that recorded in the previous year. Bankers say they believe that volume could continue to run at high levels. Inflation is broadly under control, and the National Bank has become more worried about the economy. So, provided the Swiss franc does not suffer any pronounced weakness in the foreign exchange market, the central banks may now be ready to see short-term interest rates fall further, reinforcing the positive yield curve. That should encourage investors to move out of short-term instruments and into longer-dated bonds, helping to establish a price level in the bond market that makes swaps attractive. During the long period when the yield curve was downward-sloping, swap rates generally remained unattractive and Switzerland lost business to other markets. However, some bankers also acknowledge that, despite the trend towards liberalisation over the past few years, the Swiss foreign bond market has some way to go before it can match the depth of liquidity available in other markets. For example, Switzerland only recently established a bond futures contract for government paper, an instrument which should improve liquidity by creating hedging opportunities as well as allowing for the establishment of a benchmark price in the market. In fact, the instrument is imperfect in this respect, because the withholding tax levied on domestic bonds means the local market is subject to differing price trends. The sharp increase in the borrowing requirement of federal, regional and local government, whose combined deficit is forecast by Bank Julius Bar at SFr8bn this year, meant the domestic market suffered from a considerable over-supply in the first half. This led to the unusual situation where domestic borrowers actually had to pay higher rates than foreign issuers in the Swiss market. Unless the federal government were to start issuing large amounts of witholding-tax-free bonds to foreigners - which is unlikely, for political reasons - bankers say there is little chance of ats paper becoming an accepted benchmark for the foreign bond market. In the meantime, though, they do expect some increase in liquidity as a result of the September referendum decision on relaxing stamp duty requirements, which will effectively allow for more active market-making in Swiss foreign bonds. Large issuers, such as the European Investment Bank and the World Bank, have already begun introducing clauses into new-issue documentation, permitting more bonds to be sold at a later stage. Thus it is expected that, over time, investors will be able to buy into large issues with a high level of liquidity. The hope is that this will attract fresh institutional investors into the market, further eroding the traditional dominance of the retail market. With greater liquidity and a stronger institutional presence, there could even be some structural fall in yields, which would help attract borrowers. Swiss bankers are acutely aware that, to win mandates nowadays, they have to compete with other international markets which may be able to offer more attractive swap rates. This is a much larger preoccupation for them than either the breakdown of the bond-issuing cartels a couple of years ago, or the more recent succession of payment difficulties experienced by heavily indebted corporate borrowers such as Heron and Mountleigh of the UK. The end to the old cartels, whereby the big banks were able to secure the lion's share of new-issue activity, has not done much to alter their overall market share, largely thanks to their strong distribution capability. Indeed, if anything, it is that smaller banks that have suffered, as there are no longer formal arrangements for them to participate in the market. There is no doubt that the larger banks have not yet lost their sense of wounded pride over the way in which Warburg Soditic, the Geneva-based bank, managed to upset the cartel arrangements which had served them so well in the past. But the changing nature of the market, in which an ever larger amount of new business has become swap-driven, means that the cartels would have probably died a natural death sooner or later. The immediate response required when a swap opportunity arises means there is no time to parcel out deals and pre-arrange market share. Indeed, the large banks nowadays have to compete more and more with each other to win mandates. A lingering worry is that the highly publicised difficulties of some corporate borrowers, a number of which were brought to the market by Soditic, has harmed Switzerland's reputation as an issuing centre. Admittedly, fears of a bad reputation are probably overdone, but there is no denying that investors have become more selective. They are reluctant to buy paper with a rating less than AA, and there has been a shift in favour of sovereign and supranational names. Such preferences mean that the market may face a singular challenge next year, which will be see the peak refinancing requirement for the warrant bonds issued by Japanese borrowers in the late 1980s. At the moment, it is not clear how many of these issuers will actually attempt to refinance their borrowing in Switzerland. Some are expected to refinance the debt in the Japanese market. Others may choose to refinance in other currencies, such as US dollars, if swap rates are more attractive. It is tempting to wonder whether the banks privately hope that a large portion of this particular business may pass them by. The saturation of the market with warrant issues during the 1980s, for which the large banks rather than houses such as Soditic were responsible, has not been particularly helpful. Ironically, though, with the Nikkei index at such a low point, it is possible that the warrants on the refinanced paper may prove more valuable than those on the original issues.  -------------------------------------------------    NEW ISSUES IN THE SWISS BOND MARKET (SFR M)  -------------------------------------------------               Domestic        Foreign               issuers:       issuers:                    all            all Year        categories     categories  ------------------------------------------------- 1985          11,205.6       36,969.1 1986          11,054.3       42,461.0 1987          11,726.6       36,034.6 1988          13,527.1       40,029.2 1989          14,218.7       31,281.0 1990          17,146.1       32,173.7 1991          16,201.8       30,115.9 1992          17,739.7       17,163.7  -------------------------------------------------  Source: Swiss National Bank  -------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Gencor turns in 12% advance GENCOR, South Africa's second-largest mining house, increased attributable income by 12 per cent, to R1.41bn (Dollars 420m) from R1.26bn, in the year to August. This is the last set of results the company will publish before before unbundling its industrial investments next month. The results were boosted by one-off benefits from tax adjustments and the sale of investments. Underlying operating income, excluding these effects, fell by 6.3 per cent to R1.09bn, or by 13.1 per cent to 79.5 cents per share. The dividend was maintained at 45 cents per share. Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman, said although the decline was disappointing, it reflected 'a sound operating performance in the circumstances'. Prices fell in most of the export markets in which the group operates, and the domestic operating environment was also difficult. The unbundling, which takes effect on November 5, will see Gencor's net assets shrink by about a third to R12bn from R18.6bn. The new group will have no net debt, and cash and other liquid assets of R2.3bn. After distributing to shareholders its stake in industrial groups Sappi, Engen and Malhold, and investment arm Genbel, the rump Gencor will be a mining and minerals group with investments primarily in gold, platinum, coal, ferrometals and stainless steel, and aluminium. The priority for Gencor at the moment is trying to conclude the purchase of Billiton, the mining and metals arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Talks have been under way for nearly six months. No figures have been announced, but the deal could be worth as much as Dollars 2bn. Mr Gilbertson said the deal was 'by no means done', but that the chances of success were better than 50:50. The two main issues to be resolved are the financing of the deal and the pre-emption rights that attach to many of the assets, especially the better ones. Mr Gilbertson said if all the 'plum' assets were stripped from Billiton, Gencor wouldn't be a purchaser and Shell would find it difficult to make a sale. However, he added that 'substantial progress' had been made in resolving the pre-emption issue. 'There will be a degree of pre-emption, but in my judgment we will be able to live with it,' he said. He said this meant 'some parties will take up some of their rights'. Finality should be achieved by the end of the year. Mr Gilbertson said if the new unbundled Gencor structure had been in place in 1993, it would have achieved underlying operating earnings of 37.5 cents per share. He said he would be disappointed if these were not exceeded in the coming year. The dividend will be decided in the light of 1994 cash earnings, which will be 'significantly lower' than the 1993 equivalent of 35.6 cents per share.</p>

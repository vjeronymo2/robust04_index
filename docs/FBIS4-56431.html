The leader of and spokesman for this organization  convened the legislators to an urgent meeting of the National  Assembly to fill the executive vacuum before 9 May, the date of  the closing of the current parliamentary session. Let us listen  to Emmanuel Constant:    [Begin Constant recording] We firmly believe the nation must  meet in national assembly so the executive vacuum can be filled  as soon as possible; but in any case, before the parliamentary  vacuum planned for 9 May.

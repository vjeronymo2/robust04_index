			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY ALTERS REPORT, REAPPROVES HOUSING PROJECT;  </P> <P> FOES OF AGOURA TRACT SAY SUPERVISORS ACTED TO DEFUSE SUIT OVER ENVIRONMENTAL  STUDY  </P> <P> In what critics called an unusual admission of error, the Los Angeles County  Board of Supervisors on Tuesday retroactively changed an environmental impact  report on a development the board had approved five months ago after bitter  public debate.  </P> <P> The environmental report is now the subject of a lawsuit by environmentalists  and homeowners seeking to overturn the board's March 2 approval of construction  of 150 homes at Paramount Ranch in Agoura, the former site of the Renaissance  Pleasure Faire.  </P> <P> County officials said the changes in the environmental report were meant to  explain the benefits of the board's order reducing the project from 159 to 150  homes.  </P> <P> But a lawyer for the Sierra Club and the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation,  the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, charged that the county's real reason for  altering the report was the lawsuit, which contends the report had inadequately  evaluated alternatives to the developer's proposal.  </P> <P> The changes adopted unanimously by the board Tuesday included a reference to an  economic study, prepared for developer Brian Heller, that contends that  alternatives to Heller's proposal were too costly.  </P> <P> "It's kind of extraordinary," said Carlyle W. Hall Jr., the plaintiffs' lawyer.  "They're confessing that they made a mistake. . . . I guess they feel they're  in a bad legal position and needed to do something."  </P> <P> The board's resolution Tuesday said the supervisors "inadvertently and  prematurely" approved the project in March without completing the environmental  report, leaving gaps that were filled by Tuesday's action.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, described the board's  action as remedying a minor oversight.  </P> <P> In March, "it would have been better to have closed the hearing, indicated our  intent to approve the cases and requested staff to prepare the final documents  for board action at a later date," a statement from Antonovich said.  </P> <P> Richard D. Weiss, senior deputy county counsel, maintained that the board's  action was not motivated by the lawsuit. But he conceded that "anything that  would strengthen the final environmental document . . . is going to benefit the  county" in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> In a letter to the board, Hall disputed the findings of Heller's study and said  the board "cannot reopen the record, selectively admit only certain items . . .  close the record and re-enact its March 2 actions without reopening the public  hearing."  </P> <P> But Weiss responded that there has already been sufficient public comment on  Heller's economic analysis, which was made public in December.  </P> <P> "This matter was the subject of protracted public hearings," Weiss said. "The  county has heard the nature of the opposition and understands it."  </P> <P> In Antonovich's statement, the supervisor reiterated his support for the  project. The board's action on Tuesday re-enacted all the conditions Antonovich  and the board had imposed in March, including the establishment of an  open-space buffer zone between the project and neighboring National Park  Service property.  </P> <P> In the background during the board's deliberations earlier this year was an  attempt by the Park Service and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to  acquire the development site for use as a park. Heller has not responded to an  offer by the conservancy to buy the 320-acre oak meadow near Cornell and Wagon  roads in Agoura.  </P></p>

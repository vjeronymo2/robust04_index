			<p>BFN     [Text] RIA reports: Russia needs a powerful, modern navy,  Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said at a  ceremony to raise the St. Andrew's flag over the new destroyer,  Intrepid [Besstrashnyy], to bring it into service. The  destroyer handed over to the Russian Navy today is the first  naval ship to be launched for two years. Viktor Chernomyrdin  noted that the task of constructing a new Russian fleet is being  tackled under extremely difficult conditions connected with the  loss of a number of military bases in the Baltic, on the Black  Sea, and the Caspian, and also with the difficult economic  condition and the complicated political situation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Relationship Between General Provisions and Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Provisions (subpart A) to part 63 apply to any source that emits or has the potential to emit any HAP and is subject to any rule promulgated under part 63. Thus, all major sources performing wood furniture manufacturing are subject to subpart A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major sources subject to the proposed standards are subject to subpart A. However, some of the provisions of subpart A are applicable only to sources using control devices to comply with a rule established under part 63. As such, sources complying with this proposed rule by using compliant finishing materials, adhesives, thinners, and spray booth coatings are not subject to the following sections of subpart A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 63.6(e)(3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires the submittal of a startup, shutdown, malfunction plan. For sources complying with the proposed rule through the use of compliant materials or an averaging approach at all times, periods of startup and shutdown have no relevance and should be included in the compliance determination. Likewise, a malfunction would not cause an increase in emissions because emission reduction is achieved through source reduction. Even if equipment malfunctions, the reformulated materials would still be in use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 63.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section specifies procedures for conducting a performance test and therefore would not apply. The performance demonstration for sources complying using compliant materials or an averaging approach involves submitting the information required by &sect;63.804(f)(1), (2), (3), (5), (7), and (8) of the proposed rule. This information must be submitted within 60 days because the compliance status information report is required by &sect;63.807(b) to be submitted within 60 days after the compliance date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 63.8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section specifies monitoring requirements. The compliance provisions of &sect;63.804(g)(1), (2), (3), (5), (7), and (8) of the proposed rule supersede &sect;63.8 for sources using compliant materials or an averaging approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Section 63.9(e), (g), and (h)(2)(ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 63.9(e) and 63.9(g) do not apply to sources using compliant materials or an averaging approach because they pertain to sources conducting performance tests and using continuous monitoring systems, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 63.9(h)(2)(ii) specifies that the compliance status information report be submitted within 60 days after the performance test. This requirement is relevant to sources using compliant materials, but is clarified by &sect;63.807(b) of the proposed rule, which requires that the compliance status information report be submitted within 60 days after the compliance date, not 60 days after the compliance determination, for sources using compliant materials. As written, &sect;63.9(h)(2)(ii) is not applicable for sources using compliant materials because no performance test is being required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Section 63.10(b)(2)(i&hyph;vi, viii&hyph;xi, xiii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These sections do not apply to sources using compliant materials because they specifically pertain to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan; performance tests; or continuous monitoring systems. Sections 63.10(b)(2)(vii, xii, and xiv) apply because they are more generic. Paragraph (2)(vii) requires that a source maintain records of all required measurements needed to demonstrate compliance. Paragraph (2)(xii) is related to the request for a waiver of reporting and recordkeeping requirements, which some sources subject to the proposed standards may pursue. Paragraph (2)(xiv) requires that a source maintain records to support initial notifications and notification of compliance status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Section 63.10(c), (d)(2) and (d)(5), and (e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These sections do not apply to sources using compliant materials or an averaging approach because they pertain to continuous monitoring systems, performance testing, or startup, shutdown, malfunction reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

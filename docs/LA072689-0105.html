			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Four Natwest Officials Resign: Lord Boardman, chairman of National Westminster  Bank PLC, and three others resigned because of government criticism of  Natwest's actions during a 1987 takeover of a U.S. company, the bank said. A  total of six officials of Britain's largest bank have resigned since the  government last week assailed bank executives' conduct in the unsuccessful  $1.4-billion stock sale in Blue Arrow PLC during its takeover of Manpower Inc.  Boardman, 70, accepted responsibility for the bank's "serious failings,"  Natwest said in a statement. Boardman was not cited by a Department of Trade  and Industry report released last week. Also resigning were Charles Green, 58,  and Terry Green, 55, both deputy chief executives of the bank, and John  Plastow, 60, a general manager.  </P></p>

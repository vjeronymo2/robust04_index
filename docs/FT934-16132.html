			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Swedish banks' bad loans investigated by prosecutor THE Swedish state prosecution office is to scrutinise SKr37.8bn (Dollars 4.7bn) of bad banking loans for evidence of wrong-doing and poor business practice. A total of 156 cases have been passed over to the office by the country's finance inspection board for further scrutiny following its own investigations. The amount is equivalent to 5 per cent of the total lending of all the banks examined, up until December 31 1992, in the investigation into the bad loans. The move is part of the fall-out from Sweden's two-year banking crisis, which has brought more than SKr100bn in credit losses and forced the government to provide a safety net for the entire banking system. The finance inspection board stressed that only some of the cases handed over could be expected to lead to deeper scrutiny by the prosecutor's office. It said it was impossible to calculate the exact amount at this stage. But the finance inspection board said there was evidence of some loans being obtained by deception, and instances of loans being granted when it was clear that the receiver could face repayment difficulties. The investigation has covered all Swedish banks which have sought or received state aid, including Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading commercial bank, Gota Bank, Nordbanken, Sparbanken Forsta, and Foreningsbank. In the first instance, the investigation has concentrated on credit engagements dating from 1990, which have caused many of the banks' biggest losses. The size of the bad loans being investigated varies from SKr15m to more than SKr1bn. Sweden's banking crisis is mainly related to the collapse of the real estate market. It has resulted in two of the country's leading commercial banks, Gota Bank and Nordbanken, coming under state ownership.</p>

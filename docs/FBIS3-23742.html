			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anna Ostapchuk, under the "Law" rubric: "The </F> Constitutional Court Has Carried Out the President's  Instructions. Chairman's Authority Limited in Draft Law"]    [Text] The draft law on the Constitutional Court of the  Russian Federation prepared by the Constitutional Court Work  Group was presented yesterday. Now it should soon be submitted  to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly as a legislative  initiative of the Constitutional Court. As we know, the  president suggested that the court engage in legislative  activity back in October of last year, when he issued the edict  concerning the way for the constitutional judges to spend their  time that would be preferable from his viewpoint.    Without going into the propriety of such "instructions" from  the head of one branch of power to the highest organ of another,  it is worth noting that the Constitutional Court really is in  need of a new law. The previous one became obsolete because of  the numerous amendments made to the previous Constitution. After  the adoption of the new one, which gives completely different  kinds of authority to the Constitutional Court, it became twice  as obsolete. And that is only from the formal standpoint.    The law on the Constitutional Court, as distinct from many  other laws of the new Russian state which have prototypes in  Union practice, was written completely starting from "scratch."  Such a reality as this simply did not exist previously. The  authors from the Committee on Draft Legislation of the Supreme  Soviet created a "cocktail" mainly out of American and German  legal norms. Over two years, all of its weak spots "came to  light." As for the new document, above all one should point out  that it will be a federal constitutional law, with respect to  which the Constitution has prescribed much stricter rules for  adoption. It is a law that elaborates on the Constitution and  fills in its gaps without a procedure for amendment. There will  be only a couple of laws like this.    Consideration of the constitutionality of political parties  has been eliminated from the new law. Therefore, one can assume  that the so-called CPSU affair will remain the only precedent.  And now every citizen or court may appeal a law that encroaches  on the constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens.    Resolving disputes between federal organs of power and  subjects and among various subjects has also been added to the  purview of the Constitutional Court. This new norm for the  purview of the Constitutional Court is mentioned briefly in the  new Constitution, but the law on the Constitutional Court  includes the entire procedure. According to it, conflicting  parties may appeal to the Court, as can the president if he has  not succeeded in his conciliatory role in conflicts of powers.  The fact that the Court has been given a completely new right to  interpret the Constitution is also an innovation.    As for the chairman of the Supreme Court, his authority is  significantly restricted now. His role has actually been reduced  to conducting sessions and recognizing speakers. Any action on  the part of the chairman is accompanied by a stipulation: "by a  decision of the Court" "with the Court's consent," etc. All  decisions are adopted collegially, which can also lead to making  the Court ineffective if the judges, instead of analyzing cases,  jointly resolve all issues, right down to economic ones.    The developers also tried to envision a number of measures  to  make politicization of the Court as difficult as possible. In  many judicial systems there is such a concept as "restraint" or  "silence" of judges. But that is not so much written into the  laws as it is prescribed by ethics. Since no kind of silence can  be achieved legislatively. Under the previous Russian law,  judges were instructed not to discuss cases under consideration  by the court while in the new one they are prohibited from  expressing their ideas even regarding those issues that could be  considered by the Court.    From now on, the results of the voting will not be divulged,  either: how many voted "for" and how many "against" the decision  that was adopted. Moreover, the judge is now prohibited not only  from engaging in political activity but even from attending  party congresses as a spectator. This prohibition seems rather  absurd. One might assume that it was introduced specifically  against Constitutional Court Judge Viktor Luchin, on whom, in  search of "evidence" of his political activity, the judges  subscribing to a pro-presidential political direction "pinned"  precisely that.    The law on the Constitutional Court also contains many other  "innovations" whose apparent purpose is to reduce the political  role of the Constitutional Court as much as possible. As we  know, the Court began to consider the president's statements of  both 20 March and 21 September on its own initiative. The Court  has now been deprived of the right to such personal initiative.  Incidentally, another ban has been imposed: The Constitutional  Court may not consider actions and decisions of officials that  are not expressed in normative acts (another veiled reference to  20 March of last year).    In order to accelerate the movement of cases, the Court has  been divided into two chambers, which have equal rights and are  not specialized. No position for chairman has been envisioned in  the chambers.    In addition to these innovations, an extremely important  aspect, which was initially proposed by specialists from the  work group but was eliminated in the stage of coordination, is  missing. This measure could prevent extremely negative political  consequences of the adoption of unconstitutional laws. We are  speaking about preliminary monitoring of laws published by  parliament. In the opinion of the leader of the Department of  International Law of the Constitutional Court, Vadim Sobakin,  "If the Court were given the right to verify the  constitutionality of laws after they were adopted but before  they were published, this would help to significantly reduce the  intensity of political passions. For after the law takes effect,  irreversible consequences begin. For example, the law on taxes.  Let us say that it encroaches on citizens' rights. But how many  people have to pay the taxes it establishes before we consider  their constitutionality! And it is precisely the honest  taxpayers who suffer. This would also mean that the president  would not have to be discredited again--after all, when a law is  abolished, his okay goes with it. This practice is widespread in  many European countries whose Constitutional Court proceedings  are extremely similar to ours. Such as Italy, Austria, Romania,  Poland, Portugal, and other countries."</p>

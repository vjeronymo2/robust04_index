			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HERRMANN STILL UNSIGNED BY RAMS  </P> <P> Quarterback Mark Herrmann, whose Ram future has been in doubt since the  acquisition of Chuck Long from the Detroit Lions, remains unsigned as  quarterback Jim Everett and selected running backs report to camp today.  </P> <P> Herrmann, 31, was supposed to report, too, but no deal had been completed as of  Sunday night.  </P> <P> Ram sources said that in Herrmann's case, a contract could be worked out before  today's practice.  </P> <P> Herrmann's chances of making this year's team appear to depend on whether the  Rams keep three quarterbacks on their roster.  </P> <P> In other news, Mike McDonald, the team's snapper on punts and field goals, has  been signed to a one-year contract, leaving the Rams with seven unsigned  veterans, including Pro Bowl linebacker Kevin Greene.

			<p>BFN     [Text] We received a report today from the press service  of the Ukrainian president and the Ukrainian Cabinet of  Ministers.    Who will pay for gas? The government is referring to  nonpayments for Russian gas used by Ukrainian enterprises. An  agreement on settling Ukraine's gas debts in the sum of $500  million was reached with the leadership of the Russian joint  stock company Gasprom. [Words indistinct] over the first three  months of the current year, our enterprises paid only 20-25  percent of the required amount. Considering this situation,  acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy today held an extended  meeting with leaders of certain ministries and departments,  representatives of oblast administrations, and managers of  production associations which amass enormous gas debts.  Opportunities for the branches and enterprises, in particular  the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of [word indistinct]  to clear their debts at the expense of their production were  discussed. Specific measures aimed at making payments next  month -- which must be carried out under the personal  responsibility of enterprise managers -- were also detailed at  this meeting. The oblast state administration was authorized to  pressure debtor enterprises. If they fail to make these  payments, managers of enterprises and local administrations will  bear all responsibility for the economic and social  (?consequences), which may follow after gas deliveries to  enterprises, which have not cleared their gas debts, are  suspended.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (9): Where powder stays dry - How technology is changing the fortunes of artificial slopes British skiers, Vail decided, were different. So different that Chris Ryman, the Colorado resort's ski school chief, sent a group of its top instructors on a tour of British dry ski slopes. 'We wanted to see what made many of our British visitors tick and maybe learn some things for ourselves,' said Ryman, now Vail's general manager. The results were revealing. The main differences between British and US skiers did not lie in a separate use of the same language but in attitude. 'The British are easygoing, but they want to start at the crack of dawn and stay till nightfall. No fancy lunches. They want to get on with it and learn. That's not very American. 'The American spends two days skiing then his wife says, 'Let's go shop in Denver'. The British will work in a group. They enjoy lessons. They come back every day and our instructors love it. It's given them a new incentive,' said Ryman. He drew a parallel with the British experience of dry slopes and US skiing. 'At Vail there is no wet snow or ice. It's Rocky Mountain powder or packed powder. It is a controlled environment.' So, of course, is a dry slope. Lesley Beck, whose slalom 10th in the 1987 world championships at Crans Montana, Switzerland, is one of the best British performances of recent times, was reared on brush slopes. 'You learn all the basic skills for snow. It hurts more when you fall but otherwise it is fabulous preparation. Most slopes are in or around big towns or cities. It's not strange or intimidating. It's affordable. Every bit that you are doing counts.' Plastic-injected spikes or brush nylon, the two main types of artificial surface, will never take the place of snow, but they can induce good habits and one in four British skiers will want to limber up on it before their holiday. Not all newcomers to dry slopes can expect to be impressed first time out. Some of the older slopes are as visually appealing as a giant upturned wheelbarrow. More recent ones are sculpted with bends and bumps. Twenty per cent of the slopes have 80 per cent of the business and some of the first-generation facilities are dilapidated. 'The struggling ones are usually the stand-alones,' said Mike Jardine, British Ski Federation chief executive. To survive and thrive a slope needs to be not only interesting but part of a mixed development with other leisure activities. 'There has to be the right initial investment in anchoring and grading the slope,' says Jardine. 'Snow generally is soft and yielding and people initially were worried about the unfriendliness of bristle. Sprained thumbs were commonplace. Good sprinkler systems came in so these days you sometimes ski through a fine knee-high mist which comes on at regular intervals. The lubrication of the slope helps with technique and makes the whole process more enjoyable.' A good club core is essential to the success of centres such as Bearsden in Glasgow, Rossendale on Merseyside, Sheffield, Swadlincote, Telford, Pontypool, Gloucester, Hillingdon, Bracknell or Chatham. And Southampton has produced some of Britain's finest aerials skiers. But Hillend (Edinburgh), at 400m the longest British bristle slope, is struggling with its costs and companies running Beckton in London Docklands have twice gone into liquidation. Will technological advances in indoor snowmaking provide a significant breakthrough? An L-shaped 150m indoor slope at Tamworth is setting the pace. It boasts a two-stage escalator and the slope is made of scrapings of snow laid down like a carpet and methodically regroomed. 'For newcomers and intermediates it is ideal - friendly and a novelty,' said Jardine. 'It also follows the success formula with a swimming pool, gymnasium, restaurant and bar.' Real-snow indoor slopes are a 1990s revolution of almost incalculable consequences. Malcolm Clulow, managing director of Acer Snowmec, is a refrigeration expert and convinced non-skier. He has experimented with a 30m by 10m pilot slope at Telford, and now has plans for six complexes - two near London, and others at Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and Glasgow. His winter theme parks will feature beginner, intermediate and expert areas of differing snow textures, including off-piste, in a controlled -10C environment where the snow never melts or ices. Skating and white-knuckle events such as toboganning or bobsleigh are on the agenda. Also hotels, restaurants, cinemas, bars and shops. Recently, the South Korean Hyo San Development Company signed a licence to use Snowmec technology for a series of six centres in Korea, the first a covered, all-year ski and leisure centre at Migum City, 30 minutes north of Seoul. Brian Thomas, director of the Huddersfield-based Briton Engineering, has been involved in surface and lift construction at Aonach Mor, Britain's largest outdoor development, and at more than 120 dry slopes. His hope is that the British ski industry will learn, as it did in the past, from its climbers. 'Twenty years ago climbing walls were a joke. Now the proprietary walls keep people coming back and back. 'Similarly, ski surfaces which are not inclined rectangles that you get bored with in half an hour will give people the incentive to take up skiing as a sport, not just a holiday pastime.' But that's not where it ends. To get the best out of a good slope there is still a need for good instruction. 'Ninety per cent of people will go for a 'safe option',' says Thomas. 'They will not push themselves. They should be guided into uncharted territory - the steep and deep, the pipe, the ridge, the wall, waves, all manner of gradients and trainer trails - without excessive risk.' It sounds something like a financial formula, too.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY  </P> <P> MORE EATERIES:  </P> <P>  Petite France, 1835 Newport Blvd., Suite D-156, Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Open daily, except Sunday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 650-9363. About the only  hints that this storefront stand is a low-budget operation are the foam serving  trays and plastic utensils. The quality of the food -- from beef Bourguignon in  red wine sauce to prawns sauteed with cilantro -- is light years beyond the  nearest Happy Star. RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

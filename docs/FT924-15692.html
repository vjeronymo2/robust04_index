			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Germans pour cold water on future of Ecu SCEPTICISM about the future of the Ecu market is mounting, as negative remarks by German officials in recent days wiped out any remaining vestiges of investor confidence in the sector. The prospects for further supply, even under the well-established programmes set up by the Bank of England and the French Treasury, appear to be dwindling. Yesterday, Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's four-man directorate, poured cold water on the future of the currency. Speaking at a conference in London, he said: 'A future European currency, whatever it is called, will not be a basket currency.' For the foreseeable future, the Bundesbank will continue to 'feel responsible solely for the D-Mark, in the interest of domestic as well as foreign investors.' Of the Ecu, he added: 'We see no reasons why we should change our attitude to this artificial currency . . . The current outlook for the private Ecu market I think is rather gloomy.' On Wednesday, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, outlined his view of a two-speed Europe consisting of 'concentric circles', with a nucleus currency based on the D-Mark which he termed the 'Europamark'. Although the Bundesbank has long been known for its unfriendly view of the Ecu, the latest developments, at this crucial stage of debate on the path towards European monetary union, seem to stamp out hopes of a resurrection. The Ecu bond market, which went into a steep decline after the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty on June 2, is now barely traded. Ecu bonds now yield more than 50 basis points above their theoretical value  - based on the yields of component currencies. At this level, banks can asset-swap AA-rated Ecu bonds - from fixed-rate to floating-rate - at a level of about 20 basis points above the London interbank offered rate. For such a return, there is demand for the bonds as floating-rate assets, which is providing some support for the market. But in the longer term asset-swapping will further reduce the market's liquidity, since such paper is not likely to be traded. Meanwhile, the UK and France, both committed to issue under Ecu programmes, could be forced to abandon or postpone plans for further auctions, according to some dealers. Financially, such issuance is no longer attractive due to the sharp rise in Ecu yields. The French Treasury, which stated at the start of the year that it would hold an Ecu auction once a quarter, failed to issue during the third quarter, which ended on Wednesday. 'We are looking for the market to recover somewhat before issuing again,' said a French Finance Ministry official, adding that he was confident issuance would resume. The last Ecu OAT issue, totalling Ecu525m, was in April. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is due to announce its next Ecu T-Bill tender next week. The T-bill tender on October 13 is due to be followed by a note tender on October 20. But some traders suggested that there will not be sufficient bids. Other dealers said that there should be a stronger bid for the Ecu short-dated T-bills, since there is still some Ecu cash to invest. The Bank of England declined to comment on the prospects for the tenders. In the meantime, dealers see little prospect of any return of investor interest. 'The Ecu is not going to be the single European currency, and that seems to be the end of the story,' said one trader. The failure of the Yes vote in last month's French referendum on Maastricht to boost the market has destroyed what may have been the market's best prospect for a revival. 'It's more or less over for the Ecu market,' said one trader yesterday. 'It was fun while it lasted.'</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SISTERS ENTANGLED IN DEADLY WEB;  </P> <P> CRIME: A FULLERTON WOMAN WITH A COCAINE HABIT IS ON THE RUN, ACCUSED OF  PLOTTING TO MURDER A FAMILY MEMBER, A RESPECTED ANAHEIM BUSINESSWOMAN.  </P> <P> This is a tale of two sisters as different as night and day.  </P> <P> One, a Fullerton woman with a dangerous penchant for cocaine, has been charged  with being so greedy that she allegedly plotted the death of her own sister to  avoid sharing an inheritance.  </P> <P> The other is known as a respected Anaheim businesswoman who loved her sister so  much, said a prosecutor, that she refused to believe she could be cold-hearted  enough to want to have her killed. She even talked a judge into releasing her  sister from jail into her custody.  </P> <P> Details of the bizarre case, characterized by Deputy Dist. Atty. Aimee Libeu as  "the stuff novels are made of" because of its allegations of greed and  betrayal, emerged last week when a mistrial was declared.  </P> <P> But many of those details are sketchy.  </P> <P> The accused, Alice Marie Reidhead, has apparently fled.  </P> <P> And the alleged target, her sister Karen Meadows, declines to comment.  </P> <P> The case began to unfold the night of Oct. 25, 1988. Reidhead, then 34, was  arrested at a Cypress motel after she allegedly paid an undercover police  officer $800 to kill Meadows, then 35.  </P> <P> According to the prosecutor, Reidhead told a Cypress officer posing as a hit  man that she wanted her sister out of the way so she could avoid sharing what  she believed to be a $2-million property inheritance from her mother, Lorraine  Hulbert. Reidhead also told the officer, according to court documents, that  "she felt her sister had been back-stabbing her."  </P> <P> Reidhead, who also goes by the alias of Alice Marie Witten, had agreed to pay  $1,500, with the remaining $700 to be handed over after her sister was killed,  police allege.  </P> <P> "She stated she didn't want her sister to suffer," undercover Officer Roger  Neumeister testified during Reidhead's preliminary hearing. "I told her I would  make it look like an accident."  </P> <P> The encounter at the motel was the second time Reidhead had met with the  undercover officer to discuss the alleged murder plot. Neumeister wore a hidden  microphone and their conversations were tape-recorded and monitored by Cypress  Police Sgt. Gene Komrosky.  </P> <P> Santa Ana defense attorney Michael Cassidy, who represents Reidhead, said he is  confident he has a strong case to prove his client was a victim of police  entrapment.  </P> <P> He contends that there was no motive for Reidhead to solicit murder. Her mother  was alive and healthy, and there was no expensive property to inherit.  </P> <P> In addition, Cassidy argues that the police tape-recordings aren't clear as to  what his client really wanted from the undercover officer. In fact, during the  preliminary hearing, the undercover officer admitted under cross-examination  that Reidhead never actually used the words, "I want her killed . . . or I want  her dead."  </P> <P> What she did say, the officer testified, was that "she didn't want her  (Meadows) around." Neumeister said that when he specifically asked if she  wanted her sister killed, Reidhead responded, "That's a strong word."  </P> <P> According to Cassidy, Reidhead contends that she paid the undercover officer  $800 to purchase cocaine, not solicit the murder of her sister. She claims the  officer even showed her the cocaine at the motel. The officer, however,  testified during the preliminary hearing that it was Reidhead who brought the  cocaine to the meeting and offered him some.  </P> <P> Cassidy said it was Elbert (Chick) Chickelero, an informant and drug suspect  seeking leniency in his own case, who set up the initial meeting between  Reidhead and the undercover officer. Chickelero told the officer, according to  court documents, that Reidhead was looking for a hit man to kill her sister.  Cassidy said police contacted Reidhead 24 times before they finally arrested  her -- she never called them once.  </P> <P> The night of Reidhead's arrest, Sgt. Komrosky said, he informed Meadows of her  sister's alleged plot against her. Her reaction was one of total "shock," he  said.  </P> <P> Despite the evidence that police said they had against her sister, Meadows  refused to believe that Reidhead would do such a thing and was adamantly  opposed to her being prosecuted. Libeu says that even though Meadows was the  intended victim, under the law she really had no say in whether her sister was  prosecuted.  </P> <P> But Meadows, who owns her own business, was so loyal to her younger sister that  she persuaded Municipal Judge Alan N. McKone to release Reidhead from jail into  her custody.  </P> <P> The idea of an intended victim of a murder plot welcoming the accused  conspirator into her home "is very unusual," said Deputy Public Defender Susan  Green, who then represented Reidhead. "At that time, Karen felt Alice was not a  threat to her. She wanted Alice to live with her. She was very concerned about  her sister."  </P> <P> According to Libeu, the sisters "had very different lifestyles" and Meadows had  long taken a "parental" attitude toward Reidhead, "watching over her and  feeling responsible for her." Meadows had long been concerned about her  sister's drug problem. Reidhead was an admitted cocaine addict, according to  her lawyer, Cassidy. Once, Meadows had nursed her through a drug rehabilitation  program, Libeu said.  </P> <P> Convinced of her sister's innocence, Meadows even appeared with her on the  "Geraldo" television program in February. The show's topic was contract  killing, and the sisters held hands throughout most of the broadcast. Meadows  said she "laughed" at police when they told her of the alleged plot.  </P> <P> Reidhead, who wore long dangling earrings and bore a hard look on her face  during the show, denied the charge but admitted that she had been a cocaine  addict, using as much as an ounce a week about the time of her arrest.  </P> <P> Meadows, dressed in a conservative gray suit, said she had always been close  with her sister, and when host Geraldo Rivera asked Meadows what she would like  to tell the prosecution about the charge against Reidhead, she answered, "I'm  going to tell them they are full of crap."  </P> <P> Three months later, however, Meadows' belief in her sister was shattered.  </P> <P> In May, prosecutor Libeu said she finally showed Meadows the actual transcripts  of her sister's conversations with the undercover officer. Meadows, she said,  broke into tears.  </P> <P> "There's nothing vague about what (Reidhead) says" on the tapes, Sgt. Komrosky  said. "You could hear the viciousness in her voice. You don't have to be a  brain surgeon to figure out what she wanted done."  </P> <P> It's "clear that she was soliciting the murder of her sister," Libeu said.  </P> <P> The sisters split up, and as Reidhead's trial date approached, she became  increasingly "depressed and fearful," Cassidy said.  </P> <P> In May, Reidhead pleaded no contest to a charge that she embezzled money from  her employer, Western Waste, a Norwalk refuse hauling company, Libeu said. She  was ordered to pay $4,400 in restitution for false claims she had processed in  the company's insurance department. She was also sentenced to 180 days in jail,  but that was stayed so she could make restitution.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Reidhead had another misdemeanor case pending against her in Orange  County, stemming from her arrest on a charge of being under the influence of  drugs.  </P> <P> On July 25, when a jury was selected for her trial on the charge of  solicitation for murder, Reidhead attempted to plead no contest. She had come  to court that day looking distressed and unkempt, Cassidy said. She wept a lot  and was dressed in black spandex pants with spike, turquoise-colored high  heels, he said.  </P> <P> As Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan began to accept her plea, he asked  Reidhead if it was true that she had tried to solicit the murder of her sister.  "No," Reidhead screamed, and she began to cry.  </P> <P> "She couldn't choke it out," Libeu said, "so the judge refused to accept the  plea."  </P> <P> That same day, the prosecutor filed a motion asking that Reidhead be taken into  custody and her bail set at $100,000. Cassidy says that may have been the final  straw. "She was very afraid of going to jail," he said.  </P> <P> The next day, a Thursday, Reidhead didn't show up in court. When she failed to  appear again on Monday, the judge issued a warrant for her arrest and declared  a mistrial.  </P> <P> Meadows "has no idea where Alice is," Libeu said. "Meadows is concerned for her  safety. She's under a lot of stress. She's refusing all interviews."  </P> <P> Sgt. Komrosky is confident that police will eventually find Reidhead.  </P> <P> "I don't put anything past her," he said. "She was sophisticated enough to get  away with embezzling money from her company for a long time, and she was  sophisticated enough to contact persons in the world of murder-for-hire. . . .  </P> <P> "I don't know whether she is going to try to get out of the country. But I  think I will find her."  </P></p>

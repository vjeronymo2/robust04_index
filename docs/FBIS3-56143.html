			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS - Ninety members of the  Russian Federation Council Thursday nominated Vladimir Shumeyko  for chairmanship of the new Russian legislature's upper chamber  in a secret nomination procedure, thus giving him a better  chance to be elected than in the first two rounds of voting  Wednesday.    Shumeyko's name appeared on slips with nominations filed by  every member of the chamber ahead of the actual voting, which is  also to be by secret ballot.    If the same number of ballots are cast in his favour as  there  were nominations it will take Shumeyko over the 50-percent  hurdle and land him safely in the chair.    On Wednesday, in the first round of voting this pro-Yeltsin  candidate missed the election by a single vote by scoring 85  votes, one short of the required 86 vote majority. But the  second round confusingly brought his figure down to 81, just two  votes ahead of his main rival, Siberian industrialist Petr  Romanov.    The situation has changed in an unpredictable manner again.  Today Romanov was renominated by a mere 37 people. The other  challengers, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of an ethnic Kalmik  Republic, and Eduard Rossel, the leader of the powerful  association of several industrial regions in the Urals, got few  votes each and have next to no chance to be elected.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A transient who stabbed a woman to death in front of her young daughters and  killed a Hillcrest man 10 days earlier was sentenced Friday to 52 years to life  in state prison.  </P> <P> Thomas Jon Kemp, 27, received the consecutive terms for the Nov. 28, 1988,  murder of Gerilee (Jane) Bertrand, 34, and the Nov. 18, 1988, stabbing of  Chester (Earl) Grandison, 38.  </P> <P> On the eve of his jury trial last week, Kemp pleaded guilty to two counts of  first-degree murder.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office had filed special circumstances allegations and  was planning to seek the death penalty had Kemp been convicted of multiple  murders.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Madruga said the pleas were accepted because  Bertrand's daughters were frightened about testifying in court and reliving the  trauma of witnessing their mother die.  </P> <P> When asked by Superior Court Judge J. Richard Haden if he wished to speak, Kemp  said: "I have nothing to say."  </P> <P> At the sentencing was Bertrand's mother, who also was present when she was  stabbed, and the two daughters.  </P> <P> Bertrand was stabbed after she and Kemp, who had been living with her in  National City, argued over a radio. She told him she had called the police  because of the disturbance he was causing, and he took out a knife and stabbed  her in the heart.  </P> <P> After his arrest, police discovered the key to Grandison's apartment complex  gate in Kemp's pocket.  </P> <P> Grandison was stabbed 18 times and his nude body was found by his roommate.  </P> <P> Kemp's bare footprints were also found in Grandison's bathroom.  </P></p>

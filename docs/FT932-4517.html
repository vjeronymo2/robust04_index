			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / British Coal to cut 3,000 white-collar jobs BRITISH COAL warned for the first time yesterday that some of the 12 pits reprieved in March were at risk as it announced plans to cut half the 6,000 white-collar jobs at the corporation. The warning by Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, came as the National Grid predicted a stark decline in coal's input into electricity making and National Power, the generator, announced the closure of Thorpe Marsh, the coal-fired station in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, with 200 job losses. In his gloomiest prognosis yet of British Coal's prospects, Mr Clarke said he feared the electricity generators did not wish to buy any more coal, 'certainly not until the autumn'. The fate of most of the 12 reprieved pits depends on the generators making extra purchases. Mr Clarke said that with the growth in gas and with the preferred position of nuclear power 'the prospects for substantial additional sales are less optimistic than I would like'. Speaking to the annual conference of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in Weymouth, Dorset, Mr Clarke said that 'unless we are competitive, the consequence will effectively be the closure of more pits'. A cut of about 3,000 of the white-collar staff would be necessary to reduce the burden on the 31 remaining collieries, he said. Talks will be held about the job losses during the next few weeks but they will be spread across the country and will involve all grades, including senior managers. Mr Neil Greatrex, UDM president, said it was clear that the government was running British Coal. 'The white-collar job losses ought to include senior people at British Coal because they have let miners and the country down.' Meanwhile Mr David Jefferies, National Grid chairman, speaking at the announcement of his company's annual results in London, said that coal's share of the electricity market could be less than 50 per cent by 1997-98, compared with the current total of more than 70 per cent. With 10,000MW of combined cycle gas turbine plant already built or under construction, gas's share, which was almost nil this time last year, could reach 25 per cent. Nuclear Electric's share increased from 18.5 per cent to 21.6 per cent last year, and could be 25 per cent after the completion next year of Sizewell B. Emphasising the threat to British Coal's future, National Power said the 1,100MW coal-fired Thorpe Marsh plant would cease production at the end of March because it could 'no longer find room in the market place'. The company expects redundancies to be voluntary. It recently announced plans to close 2,000MW to 3,000MW of capacity during the next two to three years. National Grid results, Page 24</p>

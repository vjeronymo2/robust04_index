			<p>BFN     [Text] (DYN-NA) -- Matilde Menendez, who resigned Tuesday  from her seat on the newly-elected Constituent Assembly, stepped  down as leader of the PAMI pensioners' health scheme yesterday.  Meanwhile President Carlos Menem announced that she would be  replaced by power workers' union leader Carlos Alderete.    Menendez has been under fire since a bribery scandal  involving PAMI erupted late February when it was said that the  organization had been demanding kickbacks from clinics hired to  carry out medical work.    The initial complaint, filed by Frente Grande city  councillor  Anibal Ibarra, pointed the finger directly at Menendez for being  personally responsible for the financial irregularities. That  in turn led to a host of accusations against her in the  politically sensitive moment of an electoral campaign.    Many observers said her position on the list of Justicialist  candidates for election to the Constituent Assembly was a prime  reason for the Peronist failure in the Federal Capital last  Sunday.    However this latest development failed to placate Ibarra who  said last night that Menendez should have "been forced to go  long ago" and that the government was guilty of "keeping in  office those who have been found guilty of corruption." He  added that if the government had performed better in the  elections Menendez would still be in office.    Meanwhile Alderete told reporters that he would work to  stamp  out "all types of corruption and neutralize any cases...if it  turns out that there are any."</p>

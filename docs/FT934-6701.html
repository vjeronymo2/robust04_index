			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Air France case on Dan-Air opens The European Commission should have investigated the effect of British Airways' takeover of Dan-Air on airline competition on routes between Britain and France, Air France told the European Court of First Instance yesterday. The French state carrier told the lower chamber of the European Court that last year's takeover of Dan-Air, the troubled UK carrier, had allowed BA to increase its share of the France-UK routes using London's Gatwick airport from 45 per cent in 1991-92 to 61 per cent in 1992-93. The Commission claimed in October last year that the takeover - for a nominal price of Pounds 1 - was not large enough to fall under European rules governing mergers. Shortly afterwards the British government cleared the deal. Evidence submitted to yesterday's oral hearing in Luxembourg will now be assessed and the court should rule on the case in the first half of next year. Dr Ami Barav, a European law consultant to the London solicitor Theodore Goddard, said yesterday that a decision against the Commission in the Air France case could have far-reaching implications for Brussels' procedure for vetting merger cases.</p>

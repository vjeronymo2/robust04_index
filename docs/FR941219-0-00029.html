			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the laboratory, delta smelt eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days (Randy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mager, University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observations indicate that delta smelt are broadcast spawners that spawn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a current, usually at night, distributing their eggs over a local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area (Lindberg 1992, Mager 1993). Eggs attach singly to the substrate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and few eggs were found on vertical plants (Lindberg 1993). Lindberg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1993) found that yolk-sac fry were positively phototactic and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negatively buoyant. After hatching, larvae are transported downstream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toward the mixing zone where they are retained by the vertical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circulation of fresh and salt waters (Stevens  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). The pelagic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larvae feed on phytoplankton until day 4, begin to feed on rotifers on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day 6 and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Artemis nauplii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on day 14 (Mager 1992). Juveniles feed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusively on zooplankton. When the mixing zone is located in a broad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone (depths less than 4 meters), high densities of phytoplankton and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and juvenile fish, including delta smelt, grow rapidly (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). When given the opportunity, delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt remain in Suisun Bay even after the 2 ppt isohaline has retreated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upstream (Herbold 1994). In general, estuaries are among the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productive ecosystems in the world (Goldman and Horne 1983). Estuarine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environments produce an abundance of fish as a result of plentiful food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and shallow, protective habitat for young.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the mixing zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt are dispersed widely throughout a large expanse of shallow-water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and marsh habitat. Dispersal in areas downstream from the State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal water pumps and in-Delta agricultural diversions protects young  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt from entrainment and distributes them among the extensive,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrast, when located upstream, the mixing zone becomes confined in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deep river channels, which are smaller in total surface area, contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fewer shoal areas, have swifter, more turbulent water currents, and lack  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high zooplankton productivity. Vulnerability to entrainment in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and Federal pumping facilities and in-Delta diversions increases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Erkkila  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1950) collected young delta smelt near Sherman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Island, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July and August of 1948. In studies by the California Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fish and Game, California Department of Water Resources (DWR), and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bureau, larval and juvenile delta smelt were collected from Roe Island  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Suisun Bay north to the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rivers and east to Medford Island on the San Joaquin River (Wang 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These studies were conducted during the months of April through mid-July  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1989 and 1990. Through these distribution surveys, Wang (1991) was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to document the movement of juvenile delta smelt from the Delta to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Suisun Bay in late June and early July. In 1990, young delta smelt were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken at the Tracy Pumping Plant at the end of February (Wang 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The delta smelt is adapted to living in the highly productive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary (Estuary) where salinity varies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spatially and temporally according to tidal cycles and the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> freshwater inflow. Despite this tremendously variable environment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historical Estuary probably offered relatively constant suitable habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mixing zone (Peter Moyle, University of California, pers. comm.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993). Since the 1850's, however, the amount and extent of suitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat for the delta smelt has declined dramatically. The advent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1853 of hydraulic mining in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers led to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased siltation and alteration of the circulation patterns of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary (Nichols  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). The reclamation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Merritt Island for agricultural purposes in the same year marked the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of the present-day cumulative loss of 94 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary's tidal marshes (Nichols  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to this degradation and loss of estuarine habitat, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt has been increasingly subject to entrainment, upstream or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reverse flows of waters in the Delta and San Joaquin River, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constriction of habitat in the less productive, deep-water river  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> channels of the Delta (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992). These adverse conditions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily a result of the steadily increasing proportion of water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diverted from the Delta by the Federal and State water projects (Monroe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Kelly 1992). Water delivery through the Federal Central Valley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project (CVP) began in water year 1940. The State Water Project (SWP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> began delivering water in 1968. However, the proportion of fresh water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being diverted has increased since 1983 and has remained at high levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992). A relationship has been found between the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of juvenile delta smelt salvaged at the State and Federal pumps and both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the percent of inflow diverted and total Delta outflow (California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Water Resources and Bureau of Reclamation 1994). The high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportion of fresh water exported has exacerbated the already harsh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental conditions experienced by the delta smelt during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recent 6-year drought (1987&hyph;1992). The March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species describes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detail the factors that have led to this species' decline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Service Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service included the delta smelt as a category 1 candidate species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Category 1 includes species for which data in the Service's possession  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are sufficient to support proposals for listing. On June 29, 1990, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service received a petition dated June 26, 1990, from Dr. Don C. Erman,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> President-Elect of the California-Nevada Chapter of the American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fisheries Society, to list the delta smelt as an endangered species and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designate its critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial information had been presented indicating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioned action may be warranted and announced this decision in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 24, 1990 (55 FR 52852). On October 3, 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (56 FR 50075), the Service published a proposal to list the delta smelt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a threatened species and to designate critical habitat. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule constituted the 12-month petition finding in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat was proposed for areas of all water and all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bounded by and contained within Suisun Bay (including the contiguous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grizzly and Honker Bays), the length of Montezuma Slough, portions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento River, portions of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the San Joaquin River, and the contiguous water bodies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between (a complex of bays, dead-end sloughs, channels typically less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than four meters deep, marshlands, etc.), contained in the State of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California. The public comment period opened on the date of publication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule (October 3, 1991) and closed on January 31, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65877), the Service published a notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of public hearing on the proposed rule to be held in three locations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California. Public hearings were conducted on January 9, 1992, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento; on January 14, 1992, in Santa Monica; and on January 16,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992, in Visalia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART OF ART CRITICISM  </P> <P> Regarding William Wilson's June 18 article about "The Dada and Surrealist  Word-Image" show at LACMA: Could Calendar please hire an art critic who will  discuss things such as composition, medium and context instead of the car in  front of him as he was leaving the museum?  </P> <P> Wilson's condescending, self-absorbed efforts to prove he is just as clever and  hip as the artist he writes around are tiresome.  </P> <P> He is guilty of what he so often criticizes in exhibit catalogues: Artspeak and  obfuscation: "In the big picture, the dilemma of the modern artist has been  that history lopped off his traditional function." Say what?  </P> <P> JOEL WALLERIUS  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY PEOPLE  </P> <P>  Richard P. Reinhardt is resigning as deputy director of the California Student  Aid Commission to become vice president for administration at United Education  &amp; Software, an Encino company that operates a chain of trade schools.  </P> <P> Reinhardt, 42, has been with the CSAC since 1983. The state agency guarantees,  on behalf of the federal government, loans to students made by private  financial institutions, such as banks.  </P> <P> His appointment at UES is effective March 13.  </P> <P> Last year, the CSAC and other regulatory agencies discovered problems at a UES  subsidiary that serviced about $1 billion in government-backed student loans.  The joint investigation, which uncovered problems in UES' ability to service  some of the loans correctly, prompted the company to shed the student-loan  processing business and led to UES' $4.47-million loss for the nine months  ended Oct. 31.  </P></p>

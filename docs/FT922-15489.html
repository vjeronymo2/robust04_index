			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Bull stems losses to FFr3.3bn GROUPE BULL, France's state-controlled computer group which recently concluded an alliance with IBM of the US, managed to reduce its losses from FFr6.79bn in 1990 to FFr3.3bn (Dollars 589m) in 1991 despite the intense competition in the international computer industry. Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull's chairman, attributed the improvement to the radical restructuring programme implemented by Bull last year. This programme, which involved overhauling products and cutting the worldwide workforce by 9,000 people, or 19 per cent, in 1991 was designed to cut costs and improve efficiency. However, Mr Lorentz warned that Bull anticipated another tough year in 1992. 'We must redouble our efforts to adapt to a world market which is still in ' he said. Bull earlier this year restructured its debt by securing an international credit facility of Dollars 1.1bn. Bull sustained a fall in overall sales of 3.1 per cent from FFr34.6bn in 1990 to FFr33.5bn in 1991. Its hardware sales are believed to have fallen - by 4 per cent in Europe and North America  - for the first time. The company managed to counter this with its cost-cutting programme which involved reducing its production plants from 13 to five as well as job losses. The cost of restructuring was higher than originally expected. Bull was forced to make a provision of FFr675m for restructuring in 1991 in addition to the provision of FFr3.62bn made in its 1990 accounts. The alliance with IBM, which involves the two companies swapping technical know-how, will lead to the US group investing Dollars 100m in Bull for 5.7 per cent of its shares. NEC of Japan last year took 4.7 per cent of Bull in return for ceding its shares in the French company's US subsidiary.</p>

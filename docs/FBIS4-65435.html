			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`bb'-attributed report: "Concentration on Asian-Pacific </F> Region"]    [Text] Canberra -- This year's annual general meeting of  the German-Australian Chamber of Trade and Industry in Canberra  served as an illustration of the German rediscovery of Australia  and the Pacific region and the consequent intensification of  relations between Germany and the antipodean continent.    After three years in office, Hugh Morgan, managing director  of the Western Mining Corporation, left the chairmanship of the  Chamber. His place was taken by John Ralph, one of the most  prominent Australian captains of industry. He is managing  director of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia and president of the  influential Business Council of Australia. The meeting mainly  discussed Australia's role as a springboard for Asia, as a  location for branch offices of German enterprises, and as a  partner in trilateral cooperation.    "The Asia-Pacific Conference in Bangkok has provided  positive  signals that German industry and the German Government are at  last devoting proper attention to this region of economic  growth," explained Bernd Schlickum, chairman of the Chamber's  board of management. "Australia is clearly recognized as a part  of this region. Sixty percent of its exports have already gone  to Asian countries."    The presence of Senator Bob McMullan, Australian minister of  trade, served to underline the importance that the Australian  Labor Government attaches to Germany's involvement in Australia.  "The relations between our countries have expanded considerably  over the past few years," said the minister. "Today, one notes  a shift in the balance of economic power. Despite our  concentration on the Asia-Pacific region, we shall not turn our  back on Europe," he promised.    McMullan was particularly pleased by the fact that German  enterprises are establishing regional offices on the fifth  continent. With a level of investments exceeding 6.4 billion  Australian dollars (7.6 billion German marks), Germany is in  third position regarding the size of investments by EU [European  Union] countries in Australia. Franz Keil, German ambassador in  Canberra, said the difficulty lies in encouraging smaller German  enterprises to embark on the long road to Asia. Keil said the  German Embassy would do more to help establish contacts between  German and Australian enterprises.    Heinrich Zimmermann, managing director of the Chamber, made  it clear that an intensification of the Chamber's economic  functions is essential if only because of the fact that Germany  has curtailed subsidies for foreign trade chambers. "In the  future, the trade chambers must concentrate on profit-bearing  activity, adapt their services to the new situation, and at the  same time undertake harsh cost-saving measures," said Zimmermann.    Continuing with his business report, Zimmermann said that  German firms' search for representatives or importers in  Australia has increased. "But many German companies still seem  oblivious to the fact that such half-hearted attempts to  establish contacts offer only limited prospects of success," he  said. "Obviously they do not want to avail themselves of the  expert services of the chamber of trade, such as market analyses  and the finding of suitable partners, because these services  cost money."    In 1994, trade between Australia and Germany rose by 12  percent. In 1992-93, 5 to 7 percent of Australia's imports came  from Germany, so that Germany occupies fourth place among  Australia's most important supplier countries.</p>

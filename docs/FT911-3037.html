			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): MacTooth does the filling in DENTISTS are now being offered computer software which can help them keep a graphically coloured computer chart of all the work they do on a patient's teeth - and do away with written records and paperwork. The MacTooth software, developed by Degree Zero, of London's Harley Street, runs on the latest Apple Macintosh Mac LC machine. When a new patient joins the practice, the details are recorded on the computer by the receptionist. After that, the dentist records details of treatment by using the mouse. He or she clicks on to the diagramatic representation of a particular tooth on the screen and then fills in part of the tooth with a specific colour to represent a treatment. A silver splodge denotes an amalgam filling, while a bright yellow splodge denotes a gold one. Once the treatment is complete the software translates the colours into codes from which it can generate the patient's bill and other paperwork. The computer also produces a spreadsheet of the practice's accounts for the auditors. Contacts: Degree Zero: UK, 071 436 3194.</p>

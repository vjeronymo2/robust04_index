			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Square Mile calls for economic strategy plan The Corporation of London, the City's local authority, has commissioned consultants to draw up the first economic development strategy for the capital's financial district. The aim is to identify opportunities for attracting new businesses to the City while maintaining its position as one of the world's three leading financial centres. The Square Mile faces growing competition from other European cities such as Paris and Frankfurt, as well as UK cities that have economic development organisations working to attract new businesses. Corporation leaders believe there is a danger that the City may become over-dependent on financial services, where the markets are mature and scope for further growth is restricted. The strategy will be formulated by consultants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, which won the contract against competition from six other bidders. It is expected to be completed by the autumn, providing a candid assessment of the City's shortcomings as a place to do business. Among potential weaknesses to be explored are London's expensive image and worries over the effects on business of the government's attitude to closer European integration. The strategy will include an action plan for improving the attractions of the Square Mile as a location for the headquarters of international companies and other organisations. At the same time, the corporation will also be setting up an office to attract business from the former Soviet bloc countries. The Central and Eastern European Trade Centre will offer research, consultancy and translators for companies and trade missions seeking access to the London markets. Both moves reflect the growing leadership role being adopted by the corporation in bringing business to London. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the influential policy and resources committee, says the unsuccessful campaign to bring the new European Central Bank to London led it to focus on weaknesses in the City's case. The corporation has set aside a Pounds 1m-a-year budget for economic regeneration, partly committed to supporting projects such as the London First Centre, a one-stop shop for inward investors. 'The City may seem like the last place on earth that needs to sell itself,' says Mr Vince Taylor of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'But that is exactly what it needs to do if it is to maintain its market share and raise its international profile.'</p>

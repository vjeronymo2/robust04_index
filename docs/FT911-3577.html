			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: BZW to shut US equities operation BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd is closing its US equities operations and laying off 15 per cent of its staff, just a year after hiring a number of top-flight analysts to set up the business. The investment banking and securities arm of Britain's Barclays Bank said yesterday that a detailed review had concluded that 'the cost of building and maintaining a business in US equities wouldn't produce adequate returns in the forseeable future.' A BZW official in New York indicated that, even with the recent upturn in the securities business, the firm had found it difficult to compete against established US securities dealers with far greater resources. She described the venture as an 'opportunistic act which proved untenable'. The lay-offs affect 60 research, sales and support staff, most of them based in New York. The firm emphasised that its international equities business based in New York will not be affected.</p>

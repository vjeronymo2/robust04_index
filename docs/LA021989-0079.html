			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THE LAND IS LOST, BUT NOT THE TAX BILL  </P> <P> Shortly before Victor Nascimento bought 11-plus acres of land in 1970, he  toured the wooded site, which a real estate agent said ran along the town's  Blue Dot Trail, past Babbling Brook, and stopped at the old oak tree just over  the Connecticut border.  </P> <P> But the tree has rotted and the brook has dried, Nascimento says, and he's  baffled because he has been paying taxes on land he can't find.  </P> <P> "You walk in the woods," he says, "and all the trees look the same."  </P> <P> Nascimento and his brother, who is now dead, bought the parcel for $2,100 and  got a quit-claim deed, which gives them the right to claim the land but not to  take any recourse against the seller should there be a problem with the title.  </P> <P> Nascimento and his wife, Lynn, of East Providence, and his sister-in-law, Lois,  were so confused that they refused to pay taxes on the land for two years.  </P> <P> When the town threatened to sell the land to collect the back taxes in  December, the Nascimentos paid the $455 tax bill. Nascimento said he would get  a title search, although financial constraints won't allow that soon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Old Dream  </P> <P> "I am an old Boy Scout, and it was my dream to own a piece of land," Nascimento  says.  </P> <P> Arlene Violet, former state attorney general, says if they had gotten a title  search and title insurance when they bought the land, they would be able to sue  the title company if they could not find their property.  </P> <P> Violet says there are two recourses: Since the old oak tree, Blue Dot Trail and  Babbling Brook are identified in the Nascimentos' quit-claim deed, they could  look for other references to those landmarks, perhaps in older deeds, to try to  claim ownership. Also, they could obtain topography maps, which are close-ups  of the land, to find their parcel.  </P> <P> The tax collector agrees with the Nascimentos that the land exists. "There's a  deed for it, so we're assuming that it exists," says Linda Czerkiewicz of  Hopkinton. "They bought something."  </P> <P> Nascimento says the original documents filed with his lawyer were destroyed  when the lawyer's garage burned years ago, and his real estate agent says he  doesn't remember the Nascimentos.  </P> <P> "There's a chain of taxes people paid on this land, dating back to the 1800s,"  Nascimento says.  </P> <P> He says he bought the land from a Dean Edwards, who inherited the parcel from  his father, Oliver Edwards. He says Dean Edwards died about two years ago.  </P> <P> "Oliver Edwards was an old-time Yankee," Nascimento says. "These Yankees don't  pay taxes on land that doesn't exist."  </P> <P> Not only does he not know where his property is, he doesn't know how much it is  worth.  </P> <P> "I believe it's quite expensive," he says, "let's put it that way."  </P></p>

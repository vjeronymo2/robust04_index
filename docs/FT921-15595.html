			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Fugitive Georgian leader ill, says PM MR TENGIZ SIGUA, Georgia's acting prime minister, said yesterday that medical certificates had been located diagnosing Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the former president, who fled the country on Monday, as mentally ill. He also claimed that Mr Gamsakhurdia had seized Rbs200m (Pounds 1m) of state funds before his flight and embezzled more than Rbs1bn during his presidency. The president and 80 supporters were yesterday in a mountain retreat in Getokhobit in Armenia. He himself appeared on Armenian television in defiant mood, declaring he was still president of Georgia. Mr Sigua said that a Georgian delegation sent to hold tripartite negotiations with Mr Gamsakhurdia and an Armenian delegation had been refused access. He added that Georgia was prepared to allow Mr Gamsakhurdia to be granted political asylum by Armenia provided he was barred from leaving the country. He also said that Mr Gamsakhurdia's diagnosis as mentally ill might preclude his being brought back to Georgia to face criminal charges. While he admitted that Mr Gamsakhurdia had been a dissident, and that dissidents in the Soviet era had frequently been declared mentally ill, he said that five of the six doctors involved were still alive and prepared to certify the diagnoses were genuine.</p>

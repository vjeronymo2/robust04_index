			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / New crime bill passed by House The US House of Representatives yesterday passed a sweeping crime bill that would provide money for 50,000 new police officers and impose a mandatory life sentence on anyone convicted of a third violent felony. The legislation passed by a margin of 285 to 141 after a week of often rancorous debate that had alienated some left-wing Democrats by toughening the bill's measures, but not enough to win the support of the more right-wing members of the Republican party. Congressional leaders will now have to reconcile the House legislation with a similar bill passed by the Senate last year. In all, the House version would cost around Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19.1bn), against Dollars 22bn for the Senate bill, largely because it provides more money to help states build prisons. It also contains a measure allowing defendants to use statistics in an effort to prove racial discrimination in the application of the death penalty against them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan will not participate  in U.N. peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia "at  present" but will consider studying the possibility on a mid- to  long-term basis, Foreign Ministry officials said Thursday [3  February].    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, in announcing Japan's  contribution to the war-torn region, said humanitarian  assistance and help in maintaining stability in Macedonia  through economic and technical cooperation will be stepped up  instead.    The announcement followed weeks of deliberations on Japan's  possible contribution after the government sent a survey mission  there in early January.    The team, headed by senior Foreign Ministry Official Shunji  Yanai, visited such areas as Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade.    Hata said in the statement that Japan is not considering  sending personnel to the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    The ministry officials said Japan will continue studying the  nation's participation "from a mid- to long-term perspective"  and closely watch regional developments, the UNPROFOR and the  peace process.    Officials pointed out that although UNPROFOR commander Brig.  Gen. Saermark Thomsen [spelling of name as received] told the  mission that he will welcome Japan's participation, the United  Nations has made no formal request.    Once such a request is made, the nation will consider a  dispatch from a legal viewpoint and then make a policy decision,  they said.    Hata voiced concern in the statement over continuing armed  conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and the failure of the peace  process, and strongly urged a solution through negotiations, not  battles. He added Japan intends to make efforts toward peace.    Regarding humanitarian cooperation, Tokyo is considering  extending between 10 million and 15 million dollars to U.N.  organizations to help refugees, the officials said.    Details, including timing of the disbursement, have yet to  be  decided, they said.    Tokyo plans to provide facilities, medical goods, food and  other equipment to help the refugees, they said.    Japan will strengthen ties with Macedonia and promote  personnel exchanges to help develop its economy and improve  public life in an aim to prevent conflicts from occurring, the  officials said.    Specifically, Japan will send three or four experts to  Macedonia in spring to study implementation of economic and  technical cooperation. They will also invite Macedonian  Government officials in charge of economic cooperation to Japan  in March, they said.    Japan also plans to establish diplomatic ties with Macedonia  as soon as possible and look into setting up an honorary counsul  general, and will lift self-restraints on tourists Friday to  Macedonia, they said.    The government will also send a Foreign Ministry official to  the eight-member conflict prevention mission of the Conference  on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the officials said.    To tackle the area's problems more effectively, Japan will  strengthen its embassy in Austria to cover Slovenia, Croatia and  Macedonia, and promote ties with Albania, which play an  important role in the stability of the Balkan region, they said.    A minister at the Japanese embassy in Austria will become a  Japanese representative in charge of problems in the region and  will attend consultations among major nations in Zagreb when  possible, they said.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HUNTER LOSES BID TO REFUTE DOMINELLI  </P> <P> The judge in the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial ruled Thursday that evidence  contradicting a claim by J. David (Jerry) Dominelli that he was a Vietnam  veteran is not admissible because it "is going too far afield."  </P> <P> During a passionate appeal to U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam during a  hearing held after the jury was sent home for the day, defense attorney Robert  Brewer Jr. argued that the evidence is crucial to defend Hunter because it is a  prime example of how Dominelli lied to her in their personal relationship, as  well as in their professional relationship.  </P> <P> A central defense contention is that Hunter could not see through the lies  being fed to her by Dominelli because she was so in love with the man who  masterminded the giant J. David &amp; Co. fraud operation.  </P> <P> This defense tactic is countered by prosecutors, who say that being in love is  not a legal defense against the 197 crimes Hunter is accused of committing.  </P> <P> Love "doesn't destroy the ability to tell right from wrong," said Assistant U.  S. Atty. Stephen Clark.  </P> <P> Clark and the lead prosecutor, Assistant U. S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo, charge that  Hunter was a knowing and willing participant in the J. David Ponzi scheme,  which caused about 1,200 people to lose nearly $90 million.  </P> <P> Brewer conceded that this defense might be considered "laughable," but he urged  Gilliam to consider that Hunter is a "sympathetic and emotional person" and  that Dominelli told her war stories "in graphic details."  </P></p>

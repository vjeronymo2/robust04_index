Bernard Sansaricq, who proclaimed himself president of  the Haitian Senate on 4 February, led the operation to prevent  Senate leaders who oppose the military government from taking  their seats.    According to Radio Metropole, military men occupied the  Senate and shots were heard in the area surrounding the  legislative building in Port-au-Prince. Armed civilians  surrounded the building and were arresting people who opposed  pro-coupist parliamentarians. No information on the number of  people detained or their whereabouts is available.    Political observers think the coupists found a way to "close  off" the Senate, an objective which has been announced many  times by those who oppose President Jean Bertrand Aristide's  return. Senate President Farmin Jean Louis, who was elected in  the negotiations supervised by the international community in  August 1993, was in Washington on a State Department invitation  for a new round of talks when he was deposed. Jean Louis and the  other senators who rejected the views of Sansaricq and his  followers, left the parliament because of death threats against  them. This Monday, Jean Louis and Senator Julio Larosilliere,  who was in Washington also, arrived at the Senate for the first  time since their return and announced their determination to  reoccupy their seats.    Diplomats in Port-au-Prince have said that the international  community does not know who the senators led by Sansaricq are,  considering that Jean Louis' mandate is still effective.    Several Haitian women's organizations took advantage of the  commemoration of International Women's Day on Tuesday to express  their dissatisfaction with UNICEF, an organization that, they  say, has remained silent on the abuses perpetrated against them  by the coupist military.</p>

Indeed, I had intended to abandon my mission. In  view of recent events, however, I think that my resignation  would not be appropriate or even clearly understood or correctly  interpreted at the very time when, for the first time, decisive  action had just been taken in Bosnia."    LE SOIR, which in an exclusive interview on 25 May 1993  announced the intention of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, former Polish  prime minister, special rapporteur of the Human Rights  Commission in the former Yugoslavia, to abandon his mission,  questioned him again by telephone in Warsaw before the  publication of his latest report in Geneva next Monday.    However, although Mr. Mazowiecki is wondering about the  appropriateness of his departure given the new circumstances  created by the ultimatum in Sarajevo, he has not changed his  opinion and continues to accuse the international community of  "inertia" faced with the "large-scale violations" of human  rights in Bosnia.    "The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, especially in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, prove that human rights only occupy a  secondary place on the international political stage," the  former Polish prime minister writes. A number of "official  measures which have been taken can be regarded as a substitute  or an excuse for the international community's political  inertia," he said. The special rapporteur then admitted that he  had been unable to achieve his main objectives which were "to  provide assistance to the victims and reduce the massive scale  of human rights violations."    It was in August 1992 that the UN Human Rights Commission  gave Mr. Mazowiecki the task of drawing up periodic reports on  the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. Mazowiecki, who has  already published five reports last year, still thinks that all  his warnings have been "ignored by the international community."  Meanwhile, the policy of "ethnic cleansing," started by the  Bosnian Serbs has been "continued without respite," he explained.    Last May, Mr. Mazowiecki was extremely critical of the  international community. "Pontius Pilate's gesture does not  suit me," the first prime minister of postcommunist Poland told  us at the time. He is waiting for the meeting in Geneva next  Monday before making a decision. The fact remains that he is  wondering, as he told us on Tuesday evening, "whether the  international community will be capable of continuing decisive  action in the defense of human rights in the former Yugoslavia.  Withdrawal or UN control of the heavy weapons around Sarajevo  does not solve the terrible problems which stem from the serious  human rights violations in Sarajevo and elsewhere. I hope, but  unfortunately without having any certainty, that the Sarajevo  action will be a turning-point and that equally decisive actions  will also be taken elsewhere."</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES: TWO HALIBUT DERBIES WILL BRIGHTEN THE SPRING SEASON  </P> <P> There's nothing like halibut derbies to set the pace for spring fishing.  </P> <P> The first of two local derbies is this weekend with the 16th annual Marina del  Rey contest.  </P> <P> Fishing will begin at 5 a.m. Saturday and continue until the weigh-in station  closes at 5 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> The fishing area is restricted to five miles offshore between Pt. Vicente and  Pt. Dume.  </P> <P> The halibut-only derby is a charity event in conjunction with the Marina del  Rey Anglers and the Boys Scouts of America Western Los Angeles Council. Entry  fees will be equally divided among the Boy Scouts and youth fishing and marine  conservation projects.  </P> <P> The grand prize for biggest fish will be a trip for two to the Great Barrier  Reef in Australia.  </P> <P> Second prize will be a trip for two to Alaska to fish for giant halibut and  salmon.  </P> <P> Other prizes will be provided by tackle companies and landings.  </P> <P> All derby entrants will be automatically entered into a special prize drawing  at the awards banquet April 5.  </P> <P> Carl Lambert, derby chairman, is encouraging anglers to use only single hooks  and 14-pound test line, and to carefully release all short fish.  </P> <P> Entry is limited to 1,200 anglers. Lambert said a few spots remain open. Late  applications may be taken to the derby headquarters at Pardee Scout Base, 13640  Mindanao Way in Marina del Rey. The entry fee is $35.  </P> <P> The next derby will be the Santa Monica Halibut Derby on April 7-8.  </P> <P> Mike Vasi of Redondo Beach, fishing at King Harbor breakwater on the incoming  tide, was soaking an anchovy on the bottom when he had a strike and brought up  a halibut.

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Irish questions FOR SOMEONE who writes about the micro-world of Donegal, Brian Friel has a formidable range. Those who admired his gentle Dancing at Lughnasa a couple of years ago will find this revival of Translations, written in 1980, much stronger meat. Translations is almost an overtly political play. The time is 1833. The English military have arrived to conduct the first ordnance survey of Ireland. As David Killick's no- nonsense-from-the-natives Captain Lancey explains, there are two reasons. One is to equip the military authorities with 'up-to-date and accurate information in every corner of this part of the empire'. The other is to provide a basis for a new land evaluation for the purpose, he claims, of more equitable taxation. Subsequent developments suggest that the military can be very brutal. English audiences should not wince at that. Imperialism showed its nastier side in Ireland. Harder to take is the hyper-romanticism of the Irish in the first half of the 19th century. Every peasant, however drunken, carries a copy of Homer in his pocket. The entire rural population attends hedge schools where they imbibe arithmetic as well as the classics. They prefer to converse in Greek and Latin rather than stoop to English. Perhaps we should put that down to poetic licence. The main practical criticism of Translations is structural. The play does not have an ending; it just stops. There has been the heavy hint of the murder of an English officer. The military is about to exact its revenge, first on the animals, next on the people. Then Hugh, head of the hedge school, begins a long speech about what came out of Troy: Urbs antiqua fuit. The curtain falls or, in the case of the Donmar Warehouse, out go the lights. I suspect that this is Friel deliberately running away from the political tension he has built up. The best parts of Translations are not about imperialism, but rather slow changes over time, especially in relation to language: that includes local place names, which the English want to standardise. Nor is the play particularly anti-British. Some of the young Irish actually want to learn English, if only for emigration to America. The more educated Irish can speak English anyway; it is just that they regard Ovid in English translation as sounding plebeian. Yet while the play has its defects, it has some marvellous moments. Friel bows to Shakespeare in allowing a young English officer to communicate with an Irish girl in spite of the language barrier. 'Say anything at all,' says Zara Turner's Maire, 'I love the sound of your speech.' Tony Rohr's Homer-loving layabout believes in his cups that he has received a proposal of marriage from Pallas Athene and is seeing her father, Zeus, tomorrow. More seriously, Norman Rodway's Hugh goes into a discourse about endogamy or marrying within the tribe. He gives the word in Greek. It is a mild relief that he appears to accept exogamy - marrying outside the tribe - as well, but clearly it is the exception not the rule. Until Friel backs away, the message is that it is dangerous to truck with the English - almost, in other words, 'Troops Out]' The refurbished Donmar Warehouse is setting high standards. Translations is directed by Sam Mendes and there is an austere, wet hay-smelling set by Johan Engels. It fits the barren atmosphere; the only child mentioned in the play dies in infancy.

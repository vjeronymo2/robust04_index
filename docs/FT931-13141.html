			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Excalibur shares fall as first half loss revealed EXCALIBUR shares tumbled 19 per cent to 8 1/2 p as the jewellery and engineering company revealed interim losses at the midway stage and halved the interim dividend to 0.2p. The pre-tax loss for the six months to October 31 was Pounds 183,000, against a profit of Pounds 905,000 last time. Sales fell 8 per cent to Pounds 30.3m. Analysts, surprised by the extent of the reversal at the operating level from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 654,000, reduced forecasts for the full year from less than Pounds 2m pre-tax to break-even. Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman, said he had been disappointed by the effect of a decline in jewellery on the other businesses. 'With the exception of jewellery . . . our businesses were within Pounds 8,000 of budget,' he said. The jewellery division, operating in a market which Excalibur estimates has declined by 60 per cent in two years, suffered operating losses of more than Pounds 1m, against a small profit last year. Margins had fallen by about 50 per cent in the face of price-cutting and stock-dumping by competitors. Action had been taken to stem losses, and about 37 per cent of the 100-strong workforce had been made redundant, Mr Griffiths said. However, the division was unlikely to return to profit in the full year. Mr Griffiths said retailers were likely to remain cautious, even when economic recovery began. The giftware operation was also adversely affected by the downturn in consumer spending. Profits were significantly down on the previous year. The engineering division offered a slightly better return with a small increase in operating profits from aerospace. Industrial products experienced mixed fortunes, with the off-road vehicle business continuing to incur losses. Mr Griffiths said engineering order books were about the same, if not slightly better. Yet margins continued to be under pressure. Interest charges were 23 per cent lower at Pounds 837,000. However, gearing at 83 per cent was higher than last year's 69 per cent following the Pounds 600,000 purchase of a small business to add to the industrial product division. Mr Griffiths said the group had generated some Pounds 2m more than expected from cash flow. This contributed to capital expenditure of Pounds 1m in the first half. Losses per share were 0.6p, compared with earnings of 0.8p last year. COMMENT With any other company investors might well be preparing for the worst. However, Excalibur appears to have secured its future with the recent debt restructuring to provide long-term finance. Add to that the purchase of shares by all directors over the course of the past year, and Excalibur might not be so easy to write off. The betting appears to be on something significant to release value in what is seen to be a respected engineering company: perhaps the sale of the giftware division. This would allow swingeing rationalisation of the jewellery operation and improve the debt position. When this happens, it might be worth taking a closer look at Excalibur. The value seems to be there, but it might be a bit too early to bet on it.</p>

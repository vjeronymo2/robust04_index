			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Esselte falls 19% to SKr205m ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, saw profits after financial items fall 19 per cent to SKr205m (Dollars 25.6m) in the first nine months as weak conditions continued to affect important markets. Group sales were up 18 per cent at SKr8.6bn, but excluding currency effects, they were down by 4 per cent from last year. The rise in third-quarter profits to SKr67m from SKr55m as well as the weak result in the last quarter of 1992 led the group to predict a better full-year result, in spite of poor demand and restructuring costs. It expects a 1993 profit of about SKr300m, which will be SKr41m higher than last year. The group said the market had been particularly weak in Spain, Belgium, Italy, France and Japan in the first nine months. However, there was some improvement in the UK, Norway and Finland, and a patchy recovery in the US. The group is restructuring its Pendaflex and Bensons divisions which both fell into the red during the period.</p>

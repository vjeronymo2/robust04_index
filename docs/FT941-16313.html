			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Gender latitude on pension schemes - European Court The European Court of Justice has ruled that it is not unlawful under European Union law for an employer to make differing contributions to a contributory pension scheme for male and female employees. The case concerned a Mr David Neath, who was made redundant at the age of 54 in 1990 after 17 years service with his employer, Hugh Steeper, a Leeds-based artificial limb manufacturer. During his employment, he had contributed to private occupational pension schemes. Although the employees' contributions to the schemes corresponded to a percentage of their salary which was the same irrespective of their sex, the employer's contributions differed for men and women because of the actuarial factors used. The scheme in question allowed men to claim a full pension at 65 and women at 60. On his redundancy, Mr Neath was entitled to have his acquired pension rights transferred to another pension scheme or to receive a deferred pension payable at 65. He could also convert part of the deferred pension into a capital sum. Mr Neath realised that his financial position would be better if the interpretation of the Court's judgment in the Barber case were that his pension could be recalculated on the same basis as his female counterparts for the entire period of his 17 years' service, rather than just for the six weeks subsequent to May 17 1990, the date of the Barber judgment. He also realised that, whatever the effects in time of the Barber judgment, the value of his pension in whatever form he took it would be lower than a female employee would have received because of the use of the actuarial factors based on the differing life expectancy of men and women. He brought an action before the Leeds Industrial Tribunal seeking the same pension rights as his female counterparts. The tribunal referred two issues to the European Court: the effect in time of the Barber judgment and the use of actuarial factors differing according to sex. The first issue was resolved in the Court's judgment of October 6 1993 in the Ten Oever case, where the Court held that the principle of equal pay should apply only to benefits payable in respect of periods of employment after May 17 1990, except in the case of claims initiated before that date. The Court in the present case reiterated this and added that the principle should also apply to transfer benefits and lump-sum options. On the second issue, the Court had to decide whether the fact that male employees would be entitled to less than their female counterparts because of the use of actuarial factors was compatible with EC equal pay rules. To decide this, the Court had to determine whether the transfer benefits and lump-sum options available to Mr Neath amounted to pay. The European Commission argued they should be treated as pay and that, thus, no differences in treatment based on sex could exist unless objectively justified. Statistical data based on the life expectancy of men and women were not objectively justified as they reflected averages, whereas the right to equal treatment was given to individual employees. The Court rejected this argument. It said the concept of pay encompassed the commitment given by an employer to pay an employee defined benefits or specific advantages. Anything outside that commitment did not constitute pay. In the context of an occupational pension scheme, the employer's commitment was the payment of a periodic pension at a particular moment in time. However, the commitment did not include the funding arrangements by which the periodic payment would be secured. Thus, an employer's contributions to a pension scheme which were unequal due to the use of different actuarial factors for men and women were not incompatible with EC equal pay rules. The Court ruled that this principle covered transfer benefits and lump-sum options, the value of which could be determined only by reference to the particular funding arrangements in question.

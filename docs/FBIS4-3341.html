			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 3 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The  construction of coastal shelter forests, one of China's key  forestry ecological engineering projects, is progressing  rapidly. At present, over 14,000 km of major continental  coastal forest shelter belts exist, forming a "Green Great Wall."    Since the beginning of the construction of China's coastal  shelter forest system in 1988, over 30 million mu of land has  been afforested in six years. Since 1991, in particular, the  speed of the construction of coastal forest shelter belts in  various localities has increased rapidly. In a span of three  years, 20 million mu of land has been afforested along more than  5,000 km of coastline.    Fujian, Hainan, and Qingdao are at the country's forefront  in  growing coastal shelter forests. On the basis of fulfilling the  task of the first phase project in growing coastal forest  shelter belts in 1992, Fujian Province began last year to  concentrate its efforts on expanding major coastal forest belts  and farmland forest nets, and has built a 3,100 km "Green Great  Wall" along the province's 3,300 km coastline. Hainan Province  has grown over 1,400 km of major forest belts along its more  than 1,500 km coastline.    The construction of the coastal shelter forest system has  greatly reduced the impact of typhoons, tidal waves, and  rainstorms, which occur several times a year, and has given  effective protection to 48 million mu of farmland. Half of the  counties on coastal plains have grown farmland forest nets and  one-third of the coastal mountain counties have grown trees on  all barren hills and mountains. This apparently has improved  the ecological environment, and even the investment environment  of coastal areas.</p>

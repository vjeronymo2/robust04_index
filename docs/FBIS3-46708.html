Under a draft of this plan, the six special cities under  direct central government control will become ordinary cities.  Pusan, Taegu, Inchon, Kwangju and Taejon will become local  administrative units like other cities, but Seoul, with a  population of more than 10 million, will be split into four  cities as the government thinks that it has grown too large to  administer effectively.    Several cities and counties will be merged for more  effective  administration because, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party  [DLP] says, the present system of stratified government is a  legacy of the authoritarian past.    Rep. Sin Sang-sik, chairman of the DLP ad hoc committee on  political affairs, says that his committee is reviewing a plan  to split Seoul into four cities.    The opposition Democratic Party is opposed to the DLP's plan  for Seoul's division, accusing the government party of resorting  to redistricting because it is unsure of victory in the 1995  mayoral election, the first in many years.    The opposition party objects less vociferously, however, to  the plan to rezone cities and counties to create integrated  urban-rural administrative units.    Rapid urbanization has made it almost impossible in many  places to draw a clear line between a rural and an urban area,  and this warrants the creation of integrated urban-rural  administrative units in some provinces.    In South Kyongsang Province, for example, Sin says, Miryang  City has a population of 70,000 and Miryang County a population  of 50,000, and it is hard to tell the city administration from  the county administration in this case.    "It's nonsense to separate Miryang City from Miryang County  and vice versa," he says.    This also applies to Kimhae City and Kimhae County in the  same province, according to Rep. Kim Yong-il, whose district it  is. He says a merger of the county into the city is desirable  for reduced administrative demands and for the convenience of  the residents.    Relatively large cities divided into wards (Ku) are not  targeted for merger with counties in the DLP plan. They are  Chonju, Ulsan, Puchon, Songnam, Suwon and Masan.    Small cities such as Chechon, Sokcho, Tonghae and Osan are  set for merger with adjacent counties.    Farmers in counties that merge with cities will continue to  receive government support, such as farming funds and  scholarship funds for their children, under the DLP plan.    The opposition party is giving an unfriendly look at the  DLP's local administrative reform plan, calling it  gerrymandering for victory in next year's local elections. In  particular, it strongly opposes Seoul's division, considering it  a plot to win the mayoral election.</p>

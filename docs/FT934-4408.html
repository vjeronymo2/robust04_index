			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: BellSouth challenges operating restrictions BellSouth, the largest of America's 'Baby Bell' regional telephone companies, yesterday filed a legal challenge to the proposed Dollars 12bn takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications, the wireless telephone group, by long-distance carrier American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.

Its motion was filed in the US district court in Washington, DC, before Judge Harold Greene, who presided over the 1982 anti-trust court case which led to the spin-off from AT&amp;T of the seven local 'Baby Bell' telephone companies. As part of the break-up, the Baby Bells were forbidden to operate in the long-distance market, while AT&amp;T was prevented from acquiring the stock or assets of a Baby Bell. BellSouth argues that the proposed McCaw takeover violates the anti-trust settlement because McCaw owns minority interests in several cellular properties where Baby Bells hold the majority stake. AT&amp;T dismisses this claim. BellSouth says it is prepared to support modifications to the anti-trust settlement, allowing the McCaw deal to proceed, provided that in return the Baby Bells are allowed to compete on equal terms with AT&amp;T in the wireless market. This would mean allowing them to send calls out of court-mandated local areas, as well as removing restrictions which force Bell companies to offer their wireless customers a choice of companies to handle their long-distance cellular traffic. 'Non-Bell companies can save money by combining all of their long-distance traffic to take advantage of volume discounts,' it said. 'This gives McCaw an enormous competitive advantage in the wireless market.'</p>

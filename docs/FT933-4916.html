			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Italians may stay in Mogadishu ITALY SAID it could delay the withdrawal of its troops from Mogadishu, the Somali capital, for areas to the north, after a United Nations request yesterday that the troops stay, Reuter reports from Rome. Defence Minister Fabio Fabbri told Italian state television 'the (withdrawal) could be delayed, but only by a few days. It will not be cancelled. Right now we are trying to define the conditions and the timing of an eventual delay.' Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, had asked Italy to delay its withdrawal following a weekend ambush in which seven Nigerian peacekeepers died, a government spokesman said. The Italians were due to quit Mogadishu at midnight yesterday after a row in June and July in which they were accused of taking orders from Rome rather than UN command. Italy is a former colonial power in Somalia.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott claims Labour election campaign hijacked THE open warfare over responsibility for Labour's election defeat flared again last night when Mr John Prescott repeated claims that the campaign had been hijacked by outsiders. The transport spokesman's charges were described as 'complete rubbish' by Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaigns co-ordinator. Ms Patricia Hewitt, a former aide to Mr Neil Kinnock now at the centre of the storm, also counter-attacked against the 'huge cowardice' of people refusing to take responsibility for decisions reached collectively by the leadership. Last night, Mr Stan Orme, Labour MP for Salford East, announced that he would not be seeking re-election as chairman of the parliamentary Labour party.</p>

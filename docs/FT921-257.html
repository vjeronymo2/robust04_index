			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Manufacturer switches plants: Machine Tools NOBLE &amp; LUND, one of the best-known companies in the UK machine tool industry, is to become mainly an assembly operation after more than 100 years of manufacturing. FMT Holdings, owner of Noble &amp; Lund, is transferring manufacture of the company's large gantry-type milling machines and aviation profiling machines to its base in Brighton, East Sussex. Sixty manufacturing jobs have been cut at Noble &amp; Lund, which is based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, leaving 50 assembly and design workers. The transfer is a response to the recession, which has reduced orders for Noble &amp; Lund. The company derives four fifths of its business from the UK, more than the average for the UK industry. Mr Mike Bright, FMT chairman, denied strongly that Noble &amp; Lund was to be closed. This year FMT - one of the few UK builders of machine tools that competes head-on with the Japanese in making flexible machining centres - cut 60 jobs at Brighton. Total employment has fallen from 400 in 1990 to 200. 'We must just hope that we see the end of the recession,' Mr Bright said. Mr Stephen LeBeau, a well-known figure in the UK machine tool industry, has left Yamazaki, one of the world's largest producers, after little more than a year as UK sales director. His unexpected departure was said to be by mutual consent. Yamazaki would not comment.</p>

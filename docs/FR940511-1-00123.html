If the proper fees are not submitted at the time of such filing, the authorized officer shall note the fees as being paid as of the date of the filing, provided that the claimant submits the proper fees within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer. Failure to submit the proper fees will cause the claims or sites to be forfeited by the claimant/owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) The Secretary will adjust the location and maintenance fees every five years, based upon the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor.

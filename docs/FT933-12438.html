			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Portuguese bank ahead at mid-term BANCO Comercial Portugues, one of Portugal's leading private banks, yesterday reported first-half net profits of Es9.6bn (Dollars 58.1m), a 2.3 per cent increase on the first six months of last year. The results reflected a 9 per cent increase in the second quarter after a negative result of 2.9 per cent during the first three months of 1993. Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP president, said the sustained growth in the volume of remunerated assets supported by a broadening of the base of depositors, a satisfactory evolution of commissions and the recuperation of the bank's financial margin after the devaluation of the escudo all played a positive role in the results. The bank's cash flow reached Es27.7bn during the first six months of 1993, up 9.2 per cent on the same period the previous year. The contribution of subsidiary companies to the first-half results increased to 22.4 per cent this year from 13.7 per cent of the total in the first six months of 1992. Net earnings per share reached Es88 during the first half of 1993. Return on assets was 1.2 per cent and the net profitability of own capital was 12.3 per cent. The bank's financial margin rose to 4.7 per cent.</p>

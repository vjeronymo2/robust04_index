			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (2): More talk than action  -Barry Riley doubts if there is a vogue for specialist managers THE OSTENSIBLE rise and rise of specialist pension fund managers in the UK has been one of the major themes of the institutional investment business in the past few years. Certainly one or two major pension funds have hired a string of specialists. Rolls-Royce is one famous example, with 14 managers listed for the Pounds 1.2bn fund. IBM UK, in the American way, has 10 to manage Pounds 1.1bn. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that in general there has been a lot more talk than action. According to one of the two main performance measurement firms, Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps), only 40 of the 1,495 UK pension schemes it measured last year were managed primarily on a specialist basis. It is true that they were larger than average, but even so they represented only some 8 per cent of the total assets. The average number of separate managers was four. One of the leading balanced pension fund management companies, Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, carried out its own survey of the trend towards specialisation last year. It focused on the big funds, with a median size among respondents of Pounds 300m. About a third of these big funds turned out to be using a specialist formula of one kind or another. But only for funds worth more than Pounds 500m did the average number of managers rise to three. Hiring specialist managers to maximise performance is most logical in the more esoteric areas such as emerging markets, venture capital and direct property investment, but arguably rather less so in UK equities or global bonds where balanced managers are expected to have reasonable levels of expertise. From the other side of the fence, many management houses are quite keen to promote their specialist expertise when their records in balanced management are no longer of a top quartile quality. For instance, Lazards is one of a number of City merchant banks which have faded in the balanced fund management business but which is still active in international equity management for a variety of private and institutional clients. It is thus emphasising a good track record in continental European equities as the basis for winning specialist mandates from UK pension funds. But competition is fierce. A wide variety of managers is focusing on the potential of the UK pension fund business. Overseas contenders such as JP Morgan, Swiss Bank Corporation and Lombard-Odier are promoting themselves as specialist operators to the trustees of UK pension funds. Domestically, too, the Pounds 300bn pension fund business is an obvious target for managers who have succeeded in other areas. For example Perpetual, the unit trust company, is at present gearing itself up to attack the pension fund market, primarily on the basis of specialist equity mandates. Mr Bruce Mackintosh, a marketing consultant to Perpetual, says the company is seeking to bring its expertise in unit trusts to bear on another area of business. But he recognises that it will take three to five years to get on the short lists of the pension consultants. One reason why the trend towards specialist management has been so slow is that the asset allocation responsibility - covering the split of assets between, say, UK and overseas assets, bonds cash and property - has to be handled some other way, rather than being bundled up within a balanced mandate. Mr Anthony Steel, who runs an asset allocation boutique called Advice on Investment Strategy, has for the past four years or so been trying to fill this very gap. After all, he says: 'The specialist route puts an asset allocation responsibility on the pension fund's trustees which they don't feel they can handle.' He provides a panel of assorted experts who meet periodically, and he claims that their advice has potentially added between 1 and 2 per cent a year, on the basis of quarterly rebalancing recommendations (though whether clients take the advice in practice is up to them). But does specialisation really work, in the sense of adding performance? Caps has done some calculations which suggest that there is not a lot in it. Last year the specialists slightly underperformed balanced managers in UK and overseas equities, but outperformed in the less important categories of UK fixed interest, property and index-linked gilts. Caps refuses to come to any overall conclusions about performance because it says that schemes which have adopted a specialist structure have often done so as a result of asset/liability modelling exercises, so allocations may have been decided very largely on grounds other than the maximisation of performance. Crude figures for overall performance could therefore be misleading. Meanwhile the asset allocation problem is being tackled in various ways. At Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management Mr Lindsay Tomlinson, a specialist in quantitative management, says that risk-averse trustees (often those who have picked several unsuccessful balanced active managers in the past) are going for specialist index funds plus a consensus asset allocation formula. That is, they seek to copy what everybody else is doing as precisely but as cheaply as possible. At the same time, various quantitative models are being promoted, though US-style switches between bonds and equities are less relevant to UK funds which regard themselves as scarcely investors in bonds at all. A new London boutique, Allingham Anderson, offers techniques for hedging the risks between various asset classes, using the derivative markets. It has a formula for achieving a return in line with the best asset class over a defined period - in effect, a more refined and less risky version of portfolio insurance, which came unstuck on Wall Street during the October 1987 crash. Whether the UK pension fund market is ready for such techniques yet is doubtful. It seems that for the time being specialisation, with the extra responsibilities it implies for trustees, will be more widely discussed than practised.</p>

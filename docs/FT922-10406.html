			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Arts: Big three for Covent Garden The three tenors, Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras will all sing at the Royal Opera House next season in different productions, with Pavarotti opening the new season on September 12 in Tosca, opera director Paul Findlay announced yesterday. He added that two of these performances will be shown free on the open-air screen in Covent Garden in order to to satisfy the growing demand for opera in Britain. Placido Domingo will be joined by Kiri Te Kanawa in Otello during October, while Jose Carreras will take the lead in Verdi's Stiffelio in January 1993.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION  </P> <P> I can't believe how shortsighted everyone -- young and old, rich and poor -- is  on the subject of education.  </P> <P> No one seems to realize that no matter if children are black, brown, yellow or  white, they are the future of this nation -- our nation. A few children from  private schools cannot run an entire nation. Maybe instead of worrying about  who and how many, we need to concentrate on educating all as best as possible.  After all, as I was told by my daughter's kindergarten teacher, the only fair  is in Pomona. Let's stop worrying about "equality" and concentrate on "quality  education." Maybe this approach will make for more equality.  </P> <P> NANCY SCHWAB  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

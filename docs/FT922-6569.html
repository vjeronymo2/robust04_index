			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y offers safeguards to fend off creditors OLYMPIA &amp; York has offered its creditors financial safeguards aimed at thwarting their efforts to unravel the court order which has frozen the troubled developer's Canadian debt obligations. An O&amp;Y lawyer urged an Ontario court yesterday not to make any exemptions from the order granted last week under Canada's Companies Creditors Arrangements Act. If the restructuring of O&amp;Y's USDollars 12bn debt is to have any chance of success, he said, creditors must be kept at bay and no creditor should be given an advantage. In return, O&amp;Y has proposed to identify all revenues and expenses according to the asset to which they relate, and to set up separate bank accounts for each asset. Administrative and restructuring costs of the parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments, would be allocated on a proportionate basis among the various assets. O&amp;Y made its offer in response to a slew of motions submitted by disgruntled creditors, represented by about 40 lawyers. These will be considered at hearings next Thursday and Friday. The lenders' main concern is to prevent any 'co-mingling' of funds between O&amp;Y's Canadian operations, and its businesses in the US and Britain, which are not subject to court protection. A motion by Bank of Nova Scotia could stall the proposed sale later this month of O&amp;Y's 18 per cent interest in Santa Fe Pacific, the Chicago-based railway and mining company. In addition, holders of securities backed by individual buildings are seeking exemption from the CCAA order to enable them to seize rents in lieu of overdue interest. Mr Bernard Wilson, the Price Waterhouse partner appointed as a liaison between O&amp;Y and its lenders, assured creditors in an affidavit that he expected to be able to review revenues and expenses on each property, 'and the application of any excess'. The court ordered Mr Wilson to provide cash-flow projections on specific O&amp;Y assets by next Monday. He is due to present his first full report to the lenders on June 15, and at monthly intervals after that. Although lawyers for the banks responded cautiously to O&amp;Y's proposals, several described them as a step in the right direction. Meanwhile, O&amp;Y and some of its bank lenders have joined forces to prevent disgruntled commercial paper-holders from forming a committee to press their claims. The paper is secured by Exchange Tower, a 36-storey building in Toronto. O&amp;Y has failed to conclude a sale-and-leaseback deal on the building which would have allowed it to redeem about CDollars 150m in outstanding commercial paper. It emerged at a five-hour meeting in Toronto that the company and several of its bank lenders hold substantial quantities of the commercial paper themselves. Other holders, including Merrill Lynch, the securities firm, were unable to muster the two-thirds majority necessary to form the committee.</p>

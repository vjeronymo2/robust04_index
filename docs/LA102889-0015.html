			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TED MALONE; PRESENTED RADIO'S 'BOOKENDS' POETRY  </P> <P> Ted Malone, who filled the airwaves reading poetry and offering homespun  philosophy in the early 1930s on his "Between the Bookends" series, died Oct.  20, it was learned this week.  </P> <P> Malone was 81 when he died in Stratford, Conn., of liver cancer.  </P> <P> He was heard over four decades on many local and national radio stations, but  it was "Bookends," which went on the air in the late 1920s, that made his name  famous.  </P> <P> Malone, actually, was not his name.  </P> <P> He was born Frank Alden Russell and grew up in Missouri, where he studied at  William Jewell College in Liberty. There he won first prize in a speaking  contest.  </P> <P> The manager of Kansas City radio station KMBC offered him a job as an announcer  and ukulele player. One day in the late 1920s a hillbilly act failed to show up  and young Russell was told to go before the microphone and read poetry to kill  time.  </P> <P> He was so embarrassed that he asked that his real name not be used, and another  announcer introduced him as "Ted Malone." But his reading of William Cullen  Bryant's "Thanatopsis" produced a flood of favorable mail. In 1935 CBS picked  up the show nationally and it ran across the country from two to five times a  week for the next 30 years.  </P></p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Austrian letter bomb campaign The discovery of three letter bombs in Austria this week has sharpened tensions in the country over immigration only four days before a national election. None of the packages, delivered to a Slovenian publisher in Klagenfurt, a foreigners' advice centre and a paper factory in Tyrol, exploded. Mr Franz Loschnak, the interior minister, said the bombs were similar to those sent last December to prominent figures associated with refugee and immigration issues. Mr Helmut Zilk, the mayor of Vienna, lost a thumb and two fingers when one exploded in his hands. Mr Loschnak said investigations of the latest letter bombs indicated neo-Nazis might be responsible. 'From notes enclosed with the bombs it is clear that this action is motivated by hatred of foreigners and that it is more likely to come from right-wing extremists,' he told Austrian state television.</p>

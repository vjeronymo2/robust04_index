			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Green light begins to flash for recyclable cars in Germany: The environment industry is backing plans to make cars 85 per cent re-usable by 2002. After years of debate, German carmakers and environmentalists are nearing a showdown about how to recycle cars. The result is likely to have implications across the European Union. Since the late-1980s talks have often take place but have always stopped short of solutions. Several carmakers have been working on models designed to optimise recycling and increasingly cars are designed to include the maximum number of recyclable items. Following a recent meeting between the two sides - the environment ministry on the one hand and the car industry and economics ministry on the other - carmakers are hard at work. By the end of 1995 they hope to have created a network of dealers which will recover the approximately 2.5m cars taken out of service in Germany every year. The dealers will take them apart and sell the parts or pass them on to the carmakers which have agreed to make use of what is left over. The industry is under considerable pressure to come up with a solution: waste sites are filling up and Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, is eager to extend the ambit of his Kreislaufwirtschaft, a set of laws designed to create an economy where virtually everything can be re-used. Many cars are already up to 75 per cent recyclable and BMW, for instance, prides itself on its new 7 series BMW which is 85 per cent re-usable. What is missing is a nationwide system to collect and process the cars. The 15 associations which belong to the motor industry, including companies making steel, glass and plastic, are now drawing up plans to create such a system where recycling sites will be no further than 80km away from each other. By 2002 all cars are to be 85 per cent recyclable and by 2015 only 5 per cent of the car's weight will be left on rubbish dumps, according to a plan submitted by the carmakers' association. BMW is working with the environmental services subsidiaries of Thyssen, Preussag and Klockner to build a nationwide network of recyclers - similar to a dealer chain - which would take over the cars and, most importantly, break them up according to accepted environmental standards. There is an abundance of horror stories about how cars are disposed of. Sometimes the petrol tank is filled with engine oils and, on other occasions, the car boot is piled high with used tyres. These are just two examples where people have delivered their cars for recycling and thrown in other waste for good measure, says Mr Wilhelm Kallweit, of Thyssen Sonnenberg, the Thyssen subsidiary which specialises in environmental technology. Under the new regulations the petrol, oils, brake fluid and coolant will be collected in separate containers which are taken away by specialist companies. Tyres, batteries and glass are already removed when cars are recycled but in future safety belts, bumpers and door pockets will also be taken back by the carmakers. These are working on technology which would allow them to re-use bumpers as the lining for car boots and door pockets as the ledges under the rear windscreen. Companies such as BMW will also supply computer software which can identify exactly what materials were used to build a 1960 model, enabling recyclers to sort left-overs more efficiently. Engineers are also working on thermal technology which could break down other compounds found in cars. But at the moment a residue - 15 per cent in the case of the new 7 series BMW - is left over. 'The rest simply ends on waste collection sites,' says Mr Wilhelm Pottinger, who heads the recycling unit at BMW. Much remains to be done. Thyssen Sonnenberg is for the first time working on a model to identify exactly how much time is needed to take a car apart. Previously costs have been impossible to calculate because there were no environmental standards to speak of and the job was done in such a haphazard manner. The biggest bone of contention is the price. The motor industry wants the car's last owner to pay the estimated DM200 (Pounds 82.60) it will cost to break down the car and dispose of its parts. Competition among recyclers would keep the costs down and a possible rebate for drivers would encourage them to keep their cars in the best possible condition, says Mr Alfred Brode, a spokesman for BMW. The environment ministry, however, is not convinced and is pushing for a higher new car price which would reflect the recycling costs. 'We want to force the carmakers to think more about how they can use more of the car for recycling purposes,' says Mr Martin Waldhausen, a spokesman for the environment ministry. While industry is working to improve recycling capabilities, companies believe they will not be able to do it all themselves. 'The government must force people to recycle their cars,' says Mr Brode, referring to proposals which would require people to prove that they have taken their car to a licensed recycler before they can cancel their registration. The German plans are being extended across Europe. BMW signed an agreement with Renault and Fiat in April which obliges all three companies to take and recycle their partners' cars abroad. However, Mr Waldhausen is not optimistic that industry will make enough progress before early next year. 'There have been a lot of fine words but little of it is actual substance.' As car prices are politically sensitive and elections are looming, the environment ministry has said it will wait until early next year to see if the carmakers and the economics ministry can hammer out a workable scheme. If too much remains just talk, the environment ministry has vowed to force through laws to create a car recycling system.</p>

Today you and I have a dialogue with Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk,  president of the Republic of Ukraine. He is in the television  studio in Kiev. Good afternoon Mr. President!    [Kravchuk] Hello!    [Skryabin] We are happy to have you on our program. [passage  omitted]    I think that the Institute of Sociological Research, headed  by Professor Sokolov, is also taking part in our program today.  The fact of the matter is that today we are using sociological  research carried out here in Moscow in March and I think it will  serve our program well. I would like to say that the  sociological research which was carried out was devoted to the  theme "Russia and Ukraine -- their joint situation -- public  assessment of information and expectations."    Before putting a question to you, Mr. President, I would  like to draw attention to two problems worrying the public in  connection with the poll carried out by the Institute of  Sociological Research. The first is the lack of information on  the situation in Ukraine. In particular, according to the data,  more than one-third of all those polled said they lacked  information and the majority of those polled -- 55 percent --  think that the Russian mass media are not very objective about  life in Ukraine, or simply carries distorted reports about it.  I think that our meeting today will allow that problem to be  resolved.    And the second problem is the public's great concern about  relations between Russia and Ukraine. If you don't mind, Mr.  President, I think that we will devote our conversation today to  this problem.    Allow me to begin by trying to find out how you regard the  stereotypes that exist today in Ukraine and Russia; stereotypes  that on the whole are held to be true by people. We would like  to know your point of view. Well, the first and main one is  connected with the economy.    The fact of the matter is that sociological research showed  that the state of Ukraine's economy, especially as far as  Muscovites -- 65 percent -- are concerned, is seen as  catastrophic, or very serious, while only eight percent think  that there is a tendency for it to improve. [passage omitted]    [Kravchuk] There is no doubt that Ukraine's economic  situation is serious. There are no doubts about that. We  realize that ourselves, as do the government, the Supreme  Council, and the authorities in the localities. But the main  question probably is: Is the Ukraine's economy really as bad as  its made out to be, and is Ukraine the only state of the former  USSR where things are worse than everywhere else? And that lack  of information has a good deal to do with that view. I will not  give any figures but any unbiased visitor to Ukraine if he  visits our shops today, not just in Kiev but in the oblasts,  will see that there is a choice of sausage, meat, dairy  products, groats, and pasta. Well, prices are another matter.  But there is a choice, in the first place. In the second  place, these are Ukrainian-produced goods. But if you live  nearer Moscow you can visit the squares in front of the city's  stations and its markets -- which I happen to know very well --  you will see an awful lot of Ukrainian products, of foodstuffs  there. And I naturally ask the question: Is a poor people, or a  people which are hungry, as it is sometimes made out to be, able  to fill not just its own shops, but also Russia's markets and  the squares in front of its stations.    Therefore, I think this stereotype appeared about a year  ago.  Yes, indeed, it is true, a year ago, the shelves of the shops in  many regions of Ukraine were practically empty because a pricing  and subsidy system was not developed. But that question has  been taken off the agenda for now. There are two questions now:  Prices and wages, but not food products. There are food  products. That is why this stereotype is still around and they  are still hanging on to it. Therefore, I would say: If there are  any doubts here, take the television cameras into our shops and  then you can see what things are like, if Ukraine is hungry  today or not. That is a short reply.    But there are more profound questions -- questions of  economic reform, questions of the transition to new economic  relations, market reform, financial and credit reform, banking  reform. But these questions are all so complex and difficult  that they will take time, and these questions of reform are just  as complex and difficult for all states of the former Soviet  Union, including for Russia, too. Therefore, unless there are  some other aims, I think it is simply unjustified to single out  Ukraine today.    [Skryabin] Leonid Makarovych, you will, I hope, agree that  perhaps the sorest problem both for Ukraine and for Russia is  the disruption of economic ties. [passage omitted] What do you  think about this situation?    [Kravchuk] One should first answer the question of what ties  we are talking about here. If people say that all the ties that  formerly existed should be reestablished, this cannot be done,  because many enterprises in both Russia and Ukraine that were  previously linked with such ties either no longer exist, or have  switched to new output, so it is impossible. I advocate  strengthening ties, but on a new basis, on new principles.    Let us just take a look at these principles. Who is it who  should establish ties -- President Yeltsin and President  Kravchuk -- or the enterprises and collectives themselves?  Collectives that have an interest in establishing ties have  already got them going -- and long since, at that.    Secondly, what should the state do to develop, expand, and  strengthen ties? It must create the conditions for that to  happen. In Ukraine, for example, we have abolished all customs  duties on goods being exported from Ukraine. We have suggested  to Russia setting up a free trade zone. Russia has not as yet  accepted this. It has opted for most favorable status, but with  certain goods exempted, namely gas, oil, nonferrous metals,  timber, and some others. So we get a sort of cut-off zone.    For our part, we did not initiate setting up a customs  barrier, nor creating any sort of obstacles. Let us be quite  frank about this, it is the sorest point at the moment. If we,  today, are advocating a single market or a common market within  the context of the CIS, then we certainly support that. But for  this to come about, conditions have to be equal. If today, for  example, the Russian consumer buys oil at 30 percent less than  oil costs the Ukrainian consumer, and the same thing applies to  gas -- how can Ukrainian manufacturers withstand the competition  in this common market that it is proposed we should set up? In  order to strengthen ties and develop good relations, identical  common conditions must be created. Customs policy, taxation  policy, pricing policy, and other forms must all be coordinated,  just as is done in all civilized countries. But when this is not  done because each state pursues its own interests -- I am not  singling out Ukraine as being the most reticent here, so to  speak -- if each state pursues its own goals and at the same  time chants the slogan, let us join together, then no one has  ever managed this before, nor will anyone do so now. That is why  I advocate that it should be the collectives who strengthen  ties, on the basis of the new situation in their work and life;  and that states should create the conditions for it, including  by accords between states -- Ukraine, incidentally, has signed  almost all the documents that have been put forward within the  context of the CIS and also in relations between Russia. This  removes all the problems and questions. It will neither concern  the government nor the president, it will be the concern of the  collective that has an interest in the market, the ties, and in  ensuring normal payments.    [Semenov] Then why do you occupy such a restrained and  cautious position regarding economic union?    [Kravchuk] I will tell you. Economic union should openly  specify to the whole people the principles of its development.  To demonstrate this, I will touch upon the following issue: a  single ruble zone. Russia, as a center of gravity -- which is  natural -- and also as the initiator of setting up a single  ruble zone, should say openly what the principles of joining the  single ruble zone are. What will the states which will join the  single ruble zone lose or win economically, politically, etc.?  Moreover, this should be said openly. And then each person  would decide whether it will develop as an independent state on  the basis on its own currency and relations between states  develop in the framework of equality and partnership, or whether  there will be a single ruble zone, single currency, single  financial and banking system, and then one should forget about  independence. The people should not be deceived.    Look at the practice. Why did Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan  refuse the single ruble zone? Because a general phrase was  written: A single ruble zone. It should be clearly stated: What  are the motives of the national bank, or the Russian bank? What  are the motives of the Finance Ministry? What has to be given  up, what should be gained? Then I will say to my people:  Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, this is the option you are being  offered -- openly and honestly. If you are in favor, then go  ahead -- with or without me, enter the zone. But when this is  done with eyes closed, when they say first you sign and then we  specify, the result is that some people enter and then leave.  Surely, it is this that has led to such complexities with  Belarus -- because there is not absolute clarity.    Therefore, I have said before and I am say now: We should  define our position, whether we will build an independent state  based on the principles of good-neighborliness, friendship and  partnership, helping each other, or whether we will unite in a  single state with a single ruble, a single bank, single  taxation, and single customs. We should ask the people.    At present, I base my opinions on the fact that 92 percent  of  Ukraine's people voted for independence. One should ask the  people: What do you want? We cannot rely on the people and, on  the other hand, decide these issues without the people at  somebody else's will.    There should be clarity and openness, inter alia regarding  Belovezhskaya Pushcha. This is also one of the stereotypes.  The Soviet Union did not disintegrate in Belovezhskaya Pushcha.  This happened before Belovezhskaya Pushcha. The final decision  was not taken in Belovezhskaya Pushcha but in Almaty, in the  Almaty Declaration, but nobody admits this. By the way, as for  Belovezhskaya Pushcha, not only the presidents, but also the  prime ministers signed the documents there. One prefers to  forget this because one wants to find who is to blame, but those  who are to blame were before the event. Believe me, they were  not in Ukraine.    [Skryabin] Thank you very much. Leonid Makarovych,  speaking about Belovezhskaya Pushcha, if our Ostankino  Television prepares a program connected with Belovezhskaya  Pushcha within the framework of Live Dialogue, are you prepared  to take part in it?    [Kravchuk] Yes, absolutely! Quite a bit of time has passed  since the Soviet Union collapsed and since the time of  perestroyka and it is time to tell the people how that process  developed, who stood on the path of that process, as one of our  leaders used to say, and who enabled all that happened to  happen. And most importantly, did we have another way out? Was  it people's will or was it an objective and natural process? I  think that it was an objective and natural process of  disintegration. But were we able to go through that natural  process as subjects, in accordance with will and reason, or were  mistakes made and who made the mistakes and why? People must be  told because myths and illusions around that and the search for  guilty parties in the form of several people have gone too far  already, and some zealous participants in that process are now  making themselves out to be super-internationalists and they  pass over in smiling silence their participation in that. I am  not accusing anyone. I repeat, that was a natural process and  by that disintegration we stopped the whole thing collapsing --  that is objectively -- but nevertheless, since things have gone  so far, people must be told the truth. [passage omitted]    [Telen] Mr. President, I regret having to interrupt that  interesting conversation about Belovezhskaya Pushcha, but since  we have agreed to make a separate program on it, I will return  to the economy, to economics, and politics. You were quite  right when you said that the economy is closely linked to  politics today and often is based on politics, but as long as  the economic situation, in particular, in Ukraine is so serious,  there is always the chance that another state, not necessarily  Russia, will use economic pressure for political aims. There  has been much talk of that in various situations, both with  regard to Russia and to Ukraine, in particular, the recent gas  situation, with Ukraine's debt to the Russian Gazprom.  [passage omitted] What do you think? Can Russia use economic  sanctions for political ends? Is that a reality? And do you  see such a danger for Ukraine?    [Kravchuk] There are a number of complex aspects for me. The  first is that gas and oil must be paid for. And in Ukraine  today, the following situation has taken shape: Since we have no  real possibilities of accumulating hard currency because Russia  does not buy in great quantities the goods that are being sold  to it. I am speaking about Russian enterprises. For instance,  a Russian enterprise can wait to buy a KRAZ [truck made at the  Kremenchug automobile works] for a six months or a year, whereas  gas is an everyday necessity. In other words, we cannot  accumulate hard currency in selling our goods to Russia today.  There are no quotas on the European market. So we have a  product, but we cannot sell it and accumulate hard currency.  Therefore, it is not possible to pay for gas and oil in a  timely manner. What can I say if there are not any payments?  The tap can always be turned off. That can always be dished up  as pressure, anything you like, and the following explanation  can be given: You are not paying, we are not supplying you.  Therefore, there is a problem here, and we are now making every  effort to mobilize forces, reserves, resources, or by other  means, to accumulate hard currency and to settle with Gazprom.  But I have a question, too. The gas could have been turned off  on 26 February. There were no payments there either, but for  some reason it was turned off on 3 March while I was in the  United States. I cannot explain why it happened like that --  for it is probably no coincidence, people say. That is the  question! Some are always exploiting the time, political, or  economic factors to create problems around it. I think we will  find a solution -- there is no doubt -- and relations will be  normal, payments will be normal. Ukraine is not a poor state.  It will settle up. Incidentally, we owe everyone today -- we  owe the West -- and the West deferred loan and interest  payments. When normal interests and the prospect for relations  are taking into account, all factors are taken into account and  the main factor is our future, our good relations with our  neighbor, with people with whom we lived for 340 years together  with one territorial integrity, lived in the Soviet Union,  shared sorrows and difficulties and good times. Therefore, I  would refrain from having only mercantile relations now or  taking advantages of difficulties with Ukraine. Ukraine will  not be a debtor. It will settle up -- if not today, then  tomorrow.    [Semenov] Leonid Makarovych, there is another moral and  political aspect. Is Ukraine in a position to guarantee fully  that Russian gas and oil reach Europe? You know there have been  some unpleasant situations.    [Kravchuk] The position is this. We have now set up a  working group, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk,  which together with local administrations has placed the passage  of gas and oil under the strictest supervision. We believe that  this is absolutely unacceptable, and believe me, I am convinced  of that. If anyone is doing this, or does it in the future, he  will be called to account.    [Semenov] [Passage omitted] Recently a sort of diplomatic,  perhaps friendly or unfriendly triangle has become established,  namely Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. What is the role  of the United States here, in your view? Is it serving to  reconcile us, to remind us of our old friendship, or will we  perhaps feel ashamed in front of the United States and come to  agreement without its help?    [Skryabin] Well, if I can approach this from another angle,  it has been said that America is our new friend. Is this not in  some way the loss of our old friend Russia?    [Kravchuk, laughing] Well, I reckon it is like this: The  fact  is that we have all been brought up on a specific sort of  ideology, an ideology that declared all bourgeois, capitalist  countries to be our enemies. Now, of course, even some friends  are difficult to interpret, But I think the more friends the  better. In any case, I am convinced that America will lay no  claims to Ukraine, whether territorial or any other. The fact  that we are establishing ties with the United States, France, or  Great Britain does not mean this is detrimental to Russia.    I have said before and I am saying now: our relations with  Russia have a special status. These are relations of  partnership, friendship, and good-neighborliness. There is no  other way for Ukraine or Russia. Historically and objectively  and, if you prefer it, subjectively, this friendship is at the  level of everyday life. If, for example, we are talking of  friendship with the United States at the level of government  structures, at state level, here it is at the level of people,  border areas and families who have friends and relatives or  children. It became integrated at the level of everyday life.    I can see that Russia seems to be jealous, as if the fact  that Ukraine is making friends and establishing good relations  with others will be at Russia's expense. I even like this. It  looks as if Russians love Ukrainians very much and they do not  want to let them go because of their friendly feelings.    But I would like to see one thing: so that this love should  be expressed in some concrete steps with regard to Ukraine -- in  providing aid in the economic reform and in the reform of the  political system. In mitigating those harsh processes that are  under way in our country, inevitable as they are. In solving  calmly and equitably the problems of nuclear weapons, of the  Black Sea fleet, and everything connected with these. If this  love, these good relations, are expressed in such concrete  steps, then this love can only be to the benefit of us alive  today, and of those who will be living tomorrow and the day  after tomorrow, for we have to live on the same planet, live and  be friends, as the saying goes, and we cannot avoid that. There  is no other option, no alternative. Only hotheads can think  otherwise. Those Russian Federation citizens who often brand  the official authority, including the president, as virtually  nationalist, because he pursues this policy, should reflect.    This, too, is a stereotype of the same ideology. If somebody  speaks in favor of an independent state, nothing more is  required. If he is in favor of independent Ukraine he is a  nationalist but if he is against independent Ukraine he is an  internationalist and is most welcome, that is the point. But  then the following question could be asked: If a Russian speaks  in favor of independent Russia who is he? This question is  somehow avoided. We should not, therefore, be guided by  stereotypes in our life. We have risen to a new plane, new  philosophy, new ideology, and we should rid ourselves gradually,  step by step, of nationalism, chauvinism, or national-patriotism  which, I am convinced, can only lead to confrontation, not to  good relations.    [Semenov] But for love to blossom it should be reciprocal,  Leonid Makarovych, do you agree?    [Kravchuk] Certainly. I cannot, therefore, give you any  example saying that there is no reciprocal love on the Ukrainian  part. When the Russian Supreme Soviet, contrary to common  sense, adopts a decision on the status of Sevastopol and sends  its people to the Crimea to stir up separatist moods, believe  me, Ukraine is not sending anyone to Rostov or Tatarstan or  other republics to create difficulties there. And now tell me  who loves whom reciprocally: the one who wants to interfere in  the other's territorial affairs -- and I find this very  difficult to explain -- or the one who bends. Or do you want us  to bend over backward? One should understand that a person has  a limit, he has honor which is above all, beyond which economic  and other problems become of secondary importance. It is how  people are.    [Skryabin] Thank you very much. Leonid Makarovych, I would  like to refer to the findings of the Institute of Sociological  Research of Professor Sokolov again. It also is about  stereotypes. The majority of Muscovites who were polled in the  survey are very negative about your political course. Fifty-six  percent think that you follow a policy of isolation and  separatism and are a Ukrainian nationalist.    [Kravchuk, laughing] Well, what did I say!    [Skryabin] But I think that Yevgeniy Andreyvich (Ushakov)  from Moscow is right when he says that he hopes there are people  in the leadership of Ukraine today who are as wise as Bogdan  Khmelnitskiy [17th century Ukrainian leader], who understand  that only a close union between the people of Russia and  Ukraine, a union without ambition, will bring calm and  prosperity to these peoples.    [Kravchuk] I completely agree. But there is just one thing.  The nature of that union must be determined. You know there are  calls at the moment in our country -- the pre-election campaign  is underway -- some say we are for union with Russia, for the  creation of a single credit and banking system, for the creation  of a single monetary system. Down with the frontiers! Down  with the customs! Down with everything! But we say: For an  independent and self- sufficient Ukraine. I want to ask: Is  this logical and do these actions and ideas go together?  Therefore, there is no need to deceive the people! I said that  right at the outset. Let us determine what the economic union  will be like, what the ruble zone, the nonruble zone will be  like, let us tell the people and then let the people decide what  it should give back and what it should take. But to simply make  declarations will bring only confrontation.    I was and will be a supporter of friendship, neighborliness,  and partnership with Russia not because it is my particular  opinion but because this is what history dictates. That is the  crux of the matter. But let us channel everything else not  dictated by history into a civilized framework, along the lines  of good relations, mutual understanding, partnership, equality,  and then all the problems will disappear. Believe me, if  somebody wants to dictate and somebody else is to be  subordinate, the problems will not go away.    [Telen] Mr. President, then let us go on to the problem of  elections. We know that Ukraine has embarked upon the final  part of the pre-election campaign -- I mean parliamentary  elections. The presidential elections are ahead and...    [Skryabin, interrupting] And the local soviet elections...    [Telen, continues] And the local soviet elections, too.  Relations between Ukraine and Russia are one of the central  questions of the pre-election campaign. But I would like to ask  you about something else. It is known that around 70 percent of  the electorate intend to take part in the first round of the  parliamentary elections -- that is quite a big figure -- but  according to forecasts by many Ukrainian specialists, the matter  will not be decided at the first round of voting, since there  are too many candidates for every deputy's seat and it is quite  likely that parliament will not be elected at these elections.  Tell us please, how do you forecast the situation if parliament  is not elected as a result of the first and second round of  voting? What will the situation in Ukraine be like?    [Kravchuk] I would like parliament to be elected, that is  the first thing, and that wise, calm and professionally trained  politicians, people capable of resolving domestic and external  problems in line with international principles and the interests  of their people enter parliament. This is my profound wish and  conviction. There are really around over 5,000 candidates for  450 seats. That works out about 12 people per constituency. It  is unlikely that this problem will be resolved in the first  round. The second round is more difficult from the legal point  of view: 50 percent turnout is required and over 25 percent are  required to vote.    There will be difficulties. But if parliament is not  elected, a parliamentary crisis could arise because some  deputies will be elected and it cannot be ruled out that one  deputy could hold a seat in an old constituency, another in a  new constituency and it will be difficult to manage that  situation. But elections to local bodies of power and  presidential elections in June still lie ahead. Unless all of  that is decided in March or April, I fear that a power vacuum  could be formed and then we will have to take some kind of  extraordinary decisions. I think we will be able to decide that  problem within the framework of democracy, within the framework  of the interests of the state so as not to bury the state, not  to allow executive structures of power to disintegrate. We have  bodies of power in the localities, there are presidential  structures, there are local soviets. I think that we can and  will be able to run the state with the help of these structures,  having decided the question here in the center in accordance in  the interests of both the people and the state.    [Telen] Mr. President, can presidential elections be  postponed given the complicated situation?    [Kravchuk] Well, you see, I would not like to initiate this  because some people could view this as my desire to put off  elections. It was me who proposed early elections of both  parliament and president. But today, according to my  information from localities and leaders of different ranks and  the letters and telegrams that keep arriving, first, time limits  are very compressed, second, it will be summer, harvesting will  be underway. And then, people say that if the parliament issue  is not settled, if the parliament fails to adopt two important  laws, on local power structures and their functions, plenary  powers and interaction with the central authorities, and if a  new law on presidency is not adopted -- because the current law  defines the president as head of state and executive authority  and also defines relevant functions and plenary powers -- then  the elections can be not simply inexpedient but even dangerous  to a degree because a power vacuum will set in. The central  bodies of authorities will have no influence over local bodies  of authority, because there will be no law to regulate these  relations. So people notice this, they are worried and are  asking to postpone these elections until these two laws are  adopted and to hold the elections at a more convenient time.  Well, I cannot solve this problem on my own.    [Skryabin] Incidentally, Leonid Makarovych, your view fits  in with those of our viewers. [passage omitted]    [Kravchuk] Yes, there is concern, I feel it, too, in  telegrams, letters, or telephone calls that are received not  only by my office but by other structures, too, including the  Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Council. In other words,  the people are alarmed. But since there is alarm and  uncertainty, which is undeniable, all this should be solved in  such a way that the management of the state, the state itself,  and its independence do not suffer in the process. [passage  omitted]    [Semenov] I know that preventing any form of bloodshed in  Ukraine is your political priority. At the same time, you have  declared the holding of referendum in Crimea illegal. It will,  however, be held, most probably. What actions can you take? I  can hardly imagine.    [Kravchuk] You see, here we have the following problem. I  agree with Andrey Georgiyevich [Skryabin] that if we start  arguing today about who owns Crimea this argument will be very  difficult to bring to a logical conclusion. It depends on what  period, time span, or historical period you examine. I would  not raise this issue at all. The way I formulate the question  is the following: Do we need today, considering the difficulties  that have arisen within the CIS framework and the difficulties  related to the former Soviet Union -- do we need to raise the  issue of solving the Crimean problem? My answer is an  unequivocal no, if we are to be guided by common sense and  political expediency and consider the dangers that lie in wait  for us along this road. This is my profound conviction.    Second, after the president of Crimea was elected, our first  meeting in Ukraine was interesting. The president did not ask a  single political question.    He [Meshkov] said: The main issue for me is the economic  program. After this, I gave instructions to the government, and  we created for Crimea, together with Crimea, a budget balancing  expenditure if the Crimean authorities ensure the revenue. In  addition, we added a specific sum for the Crimean Tatar people  as was done in all our budgets. So, the main issue of the  budget was removed from the agenda.    Now we need to work. And here I ask myself the question:  Should one tackle the economic issue or kindle the political  problems again? Such as: Are you in favor of dual citizenship?  Is it not understood that the majority of the population is in  favor of dual citizenship in Crimea? Are not the other  questions asked in the poll understood? But the main issue is  the competence of the all-Ukraine referendum and not the Crimean  referendum: This is, in accordance with Ukraine's Constitution  and with the law on the all-Ukraine local referendum, the  competence of Ukraine. That is, no part can resolve this  problem unless it expresses the will of the entire people.    That is the first thing. The second thing is that there is a  ratified international principle, the Helsinki Process, which  takes very seriously all problems related to territorial borders  and others, because they understand that confrontation is in  store here, there may be blood in store here. Therefore, I  could not but annul these two points in the Crimean president's  decree, because they contradict the Constitution and our laws.  The point that relates to the competence of Crimea remains.    So, conditions have been created today for Crimea to work  economically and resolve its problems. What conditions are  these? Inadequate in respect of the opportunities, indeed,  difficult and hard ones, yes indeed, but we have to work. I can  imagine what will happen after this referendum. It has  absolutely no juridical force whatsoever, but I can well imagine  how many of your Ostankino broadcasts there will be, not to say  from your editorial office: The Crimeans have expressed their  will, and so on and so forth. This is all politicizing,  whipping up passions, the newspapers will go on about it, there  will all sorts of rallies, everything to show what the Crimeans  want. But can what the Crimeans want today be settled without  the involvement of Ukraine and Russia? In keeping with the  Helsinki and UN norms and other principles, two conditions are  essential: First, the agreement of Ukraine and of Russia. Third,  the expression of the people's will. Or rather second, the  expression of the people's will. But those conditions are not  present, all these expressions of the will of part of the people  will constantly come up against the barriers of international  principles, territorial borders etc., and so on and so forth.  Can we really set out on this path today?    This is why I have been appealing and continue to appeal:  There should be an end to politicizing, exploitation, and  playing the Crimean card. It will not lead to anything good.  We have the experience of the Dniester Region and Karabakh.  Surely we do not need a few more trouble spots for the hotheads  to finally understand that they must stop. Because we are  already tired of receiving death notifications. How many of  these must there be?    [Skryabin] Leonid Makarovych, thank you, I am sorry but we  have already run over our airtime, I cannot even offer you time  to bid farewell.

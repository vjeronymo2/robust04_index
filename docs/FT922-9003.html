			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / CPSA leaders back pay offer MORE than 11,000 Civil Service clerks will receive rises of about 11 per cent if they follow the CPSA union's recommendation to accept the government's shake-up of Whitehall pay. The basic offer, worth 4.75 per cent on the pay bill for 175,000 staff, would mean that for the first time civil servants would not receive automatic annual rises for long service. Rises above the cost of living would depend on performance. Under existing Civil Service pay rules the settlement must be at least 4.5 per cent this year. The offer means all clerks would receive a 4.25 per cent cost-of-living award from April 1 this year. About 6,000 staff on the main clerical grade would get 5.45 per cent. They currently earn Pounds 9,983 and would earn Pounds 10,527 under the proposed deal. The offer also extends the scope for government departments and agencies to opt out of centralised pay bargaining. It lays down a procedure for pay and grading to opted-out departments and agencies. Under the procedure unions must be consulted at national level. The moderate CPSA union, which represents junior civil servants, is recommending members to accept the offer. A Militant-supporting group within the union will urge members to reject it. Last week leaders of the NUCPS union, which represents middle-ranking civil servants, said it would recommend members to reject a similar offer worth 4.5 per cent on the pay bill. The Union of Communication Workers is recommending 12,500 Post Office counter and clerical staff to accept an offer from management of a 4.25 per cent increase in basic pay backdated to April 1. The offer is worth a net 4 per cent because some allowances are not being increased this year.</p>

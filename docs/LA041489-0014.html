			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN, MINKOW  </P> <P> Congratulations to Kim Murphy on a mesmerizing article on Minkow. It was novel  quality!  </P> <P> This article should serve to caution ZZZZ Best investors: Don't throw in the  towel just yet! While Barry's bubble may have burst, there are potential  globules of gas rising from the saga of Tom and Debbie, aided by Mark Morze,  the Amazing Mathematician, and the good services of the butler brothers, Jack  and Jerry Polevoi. Now those are the big, unbreakable, bankable bubbles of a  successful daytime soap!  </P> <P> Again, my compliments.  </P> <P> NIQUIE HUTCHISON  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

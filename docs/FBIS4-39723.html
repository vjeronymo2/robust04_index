			<p>BFN     [Text] Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan maintained  today that the republic's parliament would ratify the  Russian-Armenian inter-governmental agreement on the status of  Russian forces in the Republic this summer. "We must sign the  treaty on the setting up of Russian bases on the Republic's  territory by 1 September," he said in an exclusive interview  with INTERFAX.    The inter-governmental agreement on the status of the  Russian  forces in Armenia was signed in 1992 and ratified by the former  parliament of the Russian Federation in February 1993.    Sargsyan pointed out that the Republic's leadership is not  insisting that Moscow pay rent for the land for these bases and  for communal services. In his words, the Armenian leadership  proposed that Russia's military department train Armenian  citizens in Russian military colleges also "free of charge."    In addition, it was proposed to grant an opportunity to a  contingent of Armenian servicemen to serve in the Russian  military bases to be created in the Republic.    Commenting on the upcoming trip of Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev to Baku, Sargsyan said he thought it unlikely that  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev would join the agreement on  the settlement of the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh.    Representatives of Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russia,  which acted as mediator, signed a document on this issue on 17  May in Moscow.    "After the statements of the Azerbaijani leaders stating  that  there will be not a single Russian soldier on the territory of  the republic there can be hardly any progress on peaceful  settlement of the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh," said Serzh  Sargsyan. "They have burnt all their bridges by their  statements," he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Stihl Demands Tax Reform and New </F> Social System"]    [Text] Bonn, 16 Jun -- In the coming legislative term,  Germany as a business location will need a new tax reform, as  well as privatizations, deregulation, and a restructuring of the  social security system, the president of the Federation of  German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], Hans Peter  Stihl, told Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl at a meeting of the  German foreign trade chambers in Bonn.    Stihl praised the chancellor for showing, over the past few  years, how important he considers Germany's foreign trade  interests, not least during his visits abroad. Stihl said he  sees no point in calling for more state involvement in times of  difficult economic conditions, but he expects politics not to  make life unnecessarily difficult for industry. This should  start at home. Good framework conditions in Germany are the  best promotion of foreign trade, the DIHT president said.    The FRG has made good progress in this respect lately. The  economy is gradually recovering. This is partly due to the  corporation tax reform, this year's moderate wage agreements,  and the enormous amount of rationalization and restructuring  carried out by companies. Yet, one must not forget that Germany  as a business location has to cope with permanent structural  challenges, Stihl said, directing his words in Kohl's direction.    In Stihl's view, markets will interlink at an increasing  speed due to the enlargement of the European Union [EU] and the  successful conclusion of GATT. It is important now that GATT is  put into practice as quickly as possible. Free world trade must  not be threatened by new criteria, such as environment and  social standards.    In front of the 700 participants of the DIHT event entitled  "Out of Dullness, Fit for the World Market" Federal Chancellor  Helmut Kohl called on the EU to conduct an internationally open  trade policy and advocated basic international employees'  protection rights to be more widely observed. This must,  however, not serve as a pretext for new protectionism, the  chancellor added. Increasing integration of the Central and  East European states in the big market of the European Economic  Area is a foreign-policy aim of the German EU presidency that  starts on 1 July 1994.    Kohl decisively rejected calls for direct export and  investment subsidies. In the chancellor's view, protectionism  and trade barriers in view of ever increasing international  competition are short-sighted measures. First, free world trade  is essential for an export-oriented country such as Germany, and  second, an upswing of the economies of Germany's eastern  neighbors means political stability and an insurance against  relapses and old contrasts, Kohl said.    Stihl announced that German industry will open new  delegates'  offices in Shanghai, Singapore, and Hanoi. The Warsaw and  Ankara offices are to be upgraded to Foreign Trade Chambers.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / S Africa tensions rise after killings SOUTH AFRICA yesterday braced for more racial tension after five whites were killed by blacks at the weekend, and a group of retired generals said they might turn to violence to protect Afrikaners. A man claiming to represent the Azanian National Liberation Army, the little-known armed wing of the ultra-radical Black Consciousness Movement of Azania, telephoned a local news agency to claim responsibility for the murder of five whites in an eastern Cape hotel on Saturday night. But another caller to a different news agency denied the claim. The gruesome attack, which followed several similar killings in recent months, has further exacerbated white fears. The Azanian People's Liberation Army, the military wing of the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress, has been blamed by police for most of these attacks. The attack came on the eve of the funeral on Sunday of African National Congress leader Oliver Tambo, which went off without incident. However, white television viewers will have been further alarmed by live coverage of the funeral, which involved a long parade by guerrillas of the ANC armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, wearing full battle dress. Later, Umkhonto guerrillas in camouflage directed traffic along the route through white areas to the cemetery where Mr Tambo was buried. Meanwhile, a group of former army and police generals say they will try to mobilise right-wing whites behind the demand for self-determination for Afrikaners. General Tienie Groenewald, one of the conveners of the 'committee of generals', has denied press reports that the generals aimed to establish an army of the right, but said the group would turn to violence if constitutional options proved unsuccessful. He said the group's aim was to ensure that the government and the ANC did not ignore the views of right-wing whites, and ethnically based parties such as the Inkatha Freedom party, in constitutional talks. Political analysts believed the group would find it difficult to unite the fractious and divided right, composed of scores of small splinter groups. But given the group's considerable potential support among the largely right-wing armed forces, its formation could further exacerbate tensions.</p>

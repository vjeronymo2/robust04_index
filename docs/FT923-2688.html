			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian gas offer INDONESIA has unveiled a package of incentives to improve the commercial viability of developing gas fields and to entice production companies to explore frontier areas for oil. The package allows a more rapid depreciation of the capital costs of developing gas fields, while increasing the production companies' share of 'equity' gas - the gas produced after the current costs of production have been deducted. Companies signing new conventional contract areas will receive 35 per cent, up from 30 per cent, of equity gas, with the rest taken by Pertamina, Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas utility. In frontier areas, companies will receive 40-45 per cent of equity gas, depending on water depth. For companies operating existing contracts the equity split is unchanged, except for deep water frontier areas where the split is increased from 30 per cent to 40 per cent. The package does not increase the price paid by Pertamina for gas of about Dollars 2 per million cubic feet. Oil executives say the price must be raised if sufficient gas is to be developed to satisfy growing demand, mainly from power generators.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANY HELP TEND TO GETTY GARDENS  </P> <P> We were glad to see Patricia Ward Biederman's article on the Getty gardens.  (Times, Aug. 30)  </P> <P> From your headlines, readers may get the mistaken impression that Michael  DeHart, our excellent horticulturist, does everything.  </P> <P> In fact the gardens have been supervised since they were built in 1974 by  Richard Naranjo (mentioned mistakenly as having been born in Mexico). Mr.  Naranjo oversees a staff of 12, including Michael DeHart, whom he hired  recently. It is to Richard Naranjo and his remarkable staff that our visitors  should be grateful.  </P> <P> Michael DeHart asks that we point out to you that we use a relatively safe  pesticide, Tempo, against the white fly, which is commercially available for  institutional use only. We've been inundated with calls from people who think  we made a special discovery!  </P> <P> JOHN WALSH  </P> <P> Director, Getty Museum  </P></p>

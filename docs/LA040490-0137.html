			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> GUILTY VERDICT URGED IN COUPLE'S SHOOTING  </P> <P> The attorney prosecuting Richard L. Rodriguez, 22, who is accused of being  hired by an Anaheim man to kill his parents, urged the jury to return guilty  verdicts on all charges as they began their deliberations Tuesday.  </P> <P> In his closing remarks, Assistant Dist. Atty. Ed Freeman retraced the day when  Pauline Terry, shot four times in the upper torso, crawled past her husband,  Owen Terry, who had been shot twice in the head, and dialed 911 for help. The  shootings occurred Nov. 28, 1988, in their Anaheim home.  </P> <P> Pauline Terry, 52, was an instructional aide at Riverdale Elementary School in  Orange and Owen Terry, 56, was an accountant.  </P> <P> The couple's only son, David John Terry, 19, is also charged with murder and  attempted murder, and his trial is expected to begin this summer.  </P> <P> "It's a very emotional case," defense attorney Michael A. Horan told the jury  Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court. "I told you it would be."  </P> <P> But Horan argued that Rodriguez was not the killer, that he never even entered  the Terry's home. His only role, Horan argued, was to act as a middleman to  fence property stolen from the Terrys.  </P> <P> Rodriguez was found by police dogs, hiding in a bush at a riverbed near the  home. Also found there were a handgun, jewelry and a pair of gloves, Freeman  said. The gun and jewelry belonged to the Terrys, he said.  </P> <P> Freeman reminded the jury of witnesses' testimony that Rodriguez had been given  the gun by David Terry to enter the home, shoot the parents and rob them of all  the jewelry he could get.  </P> <P> If Rodriguez was fencing property for two of the key witnesses, as the defense  claims, why didn't he say so when those witnesses testified, Freeman asked.  </P> <P> "The only reasonable conclusion in this case is that Richard Rodriguez is the  burglar, robber, murderer of Owen Terry and the attempted murderer of Pauline  Terry," Freeman concluded.  </P> <P> Rodriguez is charged with murder, attempted murder, robbery and burglary.LUZ  VILLARREAL  </P></p>

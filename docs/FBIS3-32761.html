Menem  said: "Argentina must struggle tirelessly to have those  responsible for these aberrant acts severely punished."    Menem was referring to the preliminary conclusions of the  British police -- Scotland Yard -- based on the accusations made  by former Corporal Vincent Bramley regarding abuses and crimes  committed by the British after the Mount Longdon battle in 1982.  Another investigation, similar to the British, the conclusions  of which are being zealously guarded, was also carried out in  Buenos Aires two years after the first accusation made by the  former British corporal.    In a news conference Menem said, however, that "this  circumstance will not change in the least the policy we  implemented regarding relations with Great Britain."    Although some officials labeled the comments as a "political  declaration," that is, for domestic use rather than aimed at the  British, the president's comments that Argentina must "struggle  tirelessly to have those responsible for these aberrant acts  severely punished" put the foreign and defense ministries --for  different reasons -- in a difficult situation.    Just over two months ago in The Hague, in response to a  British reporter from the DAILY NEWS, Menem said: "At this stage  of events it would be useful to bury that past once and for all."    For diplomats, the president's change of position involves a  delicate situation in the even more delicate relations with the  United Kingdom which is under the so-called "umbrella"  protection.    A Foreign Ministry source explained to CLARIN the steps to  be  taken from now on: On one side, wait for the final result of  the Scotland Yard report which has already been sent to public  prosecutor Barbara Mills who should make a decision next April,  and on the other, wait for the British reaction to Menem's  comments.    The concern in the Defense Ministry was different. On 7  February, after CLARIN carried an exclusive publication of the  content of Scotland Yard's report, Defense Minister Oscar  Camilion held a meeting with the commanders of the three  branches of the Armed Forces.    In the meeting a decision was made that the final report of  the Argentine commission which carried out an investigation  questioning former soldiers be submitted to Armed Forces Auditor  General Brigadier Eugenio Miari "to make a decision on the  appropriate legal procedures" and to turn it over to the Foreign  Ministry to decide "on the appropriate actions to be taken."    This is like a merry-go-round. The Foreign Ministry says it  does not know the content of the Scotland Yard report despite  the fact that its conclusions have been known for 10 days. In  the Defense Ministry, depending on who is consulted, it is said  that the final Argentine report is not ready or that it is  already in the hands of the Armed Forces auditor general.    A source who read the Argentine report said "it is  absolutely  inconsistent" and that the accusations "cannot be proven or  denied." Being more sincere, a high official admitted to CLARIN  that the conclusions of the Argentine report will be held until  the details of the British report are known.</p>

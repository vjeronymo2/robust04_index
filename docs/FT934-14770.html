			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Turkish PM seeks boost on US visit TURKEY'S prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, yesterday arrived in the United States in need of a foreign policy boost to her flagging fortunes at home. More than her predecessor President Suleyman Demirel, Mrs Ciller has stressed the economic aspects of Turkey's foreign relations. In talks with President Bill Clinton today, Mrs Ciller will be urging US support for an exceptional lifting of United Nations sanctions against Iraq to allow the oil pipeline that runs through Turkey to re-open. Turkey is seeking compensation for the loss of toll tariffs, estimated at Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.2m) a month, from the closure of the pipeline. Western diplomats in Ankara, however, warn that the administration is unlikely to change its position. Also on the agenda will be the deteriorating situation in Somalia, where Turkey provides the commander of the United Nations peacekeeping force and contributes 300 troops to the operation. Turkey is understood to be hesitant to commit more soldiers as requested by Mr Frank Wisner, US defence under-secretary, during a visit to Ankara. More broadly, Mrs Ciller, who is often portrayed at home with a 'made in America' tag, will be looking to the US for support for her economic reforms, a more explicit denouncement of Kurdish separatist violence and a measured endorsement of Turkey's importance to US strategic interests in the region. The Clinton administration is said to support a greater Turkish role in the Middle East. From Washington, Turkey is increasingly seen as playing a dual role of containment of Iranian fundamentalism, and of President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. Already, Turkey has shifted its policy on Iraq. It continues to provide bases for allied aircraft to police the no-fly zone in northern Iraq, where Iraqi Kurds have established a de facto state since the end of the Gulf war. But Turkey is also improving strained ties with Iraq and is the only member of the allied coalition to have reopened its Baghdad embassy. With the US keen to upgrade its security ties with Turkey, Mrs Ciller may receive a more sympathetic hearing to her request for more flexible terms on Turkey's military equipment purchases. Turkey is the largest recipient of US military assistance after Israel and Egypt. Last year it amounted to about Dollars 500m. Mrs Ciller faces a testing visit. More than previous Turkish leaders, she seems vulnerable to the charge of US patronage. A former lecturer at the University of Connecticut in the 1980s, she was even alleged by her opponents to have had considered taking US citizenship - a charge she strongly denied when entering office in June as the new leader of the centre-right True Path party.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Edgard Ponce, president of the United Workers Front  (FUT), said the government must change its policy or the  demonstrations and protest strikes will continue to grow.  Workers and peasants are unwilling to allow privatization of  the Ecuadorean Social Security Institute, the state-owned  telecommunications company, and the Ecuadorean Institute of  Electrification. The FUT reiterated that the workers will take  even more radical action if the government persists in its  maniacal fervor to privatize state-run companies.    The FUT president added that joint action by the FUT, the  public sector, the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of  Ecuador, teachers, craftsmen, small merchants, and other sectors  would have serious repercussions that the government can only  prevent if it stops hijacking profitable state-run companies to  give them away to private businessmen.</p>

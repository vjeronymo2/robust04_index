			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / MPs say promises to forces broken Britain's forces have been so stretched by their engagement in former Yugoslavia that promises about conditions of service for soldiers and sailors have been abandoned, a cross-party committee of MPs said yesterday. In a report two weeks before the expected announcement of wide-ranging cuts in defence spending, the Commons defence committee argues that even now the armed forces are thinly spread. The committee questioned whether the Treasury was qualified to judge which forms of defence spending were dispensable and pointedly reminded Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, of a comment in the April white paper: 'The possession of such a valuable and prestigious national asset as our armed services is not a luxury.' The committee said: 'This is a message which, it seems, is yet to be fully received by the Treasury.' The MPs reserved their harshest words for the capacity limits shown up by the deployment of 2,500 ground troops in central Bosnia and ships in the Adriatic. It says guarantees to sailors about the proportion of time they would spend overseas had been broken as a result of the Adriatic operation. 'It is a shocking comment on the degree to which the Royal Navy's resources are overstretched that even the Navy's relatively unambitious welfare targets are being constantly breached,' the committee added. The government has said next month's defence cuts, designed to shave at least Pounds 750m from the annual defence budget, will have no effect on the armed forces' fighting ability because they will focus on trimming the cost of support services.

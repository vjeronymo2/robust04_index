			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Reynolds Metals in cans deal REYNOLDS METALS, the US integrated aluminium manufacturer, is to buy Miller Brewing's aluminium beverage can manufacturing operations. The deal will make Reynolds the third-largest aluminium can producer in the world. The transaction will increase Reynold's US aluminium can capacity by nearly 50 per cent, according to Mr Richard Holder, Reynolds' chairman. The acquisition is part of the company's strategy to expand its value-added aluminium businesses. A spokesman for Miller, which is part of Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, said the company was divesting the can properties because it wished to focus on its core business of brewing beer.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (12): Big video is watching you - Operatives at this Devon-based manufacturer of food and beverage equipment were video-taped to see how work could be speeded. Andrew Baxter describes the results / Case Study: Hobart Still Workers at Hobart Still in Barnstaple used to put a special drill for a new machine tool in a drawer for safekeeping. On one occasion, a videotape showed that 20 minutes were wasted when the drill was put back in the wrong drawer. The episode, recounted by Mr Graham Forster, UK engineering and manufacturing director of the food and beverage equipment producer, illustrates both the obstacles to change and the achievements at the Devon plant over the past few years. Why put a drill away in a drawer when it should be available close to the machine tool, says Mr Forster, for whom reducing set-up times became a top priority as the factory underwent a dramatic transformation. The changes, however, could only be achieved through big changes in working practices and flexibility, as symbolised by the willingness of workers to be videotaped in an effort to reduce waste and save time. Hobart is part of the food equipment group within Premark International, the US company perhaps best known for its Tupperware products. In 1989, the group bought WM Still, which makes beverage systems and two years later decided to close the Still plant in Hastings, concentrating manufacturing in Barnstaple. Barnstaple had been working on a three-and-a-half day week at the time, so had spare capacity. The addition of beverage equipment to the factory's range of Hobart food mixers provided an excellent opportunity to change practices at the plant, to reduce cost and increase flexibility. 'The feeling was that we had one opportunity to get it right,' says Forster. The plant was producing more expensively than its counterpart in the US, and there would have been a question-mark over its future if it had not increased efficiency. Over five months in 1991, the production of Still equipment was brought to Barnstaple, and a number of key decisions were taken. The product range and processes needed to be rationalised, production had to be relaid out, an additional plant across the road was identified, investment was needed to reduce space and cost, three manufacturing control systems had to be consolidated and, by no means least, the plant's culture needed to be changed. Making the move had cost Pounds 3m, but the question was how much more would need to be spent to get things right. There was certainly plenty to do: for example, one measure of the plant's effectiveness was the ability to deliver orders on time. In the upheaval caused by the consolidation, it could only achieve this with one in four of its beverage equipment orders. The company had been considering moving to cell manufacturing but felt it needed some outside help, says Mr Forster. After talking to several consultants it selected Peter Chadwick, the fast-growing consultancy which specialises in detailed change programmes to improve companies' performance, for an initial two-week analysis. 'The aim was to ascertain what the opportunities were at the company, for improving its cost structure and its flexibility, and what the biggest drivers for success were,' says Mr Peter Mounsey, who conducted the study for Peter Chadwick and led the subsequent main 35-week project from February to November 1992. This began in the machine shop with the development of cellular manufacturing, which was then implemented before the project team moved on to the fabrication area. The intention, through moving to cells, was not simply to get away from the old one man-one machine methods but, as Mr Mounsey puts it, 'to drive the culture' by ensuring cell members had the information and incentive to suggest how performance could be improved. The 'cell facilitator' was given considerable lee-way to decide how to schedule work on the different machine tools so long as the overall order priorities were adhered to. The thinking behind this is that the people in the cell are in a much better position to make such decisions than a scheduler in an office. Cells depend on multi-skilling, and their introduction can lead to workforce cuts - the turning cell, for example, has saved eight jobs. They have proved to be a much more flexible way of handling the kind of erratically-sized batches and short delivery times in the food and beverage equipment industry. Throughout the factory, and at the small 'Unit One' site a few hundred yards away producing smaller beverage equipment, there are some common elements to the changes proposed by Chadwick and strongly supported by Mr Len Court, the production manager who, along with Mr Forster, has been something of a champion of the change programme. They include line-side storage rather than big central stores, Kanban (card) systems triggering deliveries from one cell to another, clearly visible displays of each cell's performance updated frequently each day and backed up by measurement methods which the company had previously lacked, and some significant title changes: the old foremen are now 'area facilitators' while the engineers who used to dictate to production have been renamed 'production service' operators. The Chadwick team has promised the reorganisation would produce savings of Pounds 700,000. This was effectively exceeded last year. There has also been, as expected, a big improvement in cycle times. 'Nine times out of ten we can complete an order in a few days. Previously, everything was so rigid,' says Mr Forster. At Unit One, whose layout has been completely reorganised over the past year, area facilitator Colin Emery says a machine was recently assembled within an hour for a salesman who wanted to show it to a customer. Overall, Mr Forster says the hardest part of the whole programme was convincing workers that changes needed to be made to improve future performance. For example, recording improvements was viewed by workers initially as time-consuming and thus counter-productive but within months was helping to generate much more impressive improvements than would have been possible otherwise. And both Mr Emery and Mr Forster praise the willingness of the workforce to be moved around to meet changing demand. 'Eighteen months ago you could never have moved someone from assembly to fabrication, but people like the change,' says Mr Emery.</p>

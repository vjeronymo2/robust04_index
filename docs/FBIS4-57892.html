			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Santiago, 23 May (EFE) -- Gutenberg Martinez,  president of the Chilean Christian Democratic Party [PDC], today  denied alleged U.S. pressure on Chile to prevent the imminent  resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba. The leader of  the main governing party emphatically stated that "we have felt  no pressure, and if they were to exert any we would flatly  reject it because we are not going to tolerate any form of  pressure from anyone, either in favor or against it."    In June Martinez will head a PDC delegation to Cuba with the  purpose of personally learning about the current situation in  Cuba.    Asked about the problems preventing the full restoration of  diplomatic ties, Martinez answered: "We cannot continue to live  in the past, either at a national or international level."  Among these obstacles is the support granted by Cuba to Chilean  armed groups that struggled against the Chilean military regime,  especially the massive and illegal introduction of weapons into  Chile in 1986. Martinez also stated that the current situation  in Cuba is far from what it was a decade ago and important  progress can be seen on the island. He commented: "During our  visit we will see what changes have taken place." After the  visit, the delegation will give the PDC leadership a report on  its findings so that the latter may then give the government its  opinion. [passage omitted]</p>

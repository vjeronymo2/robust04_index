			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / A familiar spectre haunts Europe again: This time its guise is Russian nationalism in the former Soviet Union Last week the parliament of Estonia protested against Russian 'imperialism' and what it called its increasing tendency to 'see the Baltics as its zone of influence and pressure'. Estonia's action, a case of lese majeste by the smallest of the former Soviet republics against the largest, is not a lone sign of alarm. Throughout the states of the old Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and increasingly in western foreign ministries, the spectre of a 'neo-imperialist', or at least a hegemonic, Russia is being fed into discussion and giving an edge to formal statements which were once of undiluted support. For instance, two weeks ago, the US State Department expressed 'anxiety' over reports that Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, had appeared to say the Russian army would stay in Estonia and Latvia to protect the Russian minorities there. It is an issue which Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is likely to bring up with Mr Boris Yeltsin today. As the first senior western leader to meet Mr Yeltsin for a month - during which time western alarm has grown - he will be in a good position to gauge the mood in Russia as it begins its hardest year yet since the break-up of the Soviet Union. While the elections in December, which showed so much support for the ultra-nationalist and communist parties, proved a shock to the west, a tendency to extend Russia's political and economic reach once more throughout the former Soviet space had been observable for much of last year. Yet little or no public note was taken of this in the west where policy (especially US policy) towards Russia remained that the country was by far the most important among the former communist states and that it should be treated as a friend. This attitude reached its apogee last month at the Russia-US summit, where President Bill Clinton went out of his way to reassure the world that Mr Yeltsin retained his reformist credentials. Increasingly this view, pushed by Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state designate, is under attack from within the US and within the leading industrialised countries. Professor Peter Reddaway, a leading Russia expert based at Washington's Peace Foundation, says that 'behind the assurances about 'continuing the reforms', which the US has trustingly accepted at face value, a new course towards authoritarianism is being quietly prepared'. In a review of Russian policy towards the 'near abroad' - a revealing phrase which Russian politicians, and the public generally, tend to use about the other former Soviet states - Harvard University's Kennedy School claims that a 'disturbing pattern' has appeared in Russia's relations with its neighbouring states. '. . . In each of the conflicts (in these states) there is evidence to suggest that Russia has intervened in such a way as to promote their escalation and/or continuation instead of their cessation . . . . In a manner that would seem consistent with Russian policy, the sovereignty of each of the former republics of the Soviet Union has been compromised, forcing them into a dependent relationship with Moscow.' This trend to domination and authoritarianism is now remarked upon in particular by those most critical of the 'partnership for peace' initiative, under which Nato offered closer co-operation with the central European states but stopped short of offering them the membership they so wanted. This, say the critics, was because the Nato states and in particular the US, did not want to offend Russia. 'The risks of not extending Nato eastward are enormous,' says General William Odom of the Hudson Institute, and former director of the US National Security Agency. 'A new strategic divide will be drawn in Europe eventually . . . . The issues are how, where and what kind of divide.' Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, put the matter succinctly on the New York Times last October: the Nato issue, he wrote, is in large part about the domestic politics of Russia. If 'forces still enamoured of the imperial ambitions of the former Soviet Union' increase their power they are bound to see Nato as a threat: but if democrats win out, they will see that 'Nato is not Russia's enemy but its partner (whose) expansion . . . would bring Russia closer to a region of democracy and prosperity'. The issue will increasingly be debated within Russia - especially as, perhaps as early as this week, a treaty will be prepared which would unite the economy of Belarus with that of Russia, in effect putting the first under the control of the second. For the democrats, this is at once absurd and alarming. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, now a deputy in the lower house, said yesterday: 'This is the union of two states, and it must be at minimum the subject of discussion in the parliament and probably of a referendum. Actually, it is less the union of the economies in a rational way but a union of the red directors of both countries who want to re-establish their links.' Mr Fyodorov believes that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin,the prime minister, has made the re-establishment of the economic union one of his main priorities in the year ahead: and that this economic union will take the form of a political union, since the fledgling governments of these states will find themselves tied hand and foot by Moscow once more. However, Mr Sergei Stankevich, a leading member of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord and former Yeltsin adviser, says: 'There is no way Russia can ignore the fate of the more than 25m Russians outside of its borders, and so our policy will be geared to that. But Russia cannot take responsibility for these states again and any western view that these moves are neo-imperialist completely misunderstands the situation.' In the end, the issue is nationhood: can Russia accept its borders, accept that the Russians in the 'near abroad' are, however near, still abroad - and thus encourage them to become good citizens of another country? Or does it still see them as its people - and thus the land on which they live as Russian as well?</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo comes clean Investors must be hoping that Lasmo's past is not a reliable guide to its future. There is no doubting the enthusiasm with which it has reorganised its accounts. But its thoroughness implied a calculation that there would be no penalty for revealing past short-comings, provided investors' gaze could be diverted towards the future of the combined Lasmo and Ultramar group. Its shares recovered from a sharp fall yesterday, so the gamble has paid off for now. All the same, the market ought to wonder whether it has been sold a dummy. Without Ultramar, Lasmo would be looking very sick indeed. A Pounds 280m balance sheet write-down aside, the notable effect of the accounting changes was to reduce last year's stated earnings per share by 85 per cent, and 1990 earnings by nearly 60 per cent. Thus, over two years, including the Gulf war period of high oil prices, Lasmo paid 17p of dividends on earnings of 12.4p per share, instead of the previously stated 40.8p. Had investors known that, the group's paper would presumably not have been valuable enough to pay for Ultramar. Further, the new method of accounting for tax allowances gave the 1991 operating line a Pounds 32m boost, limiting the loss to Pounds 8.5m. As for the decision to take a Pounds 22m extraordinary provision against losses on US properties which have not yet been sold, this was doubtless done to protect this year's vulnerable earnings by further lowering the point of comparison. But perhaps this is to be too sceptical. Investors are surely more interested in the future, and, thanks to the Ultramar assets on its balance sheet, Lasmo looks a much better long-term bet than it did before. That said, if the oil price stays low the group could yet make another loss this year, and the market's disaffection with the entire sector means its shares are unlikely to forge ahead. There is no rush to buy.</p>

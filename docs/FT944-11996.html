			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BAe reserves right to lift VSEL bid British Aerospace yesterday refused to rule out making a revised offer for VSEL, the nuclear submarine maker. Mr Bob Bauman, chairman, told BAe shareholders that although it expected GEC's rival Pounds 532m offer to be blocked on competition grounds, BAe reserved the right to increase its own bid. 'Our offer is an open one, which doesn't prevent an increase,' he said. Two and a half weeks ago, BAe offered 2.474 shares for each VSEL share with a cash alternative of Pounds 11.40. At BAe's closing price yesterday, down 2p at 450p, the bid values each VSEL share at Pounds 12.36. Mr Bauman, however, claimed that the VSEL board would recommend the BAe offer ahead of GEC's cash bid because it would secure the future of its Barrow shipyard and open new markets for its land-based defence systems. 'It is also in the best interest of VSEL as it poses no competition concerns for defence procurement in the UK,' he said. Shareholders approved a resolution allowing BAe to proceed with the offer, despite a series of questions to the board over a clause allowing it to extend or amend the bid. Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director, sought to reassure investors that a revised offer might not be necessary by pointing out that if BAe's share price rose by 60p the current bid would be worth Pounds 14 a share. Justifying the proposed acquisition, he added that VSEL profits would reduce BAe's tax rate from 33 to 25 per cent and greatly strengthen its balance sheet. See Observer</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Milking the cash cows The UK corporate sector is sucking in cash at a rapid rate. Industrial companies are running their largest financial surplus since the early 1980s. So far, companies have chosen to use the cash to improve their balance sheets. They paid off Pounds 3.1bn of borrowings in the first half of the year and increased their cash deposits. The desire for financial strength is fair enough, but this has been at the expense of dividend payouts and capital expenditure. Generosity to shareholders has proved surprisingly limited; dividends fell between the second half of last year and the first half of the current year on a seasonally adjusted basis. However, investors have benefited recently from the trend towards share buy-backs - notably by Boots and the regional electricity companies - and full-year dividends are likely to be up a handsome 10 per cent. More worrying is the stagnant capital expenditure in the third quarter. The stock market tends to be sceptical when companies announce large capital expenditure plans, as, for example, when Hanson recently declared its intention to spend Dollars 438m expanding capacity in the US. But this scepticism is wrong-headed, if investment supports long-term earnings growth. The dearth of capital expenditure probably reflects the impact of high real long-term interest rates. But with inflation low, companies should arguably adjust to less ambitious profit targets.</p>

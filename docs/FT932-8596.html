			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bang &amp; Olufsen to make pre-tax loss Bang &amp; Olufsen, the Danish television and audio equipment manufacturer, expects to make a pre-tax loss for the year ending in May, 1993 of about DKr19m (Dollars 3m), writes Hilary Barnes from Copenhagen. The result is better than budgeted and from improved operating earnings, a disposal and improved licence income. The group said rationalisation measures are taking effect and will reduce group costs significantly next year.</p>

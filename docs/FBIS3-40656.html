			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Dunkel-Demanding Explanation By Rao"] </F>   [Text] Members of both houses of the Parliament agitated on  Thursday demanding that the prime minister make a personal  appearance to explain India's position on the Dunkel draft. The  proceedings were postponed until Friday since nothing could be  accomplished on the face of the turmoil. Lok Sabha proceedings  were postponed four times and Rajya Sabha Proceedings had to be  postponed at least three times. The members cried out slogans  like "Selling India out to the United States," etc., in  reference to India's signing the GATT.  <H5>  IN THE LOK SABHA... </H5>   Parliamentary Affairs Minister V.C. Shukla pacified the Lok  Sabha members and arranged for the Commerce Minister Pranab  Mukherji to read out a statement on GATT negotiations. The  members ignored that and insisted that the consequences of  signing GATT be discussed in the presence of the prime minister,  instead of following that day's agenda. When the Lok Sabha  reconvened at 2 in the afternoon, the members agitated once  again and proclaimed that unless the prime minister came, they  would not allow any activities to take place.    Ram Vilas Paswan of Janata Dal, wanted to know if the  premier  would come. Mr. Shukla informed them that the prime minister was  busy entertaining the Indonesian President and to kindly allow  the commerce minister to read the statement. He assured them  that there was no problem in the premier himself coming  subsequently to the parliament, and that the sentiments of the  members would be duly conveyed to him. Janata Dal members  insisted that the premier himself come. Somnath Chatterji  (CPI-M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] said that Mukherji  should be allowed to read out the statement, and the members  could conduct the discussions the next day in the premier's  presence. He emphasized that no other matter may be taken up in  the meanwhile.    After Pranab Mukherji read the statement, the oposition  agitated once more that the prime minister come. They proceeded  to the center of the assembly hall and shouted slogans. In the  midst of their shouting and agitating, the deputy speaker of the  Lok Sabha, Mallikarjunaiya attempted to take up other items for  discussion from the agenda, and some ministers put forth their  issues, but in the pandemonium created by the members, nothing  could be heard.    Therefore, Mallikarjunaiya announced that he was postponing  the proceedings. When they reconvened the same scene followed  once more. At 5 in the afternoon, the assembly was postponed for  the the third time, and soon after to the next day!  <H5>  RAJYA SABHA... </H5>   The Rajya Sabha proceedings were postponed three times  following the agitation by its members. At 1445, the assembly  was postponed for the second time. The Speaker, Najma Heptullah  had already requested orderly conduct and having failed to  obtain the same, postponed proceedings. When they reconvened,  deputing speaker Sayyad Chipte Razi announced that Pranab  Mukherji will read the statement on Dunkel, to which there was  vehement opposition. No one listened to what Mukherji read.  Opposition members rushed to the center of the assembly hall.  Since Razi's requests were being ignored, he had to postpone  proceedings once more.    The question hour was held in the Rajya Sabha inspite of all  this. When that was over, Dunkel plan was brought up and there  was agitation again. Whenever the house reconvened, there was  agitation and so the proceedings had to be postponed till Friday.  <H5>  PRANAB: EXPORTS WILL INCREASE </H5>   Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji said in parliament on  Thursday that, since the new commercial agreements concluded are  global in scope, India's annual exports will increase from  Rs.31,500 million to Rs.60 billion.    One hundred and seventeen countries, including India adopted  global trade agreements on Wednesday (15 December). Pranab  briefed both houses of parliament on this and said:    The global expansion of trading will especially benefit  India. There will be no adverse effect on grants, rations,  textiles, drugs, or copyright regstration. Textile export quotas  have been extended to 10 more years. Even though this in itself  may not be satisfactory, the developed nations have assured that  this quota will be removed entirely at the end of the 10 year  period. This will help the growth and expansion of textiles. The  developed countries of the world have reduced the tariff on  agricultural products-exports. Therefore Indian agricultural  products may be sold at a reduced price in the world market.    Japan and South Korea have loosened their hitherto firm  stand  of not allowing rice imports. They have changed their stand and  will allow rice to be imported. The agreements stipulate that  not more than 10 percent of an agricultural product's value may  be levied as tariff on it, but the tariff India will have to pay  is much reduced compared to the amount determined by the member  countries, due to special concessions. Therefore, there is no  need to fear that agricultural grants will decrease.</p>

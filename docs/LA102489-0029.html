			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Prince Charles, who banned aerosol sprays from his household out of concern for  the ozone layer, will write and present a TV documentary on environmental  threats, the British Broadcasting Corp. said Monday. On the 60-minute program,  the heir to the throne is expected to focus on global issues such as the  destruction of rain forests and the ozone layer, the high layer of the  atmosphere that shields the Earth from most of the sun's ultraviolet radiation.  Chemicals used in aerosol sprays are believed to be depleting the ozone layer.  The BBC said the prince will tell viewers: "It has become apparent to me that  we need to develop a new vision of the Earth and of the role we human beings  have as stewards of the Earth." The program is to be broadcast in May as part  of a weeklong collaboration between European stations to report on world  problems. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Porgy and Bess bring mixed emotions - Music Opera features more prominently than usual in the 1993 end-of-year television timetable. A wider range of it than usual, too: from the elaborate confection of dance and song entitled The Sorceress (BBC2, Christmas Eve), with music taken from Handel's opera Alcina and Kiri Te Kanawa personifying the eponymous mistress of magic arts, to Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (BBC2, Christmas Sunday) represents an interesting and, indeed, artistically ambitious span of operatic material. The Porgy, directed by Trevor Nunn and based on his celebrated 1986 Glyndebourne Festival production, should have been one of the highlights of the festive-season viewing schedule. For the vast majority of viewers, who will not have seen the show either at Glyndebourne or in its recent brief transfer to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, it may well be just that. At least almost all of the unforgettable original principals - Willard White and Cynthia Haymon in the title roles, Damon Evans (Sporting Life), Gregg Baker (Crown) and Marietta Simpson (Maria) - were retained; as a record of their marvellous, heart-wrenching performances the film retains a basic value. But alas, some badly misguided decision-making went into the planning of the film, the results of which (on the evidence of an advance video sampling) betray themselves in just about every frame. Most misguided idea of all was to re-mount the production - on, it seems, a rather slender budget and an exiguous notion of set-design - in a studio and then have the vocal contributions mimed: what we hear on the soundtrack is actually the equally celebrated 1989 EMI studio recording of the Glyndebourne Porgy, conducted by Simon Rattle. The deadening effect of the dubbing, of singer-actors not directly involved in the singing part of the job but simply mouthing their words, is undeniable and, indeed, unavoidable. Anyone who recalls the spellbinding immediacy of the Glyndebourne experience would be well advised to rely on memories and skip the whole relay. By contrast, the films of Puccini's Fanciulla del West (C4, Christmas Day), Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades (BBC2, Monday) and Strauss's 'conversation piece' Capriccio (BBC2, Tuesday) are taken from live productions. While this may seem a cop-out in terms of confronting the two media - the musico-theatrical and the televisual - it has in these three cases ensured that the three shows are put across with their basic qualities intact. The Puccini, with Domingo and Barbara Daniels, comes from the New York Met; the Tchaikovsky is another recent Glyndebourne enterprise, a magnificently creepy modern re-thinking of the terrifying masterpiece; and the Strauss, again with Kiri Te Kanawa, is a John Cox staging from the San Francisco Opera. Also worth noting for the new year weekend: La Traviata, filmed at the Fenice, Venice, the theatre where Verdi's opera was premiered (BBC2, New Year's Eve); and a re-run of the remarkable, endlessly fascinating conversations that in 1968 the BBC filmed between Maria Callas and her old friend and longtime admirer Lord Harewood (BBC2, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day).</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Bold fashion statement: Levi Strauss's decision not to invest in China Levi Strauss blue jeans may be an even more widely recognised symbol of American values than the stars and stripes. Sticking to values that reflect freedom and democracy is a top priority for the 149-year-old San Francisco company, which has been making denim pants since the California gold rush - even if it means sacrificing profits. This week, Levi, the world's largest apparel manufacturer with sales last year of Dollars 5.6bn, said it had decided not to make direct investments in China and to terminate contracts with Chinese clothing manufacturers, because of what the company called 'pervasive violations of basic human rights'. The decision coincides with the debate in Washington over continuing China's most favoured nation trading status, and has fueled the arguments of those seeking human rights concessions from China. However, the company insists that it is not trying to influence the political process or gain publicity. The partial withdrawal from China - where Levi continues to buy cloth and other supplies - is the latest result of a study of the company's manufacturing contractors outside the US to determine whether they comply with the strict ethical guidelines adopted last year. Levi has already pulled out of Burma, and terminated 5 per cent of its more than 600 contract manufacturers in 50 countries, as well as demanding that a further 20 per cent improve conditions. In an industry noted for sweat shops and abuses of workers rights, Levi has earned a reputation as a good employer in the US. Its labour relations are 'among the best in the industry', according to the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Worker's Union. Yet like most US apparel makers, Levi has shifted an increasing proportion of its production to contract manufacturers overseas in recent years to cut costs. Concerns about conditions in foreign factories led to the adoption of the guidelines. 'As we expanded our operations to more diverse cultures and countries, we felt that we needed to set standards to ensure that our products were being made in a manner consistent with our values, that would not be damaging to our brand image,' says Bob Dunn, Levi vice-president and a member of the team of managers which compiled the criteria for selection of Levi contractors. Levi's 'terms of engagement' for contractors cover environmental requirements, health and safety of workers and employment practices. Levi states that it will not do business with contractors who use child labour or prison labour. Working hours are limited to 60 per week and wages must at least match local standards. Recognising that in some countries working conditions are beyond the control of individual contractors, Levi also drew up a list of criteria for 'country selection', which excludes those found violating the United Nations declaration on human rights or which are politically or social unstable, such as Peru. 'Levi is to be commended for being the first company in the garment industry to adopt standards for contractors,' says Mr Philis Harvey, executive director of the International Labour Rights Research and Education Fund, a private sector group that presses for workers' rights. From Levi's perspective, the guidelines have proved a valuable management tool. 'The ink was barely dry on our guidelines when we were faced with a problem,' recalls Mr Dunn. One of the company's contractors in Saipan, a US territory in the Mariana Islands, was charged with withholding Dollars 10m in wages from its 1,350 Chinese immigrant workers. With the guidelines in place, Levi assessed the situation and terminated the contract. However, Levi has faced some difficult decisions. In Bangladesh, for example, the company threatened to close factories where young children were virtually enslaved. 'The contractors told us that the children were the sole source of income for their families, and that they would be begging if they were not working,' said Mr Dunn. A compromise was worked out. The contractors agreed to pay the children full wages if they attended school until 14 and then came to work in their factories. Levi is paying for tuition, books and school uniforms. 'This is a major effort, involving training and evaluation,' said Mr Dunn. Levi is paying a price for its principles. But in the case of China, the costs of withdrawing - while 'not trivial', according to Mr Dunn - 'will not be material for a company of our size. We believe that in the long term, protecting our brand image will support our commercial success.' As a privately held company, with most of its stock held by descendants of Mr Levi Strauss, Levi can take a long-term view. However, a handful of public companies are following its lead. These include Reebok, the shoe manufacturer, Nike, the sports goods maker, and Sears, the retail chain. 'Levi Strauss has helped us to develop and implement our standards,' said Mr Doug Cahn, director of human rights at Reebok. The company is beginning to assess its contractors. 'I'm about to leave for a trip to China with an audit team next week,' Mr Cahn said. Despite short-term costs, Levi's human-rights stand in China could pay off, Mr Harvey predicted. 'If it is recognised by the next generation of Chinese, Levi will have an advantage in a burgeoning market,' because young people will associate the brand name with integrity and freedom. But if Levi stays out of China for too long it may miss out on a gold rush bigger than the one on which it was founded: a billion people eager to adopt one of the west's most enduring symbols.</p>

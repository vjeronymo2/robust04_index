			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: UK and Italian markets lifted by ERM departure THE Italian and UK government markets took heart from the departure of their respective currencies from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The Irish and Spanish bond markets fell on fears that their currencies might be the next victims of devaluation, while Danish bonds showed more resilience. THE sterling yield-curve flattened sharply yesterday in the wake of Wednesday night's decision to suspend the currency's link to the ERM, indicating that the UK could be heading for its first positive yield curve for nearly a decade. The mood at the shorter end of the market was set by the short sterling futures contract on Liffe, which traded late in the day at 91.30 - up from its close last night of 88.65. Its signal that interest rates were expected to fall to below 8 3/4 per cent from their current 10 per cent level by the end of the year was echoed in shorter-dated gilts, which rallied strongly. For example, the 10 per cent gilts due 1996 gained nearly three points on the day, to end with a yield of 9.21 per cent. Longer-dated bonds fell only slightly, in spite of the potential inflationary implications of taking sterling out of the ERM for any prolonged period of time. The 9 per cent gilts due 2008 lost less than half a point, closing at a yield of 9.07 per cent. The extent of the levelling was 'very tame, relative to the fundamental forces,' said Mr Stephen Lewis, an economist at London Bond Broking Company. He estimated that if sterling were to fall to DM2.55, it could add half a point to projected inflation, taking the yield on long gilts up to 9 3/4 per cent to 10 per cent. ITALIAN government bonds were the best performers of the day, with gains of between  1/2 -1 1/2 points, as dealers greeted the government's plans for budget deficit cuts of more than L90 trillion in the coming fiscal year. There were also expectations of a cut in interest rates as pressure eased on the lira after its early fall. The Liffe December future was trading at 93.12 late in the day, after Wednesday's close of 92.65, with 14,720 lots exchanged. The day's high was 93.45 and the low 91.20. On the cash market, the May 2002 BTP ended at 91.93/2.05, up from 90.61/74. GERMAN bonds ended a volatile day about 0.20 points lower after a volatile day. The market had opened higher on rumours that the Bundesbank would lower the Lombard rate by half a percentage point, but then fell back when the Bundesbank failed to deliver. News in the early afternoon that the German finance ministry was raising the volume of July's 8.0 per cent 1992/2002 federal government bond by DM5bn to DM15bn did not help the market. The price of the Bund eased to 103.23/29, just below Wednesday's close, from 103.53/59 in mid-morning. The Liffe December Bund future fell to 90.71 from Wednesday's close of 90.82 with 78,058 contracts traded, after a high of 91.08 and a low of 90.38. THE Irish government bond market dropped in the morning on fears that the Irish punt might be the next victim of devaluation. The Bundesbank and the Irish central bank intervened to protect the punt which was fixed in Frankfurt at its intervention floor of DM2.619. A weaker French franc, fears of higher interest rates and the approach of Sunday's referendum on the Maastricht treaty weighed on French government bonds. Among French Treasuries, the 8 1/2 OATs of 2003 fell 0.70 to 99.04 to yield 8.63 per cent compared with 8.53 per cent. At the long end, the 8 1/2 of 2023 dropped 1.14 to 98.68 to yield 8.62 per cent. ACTIVITY in the Swedish government bond market ground to a halt yesterday as investors waited for calm to return to the international financial markets and for news of political agreement in Sweden on proposals to cut government spending. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, kept its marginal lending rate at 500 per cent yesterday in order to crush speculation against the krona. Short-term interest rates rose at the start of trading, but fell back later in the day. Three-month treasury bills were quoted with a spread of 35 per cent to 25 per cent at the opening, falling to 29 per cent to 24 per cent by the close. US treasury prices barely moved yesterday as players cautiously waited for developments in European markets to unfold. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged at 98 31/32 , yielding 7.330 per cent. With events in Europe continuing to dominate US markets, there was little reaction to domestic economic news. Jobless claims for the week ended September 5 advanced 6,000 to 400,000.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Drugs liberalisation attacked: Colombian court decision leads to defiance on streets The impact of the Colombian Supreme Court decision to decriminalise the personal use of small amounts of drugs is already evident on the streets of the country's capital, Bogota. Social workers dealing with children and young prostitutes say drug consumption has climbed since the first announcement of de-criminalisation two weeks ago. More teenagers are trying out cocaine base (a low-grade form of the drug), thinking: 'If it's legal it can't be bad for us'. Critics of the court decision say this is evidence that such decriminalisation opens the door to a massive increase in marijuana and cocaine consumption, in a country where these drugs are cheap and readily available. A recent government survey found there were more than 500,000 regular drug abusers among Colombia's 30m people, including 6,000 heroin addicts. Drug abuse is an important factor in Colombian urban violence. The country has highest murder rate in the world. The court this week issued a lengthy statement in support of its decision, but it has failed to still the controversy. A majority of the justices decided it was unconstitutional to violate a person's freedom to decide whether to use drugs. However, the court left room for congressional legislation to limit drug use in schools and other public places, and said that education, not repression, is the way to combat consumption. Four of the nine justices have stated they deplore the majority's ruling, describing it as ingenuous and anachronistic, based on 19th century liberalism, and doing 'incalculable harm to Colombian society.' The government, presidential candidates (the election's first round is due on May 29), church, business and education leaders have condemned the decriminalisation. President Cesar Gaviria said this week he would issue a decree to ban the use of drugs in public places, as the first step to overturn the ruling. He also announced moves towards a plebiscite to revoke the ruling and return any kind of drug use to illegality. Opinion polls have all shown a large majority for penalties against possession and consumption. Critics of the court decision also see it as undermining the police and other authorities fighting drug production and trafficking. Marijuana users in the centre of Bogota are now taunting police by blowing smoke in their faces. By legalising the consumption part of the drug business, the critics believe, the court is in danger of giving the illusion of legitimacy to production. There may now be greater pressure in Colombia to realise a proposal previously aired by Mr Gustavo de Greiff, the attorney-general, to legalise the whole trade. The decriminalisation will also damage Colombia's image abroad, even though the US and other foreign governments recognise that the court's decision does not reflect the Gaviria administration's stand against drugs. The US has already suspended exchanges of evidence with the Colombian authorities on the grounds that Mr de Greiff was too ready to reach plea-bargains with drug traffickers.</p>

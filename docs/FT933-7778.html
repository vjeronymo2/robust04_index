			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Higher financial costs put SAS in the red SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) slumped SKr609m (Dollars 75.7m) into the red in the first half of 1993, a SKr1.1bn turnround on its performance in the same 1992 period. The airline blamed a big rise in financial costs, but also said fierce competition, recession, and depressed traffic volumes in Sweden had aggravated its losses. Yields fell 6 per cent overall and by 13 per cent in domestic Swedish traffic. The tone was considerably more gloomy than in March, when the airline announced a 1992 loss of SKr743m, but it declined to make a full-year forecast because of the impact of market deregulation, restructuring and unrest in the foreign exchange markets. The company has been discussing a link-up with KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines, and said yesterday it expected to start talks on an 'airline constellation with a joint balance sheet' soon. Operating revenue for the first half rose 8 per cent to SKr18.9bn. However, the company made a loss after depreciation of SKr145m, against a SKr708m profit in the first half of 1992. The deficit was aggravated by SKr1.1bn in financial losses, stemming from a weaker krona, higher interest costs and increased net debt, leaving it with a loss before financial items of SKr1.23bn, compared with a SKr484m profit. The bottom line would have been even worse if the airline had not made a SKr554m gain on the sale of its terminal catering and contract catering businesses in June. This helped restrict the pre-tax deficit to SKr609m, after last year's SKr502m profit. 'Deregulation in Europe and overcapacity in the industry, combined with the recession, have resulted in intense competition and a general fall in yields,' SAS stated. It said the competition meant it had not been able to increase fares in line with the depreciation of the Swedish krona. SAS also noted that Sweden, its most important market, was a conspicuous exception to a pattern of recovery in international air transport volumes, and said recession had scarred many of its other operations, such as SAS Leisure Group. The Swedish domestic air market was deregulated in July 1992. Bright spots for the company were an 8 per cent rise in revenue passenger kilometres and a 6 per cent increase in production. Passenger numbers rose 3 per cent to 9.2m. The airline's equity/assets ratio weakened to 19 per cent as at June 30, compared with 23 per cent at the end of 1992.</p>

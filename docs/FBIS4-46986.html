			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Colonel Pavel Ilin, deputy chief </F> of a border detachment for personnel, by Vladimir Arutyunyan,  special correspondent of GOLOS ARMENII for the Shirak region;  place and date not given: "The Mission of the Border  Troops--Defense of the Interests of Russia and the Guarding of  the Exterior Borders of the CIS"]    [Text] Since the start of the 19th century  Gyumri-Aleksandropol had always been regarded as a most  important strategic point on the southern borders of the Russian  Empire. And in Soviet times also Leninakan was "singled out" in  a military respect. The permanent presence of quite a tangible  contingent of military always creates a distinctive atmosphere  and makes its mark on the tenor of urban life. Gyumri has always  treated people in military uniform with affection and respect.  But even against this background the border guards were a  special, privileged caste, as it were. As we know, according to  a number of agreements, the guarding of the "exterior" border of  Armenia (with Turkey and Iran) has been entrusted to units of  the border forces of the Russian Federation. On 20 May the  Gyumri border detachment celebrated its 70th anniversary. On  this occasion and in connection with the fact that 28 May is  Border Guards Day we decided to meet with a representative of  the Gyumri Border Detachment and chat about the present times.  Our interlocutor is Lieutenant Colonel Pavel Igorevich Ilin,  deputy chief of the border detachment for personnel and work  with the staff.    [Arutyunyan] A few words about the history of the  detachment,  if you will.    [Ilin] Our detachment, the oldest on the territory of  Armenia, was formed in 1924. Two heroes of the Soviet Union:  Colonel Dudko, who fell in the fighting for Berlin, and Colonel  Leonov, chief of the detachment, who was posthumously awarded  the title of hero of the Soviet Union for the events of 15-16  March 1969 on Damanskiy Island on the Ussuri River, were raised  here.    [Arutyunyan] Previously the border troops were officially  called the border troops of the USSR KGB. What is the troops'  present status and what is their place in the overall system of  the armed forces of Russia?    [Ilin] Our relationship with the armed forces is relatively  undefined. An edict of the president of Russia has formed the  Federal Border Service, which is subordinate to the president of  the Russian Federation directly.    [Arutyunyan] It is symbolic that your holiday--Border Guards  Day--coincides in Armenia with our national  holiday--Independence Day. And independence begins with the  sanctity of the border. How in this sense do you see the  functions and missions of the border troops of Russia stationed  in Armenia?    [Ilin] The status and functions of the border troops here  are  defined by mutual agreements between the Russian Federation and  the Republic of Armenia. And the border troops' mission is to  defend Russia's interests on the territory of the Republic of  Armenia and to guard the exterior borders of the CIS--in this  case, the border with Turkey. And, in accordance with the  agreement, the troops are deployed here to carry out this  mission.    [Arutyunyan] We have already observed that there has always  been a friendly attitude toward the border guards in our city.  How are relations shaping up with the authorities and the public  currently?    [Ilin] We are building relations with the authorities at  practically all levels--from the leadership of the rayons  through Mr. Kocharyan, authorized government representative for  the Shirak zone.    They consider all our problems their own. And they settle  practically all the questions that we put to them for support  for the guarding of the borders. In the past 18 months there  have been no conflict situations with the local populace or any  provocations in respect to the border guards. We met just before  the detachment's anniversary with the leaders of almost all  enterprises of the city, and they all expressed a single  thought: The ties of sponsorship that had been established back  in the so-called stagnation times needed to be restored and more  meetings with representatives of the enterprises and  organizations needed to be held. We have already reserved  sponsorship for some enterprises.    [Arutyunyan] The image of the border guard was for many  years  here associated with that of the fair-haired Russian type. What  is the national composition of your detachment, say, now?    [Ilin] Representatives of 26-28 nationalities have  customarily served in our detachment. There are now, in fact,  just two--Russians and Armenians. More precisely, when draftees  come from Russia, we come across Bashkirs, say, but mainly  representatives of the two nationalities (we would add that the  fact that Armenians also serve in the unit could have been  guessed without the clarifying question: almost 100 vehicles at  the gate of the unit and attempts to squeeze through the gate  and the fence, with a throng at the checkpoint, in a word, the  painfully familiar native "Armenian landscape"--V.A.).    [Arutyunyan] We know from past years that the so-called  border regime was quite strict. What kind of changes have there  been in the essence of the border regime?    [Ilin] By a decision of the Government of Armenia a number  of  forces that used to enter the border zone now no longer do so,  and the procedure of the drafting of the papers for crossing the  line of engineer structures has been simplified. We are now  seeing, however, and the local leadership has appealed to us  repeatedly in this connection, that it is altogether necessary  to tighten the regime. This applies particularly to the area of  the Akhuryanskoye Reservoir and questions of fishing. For the  inhabitants of some villages have been issued permits for  agricultural work beyond the line of the engineer structures,  and they are not cultivating the land but fishing. On the other  hand, not a tightening up exactly but simply greater strictness  in the permit procedure is required. Because Turkey remains  Turkey, and questions of the safety of the inhabitants that work  in the vicinity of the border cannot be left unattended.    [Arutyunyan] Are the violations of the border and  provocations from "that side" frequent?    [Ilin] There are violations both on the part of Turkey and  from our rear.    [Arutyunyan] More detail, if you can: What are the  violations  from the rear?    [Ilin] These are mainly mentally defective people. If we  take  the border itself, however, we have on the part of the  contiguous territory the rustling of livestock and a violation  of the border regime almost daily. Rustling of livestock on our  territory. This also remains at the level of protests as yet--on  the part of the border commissar.    [Arutyunyan] Do such generally quite petty phenomena pursue  the actual aim of inflaming the atmosphere or are these simply  chance occurrences?    [Ilin] I would not say that the atmosphere on the border is  being inflamed on Turkey's part today, I could not today say  this. But there are instances of a violation of the border  regime that pursue the goal of a test of our strength and of the  border that we guard. Flights by Turkish combat aircraft along  the border, say.    [Arutyunyan] Living conditions in Armenia are quite  difficult  today. What is life like for the detachment under these  conditions?    [Ilin] We are attempting first and foremost to resolve the  lighting problem. There are border posts that have not had  lighting for months. In connection with the agreement signed on  15 March in Yerevan, the Government of Armenia has now allocated  us cash for the local purchase of flour and to pay for the  water, lighting, and the products of the meat-packing plant that  we purchase. But this is not enough for us, all the same. In  accordance with this agreement, Armenia will assume 50 percent  of the expenses on the maintenance of the troops, and the amount  that Armenia should contribute for the upkeep of the troops and  the border military units on the territory of Armenia has been  determined. There are problems with firewood and coal. The  firewood problem is being resolved, it would seem, the coal  problem, no. We are supplied with gasoline from Russia. There is  no water at all at our base in the village of Akhurchik, there  is no water supply.    [Arutyunyan] And how has the question of the employment and  education of the members of the families of the border guards  been resolved?    [Ilin] There is always work for our wives in the detachment,  this problem has been resolved. Positions to enable women to  work, on contract included, have been determined at the border  posts. We have our own kindergarten and our own high school,  which is attached to School 25 of the city of Sochi. We  recruited the teachers on a competitive basis--95 percent of  them are local, and there is a professor and candidate of  sciences.</p>

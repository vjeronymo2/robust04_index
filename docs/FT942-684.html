			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Reshuffle at Reed It was perhaps a backhanded compliment to the transformation that Mr Peter Davis has wrought at Reed International over the past eight years that the market reacted with such equanimity to his departure. Had Mr Davis quit in similar circumstances while Reed was still a sprawling conglomerate, then the company's shares would have been devastated. But such is the presumed solidity of the merged Reed Elsevier publishing empire, which Mr Davis was so instrumental in creating, that the market barely blinked. As the initial shock wore off, Reed's shares recovered sharply. Reassurances that there was nothing awry at the trading level clearly helped. Besides, the company is in a strong financial position. Shareholders can draw comfort from the collective leadership which is in place at Reed Elsevier. There is little reason to believe that the board will go wild on the acquisition front as it sizes up Ziff and Mead. That said, the loss of Mr Davis is undoubtedly a blow. It had seemed that Reed Elsevier was doing well in avoiding the political pitfalls that have bedevilled so many international mergers. The differences at Reed may indeed have been personal rather than cultural. Mr Davis was certainly not famed for sitting on his hands. But it is a pity that Reed's complement of heavyweight non-executive directors could not have helped defuse such tensions. Shareholders may yet regret the departure of an executive with strategic vision given the speed of change in the media world and the need for bold thinking.</p>

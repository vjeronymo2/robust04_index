			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Optimists predict little progress for poorest countries THE WORLD BANK cannot be faulted for its optimism. Over the past few years it has been preaching a new message: a combination of debt relief, trade liberalisation and less interventionist government can together revive the economic prospects of the developing countries. Many of these countries have acted on the bank's advice. So far the developed world has done little more than listen politely. Undaunted, the World Bank's latest economic forecasts assume that both developed and developing countries act on its recommendations. The results, published recently in this year's Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries report, are moderately pleasing. The average annual economic growth rate of low- and middle-income countries is expected to rise to 4.9 per cent in the 1990s, up from 3.2 per cent over the past decade. The east Asian countries are expected to have slower growth, though their recent performance has been exceptional. At first sight these conclusions may seem rather odd. The developed world is the main market for developing country exports, purchasing 75 per cent of their manufacturing exports. But the growth prospects for the industrialised countries look increasingly discouraging. Moreover, exports to the developed world are likely to be the main source of resources to finance new domestic investment. Net resource flows to the developing world fell in the 1980s, and the chances of a fall in real interest rates and a spurt of new lending look remote. So why should the bank be predicting faster economic growth? One reason is that it expects a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. It estimates that a 50 per cent fall in non-tariff barriers would raise developing country exports by dollars 50bn (pounds 28.2bn), almost equal to the total net flow of official development assistance in 1991. But the bank's confidence in the Gatt process may be misplaced. Developing country imports constitute only 3.1 per cent of the total consumption of the main developed countries. But the percentage of these imports covered by non-tariff barriers has grown in the past 10 years. If liberalisation rather than protectionism does prevail, the immediate gains will be unevenly shared. More than half the extra exports would accrue to east Asian countries. But the long-term impact could spread much wider. The link between growth in exports and in gross domestic product is strong, as the chart shows. Further liberalisation might encourage more governments to pursue the free-trade and market-friendly policies that have boosted growth in east Asia in recent decades. While the developing country share of labour-intensive manufactures doubled between 1965 and 1989, this increase was entirely due to the rise of east Asian economies. But other developing countries, in Latin America and more recently India, are now following their example. Yet the World Bank report contains little good cheer for sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of low-income countries are located. Weak and corrupt governments and the throttling burden of accumulated debts mean that most sub-Saharan countries have made little progress to date in liberalising their economies and upgrading the education and skills of their population. Instead, they remain highly dependent on primary commodity exports - manufacturing exports constitute only 19 per cent of total exports, against 69 per cent in east Asia. Those structural adjustment efforts that have been attempted, notably in Nigeria, have effectively ground to a halt; while creditor governments remain unwilling to agree to the Trinidad proposals for low-income country debt reduction. The World Bank expects the world's poorest countries merely to tread water over the next decade. Even if its relatively optimistic expectations are correct, GDP growth across Africa is barely expected to keep pace with population growth. Poverty will remain as entrenched as ever. If the bank is wrong, then real incomes per head will continue to fall. INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       UNITED STATES

----------------------------------------------------------------------- All series seasonally adjusted. Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan -    new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy -    no data available, UK -    unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.</p>

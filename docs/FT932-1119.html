			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Peng admits to heart condition Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, yesterday admitted for the first time that he had been sidelined for nearly two months with a heart condition, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. Previously Chinese officials had insisted he was suffering from a bad cold. Mr Li made reference to his health problem at the end of a meeting yesterday in Beijing with Mr Paul Keating, the visiting Australian prime minister. China's premier said he had suffered a bad cold in late April, and an ensuing medical check-up had 'showed that I also suffered from a minor heart condition'. 'I have now recovered quite well, following a period of medical treatment and rest. The doctors still advise me not to attend too many activities,' Mr Li said. His admission follows weeks of speculation about his health. He disappeared from view in late April and did not re-emerge until last week.</p>

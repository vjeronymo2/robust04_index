			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Lin Ying (2651 7751): "Transnational </F> Corporations Regard Chang Jiang Delta as Golden Area for  Investment"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 30 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Jiangsu  Province and cities like Shanghai and Nanjing, which are located  in the Chang Jiang Delta area, are some of the best places on  the mainland in terms of industry, agriculture, culture,  education, transportation, and telecommunications. The  development of Shanghai's Pudong has added greater value to  these places. No wonder transnational corporations regard this  as "a golden area" for investment.    According to relevant statistics, a total of 185  transnational corporations have set up 300 industrial and  commercial enterprises in the Chang Jiang Delta area with a  total investment of nearly $4 billion. These investment  projects include electronic telecommunications,  machine-building, automobile, computer, and biomedical  enterprises. The number of medium and small foreign companies  which have made investment there is even greater and the scope  of their investment is more extensive.    Shanghai is a place in which transnational corporations are  most interested in making investment. As early as 1980, the  Schindler Corporation of Switzerland set up the first elevator  plant in Shanghai and the operation of the plant has been quite  successful. After that, many other transnational corporations  also made investment in Shanghai one after another. To date,  129 transnational corporations have set up 206 large projects in  Shanghai and their total investment has reached $2.5 billion.  Last year was a peak year for investment. Forty-five  corporations signed 60 joint venture projects with enterprises  in Shanghai and their investment amounted to $1 billion. In the  first quarter of this year, another 11 transnational  corporations invested in 15 projects in Shanghai and their total  investment was close to $1 billion.    Of the transnational corporations which have made  investments  in Shanghai, U.S. corporations rank first in terms of the amount  of investment; then come those from Japan, Britain, and Germany.  With its development in the past four years and more, the U.S.  AT and T Corporation in Shanghai has become a backbone  enterprise in the modern telecommunications industry on the  mainland and its products account for a quarter of those on the  mainland market. The corporation has reaped considerable  profits. The Xerox Photocopier Corporation has 43 percent of  the mainland market. The profits made by a joint venture  involving the U.S. Carrier Corporation in Shanghai has reached a  total of 700 million yuan in six years.    Since the beginning of this year, some transnational  corporations have competed with one another to hold negotiations  in Shanghai on investment and cooperation. These include  American Express, Shell of Britain, Ciba Geigy Pharmaceutics of  Sweden, and so on. They plan to cooperate with Shanghai in  manufacturing telecommunications equipment, electrical machines,  cars, and medicines, and to issue credit cards.    Jiangsu Province takes up much of the Chang Jiang Delta and  has big cities like Nanjing, Wuxi, Nantong, Changzhou, and  Suzhou. Jiangsu is one of the mainland provinces which have  attracted the greatest amount of investment made by  transnational corporations. According to statistics, 56  transnational corporations have invested in Jiangsu at present  and their total investment is close to $1.5 billion. For  example, Japan's Mitsubishi has invested $115 million to set up  the Suzhou Lingkang Chemical Fiber Company Limited; Britain's  BOC Group has made investment in the Zhangjiagang Biouxi Gaseous  Industry Company Limited; Germany's Siemens Corporation has  invested in the Wuxi Siemens Power Station Automation Company  Limited; and Japan's Sharp Corporation has invested $50 million  to set up its solely-owned Changshu Sharp Office Machines  Company Limited. Besides, Japan's Iwai, Marubeni, C. Ito, Toyo,  and other financial groups have also invested large amounts of  money in various localities in Jiangsu and the average amount of  investment in each project has reached $20 million.    The investment made in Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu  Province, accounts for about half of the total foreign  investment made in the province. Many transnational  corporations have made investment jointly with Nanjing and set  up a number of large enterprises. These corporations include the  Phillips Corporation of the Netherlands, the Siemens Corporation  of Germany, and so on. The average amount of investment in each  project is about $15 million.    The momentum mentioned above indicates that investment made  by transnational corporations in the Chang Jiang Delta area is  in the ascendant.</p>

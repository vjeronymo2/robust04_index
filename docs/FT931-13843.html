			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Colorvision back to profit at Pounds 153,000 COLORVISION, the Liverpool-based retailer of television and satellite systems, returned to the black with profits of Pounds 153,000 before tax in the six months to September 30. However, last time's losses of Pounds 545,000 were caused by an exceptional debit of Pounds 808,000 - an adjustment from an understatement of creditors and provisions in prior years. Turnover grew to Pounds 26.75m (Pounds 24.1m) and operating losses were halved to Pounds 72,000 (Pounds 144,000) in what is the company's quieter trading period. Mr Neville Michaelson, chairman, said that the company had again increased market share, though more slowly than in the previous 12 months. He added that profitability had been adversely affected by shortages in the supply of satellites in the second half of the period. However, he said that the conditions for economic recovery were now more favourable than for several years. To reflect the seasonality of the company's trading, the interim dividend is reduced to 2.5p (3.1p), but the total is expected to be maintained at 5.6p. Earnings worked through at 0.5p (losses 1.7p) per share.</p>

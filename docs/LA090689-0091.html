			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'DAYS OF RAGE' DESERVES ALL THE ATTENTION  </P> <P> Rarely has a television program been as bitterly savaged before it aired. Yet  rarely has there been a program with a topic as volatile as this one.  </P> <P> The rage directed at Jo Franklin-Trout and her heavily tilted, but  still-valuable and intensely powerful documentary about the Palestinian  uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has almost obscured  the program itself.  </P> <P> That should end tonight when, at last, after delays and months of fiery  controversy, "Days of Rage: The Young Palestinians" is presented to the nation.  It arrives on PBS as the hot-potato centerpiece of a 2 1/2-hour spread (at 9  p.m. on Channels 28, 15 and 24) titled "Intifada: The Palestinians and Israel."  </P> <P> Framing the Palestinian-favoring "Days of Rage" are separately produced taped  pieces tilted toward Israel, the last of which is followed by a useful  40-minute panel discussion examining Franklin-Trout's program and the issues it  raises -- and doesn't raise. Costing almost as much as the 90-minute "Days of  Rage," these appendages appear to have been added as a sort of spin control, at  least in partial response to enormous advance criticism of the program from  mostly Jewish groups.  </P> <P> That criticism has swelled into a crusade to discredit both Franklin-Trout and  her program, at times approaching an ugly smear campaign. The lobbyists have  ranged from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith (calling the program  "factual manipulations") to the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles, which phoned  at least one TV critic with an offer to send him material critical of "Days of  Rage."  </P> <P> Yet "Days of Rage" is important and -- despite what its harshest critics say --  very much deserves this TV stage.  </P> <P> It offers faces you seldom see in closeup, and sounds you seldom hear. A  Palestinian girl: "I am 7 years old. My father was killed in front of my house  during the month of Ramadan."  </P> <P> It offers fresh voices, mostly from Palestinians usually omitted from the  slender sound bites of American TV.  </P> <P> "Days of Rage" is never more shocking than when chronicling the wretched  squalor and hopelessness in camps inhabited by many Palestinians in the  occupied territories. Or more indicting than when touring the rubble of a  Palestinian villager's house that was demolished as part of Israel's  controversial policy of collective punishment. Or more appalling than when  showing the terrible back wounds of a young boy said to have been beaten by  Israeli soldiers. Or more moving than when a schoolgirl says what she hopes to  gain from the intifada, the Arabic word for uprising: "an identity." Or more  fascinating than when letting Palestinians explain their strategies for the  intifada.  </P> <P> Her purpose, Franklin-Trout states tonight, is to show "who they (the young  Palestinians) are, what they are, what they want and how they intend to get it,  and what end for the crisis now seems possible." Bravo to that.  </P> <P> But not to all of "Days of Rage," which, unfortunately, is not only a trial of  Israeli policy in the occupied territories, but also one in which, almost  always, only the prosecution's case is presented.  </P> <P> Documentaries with strong points of view only strengthen a society that  purports to cherish freedom of expression. Moreover, some of the charges here  are echoed by some human rights groups. Michael H. Posner, executive director  of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, says in "Days of Rage":  </P> <P> "From a human rights point of view, there are some particularly disturbing  problems (in) the use of live ammunition (and) the ongoing practice of beatings  (by Israeli troops), which seem excessive in some situations."  </P> <P> Yet the charges are so strong that granting Israelis the opportunity to  respond, at least generically, should have been a given, a sliver of fairness  that "Days of Rage" could have accommodated without softening its case.  </P> <P> To a large extent, "Days of Rage" is a succession of horror stories from  Palestinians accusing Israelis of heinous acts in trying to put down the  intifada. Typical: "They burst into our house, the occupation army. They beat  my father, my mother, my sisters."  </P> <P> Franklin-Trout, who is also the reporter and narrator for her program, is an  excellent documentary storyteller. What "Days of Rage" lacks most, however, is  context.  </P> <P> Some samples:  </P> <P>  -- When Israel gained statehood, the Arabs "were enraged" and "war broke out,"  says Franklin-Trout, making "war" sound as blameless as a case of measles.  </P> <P>  -- Also omitted in Franklin-Trout's shorthand history is any mention of  Palestinians also being victimized by Jordan and Syria.  </P> <P>  -- A Palestinian relief worker finds Israelis "obsessed by security," as if  there is no history of Arab terrorism directed against Jews. And on this  program, moreover, there isn't.  </P> <P>  -- We hear about the Palestinian Liberation Organization's "alleged dark and  bloody history," the "alleged" being a softening word excluded from charges  against Israelis.  </P> <P>  -- Outside a facility where Palestinians are held by Israelis for months  without being charged, Franklin-Trout hears stories of abuse from Palestinians.  "They would put him in jail, a small kid?" she asks, incredulously. Small kids  are casualties of the intifada. You wish that just once, however,  Franklin-Trout would play devil's advocate and ask Palestinians about  provocation, as with the man who tells her that Israeli soldiers shoot  Palestinians "for simply walking in the street."  </P> <P> The shorter taped pieces that precede and follow "Days of Rage" were prepared  by New York's WNET-TV, the PBS "presenting" station for "Intifada: The  Palestinians and Israel." Mostly, they are an Israeli's-eye-view that attempts  to justify Israeli policies and actions in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> Also produced by WNET, and ably and fairly moderated by Hodding Carter, the  panel discussion is a spirited debate whose participants are Alan L. Keyes, an  assistant secretary of State and ambassador to the U.N. Economic and Social  Council in the Reagan Administration; Seymour D. Reich, international president  of B'nai B'rith; Richard W. Murphy, who was assistant secretary of State for  Near East and East Asian Affairs from 1983 until recently; Jerusalem Post  correspondent Walter Ruby, and James J. Zogby, executive director of the Arab  American Institute.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the acrimony surrounding "Days of Rage" is sure to linger.  </P> <P> Speaking from Washington, Franklin-Trout dismissed an article to appear in the  Sept. 18 edition of The New Republic as the "final salvo" in the offensive to  undercut her program. Written by Steven Emerson, a senior editor at U.S. News  &amp; World Report, the article charges that "Days of Rage" was made "in close  cooperation" with the Arab American Cultural Foundation, on whose board  Franklin-Trout sits.  </P> <P> Denying the charge, Franklin-Trout said that she joined the foundation's board  "a year after I finished the film." She also rejected the article's assertion  that she had sold the foundation rights for her program's "international  distributuion and national distribution after it had been aired by PBS."  </P> <P> Franklin-Trout has said she financed "Days of Rage" entirely from sales of  cassettes of her previous documentaries to various organizations, including the  foundation. PBS has confirmed that it rejected Franklin-Trout's suggestion to  include the names of those organizations in the "Days of Rage" credits because  such a listing would have gone against PBS policy.  </P> <P> Perhaps even more injurious to "Days of Rage" was last month's public criticism  of the program by Posner of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. "I've  disassociated myself from it," said Posner, who added that he stood by his  comments made to Franklin-Trout in "Days of Rage," but faulted the program for  being "highly simplistic" and excluding "present Israeli mainstream views."  </P> <P> Franklin-Trout labeled Posner's criticism "disingenuous." It's a word that  somehow fits much of the controversy shrouding "Days of Rage."  </P></p>

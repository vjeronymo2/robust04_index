			<p>BFN     [Text] A communique issued by the National Union of Malian  Workers [UNTM] Executive Bureau notes that despite the meeting  in Algiers between the government and the Unified Movement and  Front of Azaouad, workers and their families are still  threatened by insecurity throughout the country.    The UNTM Executive Bureau recommends that recruitment  exercises in the civil service be carried out strictly in  accordance with legal provisions, without ethnic, racial, or  regional considerations. The UNTM also condemns any attempts to  divide the national territory and urgently requests the presence  of the Army throughout the entire national territory.</p>

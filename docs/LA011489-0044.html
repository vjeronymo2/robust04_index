			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAGON PENN'S FATHER ARRESTED BY U.S. AGENTS IN DRUG PROBE  </P> <P> Thomas Penn, father of Sagon Penn, was arrested Friday by federal undercover  agents after allegedly agreeing to sell them 3 pounds of rock cocaine for  $54,000.  </P> <P> Special Agent in Charge Charlie Hill, who heads the San Diego office of the  Drug Enforcement Administration, said Penn, 50, was arrested outside his Logan  Avenue apartment when he demanded the money from agents sitting inside an  unmarked car. Hill said 12 people were arrested in the case, which stemmed from  a federal indictment that will remain sealed until the suspects are arraigned  in U. S. District Court next week. Penn was named in the indictment.  </P> <P> According to Hill, Penn and five other suspects were arrested at Penn's  apartment. Agents recovered about 3 pounds of rock cocaine and 3 pounds of  cocaine powder at Penn's residence, Hill said. Although one suspect was armed  with a .22-caliber handgun and agents found a .38-caliber revolver in Penn's  apartment, the arrests occurred without incident, said Hill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Federal Penalty  </P> <P> Normally, the federal penalty for possessing more than 50 grams of rock cocaine  with intent to sell is 10 years to life in prison and up to $4 million in  fines. But a recently enacted federal Omnibus Crime bill doubles that penalty  because the cocaine was being sold within 1,000 feet of a school, in this case  Knox Elementary, Hill said.  </P> <P> Hill declined to release any more details of the case because the indictment is  still under seal, but said that Penn and the others had been under  investigation for some time. He said that agents were sent to Penn's apartment  to arrest several people named in the indictment. When they arrived, they  negotiated with Penn to purchase 3 pounds of rock cocaine, Hill said.  </P> <P> The agents reported that Penn instructed them to leave for a while and return  later after he and other accomplices finished converting cocaine powder to rock  cocaine. When the agents returned, Penn walked outside and asked agents inside  an unmarked car to pay him $54,000 for the rock cocaine, Hill said. Penn and  five others in the apartment were promptly arrested.  </P> <P> Clyde L. Spears, 36, identified by Hill as a gang member, is alleged to be  Penn's drug source. Spears was among the suspects arrested.  </P> <P> Penn's son, Sagon Penn, was found not guilty in 1987 in the March 31, 1985,  shooting that left one policeman dead and another policeman and a civilian  wounded. Two juries found that the policemen had provoked the incident by using  racial slurs and unnecessary force when they stopped Penn for questioning.  </P> <P> After Sagon Penn's arrest and during his two sensational trials, Thomas Penn  repeatedly called for better relations between police and black residents of  Southeast San Diego.  </P></p>

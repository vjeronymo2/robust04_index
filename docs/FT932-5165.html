			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / The pursuit of happiness can lead to a red Ferrari, and to early middle-age: Nicholas Denton finds Hungary's Young Democrats filling their coffers oddly ALL a retired Hungarian manual worker receives in a year as state pension is the equivalent of Dollars 1,000. This sum can also hire a red Ferrari 348ts  -including tax, mileage and heated leather seats - from Budapest's luxury rental company Jet Car - for a day. Such is eastern Europe's jarring capitalism. But Jet Car is owned by Hungary's Young Democrats and car hire earnings may cost the fresh-faced opposition liberals dear in public affection. Renting out Ferraris - and Porsches, Rolls-Royces, optional chauffeurs and bodyguards - is a lucrative business in status-conscious Hungary and meshes with the twenty-something liberals' unembarrassed faith in 'freedom for the pursuit of happiness in a free market economy.' Still, such conspicuous extravagance is galling for the losers, often embittered and envious, from Hungary's painful transition to the free market. The Young Democrats accept that ownership of Jet Car is politically damaging  -particularly so because the Young Democrats and their leader Mr Viktor Orban (pictured left) began in politics as idealistic anti-communist student radicals and it is their youthful innocence that took them to the top of the opinion polls. The image of purity, an appealing one in a country which assumes most politicians are corrupt, is now tarnished and jibes that the Young Democrats are a bunch of 'yuppies disguised as revolutionaries' have gained bite. For it has emerged also, in the last fortnight, that the Young Democrats have funded their business ventures out of a Ft700m (Dollars 8m) property windfall obtained by slick manipulation of Hungary's party financing laws. The scandals matter because the Young Democrats, with 8.9 per cent of the vote in 1990, may hold the balance of power after elections next year. Already putting out feelers are the governing conservatives of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, unpopular and weakened by the breakaway this week of extreme nationalists led by Mr Istvan Csurka. The Young Democrats' influence in power-broking depends on their electoral chances and advisers reckon the scandals will cost up to 10 percentage points in the polls. Even so, more money in party coffers is essential if the Young Democrats are to mount an effective campaign in 1994, officials say privately. As for loss of innocence - well, age catches up with everyone. The Young Democrats recently lifted the party ban on middle-aged members. Their posters had the grace to admit: 'We're getting older.' At least adulthood has its compensations. Jet Car only rents out its Ferrari to over-25s.</p>

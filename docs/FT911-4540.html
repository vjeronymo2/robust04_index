			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: GTE in sharp fall after Dollars 245m one-off charge GTE, which operates the largest non-Bell telephone system in the US, yesterday revealed a sharp fall in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 200m, compared with Dollars 407m in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per cent share slipped from 46 cents to 22 cents, writes Nikki Tait in New York. However, the market was already aware GTE would take a one-time charge, resulting from its merger with Contel, and had expected the bottom-line reduction. GTE said that, exclusive of the Dollars 245m one-off charge and a compensatory gain on the transfer of minority interests in certain cellular properties, net income worked out at Dollars 404m, or 45 cents a share. This, it said, represented a 7 per cent rise on the first quarter of 1990 - once the previous year's results were adjusted. First-quarter sales totalled Dollars 5.22bn, with Dollars 3.79bn coming from the telephone operations.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Irish institutions rescue Greencore placement - Dublin stock exchange issues statement expressing its concern over 'misleading information' THE PLACEMENT of the Irish government's 30.4 per cent holding in Greencore, the sugar, milling and malting group, was salvaged last night when the Bank of Ireland and Irish institutional investors stepped in to take the 25m shares on offer at the original price of IPounds 2.75 (Pounds 2.69). The placement was first carried out on April 30, but came close to being unwound after Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, announced in parliament on Thursday that the brokers, the Dublin firm of Davy Stockbrokers, had later informed him that they had sold 7m shares to parties connected with Davy which had created legal difficulties. This resulted in the suspension of Greencore's shares on the London and Dublin stock exchanges on Thursday. Mr Brian Davy, chairman of Davy, said that in reaching the new deal 'we started from scratch. The new list of placees is significantly different from the original as a number of institutions pulled out. There is now a much larger Irish representation'. He said the Bank of Ireland had taken 9.6m shares, and Davy, or persons connected with the firm, now had no holding. The Bank of Ireland said last night that 'it is not the Bank's intention to be a short-term holder and it intends to act responsibly and co-operate fully with the company in managing the holding'. The bank's interest in Greencore now exceeds 25 per cent. Greencore said that it was to seek early shareholder approv-al to raise an existing 15 per cent shareholding limit to 30 per cent, and had requested the stock exchange to lift the suspension of its shares with effect from Monday. The Irish stock exchange yesterday announced that the market had been misled in the first placement and that the conduct of Davy was under investigation. In a statement it said 'The committee of the Irish Stock Exchange believes that the market was trading in the shares of Greencore on the basis of misleading information following the announcements made on Friday April 30 relating to the placing of the government holding of Greencore by Davy Stockbrokers. The Irish Stock Exchange views this matter and subsequent events with extreme concern'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, attacked Davy, saying 'I deplore the manner in which this placement took place . . . it was not done in a professional manner.' Mr Ahern has been deeply embarrassed by the affair, having announced on April 30 that the placement had been completed successfully. He told parliament on Thursday, however, that he had since been informed by Davy that the original arrangements had been revised. SG Warburg has denied lending funds to Davy for it to buy 2.45m shares. Unlike the London market, Dublin broking firms act only as agents for clients, and are not involved in market making themselves by holding blocks of shares for later resale. Mr John Laurie, the investment manager for Scottish Provident, said that his participation in the placement 'would have been conditional on the placing being completed. I would expect to have been informed if it was not.' He said, however, that Scottish Provident would go ahead with its purchase. Mr Des Doran, the investment manager of Standard Life also said that he would be going ahead and if necessary would buy an additional stake. Mr Davy said of the original deal, 'we had a profit or loss sharing arrangement with Warburg'. Asked whether that amounted to a share-support deal, he said, 'we decided to unravel the deal at the earliest opportunity as we were concerned'. Mr Ivan Yates, opposition finance spokesman for the Fine Gael party, who on Thursday called for Mr Ahern's resignation said 'It is very important to reestablish the credibility of the the Irish market and it is the responsibility of the the stock exchange and the government to do this.' Mr Ahern said that he had no intention of resigning.</p>

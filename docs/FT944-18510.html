			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Etam - Other Companies The UK fashion retailer is expected to deliver an increase of more than 50 per cent in interim profits to Pounds 3.7m (Dollars 5.8m) on Thursday. The company's strategy of defending margins in the face of heavy discounting by rival fashion retailers is thought to be paying off. Shares in the group, which is heavily weighted towards the second half, have risen from the year's low of 217p in April to well over 300p.</p>

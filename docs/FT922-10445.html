			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (19): Investment in infrastructure is being given priority - South Korea: Construction AT TIMES it must appear as if South Korea has become one vast building site. Cement sales in the country last year averaged just over 1 ton for each member of the 43m population - a world record for per capita consumption. Consumption per head of population was ahead of both Taiwan and Italy, previously the two biggest, according to Korean cement manufactures. The sharp rise in sales of this most basic of building materials - up a fifth last year - vividly illustrates the dramatic growth in the country's construction output since the 1980s. Cranes regularly punctuate the skyline. Around almost every corner there are subways, roads, harbours, office blocks, apartments and dams under construction. Preliminary design work has begun on a new international airport likely to cost several billion dollars at Yong Jong do island near the port of Inchon close to Seoul. Plans are advanced for a new high-speed rail link, as well as several new motorways and at least two new ports. There is also substantial investment in improved water and sewerage facilities, a trebling in the size of the Seoul subway system, a large power station building programme and the proposed electrification of 50 per cent of the rail network by the year 2001. Central government spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GNP is forecast to almost double from 1.7 per cent to 3 per cent between 1991 and 1996. Priority is being given to investment in infrastructure, particularly transport to relieve congestion and remove bottlenecks which are preventing commerce and industry from expanding. The government also wants to encourage investment in less economically successful areas of the country, notably the south-west region. A special task force has been established by the president to identify the most important projects to be built during the next five years. It has proposed that nearly 40 trillion won (USDollars 52bn) might be spent by the government between now and 1996. It proposes this would be divided between: Roads: where about 19 trillion won is expected to be spent on constructing 450km of new roads and upgrading a similar length of existing roads. The programme would include starting work on three new motorways, a 353km expressway between Seoul and Mokpu costing 3 trillion won; a 289km highway between Ch'unch'on and Taegu costing 2 trillion won and a 160km motorway between Taejun and Chinju. Railways: some 8 trillion won is expected to be invested in upgrading and electrifying the existing network and on starting work on the Seoul to Pusan high-speed railway which is expected to cost 5.8 trillion won when it is completed, towards the end of the century Water: about 7 trillion won is planned to be spent between now and 1996 on improving drinking water and installing new water services to less economically successful regions to facilitate industrial and commercial development. The government also intends to extend sewerage treatment from about 35 per cent of the population to about 70 per cent by the mid-1990s. Port development: about 3 trillion won is expected to be spent on completing the expansion of Pusan port on the south-east coast and for the construction of two new ports at Kwang Yang, also in the south-east, and at Asan, about 100km south-west of Seoul. Longer-term, there plans to build two more new ports, next to each other, at Kun San and Chang Hang, also on the west coast. The Ministry of Energy and Resources, which has a separate budget funded out of a special petroleum revenue tax, plans to invest 70 trillion won by the year 2000 on new power stations and transmission equipment. The country currently runs nine nuclear power stations. Last year, these provided nearly half the country's electricity. By the year 2000, South Korea expects to have another 11 nuclear stations either built or under construction, making it one of the world's biggest users of nuclear power. Developments such as these could provide opportunities for international contractors where technology and design skills may have to be imported for more sophisticated projects. Bechtel, the large US engineering group, for example, is providing preliminary designs for the new international airport at Yong Jong do island. GEC-Alsthom of the UK and France, Siemens of Germany and Mitsubishi and Marubeni of Japan are among bidders competing to provide the basic design and some of the more advanced equipment for rolling stock and signalling for the 409km Seoul to Pusan high-speed rail link. Most of the civil engineering work will be provided by Korean companies such as Hyundai and Daewoo, which during the past 15 years have become highly competitive and proficient in the broad construction skills of pouring concrete and erecting steel - both in domestic and international markets. Opportunities for international contractors will therefore be restricted to niche areas where technology has still to be developed locally or where there has been insufficient domestic demand to encourage the development of new skills. Korea is expected to remain a growth market for international construction for the next five to 10 years, even if some of the current ambitious proposals fail to go ahead.</p>

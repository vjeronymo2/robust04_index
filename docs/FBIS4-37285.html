			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 17 June (SUNA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton's envoy, Melissa Wells, will head for Washington to  submit her report to the U.S. Administration on the talks she  held with President Lieutenant General al-Bashir and the heads  of the four Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and  Development states, which concentrated on the issue of peace and  humanitarian affairs.    The U.S. envoy left Sudan on 15 June for Nairobi to meet  with  rebel leaders, thereby completing her report, which will embrace  the different viewpoints on the issues of relief and peace.    This was stated in Sudan by Mityang Malwal, the director of  the peace department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  speaking in today's edition of AL INQADH AL-WATANI.    He said the U.S. envoy's program included another mission on  the issue of relief, which would take her to Geneva to hold  talks with international donor agencies. His excellency the  ambassador said that he accompanied the U.S. envoy to Kadugli in  southern Kurdufan state, and to Wau in the western state of Bahr  al-Ghazal, where they toured refugee camps and learned about  different relief organizations' activities. His excellency said  the situation was stable, and that relief work and services to  refugees were continuing.    He said the envoy listened to a report from the Catholic  archbishop in Wau, workers from the Islamic Call organization,  and the Muwaffaq Charitable Organization, which he said  confirmed that there was a great degree of peaceful coexistence  between Muslims and Christians.    Mr. Mityang reiterated the government's commitment to the  passage of relief supplies, agreements on humanitarian  activities, and the provision of food to all war victims in the  south.    His excellency said the government delegation was prepared  for the forthcoming round of negotiations in Nairobi, and denied  reports carried by western media that hopes had dimmed over  Sudan's participation in the forthcoming negotiations,  especially if the government recaptured Nimule. He said Sudan  would participate in the negotiations even if all Sudanese  territory was liberated, because peace is the principal pillar  upon which stability and development rest.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions BOXMORE International, the Northern Ireland-based packaging group, has enjoyed a strong share price performance over the past two years. Indeed, over the last 12 months, the shares have outperformed the market by 80 per cent. Robert Campbell, finance director, has sold 60,000 shares at 187p but this still leaves him with 600,000 shares. Over the last two years, Greenalls Group has moved away from its traditional brewing base to become more involved with hotel management. The current rights issue is aimed at providing funds for the group to expand by acquiring hotels at depressed prices. The sales indicated in the table are the nil-paid shares and the proceeds will be used towards taking up the rights. The share price of hotel operator Friendly Hotels has been in decline throughout the year. Henry Edwards, chairman and chief executive, bought 100,000 of the 7.5 per cent preference shares at 66p. He bought a further 50,000 preference shares and 50,000 ordinary at 94p, but both purchases were made for a non-beneficial holding.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                  Sector    Shares         Value   directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Boxmore Intl              Pack     60,000           112       1 MacFarlane Clansman       Pack     40,000            75       1 Microvitec                Elec    100,000            25       1 Raine Industries           C&amp;C     50,000            47       1 Greenalls Grp NP          Brew  4,082,364         1,550       2 Wood (JD)                 Prop     50,000            10       1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AIM Group                 EngA    230,000           281       5 Fisher (Albert)           FdRe     60,000            25       2 Lloyds Chemist            Stor     14,600            32       6 Meggitt                   EngG     20,000            17       1 Porth Group               Misc    860,743            15       1 United Uniforms ADR       Text     22,000  Dollars  124       2 Premier Consolid           O&amp;G    182,376            31       4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

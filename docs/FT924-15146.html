			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: GM productivity lags behind Ford and Chrysler THE DRASTIC slimming regime necessary to make General Motors competitive against its main US and Japanese rivals was underscored yesterday by a survey showing its vehicle assembly productivity lagging far behind fellow Detroit companies Ford Motor and Chrysler. The report, compiled by Harbour and Associates, a Detroit-based vehicle industry consultancy, showed Ford to have the greatest productivity among the US Big Three, as measured by assembly workers per vehicle. Ford was estimated to have 3.01 workers per vehicle, compared to 3.76 for Chrysler and 4.55 for General Motors. In 1989, when Harbour last undertook an industry study, the respective figures were 3.25, 4.58 and 4.88. Mr Jim Harbour, who heads the consultancy, said yesterday that 'Ford's productivity is equal to any transplant (Japanese assembly plant) in the US. Chrysler is getting better very fast. It has improved enormously over the last few years. General Motors is standing still.' General Motors has announced plans to cut 74,000 blue and white collar jobs by between now and 1995, but Mr Harbour estimated yesterday that some 90,000 jobs might have to go to make the company competitive with Ford. These comprised 54,000 jobs in its vehicle assembly, body stamping, engine and transmission manufacturing works, and possibly another 15,000 salaried staff and 20,000 in components operations. *The Harbour Report, 1989 to 1992, Dollars 150, Harbour and Associates, 900 Wilshire Drive, Suite 111, Troy, Michigan 48084.</p>

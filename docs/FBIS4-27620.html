			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The U.S. Imperialists Are the Criminals </F> Who Are Encouraging the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"]    [Text] As a needle in a sack still pierces, it can no  longer be possible to hide the fact that the United States is  the mastermind of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.    As has already been reported, the SANKEI SHINBUN carried on  18 May an article entitled "The United States has Exported  Nuclear-Related Equipment to Eight Countries Suspected To Be  Engaged in Nuclear Development--There Is Even Criticism This  Violates the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]." The  article quotes a 17 May report by the General Accounting Office  [of the United States] that the United States had exported more  than 1,500 pieces of material and equipment, which can diverted  to the production of nuclear weapons, to various countries,  including Israel, from fiscal year 1988 to 1992. This is a very  grave development of the situation, which can make the NPT  itself a scrap of paper, and is an intolerable criminal act that  can arouse a high degree of alertness from the international  community.    Until now, as a signatory of the NPT, the U.S. imperialists  have said that they are prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear  weapons. In reality, however, this is a falsehood and it has now  been fully disclosed that the United States is none other than a  criminal state that is encouraging nuclear proliferation.    As everyone knows the NPT stipulates that signatories cannot  hand over equipment that can be used for the production of  nuclear weapons--including nuclear weapons, of course, or other  nuclear explosive devices--to other countries. This  notwithstanding, the U.S. imperialists have not only  indiscriminately exported materials and equipment necessary for  the production of nuclear weapons to various countries, while  ruthlessly violating the NPT, but also turned South Korea into  the Far East's largest nuclear powder magazine by introducing  about 1,000 nuclear weapons into South Korea alone.    In addition, recently the U.S. imperialists have continued  introducing numerous lethal weapons, including Patriot  missiles--weapons of mass destruction--and assault helicopter  Apaches, into South Korea, and mobilized them in the area along  the military demarcation line, thereby running wild in  preparations for a nuclear war.    Such acts by the U.S. imperialists are creating a big  obstacle to building a nuclear-free world and are seriously  threatening the existence of mankind.    This clearly shows that the U.S. imperialists are the  masterminds who are encouraging the proliferation of nuclear  weapons and the basic source of nuclear calamity upon mankind.    What cannot be overlooked is the fact that the U.S.  imperialists, the masterminds of the proliferation of nuclear  weapons, are making an issue of the peaceful use of our nuclear  energy while shamelessly talking about the need to abide by the  NPT by finding fault with our nonexistent, so-called nuclear  issue.    We cannot but say this is a brazen-faced thievish logic like  a thief crying: Stop thief!    Starting with antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuverings, the  United States, the ringleader of nuclear proliferation, is  trying to give us a title of a nuclear criminal by artificially  fabricating a falsehood named North Korea's nuclear issue. This  is really ridiculous.    In actuality, what should be regarded seriously at the  moment  is the United States, which is preventing a nuclear-free world  by exporting nuclear-related equipment to potential countries  with nuclear weapons.    As a criminal state that is proliferating nuclear weapons,  the United States should be judged in the culprit's dock of the  international community.    The U.S. imperialists should not find fault with our  peace-loving Republic, but apologize to the international  community for their own criminal act of violating the NPT and  encouraging nuclear proliferation, and should no longer apply  the brake on the building of a nuclear-free world.</p>

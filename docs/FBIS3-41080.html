			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Eduardo Luis Gonzalez, director of international  affairs of the Secretariat for Drug Addiction Prevention of the  Argentine Presidency, is in Cuba to discuss with members of the  Cuban Committee Against Drug Trafficking the signing of an  accord for the fight against drugs. This accord may be finalized  within two months.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] I believe that it will be  completed before the year is over. We expect to complete this  accord in a couple of months. We are aware that Cuba does not  have a drug problem on the scale of Argentina's but we believe  it will be useful since the world is growing smaller;  international tourism brings both advantages and disadvantages.  The accord is a contribution we will like to fulfill. [end  recording]    Cuba has signed similar agreements with 21 countries and the  accord with the Argentine Presidency Secretariat for Drug  Addiction Prevention and Fight Against Drug Trafficking is  another effort of the Cuban Government to join international  programs against drugs.</p>

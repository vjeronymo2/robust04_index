			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Struggling Bank Summa faces deadline BANK Summa, suspended from clearing operations last Friday with bad debts exceeding Rp1,000bn (Dollars 313m), had no immediate prospect of resuming normal activity, according to Dr Adrianus Mooy, governor of Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank. In an interview, Dr Mooy accepted that others among Indonesia's 215 banks faced problems of bad debt and poor management, although not on the scale of Bank Summa. The sector's bad and doubtful debts, excluding Bank Summa, amount to about Rp7,400bn or 6.3 per cent of the sector's loans, according to BI officials. 'It's very important for the banks to look ahead and see whether they can still survive . . . If they can survive but only for a short period, they should start thinking about the way out. One of the ways, of course, is merging,' he said. 'Very soon all these banks will be screened . . . through the application of prudential regulations,' Dr Mooy added. Banks have been told to increase their capital to 7 per cent of risk-weighted assets, up from 5 per cent, by next March. He said that Bank Summa, the country's 10th largest private bank and owned by the Soeryadjaya family, had failed to keep to a plan agreed with BI for the injection of new capital. The first of three instalments, scheduled in three-month intervals beginning last September, had not been made. When suspended, Bank Summa also owed Rp66bn to BI and Rp15bn in inter-bank lending. 'They have to come up with a big bank solution, not only to solve the deficit they hold with us, but also to meet the action plan. This has to be done very soon, because if not I see no life in Bank Summa,' Dr Mooy warned. He said 17 private banks were negotiating to raise more than Rp150bn, in order to take over Bank Summa's small-scale depositors with performing loans. This would save depositors but make Bank Summa's restructuring even more difficult, he noted, adding that over half the bank's bad debt is owed by private companies in which the Soeryadjayas hold an interest. Dr Mooy said unless Bank Summa received new money quickly, its problems would become 'even more impossible'. The alternative, he added, was for BI 'to ask the bank officially to discontinue operations'. Mr William Soeryadjaya, who heads Bank Summa, was meeting BI officials late yesterday and has already taken steps to raise new finance. Last Friday 40m shares in Astra International, which dominates Indonesia's automotive sector and in which the Soeryadjayas held a 76 per cent stake, were sold for Rp400bn. BI officials say the shares were pledged to state-owned Bank Dagang Negara, against loans to the Soeryadjayas. Astra said yesterday it was unaware who had bought the shares, equivalent to 16.5 per cent of the company's capital. Bankers say, however, the Soeryadjayas recently informed banks they planned to divest 60m shares in three equal blocks to Toyota of Japan, Danareksa, an Indonesian state-owned mutual trust, and to one of four charitable foundations chaired by President Suharto.</p>

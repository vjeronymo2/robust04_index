			<p>BFN     [Text] NEW DELHI, May 25 (AFP) -- Indian authorities have  halted the construction of two nuclear power projects after a  suspected design flaw caused the collapse of a reactor dome at  the Kaiga plant in the southern state of Karnataka.    A. Gopalakrishnan, chief of the Atomic Energy Regulatory  Board, said in a statement Tuesday that work on the four nuclear  reactors being built in Kaiga and Rawatbhata in the northern  desert state of Rajasthan had been stopped.    He said the move was related to the May 13 collapse of the  concrete reactor dome in Kaiga which left 14 workers injured.  Nearly 40 percent of the 130-tonne dome fell down.    A probe has been ordered into the incident, blamed on  possible design and construction flaws. All four nuclear  reactors on which work has stopped have the same design.    The dome's function is to prevent the escape of radiation in  case of an accident.    Gopalakrishnan clarified that the Kaiga project was still  under construction and no nuclear fuel or heavy water had been  transferred to the plant.    "Hence there is no question of any radioactivity release or  radiological impact due to the incident," he said.    But the temporary halt to construction would help  authorities  review the dome design and construction methods to correct any  flaws, Gopalakrishnan said, adding similar dome failures had  taken place in the United States.    Findings of the probe ordered into the incident will be made  available in two months.    India's seven existing nuclear power plants were closed for  inspection in July 1993 after a fire broke out at the Narora  station in northern India.</p>

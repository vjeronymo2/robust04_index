			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Moaning minnies find a sympathetic ear - The objectives of the newly launched Complaints Task Force THE CITIZEN'S Charter has found a new ally in the struggle to raise the quality of the UK's public services - the whingeing Pom. For generations the great British moaner has been an object of ridicule and even the target of a wartime advertising campaign, Don't Be A Moaning Minnie. Top of the list for the professional grouser are public services such as British Rail and the privatised utilities including British Telecommunications. The Cabinet Office Citizen's Charter Unit wants them to use consumer complaints to improve services. Mr David Davis, the junior public service minister, said yesterday: 'Complaints are a valuable management tool in identifying weak areas in service provision.' He was launching a Complaints Task Force to help the public services improve their handling of disgruntled customers. An earlier task force set sail to the south Atlantic to liberate the Falkland Islands from the Argentinian invader. This task force also has a hard mission - to come up with the perfect complaints system. Mr Davis said people in the public services should not be defensive about complaints but should see them as an opportunity to improve themselves. He should know. After complaints about the chancellor's management of the economy he was promoted in the recent cabinet reshuffle from junior whip to his new post as Lord Whitelaw's deputy. He has already been tipped as a future prime minister. It is a far cry from Mrs Thatcher's heyday, when Mr Bernard Ingham, then No 10's irascible press supremo, used to lambast the moaning minnies who complained about unpopular government decisions. He once memorably likened Lord Pym, then lord president, to Mona Lott for expressing mild dissidence. The Citizen's Charter Unit helpfully provided examples of how responding positively to complaints had improved particular services. The Employment Service had redesigned its offices so that 'customers' (the unemployed) could enjoy more privacy during interviews with staff. This was in response to complaints from the customers that other people were listening in when they were discussing their personal details. How had the complaint been identified? By listening in on the customers, of course. Lady Wilcox, the businesswoman who has been making waves at the National Consumer Council, will command the new task force. She will lead a six-person team of ombudspeople and customer service specialists in drawing up a whinger's charter. She wants to make sure that the Citizen's Charter is about more than being 'fobbed off with a fiver' when things go wrong. 'People want to know that their complaints will lead to the service being improved,' she said. She may, however, be misjudging why the British are so fond of complaining. As Mona Lott used to say: 'It's being so miserable as keeps us going.'</p>

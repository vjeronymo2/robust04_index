			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhou Wei (0719 4850): "Third Plenary Session </F> Gets Favorable Reviews in Hong Kong"]    [Text] The 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee was held in Beijing on 11 November as the whole world  watched. The Hong Kong economy is so intimately linked to its  Chinese counterpart that they sink or swim together. Moreover,  the meeting took place as the fast-growing Chinese economy  successfully pulled off a "soft-landing," meaning that it has  been able to grow rapidly yet steadily. Economic reform in China  too has been enormously successful and is about to enter the  most critical phase, which will be a shot in the arm for the  Hong Kong economy. For all these reasons, the meeting naturally  attracted the utmost interest in Hong Kong. During the past  month, the Hong Kong media printed article after article on the  convening of the 3d Plenary Session, analyzing, discussing, and  speculating on what new measures the Chinese would take to  develop the market economy and deepen reform.  <H5>  An Immensely Significant Document </H5>   It is widely agreed in Hong Kong's economic and theoretical  circles and among people in the media that the plenary session  was being held at an opportune time. The "Decision on Certain  Issues Relating to the Establishment of a Socialist Market  Economy," which was discussed at the meeting, is an enormously  significant programmatic document. It offers a penetrating  analysis and clear exposition of a string of important  ideological and theoretical issues relating to the development  of the Chinese economy and the deepening of reform in the next  stage. It achieves a consensus and lays down important decisions  on how to create a basic framework for a socialist market  economy by zeroing in on the essential areas. It will certainly  push economic development to a new high, the most basic  guarantee of the long-term and steady development of the Hong  Kong economy and its prosperity.    To establish a socialist market economy, the 3d Plenary  Session called for the deepening of reform in a wide range of  areas, including banking, financial administration and taxation,  investment, foreign trade, state enterprises, social security,  agriculture, and scientific and technical education. Essentially  it will include, first of all, the reform of the microeconomy,  specifically changing the operating mechanism of state  enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system. Second,  it involves reforming, nurturing, and developing the market  system, particularly the acceleration of the maturation and  perfection of the capital goods market. Third, it involves  reform at the level of macroeconomic regulation and control,  specifically changing government functions and establishing a  macroeconomic regulatory and control system for these sectors:  banking, finance, prices, investment, foreign exchange, and  social security. For the moment the most important and urgent  thing is to achieve a breakthrough in banking and financial and  tax administration by creating a new banking and tax system and  operating mechanism. The reason is that "banking is the  lifeblood of the market economy" while financial administration  and taxation directly determine the ability of the central  government to regulate and control the macroeconomy.    The local media are fully aware of the enormous effort that  has gone into the deliberations over and drafting of this  document. We can be quite sure it is the distillation of the  experiences of 15 years of reform and the wisdom of people of  all quarters, starting with Deng Xiaoping's reform philosophy.  CPC leaders personally conducted numerous studies and surveys in  various locations, carried out ideological work at the local  level, and repeatedly spoke publicly about his thought and his  ideas on deepening reform. The 3d Plenary Session was preceded  by the publication of the Volume 3 of Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, which provided full ideological preparation  for the drafting of the programmatic document. Public opinion  too was fully prepared for what the document would include.  During the drafting process, the opinions of high-ranking  figures both inside and outside the party were solicited again  and again in hopes of reaching a consensus. It went through 10  drafts in all. For these reasons, the document is highly  practicable and theoretical. It is a programmatic document on  modern Chinese construction, its place in history comparable to  that of the "Decision on Economic Reform" adopted by the 3d  Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee in 1984.  <H5>  Economic Development Both Rapid and Stable </H5>   On the eve of the 3d Plenary Session, numerous newspapers in  Hong Kong printed "Highlights of Deng Xiaoping's Speeches  Delivered in Wuchang, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shanghai" in early  1992. Deng Xiaoping emphasized in his speeches that "development  is the only way to go." "Grasp the opportunity; develop  ourselves." "The key is economic development." "Don't stand in  the way of places which are capable of development." "Places  where conditions are ripe should try to develop a little  faster." The media consider all this of profound importance as  it further unifies public understanding of the issue of growth  rate and determines the direction in which China should move  forward. Besides, it has been a big morale booster to the people  of Hong Kong. At a time when Sino-British political talks have  yet to produce an agreement and China is tightening  macroeconomic regulation and control in an effort to cool the  economy, Hong Kong investments in the mainland continue to rise  and U.S. and Japanese capital keeps flowing into Hong Kong in  large quantities in preparation for the big push into China, in  the process driving up share prices sharply on the Hong Kong  stock market. The media take this as a vote of confidence in the  Chinese economy, a sign that the Chinese economy will continue  its fast growth after the 3d Plenary Session, its prospects  getting more and more attractive.    Even as they are convinced of fast economic growth ahead for  China, some local scholars note that the number one issue facing  China today is stability. Economic growth must be stable as well  as fast; only stable growth can be true, fast growth. Will the  Chinese economy become overheated again in the future? Will the  scale of investment expand mindlessly again? Will there be an  upsurge in inflation? These problems concern them. They believe  that as long as China does not have an effective restraining  mechanism and risk mechanism, their recurrence is inevitable.  Hence the overriding importance of maintaining economic  stability. Some scholars even argue that an annual growth rate  of 7 or 8 percent is good enough and that China should not  pursue double-digit growth in order to steer clear of the  boom-and-bust cycle and the resultant heavy losses.    Earlier some people portrayed macroeconomic regulation and  control and accelerated development, even accelerated reform, as  mutually exclusive. They would have you believe that it was a  mistake to tighten macroeconomic regulation and control. Many  local experts do not share this point of view because, first of  all, macroeconomic regulation and control can be found in all  countries that have a market economy. Since China is in the  midst of a transition from the old economic system to the new,  the need for macroeconomic regulation and control is even  greater. Second, macroeconomic regulation and control has indeed  been highly effective. Had the government not imposed the  earlier round of controls, instead allowing the financial sector  to drift into chaos, inflation to worsen, and the exchange rate  to plunge, both economic development and the effort to deepen  reform would have been badly hindered. Thirdly, China's top  priority now is to carry through with macroeconomic regulation  and control to hold down inflation, trim the trade deficit,  improve the economic structure, and boost government revenue,  thus setting the stage for the continuous development of the  economy and the deepening of reform.  <H5>  It Takes Time To Establish Market Economy </H5>   The local economic and theoretical circles are highly  hopeful  that the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  would bring about a breakthrough in economic reform. Economic  structural reform in the last 15 years has been a huge success  and laid a solid foundation, thanks to incremental reform of the  past. The practice of advancing gradually and steadily is  consistent with China's national conditions. In rural reform, in  particular, spectacular breakthroughs have been made in price  reform and opening to the outside world. Some scholars describe  past reform as following a "roundabout strategy" and argue that  it has been limited to matters of "secondary" importance. Not  true in fact. Take price reform, for instance. You cannot say it  is "secondary." Price reform, a big success story of the past  few years, has always been billed as the "key" to successful  reform. Today, we may say, the "fortress" of price reform has  been captured. In the next stage of reform, we must launch an  offensive against the other "fortresses" of the planned economy  in an effort to create a full-fledged market economy.    Be that as it may, some Hong Kong scholars have some  misgivings about "accelerated reform." Would "targeted  breakthrough" become "shock therapy?" While acceleration is  necessary, they believe, we must not go after instant success.  The reason is that China will find the pain of radical change  unbearable. Once things get out of hand, the consequences will  be catastrophic. A market economy cannot materialize overnight;  it takes a lengthy process of maturation, growth, and  improvement. Other scholars argue that 15 years of reform have  given us a wealth of experience and the national economy has  developed to a point where it can withstand a good deal of  stress. In the future, when it comes to reform we should move  quickly whenever possible. The idea is to bring about a change  with one move in order to reduce the conflicts that occur as the  old order gives way to the new and the resultant losses.  Needless to say, wherever quick action is impossible, we must  stick to the incremental approach and carry out reform step by  step.  <H5>  Work Hard To Develop Primary Industries </H5>   The People's Bank of China announced recently that because  macroeconomic regulation and control has gone well, the state of  banking in China has improved and is gradually returning to  normal. This is good news to the people of Hong Kong because it  suggests a Chinese economy that is growing rapidly, steadily,  and healthily, creating a favorable climate for Hong Kong to  invest in the mainland and bolster its imports and exports.    Structural imbalances, Jiang Zemin [3068 3419 3046] pointed  out recently, are one of the major barriers to accelerating the  Chinese economy. It is the hope of the Hong Kong economic  community that in the days ahead China will make the correction  of structural imbalances its top economic priority by  concentrating its energies on the development of primary  industries and the infrastructure, expediting the development of  the transportation, communications, telecommunications, and  energy industries and other important raw material industries,  and easing the "bottlenecks" in economic development in order to  better the foreign investment climate. The Chinese Government  has decided to abolish over 2,700 development zones, which means  that we will still have about 500 national- and provincial-level  development zones, still too many. The number should be further  scaled back so that whatever funds available can be concentrated  on and put to better use in developing a number of key  development zones, thus making the investment pay off sooner. A  few days ago the Chinese Government approved 54 new major  large-scale projects in the "bottleneck" industries. They will  be a big boost to the economy.  <H5>  Speed Up Lawmaking for Market Economy </H5>   As local experts see it, the market economy is an economy of  laws based on highly competitive commodity production and  commodity exchange. Inevitably it is accompanied by  haphazardness, social injustice, and other maladies. Even more  so than the planned economy, therefore, the market economy needs  to be guided, regularized, safeguarded, and disciplined by a  sound legal system. The Hong Kong economy is a well-developed  market economy as well as an economy solidly based on laws, the  product of a lengthy and gradual development process. In this  sense Hong Kong offers a model that China can emulate as it  develops a market economy.    Some Hong Kong scholars take pains to point out that a  market  economy is no panacea. It is wrong to make a fetish of the  planned economy, of course, but it is just as wrong to have  blind faith in the market economy. The emphasis by the 3d  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on the  accelerated development of a legal system is both necessary and  timely from the perspective of building a socialist market  economy vigorously but cautiously.</p>

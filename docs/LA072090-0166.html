			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT REACHED IN $30-MILLION GERALDO SUIT  </P> <P> A settlement has been reached in a $30-million defamation lawsuit filed against  television talk show host Geraldo Rivera by a woman arrested during a drug raid  that was part of a live television special.  </P> <P> The settlement was reached Thursday after Rivera spent six hours giving a  deposition in the suit. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.  </P> <P> The suit filed by Terry Rouse, 32, claimed she was libeled and slandered by  Rivera during the Dec. 2, 1986, television show "American Vice: The Doping of a  Nation."  </P> <P> Cocaine possession charges filed against Rouse as a result of the televised  bust were dropped.  </P> <P> Rivera provided commentary during the broadcast as Harris County Sheriff Johnny  Klevenhagen and several deputies used a battering ram to break into a  Channelview duplex where Rouse was staying. The woman was dragged out of a  bathroom and handcuffed before an estimated 15 million viewers.  </P> <P> "Klevenhagen is going in on a duplex, where an alleged pimp and prostitute -- a  dude and his lady, real pros -- are supplying truckers speed," Rivera told the  show's nationwide audience.  </P> <P> Rouse has maintained she was hired to paint the house, which belonged to a  friend.  </P> <P> Rivera said Thursday he did not feel responsible for defaming Rouse and that  her attorneys were perpetuating "a dispute that should have been resolved long  ago."  </P> <P> "My essential feeling is one of regret," Rivera said before giving the  deposition. "I think I'm here because attorneys think there is gold at the end  of a rainbow and they are flogging a dead horse."  </P> <P> Rouse's attorney, Dale Jefferson, speculated Rivera's attorneys were eager to  settle before the suit went to trial Aug. 20 to avoid having Rivera's salary  discussed in open court.  </P> <P> In January, 1987, Rouse was arrested on three marijuana delivery charges, but a  judge later reduced the charges and wiped her record clean. She already had  served seven months in jail on the charges.  </P></p>

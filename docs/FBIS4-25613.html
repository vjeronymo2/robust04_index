			<p>BFN     [Text] On 2 and 3 June, Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]  National Committee, head of the United Front Work Department  under the CPC Central Committee, and director of Taiwan Affairs  Office under the State Council, carried out inspection work in  Wuhan. During his stay in the city, he listened to the work  reports of the city of Wuhan and of Hubei Province, and met with  main responsible persons from various democratic parties, and  the Wuhan branch of the Federation of Trade and Commerce.    Wang Zhaoguo said: A China craze is spreading in the world  now. Many countries are amazed at China's economy, which has  been developing very rapidly for 15 years running without  considerable fluctuations. There are two main reasons  contributing to this: First, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we  have taken economic construction as a focus, and always have  persisted in deepening reform and expanding opening up. Second,  we have actively promoted the development of socialist democracy  and politics, and have persisted in and developed our  fundamental system of people's congresses so as to consolidate  and improve our multi-party cooperation under the leadership of  the CPC, and our political consultation. We have done our best  to extensively arouse positive factors in various quarters,  promote political consultation and democratic supervision, and  enable democratic parties to participate in and discuss  government and political affairs. This is a condition and  guarantee for promoting social stability and economic  development.    Wang Zhaoguo fully affirmed the achievements made by Hubei  and Wuhan in reform, opening up, and economic construction, and  in particular, their marked success in attracting investment  from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Wang Zhaoguo stressed:  Wuhan must give full play to its geographical strong point to  vigorously attract foreign capital. It must support and help  foreign businessmen run enterprises well. It must set a good  example in this respect to attract more foreign investment.    Wang Zhaoguo particularly emphasized: It is of great  importance to carry out economic and trade work related to  Taiwan. This is beneficial to linking the feelings of the two  sides of the straits, and to promoting their economic  cooperation and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.    During his stay in Wuhan, Wang Zhaoguo also met with heads  of  Hong Kong's New World Group, the Sun Hung Kai Group, and the  Henderson Group. He also inspected Wuhan's Tianhe International  Airport, which is under construction, as well as a  home-ownership project. He attended an inaugural ceremony for  Hankou's Changxing Park, and a ceremony marking the completion  of the airport highway project.    Those who accompanied Wang Zhaoguo on his inspection tour  included Hu Deping, vice chairman of All-China Federation of  Industry and Commerce; (Zhang Mengna), secretary general of the  United Front Work Department under the CPC Central Committee;  and responsible persons of the relevant departments.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Extent of Euro rebellion hangs on motion - David Owen takes soundings among those Conservative MPs who could be crucial to the prime minister next Wednesday THE SCALE of Mr John Major's task in securing a Commons majority in next week's vote on the Maastricht treaty was underlined last night by indications that as many as 50 Conservative MPs are currently minded to oppose the government. Telephone interviews with scores of Tory MPs suggest that this level of opposition could conceivably materialise if the government insists on tabling a substantive motion vowing to press ahead with examination of the bill implementing the treaty without delay. A revolt on this scale would leave the government staring defeat in the face  -although past experience suggests the number is likely to be considerably whittled down by the time the division bell rings. Nevertheless, if the prime minister continues the confrontational route on which he embarked this week, he will be relying heavily on his ability to shepherd several of these potential rebels back to the fold. The alternative is to bow to backbench pressure, either by tabling an anodyne technical motion or agreeing to delay detailed consideration of the Maastricht Bill. If the motion which eventually appears is interpreted as a vote of confidence in the government, the prospective rebellion would probably evaporate almost to vanishing point. As the government ponders tactics, those most likely to face the tender mercies of the whips are the potential waverers: backbenchers who have hedged their rebellious instincts. Into this category fall Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West, Mr Roger Moate, Faversham, Mr John Townend, Bridlington, Sir Rhodes Boyson, Brent North, Mr Michael Lord, Suffolk Central, and others. Some of this group indicated this week that a concession on timing could be the key to securing their support for a substantive motion, although others may be satisfied by the news of Denmark's attempt to break the impasse over its ratification of the treaty. Mr Townend said he would be 'unlikely to vote for' a substantive motion, while Sir Rhodes said he would 'find it very difficult' to give the government his support. Mr Lord said he would 'have to see what the wording is'. He added: 'All I am interested in is: are they going to bring the bill back. If they do, I shall vote against it.' Among the group, Mr Moate - who abstained when the Maastricht Bill received its second Commons reading - may prove the most intractable to sticks and blandishments. 'At the very least I would abstain, but my inclination would be to vote against,' he said. Government business managers will take heart from their memories of fizzled backbench rebellions of the recent past - notably in July when not one Tory supported a Labour amendment to extend a moratorium on stamp duty on house sales. Indeed, there is already evidence that potential rebels are beginning to back away from confrontation. Mr Den Dover, MP for Chorley, yesterday said he would support the government. On Tuesday, asked how he would react to a substantive motion vowing to press on with the Maastricht treaty as quickly as possible, he said he was 'inclined to vote against'. He said the switch was 'because of the Danish position being clarified'. Mr James Hill, MP for Southampton Test, also pledged this week to back the government. A month ago he told the FT: 'If there is any thought of bulldozing through the same thing again, they will find a lot of people like me hesitating.' He said in explanation: 'I suppose I have been reading a lot more about Maastricht.' It is clear that many implacable opponents of Maastricht are prepared to back Mr Major next week, either out of personal ambition or because they are unwilling to risk precipitating a situation in which the government could fall. One new MP said: 'I am crying out for this measure to be brought down but I am not sure this is the right time to act. It is nothing short of insulting to bring it forward now.' Another more experienced hand said: 'We are not in the business of trying to get rid of the government.' Mr Major, however, must be privately dismayed at the depth of the resolve of experienced MPs like Mr Peter Griffiths, Portsmouth North, Mr Bill Walker, Tayside North and Mr John Wilkinson, Ruislip-Northwood, all of whom were adamant this week that they would oppose a substantive motion. Mr Walker, who abstained on the bill's second reading, said: 'At the general election, I stood on a platform that I would oppose Maastricht. I will not let my constituents down.' Mr Wilkinson said: 'Her Majesty's government is hell-bent on committing hara kiri.' The prime minister must be even more concerned at the determination of newly elected MPs like Mr Warren Hawksley, Halesowen and Stourbridge, and Mr Walter Sweeney, Vale of Glamorgan, to oppose a substantive motion. Mr Sweeney said: 'I am very sorry I did not vote against the government in the second reading in May. I felt rather pusillanimous when the Danes voted against (Maastricht) in their referendum.' If the other hardliners keep their nerve, and the 22 Tory rebels from the second reading remained opposed, a vote on a substantive motion would be desperately close, even assuming the least determined of the 50 were brought into line. It cannot be presumed that all of the 22 would continue to defy the leadership. In May they did so safe in the knowledge that Labour's instruction to its MPs to abstain would ensure a convincing government majority. But none of them has yet publicly promised to back the government this time around. Sir Trevor Skeet, MP for Bedfordshire North - seen by some as a potential waverer - said yesterday: 'On a substantive motion, I am against it, exactly as I was last time . . . The prime minister does not require the vote at all. This is very provocative.'</p>

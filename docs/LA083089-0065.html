			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Overload: The computer system in Oslo, Norway, which was to handle tickets to a  concert by former Beatle Paul McCartney, collapsed just minutes after the sale  started Monday because of the huge demand. Plans were to sell tickets all over  Norway so that everyone would have a fair chance, but with the computer  overwhelmed, sales were continued through ticket booths in six of Norway's main  towns. A spokesman said Tuesday that all 5,700 tickets for the Sept. 26 opening  concert of McCartney's first world tour in 13 years sold out within hours. The  ticket rush in Norway reflected what also happened Monday in Los Angeles where  McCartney's November dates at the Forum were sold out in a flash. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

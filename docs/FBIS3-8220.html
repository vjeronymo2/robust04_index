			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb aircraft  did not bomb Moslem-held Maglaj on Sunday morning, Bosnian Serb  military sources said.    The Moslem forces which control this northern Bosnian town  are burning piles of tyres to make it look as if the town is in  smoke after an air raid, the sources said.    Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo alleged on Sunday that  Bosnian Serb aircraft had destroyed the bridge across the River  Bosna which bisects Maglaj, and Moslem army commander Gen. Rasim  Delic has requested the commander of the U.N. Protection Force  in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, to order "an immediate  intervention" by the NATO air force.    The NATO Command for Southern Europe in Naples, Italy, on  Sunday denied that Bosnian Serb aircraft had violated the "no  fly" zone over Bosnia.    NATO Spokesman in Naples John Jeffrey said NATO had no  information about any violation of Bosnian air space and could  not confirm that Maglaj had been raided from the air.    REUTERS, Mega and Antenne 1 television crews have filmed  Moslem assaults on the eastern slopes of Mt Ozren and the  situation in nearby Maglaj, and the footage showed the town to  be quiet.    Bosnian Serb military sources said that the Moslem  allegation  of a Serb raid on Maglaj was designed to draw attention away  from Moslem offensives in the north -- in the areas of Mt Ozren,  Trebava and Doboj, and in the Bosna river valley.    The Bosnian Serb army said in a statement that a Moslem  sabotage unit from Tesanj had blown up the iron bridge in Maglaj  in order to prevent Moslem civilians from crossing to the right  bank of the Bosna and fleeing to Moslem-held Zenica in central  Bosnia, under an agreement with the Bosnian Serb army.</p>

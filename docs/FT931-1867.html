			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Employment survey shows poor figures for ethnic minority groups FEWER THAN one in three organisations sets targets for employment of people from ethnic minority groups, a survey by the independent research group, Industrial Relations Services, shows. The group said although both the government and the Commission for Racial Equality had endorsed the use of numerical targets to act solely as employment benchmarks, employers who set targets feared they would be seen as operating quotas - numbers from ethnic minorities that must be employed by a set date. The study of 166 organisations, covering more than 2m workers, found that just over three quarters of respondents had carried out a workforce audit to determine the ethnic origin of their employees.

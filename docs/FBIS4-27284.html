			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- An advisory group to the  minister of international trade and industry urged safe nuclear  power stations that do no require much manpower to manage, in a  midterm report it compiled Friday [27 May].    The report noted that the number of nuclear power stations  that have been operating a long time will increase in the  future, but there will be fewer people to tend to the growing  need for repair.    To cope with the problem, the report urged the use of  computers for maintenance and periodic checks. It also said  technology should be applied in a way that does not harm people  or the environment when the power stations are dismantled or  waste is diposed of.    Lightwater reactors to be built in the future should be  designed so that they require little manpower, the report said.    In addition to aiming for environmentally friendly plants,  the report pointed to the need to gain and understand the  opinions of people residing near the plants.</p>

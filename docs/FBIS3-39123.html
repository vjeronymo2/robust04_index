According to a study by the Ifo Institute  for Economic Research, rent reform accounts for 50 percent of  the 30-percent increase in the cost of living in eastern Germany  since reunification.    The increase in government-administrated prices contributed  almost 24 percent to the consumer price increase between 1989  and December 1993. Nonadministrated prices accounted for 6.5  percent. Business researchers, however, say that directly  administrated prices accounted for only 4.6 percent, while the  group of partially administrated prices accounts for the lion's  share of 20.8 percent. This mainly concerns the increase in  rents (including ancillary costs), the costs for heating and hot  water, and the increase in energy prices.    The group of quasi-administrated prices (beer, spirits,  wine,  tobacco, and coffee), on the other hand, became cheaper. In  this sector, the December 1993 prices were 12.4 percent below  the 1989 level -- also due to coffee and fuel prices going down.  This resulted in the entire cost-of-living index decreasing by  a mathematical 1.6 percent.    The beginning of 1993 saw a sharp increase in prices,  especially due to the second regulation for basic rents, which  caused housing costs to increase by 14.5 percent in the overall  index. January 1993 also brought along price increases in  public transport. Motor insurance was also 20.3 percent more  expensive than at the beginning of 1992. The average annual  price increase in the new laender was 8.8 percent.    According to Ifo, east German consumer prices will also be  influenced by administrated price increases in 1994, although to  a lesser extent. At the beginning of the year, housing costs  went up once again and will thus account for a maximum 1.5  percent of the 4.5-percent increase in the cost of living that  Ifo predicts for the new laender in 1994 (western Germany in  1994: plus 3 percent). As in the old laender, fuel tax and  insurance premiums also went up in eastern Germany. In  addition, public local transport fares and charges for municipal  services are expected to increase above average.    In the Federal Government's opinion, government price  controls for rents could be abolished in mid-1995, which would  mean that a comparative rent system would be in effect, like the  one in western Germany.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Telecom officials jailed in Taiwan bribery scandal A Taiwan court yesterday handed down prison sentences to six officials from the Directorate General of Telecommunications and acquitted eight others in a highly publicised bidding scandal involving Dollars 220m (Pounds 142m) in cellular telephone contracts. Mr Meng Chih-chung, former director of the DGT's Long-Distance Telecommunications Administration, was sentenced to seven years in jail for his role in the affair. He was convicted of forging documents and granting illegal favours to Ericsson of Sweden. Five other directorate officials received sentences of five to six years on similar charges. Objections by Motorola, the US telecommunications company are believed to have played a role in unveiling irregularities in the awarding of the contracts. Motorola lobbied US authorities, who in turn expressed concern over the case to the Taiwan government. Ericsson, which was not charged in the scandal, won all six contracts put to tender by the DGT between 1988 and 1991 for mobile telephone switching systems totalling Dollars 220m. Of the six tenders, two were awarded through competitive bidding. Citing emergency demand and product compatibility, the LDTA awarded the remaining four contracts directly to Ericsson rather than offering them through open tender. Prosecutors have said they did not discover any cases of the company paying bribes. Ericsson said yesterday it had always rejected the bribery allegations and noted that they had not formed part of the court case.</p>

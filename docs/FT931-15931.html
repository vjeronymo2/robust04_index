			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Agreement desirable I EARN an income of Pounds 10,000 and have unearned income of Pounds 40,000. I have assets as a result of an inheritance of Pounds 500,000 including our house which is worth about Pounds 100,000. My husband to be has no assets and earns about Pounds 25,000. Much as I love him, our relationship has been volatile to date. If we marry and divorce in five years with no children and no changes in our financial positions, is there any risk the Courts could award him any of my capital? There must always be some risk of the kind which you envisage on divorce, since the Court has power to direct whatever financial settlement it deems just in all the circumstances. Hence a contractual agreement settling the parties rights (in the absence of children) is desirable. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

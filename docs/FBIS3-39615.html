[passage  omitted]    Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said here that Russian  Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev had contacted French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe informing him of the Russian deal, brokered  by Moscow special envoy Vitaly Churkin.    "Mr. Kozyrev informed Mr. Juppe that Vitaly Churkin had  obtained an agreement from the Bosnian Serbs that they withdraw  their heavy arms," he said.    But he added: "We are waiting for this news to be confirmed  and to be translated into actions on the ground."    "What we are looking for is an unambiguous application,  within the deadline, of the decisions taken by NATO, that is the  withdrawal, regrouping, and placement under UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] control of heavy weapons."    "The two sides, Serbs and Bosnians, must respect the demands  made by NATO," he added. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (13): Where 'dead souls' and fake shares abound - Russia / Nicholas Denton discusses the challenges of the final frontier Custody services tend not to be noticed when they work. They are the poor cousins of the securities industry, consigned to the back office and out of the spotlight. Only when safekeeping of securities and settlement of transactions are flawed does it become clear how vital they are to functioning markets. And in few places is custody less developed, and more of an issue, than in Russia. Observers call it 'the single biggest deterrent' to western investment in Russia. None of the usual assumptions apply. Russia has no paper traded system because share certificates do not exist. Instead, the evidence of ownership is a name in a registrar's book. For a share transaction to take place an agent, or agents, for both buyer and seller have to go physically to the company's registrar and re-register ownership. That is easier said than done. There are about 3,000 registrars and those for many of the most attractive companies, the energy giants, are far from Moscow and St Petersburg. This logistical morass has given rise to a mini-industry in the sale of shares by brokers who do not actually own them. Apart from physically inspecting a share register, the only evidence a purchaser has that he is buying shares from their rightful owner is an extract from the official share register. But, as a western banker in Moscow explained, 'if you are willing to pay for an extract, you can get as many as you like'. So, although none admit to having been duped themselves, Russian bankers say that some businessmen, particularly in the provinces, are doing a steady trade in fake extracts. The unfortunate buyers learn they have been deceived only when they try to add their names to the official register and discover that their vendor does not appear. These fake extracts are coming to be known as 'dead souls' in a reference to the eponymous 19th century Russian novel by Nikolai Gogol, whose hero bought up documents establishing his ownership of serfs who were no longer living. After the liberation of the serfs the Tsarist government compensated their former owners, a scheme which Gogol's hero cashed in on, using his proofs of ownership of 'dead souls'. But even for careful investors, who avoid buying fake shares by sending their agents to personally inspect the share register in Siberia, or wherever it happens to be located, the difficulties have only begun. A registrar is allowed to take up to three days to alter the books and the agent may have to hang around and queue. The official is allowed to charge a transaction tax and the rate can reach as high as 5 per cent of the value of the deal. That is, if the buyer is lucky. The official will sometimes decide that a piece of paperwork is missing and send the agent back to Moscow. Some companies such as Gasprom, the Russian gas giant, can obstruct by exercising its right of first refusal and offering a laughable price to the seller. Getting hold of shares is difficult enough; safeguarding them is a more fundamental problem. According to Russian law, any enterprise with more than 1,000 shareholders is obliged to entrust its register to a 'separate' organisation. But, in practice, many of the registers of Russia's largest factories are controlled directly by the company and are often located in the company's headquarters. The overpowering fear of western investors is that their shares will disappear from the record. A registrar, influenced by the issuer, could in theory just say that an investor had sold its shares. The registration book could be stolen or destroyed in a fire. 'It could be an effort to defraud, to lie, or just a simple error,' says Ms Yvonne Rogers, head of settlement for Chase Manhattan in Moscow. That is precisely what Transworld, a London-based company which dominates the Russian metals trade, alleges occurred at the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Smelter, one of the world's largest aluminium producers. Transworld alleges, and factory officials confirm, that a 20 per cent stake in the smelter (worth Dollars 300m) controlled by Transworld proxies, was deleted from the records by factory administrators. Officials at the Krasnoyarsk smelter say they deleted Transworld holdings from their books because of irregularities in Transworld's initial purchase of the shares. But western investors are troubled by a system which gives factory directors - who are often hostile to outside buyers - the unilateral authority to alter shareholder registers. This danger can be minimised by regular audits by the custodian of the registrar and confirmation of the shareholding. But that does not prevent over-issue: whereby the registrar arbitrarily creates new shares and dilutes an existing owner's stake. Regulators, rather than custodians themselves, ought to be dealing with abuses by registrars but they do not. One custodian says: 'The regulatory regime is appalling. It has as many holes as a piece of cheese. And the authorities don't enforce any of it anyway.' The problems do not stop there. Collection of dividends, a customary responsibility of custodians, adds a new layer of work. Some Russian companies, lacking liquid assets, offer their products as a dividend payment. A vacuum cleaner company would issue a dividend in vacuum cleaners. Money dividend payments are complicated by the inadequacy of the banking system. A bank transfer does not generally make clear the source of the dividend payment which can be confusing for an investor with a varied portfolio. An investor, or its custodian, faces a challenge, too, in learning of shareholder meetings. The postal service is inefficient and often notification arrives after the event takes place. Companies are obliged to publish details of shareholder meetings in a widely-read publication but many print the information in the local works newspaper and leave it at that. No wonder one custodian says: 'You need a good sense of humour.' But many serious investors are not laughing. Paul Greatbatch, of emerging markets fund manager Genesis, says: 'We have chosen not to go into Russia on the basis that there is no suitable custody. There is no one there that can guarantee you title to the shares that you own.' Pension fund investors are even more cautious and US-based institutions have a legal requirement to ensure that custody and settlement are secure. 'We clearly need proper custody for the big institutions to move in,' says Nancy Curtin, head of emerging European markets for Barings Asset Management. The hunger of western institutional investors for Russian shares, together with their concern about custody, give birth to a significant opening for providers of custodian services. CS First Boston, the leading international investment bank in Moscow, has built its dominant market position on the comfort it provides for western investors. But CSFB's custodian services are secondary to its broking operations and institutions prefer to deal with independent custodians. Banks such as Chase Manhattan, Citibank and ING Bank are now responding to demand and exploring the establishment of asset servicing units. Costs will be high. Chase Manhattan expects to hire six staff just to fly to distant corners of Russia and register shares. A flight from Moscow to Vladivostok can cost Dollars 650 and hotel bills for extended stays add up. Nevertheless fees will be commensurately above western levels. Custodians in any case say they are setting up Russian operations to provide a full service for international clients rather than to make fat profits. Then there is also the challenge. Russia is the final frontier. But Yvonne Rogers, of Chase, is not so sure that custodians, much-maligned for being boring, will find excitement in the east. 'Custodians are a conservative bunch. I'm not sure whether this thing is good for their heart rate.'</p>

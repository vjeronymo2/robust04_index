			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, member of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the talks with donor countries and the  World Bank in Washington, by Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, have you managed to  convince U.S. and World Bank officials to disburse the aid to  cover the Palestinian budget deficit?    ['Abdallah] I believe the discussions over the past days  have  made substantial progress in the effort to raise funds and turn  pledges into payments so that the Palestinian authority will be  able to function normally.    [Mu'addi] Has an agreement been reached on the mechanism of  disbursing aid for the self-rule administration?    ['Abdallah] The mechanisms were already agreed on. There is  the mechanism of direct payment for the PLO and the mechanism of  payment through the Johan Holst peace fund.    [Mu'addi] What are the demands or reservations that U.S. and  World Bank officials made regarding the disbursement of  financial aid for the Palestinians?    ['Abdallah] There is nothing new in this regard. The  Palestinian side has been criticized for the delay in activating  financial and tax collecting offices.    [Mu'addi] Then what are the obstacles hampering the  immediate  disbursement of aid to the Palestinians?    ['Abdallah] Aid disbursement has already started. I do not  believe that there will be a problem. The problem is that the  aid is still less than the needs. Up to this moment, a major  portion of the deficit in the Palestinian budget is still  uncovered. The other side of the problem is that the payments  must be made on time so that the Palestinian authority will not  face a liquidity problem.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, does the date of Yasir  'Arafat's arrival depend on the disbursement of financial aid  for the Palestinians?    ['Abdallah] In fact, I have no accurate information about  this issue. However, it is known that for the Palestinian  authority to be able to perform its duties, the required funds  must be made available and paid on time. This problem is being  resolved. The next few weeks will witness activities that will  resolve this problem?    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir 'Abdallah in Washington, thank you very  much.    ['Abdallah] Not at all.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / S African group spends Pounds 1bn in US Sappi, the South African paper company, is paying Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.01bn) for SD Warren, a subsidiary of Scott Paper of the US, in the biggest international acquisition yet undertaken by a South African company. The deal is the second big acquisition by a South African company since the country's April elections and follows mining house Gencor's Dollars 1.3bn purchase of Billiton from Shell in July. Sappi is buying Warren, which Scott put up for sale in May, in partnership with US merchant bank Donaldson, Lufkind &amp; Jenrette and UBS Capital, a US subsidiary of Union Bank of Switzerland. Sappi will have 70 per cent of Warren's equity. The acquisition lifts Sappi into the front rank of world paper makers. Warren claims 27 per cent of the US market in coated woodfree papers, used for glossy publications such as magazines and catalogues. Sappi will become the world's largest producer of coated woodfree paper, with a claimed 15 per cent global share. Scott's sale of Warren, which accounts for 25 per cent of its turnover, is part of a sweeping reorganisation announced in the summer by Mr Al Dunlap, the company's new chairman. Scott aims to concentrate on its paper tissue business, in which it is the world leader. Sappi is South Africa's largest paper company, with 50 per cent of the local market, and already has widespread international interests, including five paper mills in the UK, and Hannover Papier in Germany, which was purchased in 1990. As a means of avoiding South African exchange control regulations, the deal will be financed entirely off-shore, with Sappi raising debt outside South Africa and securing it on its European assets. Sappi will put up Dollars 250m, of equity, DLJ Dollars 125m and UBS Dollars 25m. The rest of the purchase price will come through a mixture of debt and junk bonds. Mr Basil Anderson, Scott's chief financial officer, said part of the proceeds would be used to pay down Scott's Dollars 2.3bn of debt. Scott would also buy back 'a fair amount' of its own shares, he said, adding that the company planned further unspecified asset sales. He said the Warren disposal would reduce Scott's previously announced capital investment of Dollars 900m over the next two years by about Dollars 200m. Last year, Warren made pre-tax profits of about Dollars 80m on sales of Dollars 1.2bn. In its peak year of 1989 it made Dollars 253m. The final bidding for Warren is understood to have come down to a handful of international paper companies, among them the Anglo-French paper maker Arjo Wiggins Appleton with a partner. This was an apparent reversal of policy for Arjo, which had previously denied it was interested in the whole of Warren. Sappi said it had been helped in the bidding by the fact that US anti-trust laws had ruled out a number of big US paper makers. It is understood that several , including International Paper and Union Camp, dropped out at an early stage. Lex, Page 20</p>

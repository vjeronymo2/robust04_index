			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DICK TRACY' BRINGS IN ARRESTING NEW CINEMA SOUND SYSTEM;  </P> <P> FILM: HOLLYWOOD HOPES DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY WILL DRAW MORE VIEWERS BACK INTO  THEATERS.  </P> <P> As originally created by cartoonist Chester Gould, policeman Dick Tracy was  ahead of his time in popularizing a lot of modern crime-stopping technology --  fingerprinting, night scopes, teletype, police radios and the like.  </P> <P> This summer, the movie "Dick Tracy" will be used to introduce audiences to a  new hiss-stopping technology -- digital sound for movie theaters.  </P> <P> Earlier this month Eastman Kodak and the Optical Radiation Corp. introduced a  potentially revolutionary joint venture, Cinema Digital Sound (CDS), a  three-years-in-the-making system that finally brings perfectly noise-free,  deterioration-free, crystal-clear sound to the movies.  </P> <P> This pristine six-track sound isn't just for showcase houses in Westwood.  What's significant, the two companies promise, is that the technology will soon  be available even to the smallest theaters.  </P> <P> Reaction from the industry, ever on the lookout for ways to get viewers away  from their home entertainment centers and back into theaters, was swift.  </P> <P> Several exhibitors have already signed up to put the digital equipment in their  chains -- locally, the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood and Crest in Westwood will be  among the first theaters to go digital -- and Touchstone was the first studio  to announce that it would be releasing a film with a CDS sound track encoded on  select 70-millimeter prints.  </P> <P> "Dick Tracy" producer Barry Osborne says he's convinced that CDS "will become  the standard -- I'd say within a year. It's a great concept, but more than  that, it's a simple technology that really works. It'll start to spread to  35-millimeter films within a year and I don't think it'll take long for  theaters to upgrade, because it's so superior to what they have now, and not  that costly."  </P> <P> It's not yet known how many theaters will be involved in the initial "Tracy"  rollout, but the technology will be heard in at least 100 70-millimeter,  six-track theaters in time for this year's spate of Christmas releases. By  April of next year, even ordinary 35-millimeter movie houses will have the  chance to buy the decoding equipment necessary to read the digital track, which  is printed on the film strip alongside the visual image in the place where the  analog sound "squiggle" normally sits.  </P> <P> Filmmakers have as much good reason to cheer as exhibitors, noted editor Tom  Siiter, who worked on the ear-shattering CDS demonstration film. "Now you can  have the same-caliber sound as a 'Lawrence of Arabia'-style epic on your  average 35-millimeter film. An average release can be in six-track discrete  sound -- with no increase in cost, other than mixing costs."  </P> <P> Besides dazzling sound separation, having a digital track on a film print also  opens the door to other computerized possibilities.  </P> <P> "If you have a foreign-language release," said Eastman Kodak marketing VP  Leonard Coleman, "you can discretely put an English-language track in the sound  track along with the original, and then program the decoder to read the channel  with that language."  </P> <P> Further down the line, increased off-screen special effects could also be  automatically triggered in theaters by the MIDI control channel, in the  sensationalistic manner of Disneyland or William Castle.  </P> <P> "You now have a digital track on film that theoretically a PC computer could  read to create motion in seats to match a ship rocking on the ocean, or fire  lasers into the audience at a 'Star Wars'-type film," pointed out publicity  coordinator David Harney.  </P> <P> Future laser beams and explosions aside, though, theater owners want to know  just how inexpensively they'll be able to upgrade their operations in order to  blow patrons away now with mere sound.  </P> <P> The cost isn't negligible -- around $20,000 for a decoder system for a theater  already equipped with 70-millimeter six-track Dolby. The expense could  conceivably be much greater for a 35-millimeter house whose creaky speaker  system needs to be brought up to par.  </P> <P> But "everybody isn't going to have to immediately yank their old speakers and  power amplifiers out of the existing theaters," said Optical Radiation's Howard  Flemming, who helped develop the technology. "Remember when the compact disc  player came out and you plugged it into your existing hi-fi? Your old hi-fi did  sound much better.  </P> <P> "So there are ways of (exhibitors of lesser means) getting the system without  having to completely renovate their entire theater. There can be a curve of  improvement. They can control the dynamic range and bass so that the cones  don't fly out of the screen and hit a patron in the third row."  </P> <P> With many home video enthusiasts already initiated into the realm of flawless  digital sound through laser disc players and Surround Sound speakers, making  the theatrical aural experience at least comparable, if not better, was vital  for the industry.  </P> <P> "I think it'll have an impact where, when properly done, it'll bring people  back into the theaters," said Coleman, reminiscing inside the renovated Eastman  Kodak building in Hollywood. "Historically, sound technology introductions have  increased box office.  </P> <P> "This building was set up by George Eastman when he came out to Hollywood in  1927 -- not to work on pictures, but on sound. We had the pictures really  established before 1900, but when sound came in, it was felt engineering and  technology needed to be brought in by an engineering group. We provided that  free service to the industry to bring about the first sound tracks. When that  hit, silent pictures were virtually a dud. And we're providing a needed service  again."  </P> <P> It will take years for analog-sound pictures to go the way of the silent  picture -- or, to use a more contemporary example, the way of the vinyl record  -- but films as old as "The Wizard of Oz" will soon be remixed and reprinted  with the CDS system.  </P> <P> "In terms of film preservation, it's important as well," said "Tracy's"  Osborne. "A digital soundtrack won't degrade the way a magnetic sound track  does."  </P></p>

Local medical experts say the disease was caused by poor  sanitation and utilities which lack a centralized water supply  and sewage system.    Members of an emergency medical commission said that  sanitation requirements were not observed in the construction of  many of the public lavatories and as a result, the water supply  system was contaminated by sewage. The situation is being made  worse because of a large number of holiday-makers from Ukraine  and other CIS states.    However, Ukrainian health officials told Interfax the  epidemic was contained and that large medical teams were sent to  the place and measures were being taken to remove the causes  leading to the outbreak of typhoid.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Sutherland confirms candidacy for post of Gatt director-general MR Peter Sutherland, chairman of Allied Irish Banks, yesterday confirmed that he was a candidate to succeed Mr Arthur Dunkel who retires as director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at the end of June. Trade officials in Geneva believe that Mr Sutherland, sponsored by the European Community and with American support, is likely to secure the acceptance of Gatt's 114 members to take over as head of the world trade body. However, at least two other candidates are in the ring. Mr Sutherland told Irish state radio he was now 'willing, in the event of being acceptable, to take the job'. The 47-year-old Irishman, who was EC competition commissioner between 1985 and 1989, was initially reluctant to be considered for the post, citing family reasons. He said yesterday he had changed his mind after being telephoned by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president. Mr Sutherland's name has been formally proposed by the European Community in a letter to Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, India's Gatt ambassador, who is in charge of consulting Gatt members on Mr Dunkel's replacement. Mr Julio Lacarte Muro, formerly Uruguay's ambassador to Gatt, and Mr Luis Fernando Jaramillo, former foreign minister of Colombia, are also declared candidates. Geneva diplomats said yesterday that Mr Zutshi was hoping for a consensus by the next meeting of Gatt's governing council on May 12. However, an extraordinary meeting of Gatt members will be needed, probably in June, to formally appoint the next director general. Mr Sutherland said yesterday that the Gatt job was 'an opportunity to do something very worthwhile,' in particular in bringing about a Uruguay Round agreement. The global trade talks, more than two years overdue, are supposed to finish by the end of this year, when the US administration's proposed negotiating authority expires.</p>

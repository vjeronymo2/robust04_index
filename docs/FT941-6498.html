			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pension fund offsets Comalco fall Comalco, the integrated Australian aluminium producer which is 67 per cent owned by the country's CRA group, yesterday has reported net profits of ADollars 86.7m (USDollars 62.5m) for 1993, more than double the previous year's ADollars 42.5m. The profit was due largely to a gain of ADollars 35m from the increased value of pension fund investments and a ADollars 24m fillip from the reduction in Australia's company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. However, the group's main business operations suffered heavily from the steep fall in 1993 metal prices. Net operating profit fell to ADollars 28m, down 35.6 per cent from 1992's ADollars 43.5m. Total sales of ADollars 2.2bn showed a slight improvement on the ADollars 2bn of 1992, due mainly to a rise in sales volumes in smelting and downstream operations helped by a weaker Australian dollar. Mr Nick Stump, group chief executive, said the company has responded to the global oversupply of aluminium by slashing production at Bell Bay smelter in Tasmania. Mr Stump said the plant's capacity of 120,000 tonnes a year would be cut by 30% at the end of this month. The excess world supply, along with aboriginal claims on Comalco's mining leases, are threatening the short-term viability of the company's plans to double the output of its main smelter at Boyne Island in northern Queensland. Comalco and its partners have decided to delay the final decision on the expansion project until March 31. The group has declared a fully franked final dividend of 3 cents a share, making a total of 6 cents for the year, up 1 cent.</p>

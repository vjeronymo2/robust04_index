			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Trade News: French employers back WTO France's Patronat employers' federation said yesterday it would watch closely to see if the Uruguay Round agreement for a new World Trade Organisation fulfilled the 'great hopes' for this body, David Buchan writes from Paris. France championed the WTO in the Uruguay Round negotiations as a means of reining in the US tendency to retaliate unilaterally against what Washington deemed unfair trade practices. Mr Francois de Laage de Meux, head of the Patronat's international committee, said he did not expect the US to abandon entirely the unilateral provisions of Section 301 in its trade laws. This, he said, would not matter, provided - once the WTO came into force - the US only used its 301 weapon against non-Gatt countries in non-Gatt trade areas.</p>

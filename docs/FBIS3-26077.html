			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today that Moscow hopes the  possible air raids in Bosnia-Herzegovina will not happen,  stressing the need to hold additional talks over the issue.    At a meeting with visiting mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the international peace conference  on the former Yugoslavia, Kozyrev described the planned air  raids as "an extreme step."    Although in principle air raid is not excluded within the  framework of UN Security Council resolutions, Kozyrev said,  Moscow still keeps its initiative in the Security Council to  make additional efforts to push for the peace process in the  region.    Owen and Stoltenberg arrived here earlier today for  discussion on measures to prevent violence in the Balkan region  from further escalating, keep the Geneva negotiations process  going and finally achieve a settlement.    The two peace mediators departed for Geneva this afternoon  after their brief working visit here.</p>

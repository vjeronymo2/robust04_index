			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BOGEYMAN' TO CAP '90 LATC SEASON  </P> <P> "Bogeyman," a new piece by Reza Abdoh, Mira-Lani Oglesby and the same creative  team responsible for last year's "Minamata," will cap the second half of the  1990 season at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, which also will include two  other new works, two modern classics and two musicals.  </P> <P> Ibsen's rarely staged "The Wild Duck" kicks things off July 12-Aug. 12, under  the direction of Stein Winge, artistic director of the National Theatre of  Oslo. It will have the same design team as "The Inspector General," Winge's  most recent outing at the theater, including Pavel Dobrusky (sets) and Marianna  Elliott (costumes).  </P> <P> "The American Popess," a one-person play set in a morally bankrupt 21st  Century, will feature actress Nan Martin as a woman Pope, talking to her new  flock about a return to basics from a rented TV studio. This work by  German-Argentine playwright Esther Vilar will be staged by LATC consulting  director Alan Mandell Aug. 16-Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Third in the line-up is an exploration of the life and death of Times reporter  Ruben Salazar, accidentally shot to death during a police action in East Los  Angeles Aug. 29, 1970. Developed collectively by LATC's Latino Theatre Lab  (which has taken on the pseudonymous name Violeta Calles for the occasion),  "August 29" will play Aug. 30-Oct. 14.  </P> <P> Arthur Miller's "The Crucible," about the Salem witch hunts, will be staged  Sept. 6-Oct. 13 by LATC artistic director Bill Bushnell.  </P> <P> "The Joni Mitchell Project," commissioned by LATC from artistic associate David  Schweizer ("Kingfish," "Demon Wine," "The Illusion") and writer Henry Edwards,  looks at the last quarter century through 20 Mitchell songs (Nov.1-Dec. 16).  </P> <P> And "Blues in the Night," conceived and staged by New York director Sheldon  Epps (a piece that has played London and New York), will examine the  tribulations of three nameless women in a run-down hotel in the 1930s through  songs of the '30s and '40s (Nov. 8-Dec. 23).  </P></p>

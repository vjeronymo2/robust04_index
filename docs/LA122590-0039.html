			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Dude of the Year: He's bug-eyed, missing two fingers and has no chin, but Bart  J. Simpson has what it takes to capture Entertainment Weekly's  entertainer-of-the-year title.  </P> <P> The folk anti-hero who was a virtual unknown just one year ago became an  underachiever for the ages in 1990. He's got his own TV show, a record album  and a "Do the Bartman" rock video. Entertainment Weekly said Bart also deserves  credit for not catching typical Hollywood afflictions: He didn't punch out any  paparazzi, make a trip to the Betty Ford Center or sing the National Anthem.  Runners-up for the award included Julia Roberts, Madonna, Arnold  Schwarzenegger, M.C. Hammer and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

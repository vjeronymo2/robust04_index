			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Motoring: Ford prepares to take on the world - The importance of the Mondeo which is replacing the 10-year-old Sierra in the fleet market FORD'S front-wheel driven, medium-sized Mondeo promises well. However, I shall not know how good it is until I have tried it. Mondeo makes an official public debut at Geneva Show in March and goes on sale in Britain soon after. It is the long awaited replacement for the 10-year-old Sierra that, in its earlier years, was top of the pops among UK fleet and retail buyers. No new model introduction can be more important to Ford, whose sales and market share figures of late have given joy only to its competitors. If Mondeo's on-road performance lives up to its promise on paper, it ought to breathe new life into Ford. Unlike Sierra, whose avant-garde styling put off many potential buyers until they got used to its jelly-mould shape, Mondeo could be called contemporary conventional or modern anonymous. From the front, its Escort kinship shows but from the rear, a Mondeo could as easily wear a Mazda or Toyota badge as the blue Ford lozenge. Mondeo is Ford's world car. It was developed in Britain and Germany and will be built in Europe (although not in Britain) and north America. Sierra appeared first as a hatchback, with estate car and saloon versions following on several years later. But Mondeo is being launched as a full range. From the start there will be four-door saloons, five-door hatchbacks and estates with 1.6-litre, 1.8 litre or 2.0-litre, 16-valve petrol engines (all made in Wales) or a 1.8 litre, Dagenham-made, turbo-charged and intercooled diesel. All have catalytic converters. A 24-valve V6 powered high performance version comes later. Among a long list of options on certain models are traction control, adaptive suspension damping, four-wheel drive, ABS brakes and a new US-designed and made automatic transmission. All are linked to an on-board computer. Ford is equipping every Mondeo, from entry model to the smartest Ghia, with a driver-side airbag as standard. This is a bold move, deserving a rapid response from the competition. If it does not, Ford will be at a price disadvantage. That is what happened when it made ABS brakes standard equipment on all the current Granada (Scorpio) models. All other cars makers were expected to follow suit. They did, but not for some years. Meanwhile, Ford had to grin and bear the extra cost. All Mondeos have power-steering, side impact protection and high security central locking. Prices will not be known for some weeks but an Pounds 11,000 to Pounds 19,000 spread seems possible. A fully-loaded, air conditioned, 4x4 Ghia might even break the Pounds 20,000 barrier. So far, I have only sat in a couple of Mondeos. The seats seemed comfortable, the controls well placed, visibility good and the boot roomy. My first drive is keenly awaited. Ford says development teams have tested the car everywhere from the Arizona desert to the Arctic Circle, with special emphasis on ride and handling. I am sure they have. All car makers do so. But can we be sure that Ford has got its new model right from the start? When I sample a number of Mondeo models in the south of France soon, I shall be looking for something I sincerely hope I will not find. By this I mean signs of a problem development engineers are well aware of, but one they have not been able to persuade the bean counters is important enough to warrant money being spent on putting it right. My memory of new Ford introductions is long. I recall the ease with which a MkIV Zephyr would spin when tackling a roundabout in the rain, until Avon came to the rescue with a tyre possessing real wet grip. The original Granada made back seat passengers sick at the press launch because its independent rear suspension was too soft. The first front-wheel driven Escorts skittered sideways when a rear wheel fell into a sunken drain cover or pothole. This was fixed by a minor suspension redesign. An aerodynamic fault resulted in the original Sierra feeling unstable in motorway cross winds. It was soon corrected. More recently, refusing the engineers the power assistance they wanted for the fat-tyred XR2i's steering made it heavy to park, less sharp than it should have been on corners. And the raspberries the latest Escort received at its launch were deserved: it was a soggy, lack-lustre car. But within two years, it had been transformed. Lately, Ford has not been having an easy ride in Britain. It is time it had a break. If Mondeo fully lives up to its promise and the price is right, it probably will.</p>

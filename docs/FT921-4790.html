			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Thorn EMI - Virgin: The tough path to world leadership in music - The strategy behind Thorn EMI's purchase of the Virgin record business PRESIDENT for life is usually a title which company directors bestow on the aged founder when he can no longer remember their names, or which Third World despots bestow on themselves. Thorn EMI has different reasons for keeping Mr Richard Branson on as president for life of the Virgin Music Group, which, it announced yesterday, it is buying for Pounds 510m. The first is sentimental. Mr Branson had expressed a desire to retain his links with the music business and became quite emotional when the deal was finally concluded in the early hours of Friday morning. The second is Thorn's recognition that its money is being spent on nothing more than a group of music executives and the stars they have signed. Virgin has no manufacturing or distribution facilities. The trick is to get the stars to stay on, and Mr Branson promises to help. The deal, which will bring Thorn such artists as the Rolling Stones, Phil Collins, Genesis and UB40, catapults the UK music, rentals and light fittings company into the first rank of world music groups. Mr Colin Southgate, Thorn's chairman, says that before the Virgin deal his company was the world's fourth largest recorded music group - with a market share of about 14 per cent. The Virgin purchase should give the enlarged group a worldwide market share of about 18 per cent, putting it alongside PolyGram and Time Warner, the two world leaders. In the ownership of music copyrights, Thorn, which has 800,000 titles - including Singing in the Rain, Over the Rainbow and Happy Birthday to You - is already the world leader, along with Time Warner. The Virgin purchase adds another 25,000 titles, including the works of Fine Young Cannibals, Tears for Fears and the Pet Shop Boys. Mr Southgate will not be drawn on how important it was for Thorn to clinch the Virgin purchase. Although the final deal was a considerable reduction on the initial asking price of Pounds 800m, he does not want anyone to think his eagerness led to him paying too much. Mr Southgate had, however, been negotiating with Virgin for 14 months and his success in clinching the deal against rival bids from Bertelsmann of Germany and other competitors was crucial to the group's long-term strategy. Since taking over as chief executive five years ago, Mr Southgate has sold more than 60 companies - ranging from a computer chip maker to a television set manufacturer - and rebuilt Thorn around two core businesses: the rental of electronic and kitchen appliances, and music. He has insisted there was no point in staying in an industry unless Thorn was likely to be a world leader in it. The path to world leadership in music has, however, not been an easy one. Mr Southgate has been forced to watch as some of the world's last remaining independent record labels have been snapped up by his rivals. Thorn was regarded as the front-runner to buy Geffen, the US label, in 1990, but it went instead to MCA. Virgin was the last of the large independents; had Thorn failed to acquire it would have remained in the world music second division. Although Mr Branson says he will help the enlarged group retain its performers, he has had little to do with the day-to-day running of Virgin Music. Of greater importance is the retention of Virgin executives such as Mr Ken Berry and Mr Simon Draper. Both are staying with Virgin, which will be run separately from Thorn's other music businesses. Mr Berry will have a long-term contract with Thorn. Mr Southgate will not specify how long but says it is longer than three years. Mr Draper will have a rolling contract but with a clause restricting him from setting up in competition should he leave Thorn. An executive with a rival music company wonders how effective these ties will be; the music industry is notorious for the temperamentalism of those involved in it. 'In the case of the artists, it is going to be a matter of money', the executive says. Virgin's deal with the Rolling Stones, concluded last year, is thought to be safe. Virgin's payment of between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m (Pounds 22.7m) is believed to have been more than Dollars 10m more than the next highest bid. Mr Branson revealed yesterday that the contract with the Stones provided for its continuance if Virgin was sold to Thorn EMI. If Virgin had been sold to any other company, the Stones would have had the right to renegotiate the deal. Thorn believes that Virgin's profitability can be improved in three ways. The prices of Virgin's products, which are slightly lower than Thorn's, could be increased. Thorn will take over Virgin's manufacturing and distribution when existing contracts expire. Mr Southgate says this should add Pounds 20m to profits over the next two years. He adds that the negotiations with Geffen taught him an important lesson about the management of a music company's roster of artists. Geffen ran a lean roster, dropping artists who were not contributing much or who were past their peak. He believes the Virgin roster could do with similar treatment. Although the purchase puts Thorn at the top of the world music business, it remains significantly different from the other leading groups. There are no links between Thorn's music business and its other activities. The other large groups see music as part of a larger, integrated business, taking in consumer electronics and other media such as film. PolyGram is 80 per cent owned by Philips, the Dutch electronics giant. PolyGram announced last year that it would spend Dollars 200m expanding its film interests. Time Warner has large film interests. Japanese consumer electronics companies have invested heavily in both music and film. Sony owns CBS Records and Columbia Pictures. Matsushita has acquired MCA and Universal Pictures. Mr Southgate dismisses the claimed logic behind these mergers and purchases  -that there is an intimate connection between the development of new consumer electronics gadgets and the music and pictures that are played on them. Executives in rival companies also argue that the links between music and film are becoming stronger and that leading artists are demanding a presence in both. Thorn is no longer involved in consumer electronics manufacture and Mr Southgate argues there is no reason why it should be. If a consumer electronics company is to succeed with a new type of music player, it needs the support of the entire music industry - not just its own company. Sony failed to make a success of its Digital Audio Tape (Dat) player, despite owning CBS. 'The idea that you have to be a consumer electronics manufacturer to own a music company hasn't got through to my thick skull yet', Mr Southgate says. He says, too, that film companies continue to approach Thorn for help with sound tracks, even when they have a sister music company. 'The artistic guys in the film business don't like to be told who to work with', he says. A longer term threat to the enlarged Thorn music business is one which affects the whole industry: the prospect of slower growth. World sales of sound recordings doubled from Dollars 12bn in 1981 to Dollars 24bn in 1990, boosted largely by the explosive growth of the compact disc. CD unit sales in 1990, the last year for which data have been collated, totalled 770m, a 28 per cent increase on the previous year. The cassette tape, while still the most popular format, is in decline, while the vinyl long-playing record has disappeared in advanced economies such as the US and Japan. Music company executives believe, however, that as worldwide household penetration of compact disc players increases, CD sales growth will start to slow. There are new musical formats on the horizon, such as the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), which looks like a conventional cassette but which produces sound similar to that of a CD. Sony also plans to introduce a miniaturised, recordable CD. Mr Southgate dismisses the threat of a slower-growing CD market and says Thorn is prepared to produce music in whichever new format proves acceptable to consumers. Others in the industry believe that slower sales growth, allied with the huge fees demanded by world-class artists, could drive at least one of the big music groups to the wall. By acquiring Virgin and increasing its worldwide reach, Thorn has probably reduced the likelihood that it will be one of the casualties.</p>

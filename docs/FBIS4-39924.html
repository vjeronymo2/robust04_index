			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Abrosimov and Lyudmila </F> Yermakova]    [Text] Sofia, 12 Jun -- The Russian Federation Council's  delegation led by Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the chamber,  arrived on an official visit in Bulgaria today.    At Sofia airport the guests were welcomed by Aleksandur  Yordanov, chairman of the National Assembly (parliament).  Talking to an ITAR- TASS correspondent he described the visit  as "a culmination point in the contacts between the two  countries' parliaments that have become especially active of  late." I believe, he noted, that in the upcoming conversations  we will find many points in common on issues of developing  relations between Bulgaria and Russia in different spheres, and  will also exchange views on the situation in the Balkans and  Europe.    According to V. Shumeyko, relations between these two states  are now being built on a basis of equality determined by ideas  of freedom and sovereignty. At the same time, they do not  hamper the development of traditional ties between Russia and  Bulgaria. Both parliaments can do a great deal, first of all,  "by orientating legislations toward each other," something  without which progress in other spheres can hardly be expected.  This is one of the issues to which we attach considerable  importance, the chairman of the Federation Council stressed.</p>

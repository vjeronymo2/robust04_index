			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Applicants seek an order, which will supersede the prior orders, to allow the Trust to issue and sell an unlimited number of classes of shares of each of its Funds pursuant to an alternative purchase plan (the ``Alternative Purchase Plan''). Existing classes now will be sold under the Alternative Purchase Plan in reliance upon any order issued on this application. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) the impact of any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan payments (which may include servicing fees or distribution fees, or both) or non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing plan (``Shareholder Servicing Plan'') payments made by a class and any other expenses that may be imposed upon a particular class of shares and which are limited to (i) transfer agency fees attributable to a specific class of shares, (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class, (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) Commission registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares, (viii) Trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order (all of the foregoing expenses are collectively referred to herein as ``Class Expenses''); (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plans, except as provided in condition 16; (c) the different exchange privileges of the various classes of shares as may be described from time to time in any prospectus of the Trust; (d) the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature; and (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Under the Alternative Purchase Plan, shares of different classes would be sold under different sales arrangements including, for example, sales at net asset value, subject to a front-end sales charge, or subject to a CDSC. Different classes of shares could be subject to different rule 12b&hyph;1 plans. For any class, the sum of any initial sales charges, asset-based sales charges, and CDSCs will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided for in Article III, Section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Trustees of the Trust may determine that any of the Class Expenses listed above are to be borne by the class to which they are attributable. The Manager and/or the Distributor may choose to reimburse or agree not to impose Class Expenses on certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses reimbursed or not imposed by the Manager and/or the Distributor may vary from class to class. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected to vary from one class to another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse or agree not to impose Class Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund or series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In addition, the Manager and/or Distributor may waive or reimburse expenses attributable to a particular Fund (``Fund Expenses'') (with or without a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses for such Fund) but only if the same proportionate amount of Fund Expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class of that Fund. Thus, any Fund expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of a Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes. The amount of Fund Expenses reimbursed or not imposed by the Manager and/or the Distributor may vary from Fund to Fund, however. Fund expenses apply equally to all classes of a Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Fund expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund. Fund expenses will be allocated among the classes of a Fund on the basis of the relative net assets of each class of that Fund. The income of a Fund will be allocated among the classes of that Fund on the basis of the relative net assets of such class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: NFLPA CHIEF UPSHAW CLEARED BY PROBE  </P> <P> The U.S. Justice Department has closed its investigation of the National  Football League Players Assn. and union head Gene Upshaw after finding no  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Upshaw blamed the media, primarily the Boston Globe and the Ft. Wayne (Ind.)  Sentinel for making "reckless charges" and creating a "trial by headlines."  </P> <P> The financial records of the NFLPA and Upshaw have been under review by the  U.S. attorney's office since October. The Globe reported in September that  Upshaw illegally used union money and tried to conceal his actions. The  Sentinel reported in January that Upshaw was about to be indicted on tax  evasion charges.  </P></p>

The statement points out that the announcement of the NATO  ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs with a threat to bomb their  positions aggravates the Yugoslavian crisis still more.  According to the authors of this document, the question  concerns "an open interference" on the part of the NATO  countries and the position of the Russian Foreign Ministry looks  "unclear."    In order to overcome the conflict the deputies proposed to  the Russian president and government to address the UN with an  initiative to remove economic sanctions with respect to  Yugoslavia and to prevent bombardment of the former Yugoslavia  territory by using its right to a veto in the Security Council.  In addition, the authors of this statement appealed to Viktor  Chernomyrdin's government to render economic and humanitarian  aid to Yugoslavia's peoples.    The Russian State Duma has been recommended to send a  parliamentary delegation to Yugoslavia and to the conflict zone  to examine the situation in the region.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As you have been informed in our newscasts, Safet  Zhulali, defense minister of the Republic of Albania, took part  in the annual meeting of defense ministers of NATO and the  countries of the Partnership for Peace [PFP].    In his speech at this meeting, Minister Zhulali said that  the  Republic of Albania attaches special importance to cooperation  with NATO. He said that the support and signing of the PFP at  the highest level by President Berisha is a further element in  the framework of cooperation, thus granting a possibility to  prepare the Albanian Army on the road of accomplishing one of  the most important goals in Albania's foreign policy, that of  membership with full rights in the Alliance.    Underlining the situation in the region for a permanent  solution to the problem of Bosnia and for a practical and  preventive stance by the international community so as not to  allow the spread of conflict to Kosova and beyond, he expressed  the readiness of the Albanian democratic government to fulfill  the obligations that derive from its presence in the cooperation  process with NAKSI [expansion unknown] and PFP, as well as the  determination of the Republic of Albania to be a factor of peace  and stability in the region and Europe.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: SmithKline strengthens its position in vaccines SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group, has completed two deals aimed at positioning itself as a significant force in the world vaccine market. The agreements mean it is now the second largest in the market after Merck of the US. The first deal, with the State of Michigan's department of public health, gives SB exclusive rights to distribute the department's vaccines in the US outside Michigan. The products are for diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell pertussis and rabies. The two organisations will also jointly research and develop other paediatric vaccines for US distribution. The second deal with Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and Connaught Laboratories, both subsidiaries of Institut Merieux, gives SB the US marketing rights for an influenza vaccine designed for children. The product is awaiting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. SB refused to give financial details of either agreement. It said the deals meant all the elements were in place to provide a full range of childhood vaccines. The group had vaccine sales of Pounds 140m last year, according to Mr Jonathan de Pass, an analyst at Barclays de Zoette Wedd. He said the deals in themselves were not particularly big, but indicated SB's strategy. Vaccines have become an increasingly important market as companies have used biotechnology to create patentable products for which they can charge a premium.</p>

[Movahedian-'Attar] The Czech Republic and the Islamic  Republic of Iran are traditional and amicable partners. As you  know, political and economic relations between the two countries  began to flourish after 1930 and have continued to grow during  the subsequent decades. Many Czech businessmen and enterprises,  including Skoda, entered the Iranian market before World War II  and gradually acquired a good name and reputation for themselves.    The two countries import all sorts of goods and commodities  from each other and they have been technical partners for a long  time. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which has prepared a number  of large and small projects worth almost $0.5 billion, is now  considered to be the Czech Republic's most major technical  partner. It is to be expected that in the future the volume of  these projects could exceed more than $1.0 billion. The largest  Czech project in Iran is the construction of an aluminum plant  worth more than $300 million.    It is also apparent that the Czech Republic -- in view of  its  current economic circumstances -- would like to be active in the  Iranian arms market. I think that a more substantial  partnership is rather unlikely in this regard, because Iran --  which is giving priority to its economic strategy -- has,  compared with its annual gross domestic product, the smallest  military budget of the 15 countries in the Middle East.    Moreover, during the past 15 years, my country has managed  to  establish its own successful military industry, which enables it  -- to a certain extent -- to satisfy the army's needs, and we  are even capable of exporting some things.    We get the other most up-to-date and technologically  exacting  components -- as previously -- from the "Big Five."    In conclusion, Czech weapons are among the obsolete  categories of Russian military hardware, which are unable to  compete on the current saturated world market. It is obvious  that the two countries are determined to follow the path of  traditional, good cooperation that existed in the past and to  keep in step in their relations.    Understandably, the main stress will continue to be placed  on  the technical and economic character of this cooperation.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> PALMDALE CELEBRATES START OF WORK ON 2 MAJOR MALLS  </P> <P> If the story of the Antelope Valley in recent years has been all-out growth, a  subplot has been vigorous competition between Palmdale and neighboring  Lancaster for new residents and businesses.  </P> <P> So Palmdale leaders Monday celebrated the start of construction on two  important commercial projects: the first major enclosed mall in the Antelope  Valley and an auto mall that will include eight dealerships.  </P> <P> The 100-acre, $75-million Antelope Valley Mall will be anchored by six  department stores, including J.C. Penney, Harris', Gottschalk's and Sears,  Roebuck.  </P> <P> The enclosed facility at Avenue P and 10th Street West next to the Antelope  Valley Freeway is scheduled to open in September, 1990. It is expected to bring  in $2 million annually in sales taxes and to attract shoppers who have been  driving to malls in Glendale, Northridge and Victorville.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Major Coup'  </P> <P> "It's a major coup for the city of Palmdale," said Steve Buffalo, city  spokesman.  </P> <P> The developer, Cleveland-based Four Cities Inc., had considered a site in  Lancaster, Palmdale's northern neighbor, which has 26,000 more residents.  </P> <P> But Palmdale was chosen because several of the major retailers preferred that  site and because the city agreed to pay $13 million for street widening and  other improvements, Buffalo said.  </P> <P> "It's a victory in terms of gaining a strong foothold for commercial growth,"  he said. "The flow of retail shoppers had gone from north to south, but that  will change. This is a turning point."  </P> <P> A Monday night reception at the Palmdale Cultural Center marked not only the  new mall but ground breaking for the 65-acre Auto Mall Center at Avenue O and  the Antelope Valley Freeway. Six of the eight dealerships committed to the  center are moving from Lancaster. The auto center is expected to bring in close  to $1 million annually in sales taxes, officials said.  </P> <P> Palmdale billed Monday's festivities as "the event of the year" on its  invitations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Occasional Tensions  </P> <P> Buffalo acknowledged that rivalry between the two cities has led to occasional  tensions. But he said: "This is not a case of gloating. It's a case of pride. A  change of times, a change of trends."  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Susan Davis said Lancaster city officials disagree that Palmdale  has turned the tide in attracting future commercial development. She said  Lancaster still hopes to attract a major indoor mall anchored by the upscale  department stores and boutiques that the Palmdale facility, which has room for  two more department stores, presently lacks.  </P> <P> "We don't see the flow changing," she said. "We have a tremendously educated  and well-compensated population, yuppies with a lot of disposable income."  </P> <P> Davis noted that Lancaster's Valley Central outdoor mall is thriving and has  attracted businesses from Palmdale, as has an auto mall under construction in  Lancaster.  </P></p>

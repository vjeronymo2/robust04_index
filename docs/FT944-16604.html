			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rise in the dollar encourages the region's investors The rise in the dollar above the Y100 level encouraged investors, and the Nikkei index gained ground following Monday's holiday closure on buying of high-technology stocks by overseas investors and dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 index added 76.71 to 19,821.46 after a low of 19,790.46 and a high of 19,894.88. The index jumped to the day's high in the morning session on buying of export-oriented stocks, but fluctuated later in a narrow range. Expectations of higher US interest rates and growing tensions in the Middle East supported the dollar while corporate investors, encouraged by the dollar's advance, also put in buy orders. However, volume was subdued at 199m shares against Friday's 226m. Traders said the sluggish activity was also partly due to subscriptions to Japan Tobacco - yesterday was the deadline for the successful bidders to the share subscription to make payments for their stocks, but some brokers estimated that 25 per cent to 50 per cent had abstained from buying shares. The Topix index of all first section stocks finished 5.79 higher at 1,583.84 and the Nikkei 300 rose 1.15 to 290.26. Gainers led losers by 587 to 330, with 231 issues un-changed. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.01 to 1311.94. High-technology issues led trading activity: Oki Electric, the day's most active issue, rose Y13 to Y803, Mitsubishi Electric gained Y6 to Y728 and Hitachi added Y20 to Y1,010. NEC rose Y30 to Y1,260 and Fujitsu advanced Y30 to Y1,110. Carmakers, however, were neglected, with Toyota Motor down Y10 to Y2,060 and Nissan Motor declining Y2 to Y815. Pulp and paper stocks were higher. Honshu Paper rose Y9 to Y696 and New Oji Paper added Y20 to Y1,040. Japan Telecom continued to lose ground, falling Y30,000 to Y3.89m ahead of the Japan Tobacco listing. However, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y7,000 to Y872,000 and East Japan Railway added Y1,000 to Y476,000. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 106.93 to 22,115.04 in volume of 12.5m shares. High-technology stocks gained ground, with Rohm, the semiconductor manufacturer, rising Y50 to Y4,360. Roundup The region was firmer yesterday helped by overnight gains on Wall Street. HONG KONG moved forward on bargain hunting although turnover was thin. The Hang Seng index closed up 113.92 or 1.23 per cent, at 9,362.32 after touching a high of 9,392.53 in the closing minutes of trade. Brokers said the buying was mainly led by domestic investors. Among the day's main movers Jardine Matheson rose HKDollars 2.75, or 4.4 per cent, to HKDollars 64.75 and HSBC HKDollars 1.25, or 1.4 per cent to HKDollars 87.50. Brokers said they saw potential for further gains today, ahead of tomorrow's market holiday and US price data due out by the end of the week. SEOUL improved on a rise in blue chips as overall sentiment remained positive after the government's announcement last week of an easing of foreign ownership restrictions. The composite index put on 9.98 to 10,78.66, with an estimated 53.7m shares traded. Brokers said that the index reached a new high of 1,083.49 in early trading before easing slightly on a light round of profit-taking. Posco closed Won2,300 higher at Won85,700 ahead of a scheduled listing of its ADRs on the New York stock exchange later this month. SINGAPORE recouped all of Monday's losses on buying from overseas investment funds following the rally on Wall Street. The Straits Times Industrial index added 42.95 to 2,345.23, with 188m shares traded. US and UK based funds were seen as buyers of blue-chip issues, pushing the index to an intra-session high of 2,350.1 near the close. Cycle and Carriage led the market higher with a 40 cent gain to SDollars 13.60 and Jurong Shipyard 10 cents to SDollars 13.80. Elsewhere, Singapore Airlines added 10 cents to SDollars 8.35, with the foreign share rising 30 cents to SDollars 14.00. Foreign-held bank shares were higher, as Development Bank of Singapore foreign rose 30 cents to SDollars 15.40, while United Overseas Bank foreign added 50 cents to SDollars 16.00 and Overseas Union Bank foreign 20 cents to SDollars 8.55. TAIPEI lost another 1.4 per cent following last week's heavy losses, as investors returned after Monday's holiday closure. The weighted index shed 89.77 to 6,124.71, but off a session low of 5,916.39. Turnover was steady at TDollars 78.45bn. Financials went against the trend, leaving the sector index up 0.5 per cent, with ICBC rising TDollars 2 to TDollars 91. Brokers said that they expected the market to recover gradually in the coming sessions as the impact of default payments had started to cease and institutions were seen to be buying. The plastics sector had a mixed day: Grand Petrochemical lost TDollars 4 to tDollars 58.50 while Union Petrochemical reversed an earlier fall to rise TDollars 1 to TDollars 74 on late institutional buying. SYDNEY was encouraged by the gains seen elsewhere which helped the All Ordinaries index to a rise of 15.6 points to 2,003.6. BHP continued to lead the market higher, adding 26 cents to ADollars 19.50, with News Corp rising 17 cents to ADollars 8.27. BANGKOK, sensitive to news from the Gulf, recovered as tension in the region appeared to ease but the mood was still dominated by caution as the SET index closed 16.14 higher at 1,444.26 on thin turnover of Bt4bn. The absence of outside influences would be good for the market, said brokers. They said investors were generally optimistic about third-quarter results due at the end of the month. National Finance, Bangkok Bank and PTT exploration all rose by Bt4, to Bt470, Bt208 and Bt234 respectively. National Finance peaked at Bt476 earlier in the day, on active turnover of Bt78.1m. BOMBAY featured sharply higher first-half results from Reliance Industries, the big textiles and petrochemicals manufacturer which produced a 146 per cent increase at net profit level. The BSE 30-share climbed 12.30 to 4,423.25. The Reliance figures, with a net of Rs5.1bn against market expectations of about Rs4bn, brought some late enthusiasm into other blue chips. Reliance itself rose Rs10 to Rs415 after a slight dip ahead of the results. MANILA could not shake off early weakness on Middle East fears which, with a new wave of domestic initial public offerings and a lack of fresh company news, pulled the composite index down 25.16 to 2,946.95 as turnover dropped from 1.58bn pesos to 1.11bn. WELLINGTON strengthened considerably with the NZSE-40 capital index rising 1.65 per cent. Turnover was a moderate NZDollars 38.06m. The leading stocks performed well, notably Fletcher Challenge which added 14 cents to NZDollars 4.26. The power utility, EnergyDirect, gained 4 cents to NZDollars 1.67 on takeover rumours.</p>

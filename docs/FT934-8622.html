			<p>931115 FT  15 NOV 93 / Pressure for aid to capital projects: Lack of public/private projects criticised MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor of the exchequer, will today come under intense pressure from business leaders at the Confederation of British Industry at least to continue the present system of tax allowances on capital investment and preferably to extend it. Sir Michael Angus, the president, said he was 'extremely worried' about the low level of investment. In the second quarter of this year it was 2 per cent lower than in the same period of last year. The CBI is campaigning to bring British industry up to what it calls 'world-class standards' by the end of the decade. It is encouraged by the steps taken by companies to reduce unit costs, raise productivity and boost exports, but is dismayed at the failure of companies to raise investment above the depressed levels of 1989-92.

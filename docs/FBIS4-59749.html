The editorial has the  following Koranic verse as its headline: "In the Law of Equality  There Is Saving of Life to You, O Ye Men of Understanding That  Ye May Restrain Yourselves." This verse refers to the death  penalty that Di'bis urges against "the killer of lawyer  'Abd-al-Haris Madani."    The editorial extols the lawyer's profession as "defending  righteousness and righteous people and jihad against injustice  and unjust people" and defends the integrity of Egyptian  lawyers. It goes on to mention the Egyptian Human Rights  Committee's suspicions that Madani was tortured while in  custody, despite official denials. Di'bis praises the late  President Anwar al-Sadat for ordering a stop to all torture and  regrets the return of this practice after his death. He urges  President Husni Mubarak to issue a similar order and reminds him  that torture is contrary to human rights principles and the  teachings of Islam. He then calls for the resignation or  dismissal of Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's government because of the  incident.  <H5>  DISH ANTENNAS </H5>   The second major item on page 1 is a four-column report by  "AL-NUR's artistic editor" extolling the Saudi Arabian  Government's decision to ban the private use of satellite dish  antennas in order to avert the danger that foreign broadcasts  pose to that Islamic nation.    The writer exhorts Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi to  follow suit but sees little chance that he will do so. He  praises Damietta Governor Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahim for banning  satellite dishes in his Governorate and blames AKHBAR AL-YAWM's  chairman and chief editor Ibrahim Sa'dah for criticizing the  governor's move. The report criticizes the secular magazine  ROSE AL-YUSUF for accusing Saudi Arabia of buying off Egyptian  journalists.    A 200-word box on page 3 carries the Saudi mufti's fatwa  banning dish antennas.  <H5>  FATWAS, VEIL CONTROVERSIES </H5>   A 300-word item on page 1 reports on an ongoing lawsuit  between Egypt's mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi on one side and  two al-Azhar academics and AL-NUR's chief editor 'Ali Faruq on  the other. The mufti is accusing Faruq, Professor Shaban  Muhammad Isma'il, head of al-Azhar's Shari'ah Department, and  Dr. 'Ali al-Salus, professor of Jurisprudence at Qatar  University, of slandering him in articles commenting on his  fatwas on banking transactions, the importation of alcoholic  beverages for non-Muslims, and opening gambling houses for  tourists.    The court action continues.    Another 300-word report on page 1 says that the State  Council's Administrative Judicial Court has ruled in favor of  school and university female students who wish to wear the veil,  contingent on their submission to identity checks by female  security personnel.    A shorter one-column report next to this article indicates  that the Education Ministry has ordered all school students to  wear the school uniform and remove the veil. The report says  some female students are not complying and are not going to  school.   <H5>    AL-AZHAR SCHOOLS </H5>   A 3,500-word report by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi on page 3  discusses the plight of elementary and secondary students in  al-Azhar institutions -- schools controlled by al-Azhar and  leading to higher education at al-Azhar University. Various  al-Azhar academics and administrators say the students' heavy  workload, involving religious studies and learning the Koran by  heart in addition to the secular curricula set by the Education  Ministry, causes high rates of failure and produces students who  do not know good Arabic. Some educators and administrators say  that learning the Koran by heart should be left to secondary  school and university students but AL-NUR disputes this and says  it is easier for young children to learn the entire Koran. The  paper urges further state assistance to al-Azhar institutions to  help overcome the problem.  <H5>  BAN ON AUTHOR'S WRITINGS URGED </H5>   On page 3, 'Abd-al-Rasul al-Zaqqani reviews a book entitled  "A Critique of Dr. Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd's Aspersions." The book,  penned by Professor Isma'il Salim, includes contributions by  several Al- Azhar academics, who dispute Nasr Abu-Zayd's views  on the text of the Koran. They call for banning the two books  in which Abu-Zayd expounds his view that the Koran was a product  of its era's culture and calls for liberating Muslim minds from  slavery to religious texts. They say the two books should be  withdrawn from circulation to Cairo University students.    One essay included in "A Critique of Dr. Nasr Hamid  Abu-Zayd's Aspersions" is written by Dr. Mahmud Mazru'ah, former  dean of al- Minufiyah's School of Religious Disciplines and the  Islamic Call; Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Hawwas, assistant professor of  comparative jurisprudence at al-Azhar University; and two other  Islamic academics. The essay declares that the authors are not  accusing Abu-Zayd of apostasy but are urging him to reconsider  his "dangerous excesses" and "correct his errors."  <H5>  AL-AZHAR ROLE IN LICENSING ARTISTIC PRODUCTIONS </H5>   On page 6 AL-NUR carries the 4,500-word "text" of the fatwa  issued by the General Assembly of the State Council's Fatwa and  Legislation Department pertaining to the issue of whether the  Culture Ministry or al-Azhar has authority to license or ban  artistic audiovisual material. The fatwa, dated 10 February  1994, is in the form of a letter to the al-Azhar shaykh and is a  response to an inquiry he sent to the above department on 10  July 1993. After outlining the pertinent constitutional  provisions and laws issued over the years in Egypt in connection  with the dissemination of the material in question, the fatwa  concludes that the Culture Ministry is the body authorized to  license or ban artistic audiovisual material when no question of  Islamic content arises. It notes, however, that when the  material to be disseminated has an Islamic aspect, al-Azhar has  a "binding opinion on the Culture Ministry" in connection with  issuing or withholding a license for such artistic audiovisual  material.  <H5>  OPINION ON TERRORISM </H5>   In the opinion section on page 5, a 600-word article by  Hasan  Mukhtar Baghdadi, a pharmacist, says Israeli intelligence  services are behind terrorist acts in Egypt. They choose as  perpetrators of these acts people with weak characters and no  jobs. To fight unemployment, he urges the government to collect  an alms tax, confiscate the wealth of "drug traffickers,  low-quality art merchants, bribe takers, and thieves," and  encourage the investment of Egyptian capital inside the country  by offering tax breaks.  <H5>  ISLAMIC COUNCIL OFFICIAL DISCUSSES MUSLIM ILLS </H5>   In a 2,000-word interview on page 4, Kamil al-Sharif, a  Jordanian national who is secretary general of the International  Islamic Council for Call and Relief, ascribes the current ills  of the Muslim world, including backwardness in comparison with  other countries, to the lack of Ijtihad in modern times--that  is, drawing up codes of conduct based on Islamic precedent or  analogies with Koranic and Sunnah teachings. He says Ijtihad  was interrupted by centuries of foreign rule and as a result  modern Muslims are now divided over many issues and do not have  "a unified understanding or unified view of modern Islam". He  blames traditions for attributing a lesser role to women than  Islamic shari'ah actually gives them and calls for  distinguishing between shari'ah itself and mere traditions.    He says many reformers are cautious about addressing this  point to avoid accusations and suspicion because "there is also  intellectual terrorism, even among Islamic groups." He warns  that "erroneous applications" of Koranic or Sunnah texts leads  to "ignorance, chaos, and fanaticism."    Al-Sharif says he believes women can do any job men do  except  fill the highest posts of authority. Referring to the important  roles played by early Muslim women in war, nursing, and even  Ijtihad, he supports working women and says that the best  protection of their virtue comes from internal conviction.  <H5>  MUSLIMS WORLDWIDE </H5>   AL-NUR publishes on page 2 a 2,000-word interview with the  mufti of Singapore's Muslim minority. He notes the absence of  religious persecution in that secular country and speaks of the  Muslim community's efforts to upgrade the education of its  children, improve its economic conditions, and build more houses  of worship.    A 1,000-word report on page 2 is entitled "The Hardships of  Muslims in India". It speaks briefly of "the Muslims'  persecution by Hindus" who attempt to "exterminate or assimilate  Kashmir's Muslims." The rest of the report speaks  disapprovingly of various other religious beliefs and practices  in India.</p>

Although the "Alliance" has already  been dubbed "Rutskoy's presidential party," the activist, who  asked not to be identified by name "because of a gentlemen's  agreement with comrades," said that Aleksandr Rutskoy is seen as  leader "only prospectively," but generally "he is not going to  matter."    Over several months of efforts to create the "Alliance" the  organizers did manage to keep their part of the bargain in the  "gentlemen's agreement" and to ensure a certain secrecy of the  project. Only one of the technical organizers -- former Supreme  Soviet member Andrey Golovin -- spilled the beans, saying that  its "founders" were virtually all the participants in what have  of late become traditional "centrist `roundtables'" in the  Gorbachev Fund -- among them Valeriy Zorkin, ex-chairman of the  Constitutional Court; Aleksandr Tsipko, a Gorbachev Fund expert;  and ex-deputy Oleg Rumyantsev, "who worked in the White House  till the end." Organizers decline to name their other  comrades-in-arms, pleading that "too important names" are  involved.    Andrey Golovin said that the "charter fund" of the new  organization alone "is a matter of tens of millions of dollars."  Valeriy Khomyakov, who resigned as Democratic Party of Russia  executive committee chairman, voiced a guess that "Tsipko of the  Gorbachev Fund is not present there for nothing."    The abovementioned activist agreed to give a "general  outline" of the organization's immediate plans: "We already  have in place the structure and theoretical tenets, and we are  going over to practical actions. I promise that everybody will  hear about the `Alliance' in three to four weeks from now."  "The decisive moment," according to him, has been slated for  late March and early April. He vouched, however, that "there  would no longer be blood, and whatever happens will follow the  October 1964 scenario." Recall that there was a peaceful party  coup during the 1964 party plenum in October when Nikita  Khrushchev was ousted as a result of an internal conspiracy by  his closest comrades in arms.</p>

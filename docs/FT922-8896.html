			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: EC must press Greece to recognise Macedonia Sir, Today, Greece wants to eradicate the Macedonian name and relegate it to the history books. Greece encompasses more territory than ever before. It has achieved its policy of expansion by exploiting the temporary weaknesses of its neighbours over time and annexing territories with the help of the west. This is allegedly done in the name of 'Greek democracy'. In 1912 and 1913, both during and following the Balkan Wars, Greece seized Thessaloniki from Turkey, annexed Crete and absorbed a large part of coastal Macedonia. Macedonia is the name of a geographical region that belongs to all peoples. Today, the former state falls under the national boundaries of three different countries. To the north is the independent Republic of Macedonia where southern Slavs have lived for 1,400 years. To the south is the northern part of Greece and to the east live the Bulgarian-Macedonia people. Throughout the centuries, the region of Macedonia has maintained its own name. The Greek government does not have a copyright on the name of Macedonia. Nor does Greece have the right to start changing the names of other cities around the world. In ancient times, the Greeks did not consider Macedonia to be a part of Greece. In 359 BC, Demosthenes, the Greek statesman, wrote his famous anti-Macedonian speeches in which he depicted the Athenian fear of the Macedonian kingdom and Philip II. A generation later, Alexander the Great conquered Athens. With this historical precedent, how can Greece claim that Macedonia belongs to it? The Greek government, with its irrational policy toward Macedonia, has taken advantage of the goodwill of the EC by delaying the international recognition of this country. Internally, Greece has aroused extreme nationalistic behaviour, closed its northern borders for commerce and withheld vital supplies of food and medicine. I believe that Greece is deliberately preparing the groundwork for another tragedy by creating conditions for war such as is occurring in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. I believe that the EC should hold the Greek government accountable for its provocative actions. I urge the EC foreign ministers to end their indecisiveness about the plight of the Macedonian people and their right to self-determination.

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Swiss Volksbank falls due to MCC provision A PROVISION to cover a Dollars 73m (Pounds 39.9m) loan to Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) was among the main factors contributing to a slump in the 1991 profits and a dividend cut at Swiss Volksbank, Switzerland's fourth largest commercial bank. Total provisions soared to SFr393.8m (Pounds 154m) from SFr157m in 1990. Mr Walter Ruegg, president, did not mention the Maxwell loan specifically, but he said provisions were 'much larger than we forecast in the autumn'. The bank's cash-flow rose 27 per cent to SFr382.9m, but net income plunged 38.3 per cent to SFr68.4m. The directors proposed a dividend of SFr40 per share, down from SFr75 last year. Volksbank's provisions do not include any allocation for its Dollars 35m loan to a Maxwell private company last November, and against which it received 13 per cent of the shares of Berlitz, the language school subsidiary of MCC, as collateral. MCC had previously agreed to sell its holding in Berlitz shares to a Japanese company. Volksbank said yesterday that its loan to the Maxwell private company had been liquidated and the Berlitz shares were being held until a buyer could be found. Last week, Berlitz adopted a 'poison pill' scheme to deter an unwanted change in the control of the company as a result of sales by Volksbank and other banks holding large blocks.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Ruichang (0491 3843 1603): "China Supports </F> Establishment of Partnership Relations for Sustainable  Development"]    [Text] Bridgetown, 5 May (XINHUA) -- At a high-level  meeting of the UN "global conference on sustainable development  of small island developing countries" held in Bridgetown,  capital of Barbados, Liu Chengguo, leader of the Chinese  Government delegation, pointed out that the principle of  establishing partnership relations for sustainable development  as defined in this conference should become the foundation of  international cooperation in the fields of environment and  development.    Liu Chengguo held: The sustainable development of small  island developing countries is an important component of global  sustainable development. Small island developing countries'  efforts to develop the economy and protect the environment  constitute a contribution to realizing the goal of global  sustained development.    Speaking on how to establish such partnership relations for  sustainable development, Liu Chengguo said that such relations  should be characterized by mutual respect and equality in  treating each other. He said: Large or small and strong or  weak as they may be, all countries are equal partners in  international cooperation. Only in this way, can they have the  foundation for cooperation. If a country criticizes others at  every turn, always tries to force certain patterns or the  policies and methods suitable to some countries on others, and  even regards money and technical aids as political counters and  puts forward unreasonable demands on the internal affairs of the  aided countries, partnership relations will be out of the  question.    Liu Chengguo said: In such partnership relations, the  endeavor to solve global environmental problems should also be  closely combined with the endeavor to solve the specific  problems that small island developing countries are faced with,  and small island developing countries should be helped to attain  the two goals of sustained economic development and  environmental protection, which supplement each other.    Liu Chengguo pointed out that such partnership relations  should manifest the principle of "common and yet different  responsibilities." He said: Changes in weather, rise of the  sea level, pollution of seas and coasts, and other environmental  problems are not created chiefly by small island countries, but  small island countries are the first to suffer the damage. Many  problems left from colonial or trusteeship periods are still  restricting their social and economic development. Therefore,  to effectively solve the environmental problems of small island  countries and enable them to achieve sustainable development,  the international community, especially developed countries,  should shoulder more duties.    In conclusion, Liu Chengguo said: As a developing country,  China has a deep understanding and sympathy toward the  difficulties small island developing countries encounter. China  has established friendly cooperative relations with many small  island developing countries and is willing to actively probe and  strengthen multiform and multi-layered South-South cooperation  to realize common development and prosperity.    The UN "global conference on sustainable development of  small  island developing countries" opened on 25 April. Government  delegations from 100 member countries of the United Nations,  including China, attended the conference. The conference was  held particularly for the purpose of addressing the special  problems regarding the environment and development of small  island countries after the 1992 UN conference on environment and  development.</p>

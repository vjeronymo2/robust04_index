			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Books: Misfit with an eye for human weakness - JL Carr did not start writing until he was 51. Now 80, he has just produced his eighth novel - and published it himself HARPOLE AND FOXBERROW, GENERAL PUBLISHERS by J. L. Carr Quince Tree Press (27 Mill Dale Road, Kettering) pounds 4.95 157 pages A FORMER Guardian fiction prize-winner (in 1980, for A Month in the Country) and twice short-listed for the Booker prize (for the same novel and for The Battle of Pollocks Crossing), JL Carr has solved the problem of dealing with publishers. Trust your own judgment, ditch them - and publish your own work. Carr's publishing enterprise, the Quince Tree Press, has been going since the early 1960s. Now, Carr has brought out his eighth novel, Harpole and Foxberrow, in the form he calls 'half-hardback.' It is printed with love and care, with beautiful woodcut illustrations on high-quality paper and at an affordable price - features which, he feels, most other publishers are unable to do or are not interested in producing. It is another very funny, bitter and nostalgic novel. If there can be a successor to Evelyn Waugh, with a liberal dose of JR Ackerley, Carr might be it. He is now 80. Averaging one novel a decade might seem slow work. On the other hand, his first - A Day in Summer - was published in 1963 when he was already 51. He spent most of his adult working life as a primary school teacher, living for the past 40 years in the same house in Kettering, Northamptonshire. He took early retirement in 1967 to see, as he puts it, 'whether I could make a living out of writing.' He could; just about. His novels have acquired a cultish following but have never quite broken the barrier into wider reader awareness; that is a castigation of general taste rather than a condemnation of the writing. Carr has some staunch admirers. The former education secretary, Kenneth Baker, adores The Harpole Report (1972), an hilarious novel in journal and letter form about a new school headmaster whose staff and children all seem in conspiracy against him. Carr also has had some extra-literary acclaim. A Month in the Country was turned into a successful feature film, and A Day in Summer into a television film. And a version of Carr's previous novel - What Hettie Did (1988), featuring a precocious 18-year-old schoolgirl who reveres Robert Browning - was first broadcast by the BBC in 1989. But he has some well-known detractors. One leading British sports journalist, Brian Glanville, was quoted in the Sunday Times in 1988 as saying: 'I find all of Carr's writing monumentally arid.' In particular, Glanville reviled Carr's 1975 novel, How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the FA Cup, a mock-epic depiction of a village football team's rise to the top. Even Glanville has his aberrations. His successes have not, however, taken Carr into the kind of general public awareness enjoyed by, for instance, Margaret Drabble or Kingsley Amis. Part of the explanation is that Carr's writing is a literary misfit. His novels defy simple classification. They do not move in a single direction. Often, they are comic. But they also probe human weakness with a singularly mordant eye. Carr's start in life (failing the 11-plus examination twice, Victorian working class parents who left school at 12) was not auspicious. But they paid nine guineas a year to send him to Castleford secondary school. 'It was run quite anarchically - no caning, prizes or prefects; it suited me perfectly,' says Carr. There, he discovered a love of reading, particularly Conrad and Browning. Carr took to teaching as a way to earn a secure living. But he always had a conscious determination to break his career eventually and do something else. Before retiring, he had dipped a toe into publishing. '1964 was the 100th anniversary of John Clare's death. I was honorary editor of a teachers' magazine, and I thought it would be a nice idea to put a 16-page selection of his poetry in the magazine as a free gift.' It was successful. When he was 55, he 'asked for two years of unpaid leave of absence to do research. No one asked me 'what research?' But it was just to see if I could make a living without teaching.' With Pounds 1,600 saved, he started a small publishing house. It grew to a 100-strong selection of chapbooks, retailing for about 50p each, on a wide range of topics and poets. The Dictionary of English Cricketers is 'a big seller; it will carry on long after I've gone.' That basis, plus some income from his already-published novels, enabled him to take a cautious leap into the unknown and publish What Hettie Did. But why turn away from large, established publishers? Scruples, taste, and not wishing to cheat readers. Somewhat old-fashioned virtues, rather like his novels. Carr showed me a couple of early paperback versions of those. One, The Harpole Report, has a front cover showing a scantily-clad woman draped across a flustered-looking male teacher wearing academic gown and mortarboard. A front cover more remote from the book's contents could hardly be imagined. Publishers have 'got it into their head that blood and sex are what sells,' says Carr. In his writing, Carr always has tried to please himself first and hope that others would be pleased, too. With What Hettie Did, he wrote from the point of view of a schoolgirl, just for the challenge of seeing if he could do it. 'When I was a boy, one of my favourite occupations was walking along the tops of fences. Fear of falling off always had a certain charm for me. 'What kept me writing books was trying to do something difficult. For instance, writing as an 18-year-old intellectual girl - would it be possible for an old man? Of course, you stack the cards in your favour, you couldn't write about a moron who listened to Radio 2 all day long . . .' In Harpole and Foxberrow, two characters from The Harpole Report re-appear and take over a small, unsuccessful publisher. One of their authors, Edwin Shutlanger, a schoolteacher, re-writes the Bible in contemporary mores, is interviewed on television, and becomes an overnight hit. A backlash sets in against him and he is sacked for the turmoil he causes. Unperturbed, Shutlanger opens his own school, promising: 'New educational theories unwelcome.' He is inundated with applicants but turns down anyone he decides is a 'consumer' rather than a 'person.' Harpole asks how he will tell the difference. 'Simple] If he whines for what everyone else has, he's a consumer. If he insists on something different, he's a person.' JL Carr is a person - definitely not a writer of consumer goods.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Qin Chun (4440 2504)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- The "Comprehensive Study  of the Prediction and Appraisal System for the Development of  Basic Subjects of Study" [ji chu xue ke fa zhan yu ce he ping  jia xi tong zong he yan jiu -- 1015 4342 1331 4430 4099 1455  7315 3261 0735 6097 0116 4762 4827 4844 0678 4282 4496] -- a  major project of the Seventh Five-Year Plan financed by the  State Natural Science Fund -- recently passed an evaluation  examination in Beijing. Experts in this field have said that  the project was developed in setting sights on the management of  and the policy on basic research; that, in carrying out the  project, researchers conducted pioneering and systematic study  and a theoretical summation of priority science fields; and that  the overall standard of the project is among the most advanced  in China.    How to decide the priority of and to appraise scientific  research projects is one of the central issues in formulating  policy on scientific and technological development. As the  science sphere continues to expand, we must first conduct a  scientific appraisal of those key basic research projects that  are relatively mature and that have an overall impact on and  serve as a driving force for economic, scientific, and  technological development before we concentrate our efforts on  making breakthroughs in key issues. For this reason, over the  past three years and more, the group undertaking the project --  led by Professor Chen Yuxiang, a state- level middle-aged  scientist -- conducted a large amount of studies and analyses on  the scientific selection of basic research projects, finally  enabling it to establish a set of theories and a system for  appraising basic research projects. At the same time, the group  studying specific subjects, in light of the country's policy on  aiding science and technological projects and of the country's  resources distribution, conducted substantiated research on the  structure of specific subjects of study, the metrological  analysis of scientific output, the theory on the budgeting and  distribution of funds, and the formulation of scientific  development strategies and achieved fruitful results.    When accepting the project, experts said the project not  only  was theoretically innovative and has filled the gap in this  field in China but that it also has provided a new method that  can be used as a reference in formulating policy on scientific  and technological development, as well as provided a large  amount of information. In conjunction with the country's  science and technology policy and management, the project has a  very important application value for selecting key technologies.  The popularization and development of the project will provide  a new means for further improving the coordination between the  country's science and technology resources and the state's  development objectives.</p>

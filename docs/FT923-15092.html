			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Receiverships down again THE NUMBER of receiverships and administration orders last month was down on the same time last year for the fifth consecutive month, according to figures collated by accountants Touche Ross and issued yesterday. There were 412 appointments in England, Wales and Scotland for June, compared with 483 in June last year, the statistics from the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes show. The number of appointments rose from 358 in May, the fourth consecutive month in which the figures had fallen and the lowest number for 18 months. Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross, said that the trend was undoubtedly a sign of increased business confidence, and showed that the clearing banks were being more supportive of their customers. He said if the trend continued he expected business failure rates to fall by up to 15 per cent for the whole of this year compared with last year. The total number of appointments for the first six months of this year was 2,718 compared with 2,915 in the corresponding period last year. Receivership appointments rose slightly last month in London and the south-east, and for the hotel and catering and wholesale and distribution sectors. BRITAIN'S gold and foreign currency reserves fell by an underlying Dollars 14m last month, the Treasury said yesterday. The overall level, which includes debt repayments under the exchange cover scheme, fell by Dollars 104m to reach Dollars 45.7bn on June 30.</p>

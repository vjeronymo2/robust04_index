			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMOKE DETECTORS  </P> <P> As a fellow pariah, I enjoyed the letter from R. W. de Vries about smoking in  Europe (June 11), especially in France. There is an even better place for  smokers. In Turkey it seems one is always offered a cigarette, together with  the inevitable glass of tea, as one of the many gestures of friendship and  hospitality.  </P> <P> And on domestic flights in Turkey, there is no such thing as a no-smoking  section. Hooray -- this will keep most Americans out of Turkey and it is one of  the few places left abroad where one can have a wonderful holiday for very  little money and without running into a lot of other visitors.  </P> <P> Turkey, a loyal ally of this country, perpetually gets a bum rap from the media  here, but its greatest asset as a tourist destination, especially for a woman  who travels alone as I do, is that it is perfectly safe.  </P> <P> MAUREEN BANGSTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

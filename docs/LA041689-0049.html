			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIX PERCENTERS  </P> <P> Jon Douglas didn't even attempt to address the real issue in At Issue (April  2), which is the fact that brokers still make a flat 6% sales commission on the  exorbitant prices of Westside homes.  </P> <P> Instead, he simplistically stated the obvious, i.e., "most of us are . . . too  busy to take on such tasks . . . providers of professional services can act in  our best interests in situations where we may not be knowledgeable enough to  represent ourselves." Can't argue with that, Jon.  </P> <P> However, as Crystal Russell pointed out, there's been no increase in the  broker's services that even approaches the skyrocketing increase in home  prices. To the contrary, they can work less, and make much, much more -- simply  because their commission hasn't changed. Moreover, demand is so great in this  idyllic area that instead of having to beat the bushes for buyers, they have to  fend them off.  </P> <P> Relax, Mr. Douglas, we don't want to "eliminate the professional middle man."  We really are too busy trying to make a living. All we're saying is, it's time  to end the gravy train. If you and your industry aren't responsible enough to  police yourselves and implement a sliding commission scale that descends as  house prices ascend, I urge readers or regulators to end the real estate  rip-off. If not, brokers will continue to sock it to homeowners.  </P> <P> BEVERLY DELOTT  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

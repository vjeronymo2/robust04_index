			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Summary" of an item appearing in the 2 May issue of </F> TEMELJI USPEHA]    On 21 April, 1994, a round table was held in Belgrade. The  topic was "The Building Materials Industry: Foundations of  Success". The gathering was organised by Ekonomska Politika and  the Kondor Holding Company of Belgrade. It was attended by some  15 directors of the most renowned firms in that field, as well  as representatives of the Federal, Republic of Serbia and City  of Belgrade administrations.    Two reasons determined the title of the round table. First,  participating in it were only good firms, i.e. those which not  only survived in times of trial in spite of the blockade, but  succeeded in achieving more or less good business results. The  second, possibly more important reason, was to some extent  symbolic. Namely, the building materials industry has been among  industries which have their own raw materials base, depend on  imports of energy only, i.e. crude oil and natural gas. That  means that after the lifting of sanctions imposed by the United  Nations they could become one of the foundations of, and give  momentum to economic recovery of the country. Therefore, the  voice of businessmen from that industry appears to be relevant  in considering both present economic conditions and those which  will occur when Yugoslavia reenters into the international  community.    The first participant in the discussion, Mr. Jovan  Bogicevic,  assistant federal minister of the construction industry, in  charge of that industry, spoke exactly in that sense. Mr.  Bogicevic pointed out the great significance of that industry in  our country. Its share of the social product before the economic  crisis, i.e. 1981, amounted to some 11 per cent, which is  characteristic of developed countries, although Yugoslavia does  not belong among them, while the construction industry's share  in developing countries amounts to 5-6 per cent. Unfortunately,  Mr. Bogicevic stressed, that share started falling after 1981.  so that it amounts to some 5 per cent now.    Overcapacity has been a special problem. Most facilities had  been built having in mind the market of the former Yugoslavia.  In view of their capacity even that market had been too small.  Today, when Yugoslavia has been halved, that overcapacity is  even more visible. However, another circumstance prevents that  disproportion to fully tell. Shortages of natural gas and heavy  heating oil result in underutilization of those capacities so  that some products have been in short supply on the market. That  refers in the first place to cement, which for that reason has  been more expensive in Yugoslavia than in many other countries,  including some neighboring ones.    Brick, roofing tile, ceramic tile and similar products  manufacturing are in a rather different position although they  also have been working only a few months a year due to energy  shortages. Their problem has been the lack of demand so that  they have large stocks of products. Economic recession caused  the fall of investment activities, especially of private housing  construction that used to absorb some 80 per cent of their  output, so that those factories practically remained without  their market. Because of that several participants in the  discussion warned that in such a case the orientation to  stimulating demand was better than stimulating production, as,  e.g. giving credits to individuals who would build houses would  almost automatically stimulate production as well.    Mr. Karolj Kasas, director of the firm Potisje in Kanjiza,  spoke in particular of the significance of a stable dinar, as a  stable currency enabled long term thinking and planning.  "However, Mr. Kasas emphasized, a stable dinar will be useful in  the best meaning of the word if manufacturers will be able to  get credits for new programs, for the reconstruction of  production lines and construction of new facilities".  [quotation marks as published]    Mr. Sreten Ilic, director of the firm Vunizol of Surdulica,  which manufactures thermoinsulating materials, pointed in  particular to a, in his opinion, paradox. On the one hand it has  been mentioned that the easiest way of reviving the economy was  through the construction industry as many other industries were  linked to it. On the other hand when concrete talks are  initiated, the answer is that there is no money. Mr. Ilic  therefore requested the federal and Serbian governments to  precisely say what they have in mind doing, to say whether they  have investment programs, whether those are public works or  something else.    Directors participating in the round table however did not  blame external sanctions and blockades as the essential limiting  factor of development. In fact, much more was said about  internal obstacles in the form of excise duties, personal income  taxes, etc. The unanimous judgment was that such high taxes  could not be easily borne even by a much stronger economy,  situated in better economic and political conditions.    Prices of construction materials industry products and their  sales have been heavily burdened by transport costs. A very  illustrative example in that respect was presented by Mr.  Tomislav Vasovic (1st May of Cacak). That firm has been buying  stone, ground and assorted, at YUD20.00 [Yugoslav dinars] per  ton while transport from the quarry to Cacak, some 100 km away,  costs another YUD30.00 perton. The general conclusion was that  with such prices of transport it was very difficult to be  competitive on the world market, as it will be on the domestic  market as soon as borders open.    Mr. Milan Milatovic, director of the firm Mermer of  Danilovgrad, spoke from his angle about bureaucratic obstacles  which prevented development of the raw material base. That  factory was lucky that after Yugoslavia's disintegration it  remained practically the only manufacturer of stone on the  territory of the new state. Thus there has been no problem with  sales, the problem being how to satisfy all needs. But, Mr.  Milatovic sald, while in neighboring Italy only two papers were  needed to open a new site, in Yugoslavia one had to pay  YUD100,000.00 to get those papers.    Mr. Ranko Zizic, director of the Kondor Holding Company,  spoke in particular about results achieved in substituting  products manufactured in some ex-Yugoslav republics or abroad.  That firm has been specializing in hydro and thermo insulation  programs, building construction chemistry, flooring and  ceramics. Regardless of the relatively large number of factories  in that field however, Mr. Zizic stressed, there have been  many products whose manufacture has not been mastered, although  there is no reason why they should not be produced in our  country. Raw materials for many of them exist on the spot and  they had been purchased here by many, transported, e.g., to  Slovenia, where some additives had been added, they were  packaged again and then returned to be sold on this market.  Initial results achieved in that field have been significant but  not sufficient. There has been much space and many products  which could be manufactured by local factories, of course on the  same footing as regards prices and quality with those found on  the world market.    Finally, several participants in the discussion stressed the  necessity to preserve existing factories in order to prevent  that after sanction are lifted (and judging by vistis of foreign  partners some have been forecasting that that need not be so far  away) we would be forced to import products for which we have  not only raw materials but also know how and most advanced  technology.</p>

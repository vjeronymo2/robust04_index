			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cassidy Brothers Cassidy Brothers, the Blackpool-based toymaker, saw pre-tax profits drop from Pounds 695,521 to Pounds 457,217 over the 12 months to April 30. Mr Thomas Cassidy, chairman of this USM-traded group, said the decline - recorded on turnover ahead to Pounds 6.26m - was attributable to many of the group's customers de-stocking in the pre-Christmas season in the face of recession. Earnings emerged at 6.11p (9.07p) but the recommended final dividend is held at 1.65p for a maintained total of 2.4p.</p>

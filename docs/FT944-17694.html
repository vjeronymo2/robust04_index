			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Setback for Blair as party votes for Clause 4: Labour leader to continue reform despite defeat on public ownership Mr Tony Blair pledged yesterday to press ahead with plans to rewrite Labour's constitution, in spite of an embarrassing defeat at the hands of traditionalist conference delegates. Mr Blair shrugged off leftwing demands for a halt to his modernisation drive after delegates backed a resolution defending Clause 4, the party's 76-year-old commitment to widespread public ownership. Dismissing the vote as 'insignificant', Mr Blair indicated that he intends to have a statement of Labour's aims and objectives in place well before next year's conference. But privately officials admitted the vote was a presentational debacle. Mr Blair has already started work on the draft of a statement which will run to only three or four paragraphs. His intention is that it will replace Clause 4 on every membership card. Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, will announce later today the details of an extensive consultation programme with all party members. Mr Blair believes this could be completed by the spring, paving the way for broad agreement well ahead of the 1995 conference. He expects its ratification to be a formality. Friends of the leader rejected suggestions that the Clause 4 vote had in any way altered what he terms 'a seismic shift' in Labour's political strategy at the Blackpool conference. Mr Blair took comfort from the narrow margin of defeat - 50.9 per cent to 49.1 per cent - and claimed that many delegates would have voted against the motion had they not been mandated to support it before the conference. 'It makes no difference whatever to the review taking place. It has got absolutely no significance,' he said on BBC radio. 'I have absolutely no doubt that the review will take place and that the result will be absolutely positive for Labour.' Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said on the BBC's Question Time last night: 'The Labour party will get rid of Clause 4 by this time next year.' He described the vote as 'a bit of a setback'. Senior officials admitted in private the defeat would damage Mr Blair's attempts to remodel the party and make a decisive break with the past. There was also evidence of tension between Mr Blair and senior shadow ministers. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, was among those said to be irritated by the leader's handling of the issue. Detailed voting figures showed that Mr Blair won 52.3 per cent of the trade union vote, in spite of opposition from several big unions including the TGWU and Unison, the public sector union. The leadership was backed by only 41.6 per cent of constituency delegates, but Mr Blair's friends said they believed support had grown since Tuesday's call for rapid constitutional change. The Conservatives were quick to exploit the confusion. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the defeat revealed the 'incompetence' of Mr Blair's leadership. Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, said the vote revealed 'the old Labour party, the party of unilateral nuclear disarmament, the party of state ownership, the party that refuses to redefine socialism'. Delegates also voted for a resolution opposed by the leadership calling for defence spending cuts.

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> TOYING WITH THE LIMITS OF PHOTOGRAPHY  </P> <P> One hundred and fifty years ago, France's Joseph Niepce and Louis Daguerre and  England's William Fox Talbot elaborated on the 13th-Century camera obscura to  give birth to photography. In a cleverly subversive anniversary celebration,  the Long Beach Museum's "Enlarging the Repertoire: Jerry Burchfield and  Charlene Knowlton" (through March 5) toys with the conventional limits of  photography.  </P> <P> We expect photos to be small; these artists make mural-size works. Photography  is a record of actual events in time; these artists create contrived realities  using state-of-the-art techniques as accomplices. "Pure" photography should  involve subject, camera and a keen eye; this work results from lots of props  and a multimedia approach.  </P> <P> Burchfield, a widely exhibited fine-art photographer and former co-director of  the BC Space photo gallery and laboratory in Laguna Beach who now teaches at  Cypress College, spent a good decade mastering every possible trick to help  photographers hawk their wares. This he decided was anything but a "record of  truth," so he abandoned the camera, the staged shoot and the darkroom for what  he calls a spontaneity and higher truth more akin to the goals of painting.  </P> <P> Burchfield works with sheets of chemically sensitized Cibachrome paper joined  to make huge photo "canvases." He places bodies, skeletons, toys, debris and  necklace charms directly on the treated paper. Working in total darkness, he  then traces objects with a flash light. Dense objects register as dark,  detailed stencils in intense hues.  </P> <P> Other objects let light through and have an ethereal transparency. Light limns  poignant war toys ("Above and Below"), temple-like geometries ("Refuge") or  life-size marauding consumers ("Commodification/  </P> <P> Shoppers").  </P> <P> Themes are contemporary -- parenting, gratuitous violence, commercialism,  isolation -- but the smoky violet, purple, blood-red atmospheres, the shadowy  afterimages and pockets of intense light give works the same transcendent feel  of Ron Cooper's light torsos. Especially fine is "Last Supper," with  Burchfield's squatting wife, his infant and human bones invoking archetypal and  temporal cycles.  </P> <P> Trained as a painter, Knowlton makes photo-environments. She paints masked,  nude models with her own monochromatic, geometric designs, places them in front  of her large painted abstractions, photographs the whole scene, then enlarges  the print to mural size. Using wax, oils and dry pigments in blacks, whites and  browns, she paints primitive markings back onto the mural print, binding all  levels of information -- hands-on, replicated, contemporary, native -- into one  ambiguous whole.  </P> <P> Knowlton uses photography to translate her message into the language of today's  media culture. "People are trained to believe photos," she says. She wants the  almost life-size photos of masked, hunched nudes and Western cars to collide  with abstract marks, thwarting quick cultural generalizations and suggesting  connections between tribal art and contemporary art, non-Western cultures and  our own world view.  </P> <P> The strategies in "Enlarging the Repertoire" aren't new. In the '20s,  Pictorialists used soft focus and cropping to push the limits of photography  into fine art. With 60 years of photo technology and anything-goes art to draw  upon, Burchfield and Knowlton pull in painting, happenings, performance art and  conceptualism. If you take your photography with nothing on it, you will learn  something from this show; if you welcome a good helping of deft  experimentation, you are in for a treat.  </P> <P>  "Enlarging the Repertoire: Jerry Burchfield and Charlene Knowlton" runs  through March 5 at the Long Beach Museum, 2300 E. Ocean Ave. Long Beach. Museum  hours: noon to 5 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday. (213) 439-2119.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (7): Campaigning for culture vultures - The tourist industry WHEN Easter rolls around each year and the holiday rush to the south begins, Ticino is one of the first stops on Northern Europeans' itineraries. Visitors bring out their linen suits, sit at outdoor cafes and immediately feel Latin. Because it is blessed with a Mediterranean micro-climate, and its culture is firmly rooted in Lombardy, the Canton has been able to market its decidedly non-Swiss features with success. Today, tourism makes up 25 per cent of the gross cantonal product, bringing in about SFr1.5bn a year and employing 15,000 people or 4 per cent of Ticino's population. Ticino became a tourist destination in the late 19th century when the Gotthard Pass railway was opened. Prior to that, the area was frequented for the most part by Italians who spent a few weeks in Ticino during the summer and again in the winter to get away from the Milanese fog. In the 1930s, the Swiss travel agency Hotelplan organised tours to Ticino and then, after the Second World War, British and Americans became acquainted with the canton through their soldiers who were sent on holiday to various regions of Switzerland. Whereas the international jet set flocked to the Ticino lakes in the sixties, the seventies saw the advent of mass tourism and the small Canton found itself unprepared to deal with the influx. It is still battling with the results of the tourist boom which lasted well into the eighties: traffic jams, lack of parking space and a certain loss of identity. The local population, eager to take part in the flourishing industry, quickly sold off large tracts of land at low prices, and readily spoke German to visitors. The regional tourist offices decided to change their strategy in the early eighties when they felt that not only had the area reached saturation point but also that German was rapidly becoming a second language. According to Mr Eugenio Foglia, the Ticino tourist board's director, a campaign to promote 'intelligent tourism' was launched, encouraging travellers to become more sensitive to the identity of the area by visiting local museums and participating in cultural events. The tourist board, seeking to distance itself from mass tourism and to attract a more culturally and ecologically-minded visitor, has made concerted efforts to increase cultural events which incorporate the area's Italian identity, evident in its architecture, music, gastronomy and art. The canton's calendar of events has been flooded with music festivals and art exhibitions. Also new to the programme are special interest excursions such as a tour of modern architecture in the region (the star of Ticino's contemporary architecture movement is Mario Botta), and other tours which target nature lovers and include cycling and hiking trails. While early figures for the cultural campaign indicate positive results, Ticino is battling the recession. Last year the canton had a difficult time filling its 20,000 beds - overnight stays had dropped more than 8 per cent, with medium and modest category hotels suffering most. In fact, results for the 1992 season in Ticino were worse than for the rest of Switzerland. This, says Mr Foglia, can be explained by Ticino's dependence on Swiss-German and German clientele - more than half of its tourists are Swiss-German and Germans make up more than 50 per cent of the total number of foreign visitors. Both groups reacted to the economic downturn by cutting back drastically on holidays, resulting in a 13.7 per cent drop in the number of Swiss visitors to Ticino compared to a 6 per cent fall for the rest of Switzerland and a drop of 4.6 per cent in foreign tourists compared to a slight increase in travellers from abroad to other Swiss Cantons. British and Americans were primarily responsible for this rise in other parts of Switzerland and it is precisely this clientele that Mr Foglia and his office hope to attract. Although Ticino did see a return of British and Americans last year following their absence during the Gulf War period, according to Mr Foglia the numbers are insufficient to compensate for the loss of the Germans and Swiss-Germans. Mr Foglia, whose tenure as head of the world tourist board began just when the recession hit Switzerland, has been relentlessly promoting Ticino at travel industry gatherings, hosting journalists and travel agents and orchestrating mass mailings of brochures which, while extolling the area's mild climate and lush vegetation, focus on Ticino as a cultural centre as well as a resort. Retaining as clients the long-faithful sun-worshippers while attracting a new crowd of museum-goers will entail a delicate balancing act but Ticino has the advantage of already being divided into two distinct regions which can handle the different exigencies of travellers. The Sottoceneri is the southernmost tip of the Canton, situated around Lake Lugano. Over the years, Lugano has developed into an urban centre and now attracts more of a business crowd with weekend visitors and day trippers from Italy. Lugano is the site of many of Ticino's museums, including Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza's Villa Favorita. Classical music, jazz and world music festivals also take place in the town. Some 67 per cent of overnight stays are by foreign visitors whereas in the Sopraceneri region, which encompasses Locarno and the villages around Lake Maggiore, Swiss tourists constitute 65 per cent of overnight stays and the average length of time spent there is longer than around Lugano. Mainly a resort area, Sopraceneri's attraction is the vast Lake Maggiore and its beaches and surrounding valleys, rivers and streams. Because the tourist industry is an essential contributor to Ticino's revenue, the board receives a great deal of support from the canton government to upgrade the quality of tourism. Enormous sums have been invested in projects for new roads, tunnels and pedestrian zones to mitigate heavy traffic during the tourist season, while much effort has gone into encouraging visitors to use public transport by offering special regional passes. Ticino, still reeling from the effects of the recession on the 1992 season, is banking on diversifying the nationalities of its clientele and targeting a higher income group, thus extending overnight stays. And Mr Foglia believes a cardinal lesson was learned from the tourist boom of the seventies and eighties: so as to maintain a harmonious balance between guests and hosts the tourists should not outnumber the local population.</p>

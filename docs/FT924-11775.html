			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Outlook darkens for Germany's budget THE slowdown in the west German economy, combined with soaring costs for the east, means new budget savings of at least DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) must be made next year, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, warned yesterday. After talks with leaders of the country's industrial organisations, he said they all believed that west German growth had to be revived in order to maintain the flow of state aid and investment to the east. The slowdown was likely to mean a shortfall in budget revenues of DM5bn-DM7bn, he said. At the same time, new spending needs identified in the east, including the servicing of DM50bn in housing debts and extending investment subsidies to industry, would push the deficit into 'billions in double figures'. The government is adamant that there can be no tax increase for 1993 (on top of a 1 point rise in VAT, already approved), and has also rejected calls for a levy or compulsory loan from the better-paid. Any extra spending in the east must be financed from savings in the west. Mr Mollemann said his talks with industry were aimed at complementing negotiations for a 'solidarity pact' between industry, unions, central government and the 16 federal states, to finance recovery in the east. In a report to the cabinet on Wednesday, Mr Mollemann estimated growth in the east German economy this year at between 2 and 5 per cent, compared with original government forecasts of 10 per cent or more. He put west German growth at 1.5-2 per cent. He called for further radical savings measures from public spending, without specifying where the cuts would fall. One proposal before the government, to increase investment subsidies for small and medium-size businesses in the east from 8 to 25 per cent, would cost far too much, the industry lobbyists warned. Mr Hans Peter Stihl, of the German chambers of trade and industry, said that investment promotion had to be differentiated between regions and economic sectors. One proposal is to end subsidies for investments in the relatively flourishing retail trade and services sectors, and concentrate simply on reviving east German manufacturing industry.</p>

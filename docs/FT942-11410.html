			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (11): Business continues to flow in - Confidence among western national export credit agencies in the region has remained relatively untouched by political uncertainties in South Africa / Country profile, Southern Africa Less than two weeks before South Africa's recent elections, the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) announced a new financing line for supplies for the Alusaf aluminium plant at Richards Bay, Natal. The decision to go ahead exemplifies ECGD's underlying confidence in South Africa, in spite of the uncertain political prospects and a continuing recession. While many sub-Saharan countries remain off cover, recent years have seen a continuing flow of business in South Africa. Indeed, there are only three markets worldwide for which the ECGD exposure is higher. ECGD now has more than Pounds 1.3bn at risk in export credits it has guaranteed; and in 1992/93 it underwrote a Dollars 225m project line of credit for Davy International's supply of hot and cold mills for the Columbus stainless steel development. Its confidence is underpinned by a good payment record - by the end of the 1992/93 financial year, ECGD was trying to recover a mere Pounds 0.5m in claims paid out on South African business. Credit insurers still take a positive view of South Africa, although they may be worried about longer term prospects should post-election upheaval provoke a fresh wave of disinvestment. Investment Insurance International, a leading UK broker, reports that the private credit and political risk market is still willing to cover new deals, with premiums averaging between 2 and 4 per cent of insured value. In the past, confidence among western national export credit agencies underwriting project and capital goods contracts has also been bolstered by the state's role in guaranteeing part of the risk. The parastatal Industrial Development Corporation has played a key role, with finance often channelled through its subsidiary Impofin. The prospect of an ANC-dominated government taking over this system does not appear to worry foreign credit underwriters who believe that it will follow middle-of-the-road, market-oriented policies, backed up with judicious intervention in support of key projects. Attitudes to other southern African markets are more varied. Zimbabwe has attracted considerable interest from international export credit agencies. ECGD covered Pounds 23m of business there in 1992/93. France has put together an Dollars 11m financing package to support Aeroports de Paris' (ADP's) plan for development of seven domestic airports ADP also hopes its design for a new international terminal at Harare airport will be accepted, in spite of tough competition from a Cypriot group, Air Harbour Technologies. Zimbabwe is now on the road to recovery after a devastating drought that hit farm output hard and strained foreign exchange reserves. The country has a good payment record although some underwriters are treating it with caution until they see developments in South Africa, an important market for Zimbabwean firms. Angola and Mozambique are still regarded as high risk markets with few foreign credit insurers willing to cover deals unless they are already secured with confirmed irrevocable letters of credit. The one exception to this cautious stance is the Angolan oil sector - medium term credit is occasionally available when secured against petroleum earnings. Zambia used to be something of a pariah in the financial community because of the massive payment arrears it had accumulated. But the past few years have seen the introduction of vigorous free-market reforms, in line with IMF demands. This has pleased foreign aid donors and strengthened foreign confidence. In February this year, the UK restored ECGD 'national interest' insurance cover for trade deals on short term credit. The surprise market for many newcomers to southern Africa is Botswana, which, because of its diamond reserves, has sufficient foreign exchange to pay for more than a year's imports. Payment performance is good and Investment Insurance International finds that most insurers charge premiums in the 2-4 per cent range.</p>

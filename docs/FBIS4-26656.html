			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 24 (CNS) -- The trunk railway lines,  including those between Zhejiang and Jiangxi as well as between  Guangxi and Guizhou, were badly stricken and a great loss was  caused because of the torrential rain which hit the southern  area of the Yangtze River and South China since mid-June and led  to torrents of water rushing down the mountains and floods.    There were 14 main railway lines affected by floods as of  June 19, according to the Ministry of Railways. A breakdown of  railway service happened on 42 occasions, which resulted in a  loss of rail service time of up to 371 hours, a rise of 237  hours over the same period last year. Loading and unloading  services were affected, involving some 2,000 cars in the railway  system on average each day. Incomplete statistics showed that  direct economic damage to the railway lines resulting from the  floods was put at over RMB 70 million [renminbi], while indirect  economic loss because of breakdown of rail service was much more  serious.    As the flood season came earlier than normal with a violent  impact, railway lines in central Fujian Province were affected  by landslides because of torrents or water rushing down the  mountain between May 1 and 3. A 27-kilometre section of the  Yingtan-Xiamen railway line was buried by a mud-rock flow, which  led to a breakdown of rail service of up to 68 hours. Railway  service between Zhejiang and Jiangxi and that between Guangxi  and Guizhou came to a halt mainly due to the floods.    Guangdong and Hunan were violently hit by rainstorms.  Railway service was seriously affected, including the railway  lines between Beijing and Guangzhou, between Hunan and Guizhou,  as well as between Hunan and Guangxi, all of which are under the  jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Railway Administration. Along  these lines, landslides and sections submerged in water took  place in 60 places, and the water level at seven bridges was  well over the warning line.    The southern part of China is still subject to heavy rain in  recent days, according to weather forecasts. A flood control  command was set up by the ministry and various railway  administrations, and a 600,000-strong emergency team was also  established to stand by in a bid to fight possible floods and  ensure the safety of railway service.</p>

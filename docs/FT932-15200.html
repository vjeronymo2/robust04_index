			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Rise in output reinforces signs of recovery FRESH EVIDENCE that the UK is emerging from recession came yesterday with news that manufacturing output increased sharply in February. Output rose by 1.2 per cent compared with January, the third successive monthly increase. The rise took manufacturing output to its highest levels for 18 months and prompted the government to come closer than ever before to an official declaration that the recession had ended. The Central Statistical Office figures brought an unequivocal assessment from 10 Downing Street that the recession was over. A senior official said it was clear that 'we have a much more broadly based recovery'. Last night, Mr John Major said: 'We have come through the worst of our difficulties and very few people now doubt that the economy in this country is getting better. 'Most of our competitors are still in difficulties or going into difficulties and that means for British industry and commerce a very remarkable series of opportunities that lie ahead of us.' Optimism about the economy was reflected in British Steel's decision yesterday to announce a second round of price increases for the year. Price rises announced in January and implemented in recent weeks have been accepted by customers and fully implemented, unlike last year when they failed to stick. The upbeat news was also underlined by a report from the Confederation of British Industry and Coopers &amp; Lybrand. This found that business confidence in the financial services industries had 'strengthened markedly' for the second successive quarter. Business volumes had fallen slightly compared with the previous quarter, but the rate of decline was slowing. On the foreign exchanges, the much better than expected industrial production figures prompted gains for sterling although they failed to inspire share prices. The sharp month-on-month rise in manufacturing output was backed by a sustained rise over the three months to February, a measure which gives a better picture of underlying trends. According to the seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO, manufacturing output rose by 1.2 per cent in the three months to February, compared with the previous quarter. Against the same period a year ago, output was 1.5 per cent higher. Speaking in Tokyo at the G7 meeting of foreign and finance ministers, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday's figures were 'excellent news'.

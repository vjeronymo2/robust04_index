			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S WALL  </P> <P> Instead of feeling smug about the demise of communism and the yearning for  freedom and democracy in the Eastern Bloc, we might do well to look to the  state of freedom and democracy in our own country. We've got a wall of our own  that needs to come down -- the wall between the power class and the ordinary  citizen.  </P> <P> The HUD scandal, the savings and loan scandal, the defense contractor scandal  (which has become strangely silent in recent months) demonstrate that the  government is being run primarily for the benefit of the rich and powerful.  Contrast these shameful happenings with the denial of abortion to poor women  who are raped or victims of incest, the lack of health care for the poor, the  measly rise of the minimum wage, the lack of child care, the wave of  union-busting, and the picture becomes clear.  </P> <P> We're building more prisons, but for whom? Certainly not for those who buy  senators and congressmen and help them rip off the public. Not for people like  Ollie North who tramples on the Constitution, not for defense contractors who  bilk the public out of billions. Not for former members of the cabinet who made  phone calls to colleagues to enrich themselves and their friends. For whom,  then? For a guy who steals a loaf of bread or gets caught with a couple of  joints in his pocket?  </P> <P> Come on, America. Let's look at our own wall and start chipping!  </P> <P> BILL IDELSON  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

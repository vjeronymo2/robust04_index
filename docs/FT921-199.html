			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Clinton smoke draws little fire: Candidate's marijuana confession may revive 'character' issue THE two leading candidates for the Democratic party's presidential nomination have finally agreed on something. Mr Jerry Brown asserted on Sunday night that Mr Bill Clinton's confessed use of marijuana while a student at Oxford in the late 1960s was 'not relevant' to the current campaign. In response to a question in a televised debate shown in New York, which holds its primary a week from today, Mr Clinton said: 'When I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn't like it, and I didn't inhale and I never tried it again.' He added he had never broken any US state drugs law. Mr Brown, appearing via satellite from Wisconsin, said he had never used marijuana but went on: 'I agree with Clinton, why don't you lay off this stuff? What you did 20 years ago is not relevant.' The question of the use of narcotics has now become almost a rite of passage for aspiring American politicians and public office holders. In 1988, two Democratic candidates, Senator Albert Gore and Mr Bruce Babbitt, acknowledged earlier recreational use of soft drugs. So did Judge Clarence Thomas, approved as the new Supreme Court Justice last year, and Mr Douglas Ginsburg, who withdrew his nomination by President Ronald Reagan for the Supreme Court in 1987. In the latter case, Mr Ginsburg confessed to use only seven years previously, when already a university professor, an admission which materially damaged his nomination. However, national surveys have shown that about half Mr Clinton's generation which grew up in the 1960s smoked marijuana at one stage or another. There was some criticism yesterday that Mr Clinton had chosen to defend himself on the narrow grounds that he had broken no US law, not mentioning that marijuana was still illegal in Britain. A more general concern for the Arkansas governor may be the extent to which his admission reinforces other well-aired doubts about his 'character' - less among his generation but more among older Americans to whom the 'sex, drugs and rock n'roll' revolution always was unpalatable. His confession attracted front-page treatment yesterday in the mainstream media, with the New York tabloids typically having a field day. 'Clinton on the S-pot,' was the headline in the New York Post, while the Daily News, which had pressed Mr Clinton on the issue earlier, half-joked 'Weed asked him that.'</p>

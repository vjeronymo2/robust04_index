			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Qin Jingwu [4440 0079 0582]] </F>   [Text] Last year, China's offshore crude oil production was  4.63 million tons, an increase of 760,000 tons over the previous  year, earning a total of US$600 million, a 20 percent increase  over the previous year. According to data from the China  National Offshore Oil Corporation, impressive gains have been  made in offshore oil and gas prospecting as 40,000 kilometers of  linear seismic survey were completed in the year, 17 exploratory  wells were drilled, 16 new prospecting structures were found,  and 7 oil and gas discoveries were made for a success rate of 44  percent, including 11 new structures independently discovered,  yielding 6 oil and gas finds for a success rate of 54.5 percent.  Between August and October last year, 3 offshore oil fields went  into production, and that raised the daily offshore oil output  level up to 17,000 tons.    Calls for petroleum bids for nearby offshore areas in the  East China Sea were very successful as China joined 15  corporations from 7 countries in forming 9 groups and signing 18  petroleum contracts and agreements. Bids were concluded for an  area of 64,246 square kilometers at 18 locations, covering 90  percent of the total area for which bids were sought. The  foreign corporations working at their own risk, drilled over 50  exploratory wells in the contracted areas, at investments of  over US$300 million. The successful bidders were such major oil  corporations as Texaco, Chevron, Esso, (AGIP), Shell, and Japan  Oil. The main reason for the successful bidding for East China  Sea oil is said to be the progress of reforms in China, the  stable and rapid economic development, and the cooperative image  and reputation of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation,  as well as the attractiveness of East China Sea oil resources  for foreign corporations.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Lost soul of socialism They say socialism is dead. Such an over-simplification is almost certainly misleading; it may even be wrong. Conservatives utter it as a mindless cry of triumph. But they do not tell us the answer to the next question: does this mean that our democracy will now start to work a little better; or will it in fact work a lot worse? It is a fact that Marxist dogma and communist practice have both suffered comprehensive intellectual and political defeats in eastern Europe. Moreover, many socialist parties in western Europe have also been struck by a series of disasters in the recent past. In March, the French Socialist party suffered its greatest electoral defeat in the country's modern history. The impression that France's ageing Socialist president, Francois Mitterrand, is just the lone relic of a fin de regime has been tragically underlined by the suicide of his former Socialist prime minister and ally, Mr Pierre Beregovoy. His longstanding rival, Mr Michel Rocard, has now seized control of the Socialist party in the hope that he can arrest, and if possible reverse, its total collapse. Rocard is trying to rebuild the party on entirely new bases, possibly in alliance with other political forces. In Italy, the crisis wreaking mayhem throughout the political establishment was detonated by revelations of wholesale corruption in the Socialist party. Bettino Craxi, the former prime minister, is one of many leading politicians under investigation for corruption and has been forced out of the leadership of the party. His successor, Giorgio Benvenuto, has already promised sweeping reforms, which could go as far as the formation of a new party, with a new name and a new symbol, possibly in alliance with other political parties. In Germany the Social Democrat Party (SPD) is in disarray after the abrupt resignation of its leader, Mr Bjorn Engholm, following damaging new revelations about an old dirty-tricks episode. In Spain, the ruling Socialist party has been tarnished by a decade in power and by corruption, and faces defeat in next month's general elections. In Britain, the Labour party snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in the last general election. Paralysed by convention and past dogmas, it looks set to be defeated again in the next. In fact, if you exclude the Labour party, most of this cluster of events can be explained simply by the spread of political corruption and dirty tricks. In Italy and France all the main parties of government, not just the Socialists, have been deeply implicated in illegal party-financing skulduggery. It's just that the French Socialists seem to have done it more systematically than the other parties. In both countries, the voters only rebelled after magistrates exposed systematic law-breaking. Jean-Marie Guehenno, who is head of policy planning at the French Foreign Ministry, thinks we should not be surprised by the spread of corruption. In his new book, he argues that political corruption is just one of the logical consequences of global markets, international networking and the information revolution. Other consequences are the reduction of all other values to money, the overwhelming of national political systems and the disintegration of traditional democratic values. You may not be surprised to learn that his book is called La Fin de la Democratie (published by Flammarion). His diagnosis may be too pessimistic. But it is clear that the forces at work in the new international economic environment make it very difficult for any government to follow old-fashioned socialist policies, without retreating into Cuba-style isolation and backwardness. France's Socialists tried it in 1981, but by 1983 they discovered they must choose between socialism and the European Community; they chose Europe. Leaders such as Michel Rocard and Giorgio Benvenuto and, yes, John Smith, face a double challenge - to salvage something plausible from the implicit corpus of socialist ideals, in terms which are consistent with market pricing, and to see if this can be made into a vote-winning platform of government. Neither task will be easy. Chunks of the old socialism, including nationalisation and command interventionism, have fallen into the road. Swathes of the old socialist voters, such as trade unionists from heavy industry, have migrated to the middle classes, to informal employment, or to unemployment. Today's central challenge, moreover, is not redistribution or expanding the welfare state, but the generation of wealth on competitive terms. But the task cannot be impossible, because British-style conservatives are also imprisoned in their own philosophical quandary, which is just as difficult. This is the quandary of reductionism or political alienation. The problem with liberal democracy is that liberalism is all about the individual, and about costs and prices, whereas democracy is all about shared values, common interests and collective action. The tension between the two is unavoidable. The more the conservatives press the pedal of liberalism, the more they glorify the individual against the community, the more they elevate commerce against culture, the more they stress prices against values. This must leave room for an alternative view of society and culture, community and social solidarity. Many years ago, a German coined the concept of a social market economy; and he was a conservative. If Jean-Marie Guehenno is right, money is now the only value, even in politics. But if he is wrong, perhaps an updated socialist party could take over the concept of One Nation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- The State Duma (lower  house of the Russian parliament) adopted an address on Friday to  the Russian president, as the guarantor of the Russian  Constitution, requesting him to use his powers to ensure  constitutionality during the election campaign to bodies of  state authority in member republics of the Russian Federation  and to bodies of local self-government.    The Duma's address to the president was prompted, above all,  by concern over facts of discrepancy between this process and  provisions of the Russian Constitution and the lack of adequate  control over the observation of legality from federal bodies of  power.    Lawmakers were especially concerned over violations of  voting  rights of citizens in legal acts adopted by bodies of state  power in member republics of the Russian Federation, infringing  on the principles of equal suffrage and restricting the  participation of citizens and their associations in the election  campaign as well as over violations of the principle of openness.    The Duma's address was also sent to parliament's upper  chamber, the Russian Government, bodies of state authority in  member republics of the Russian Federation, the Russian  procurator-general and the Russian Central Electoral Commission.  The address calls on them to take measures "to implement  successfully new state construction in Russia by concerted  efforts of all interested sides".</p>

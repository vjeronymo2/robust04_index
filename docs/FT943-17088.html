			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Austria reaps rewards with China deals Austrian companies appear set to secure contracts with Chinese government agencies for up to Sch10bn (Pounds 574m) in goods and services, after several years of efforts to build contacts and trade with the People's Republic. Several contracts, including one for a Sch500m steel casting plant and another for up to Sch1.6bn worth of crude oil, were signed yesterday during an official visit by Mr Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, to Vienna. The most important agreement, worth up to Sch7bn, was in the railway equipment sector, where Austria has many strong suppliers. Under the agreement, Austrian companies will receive some Sch3bn worth of orders for locomotives, rails, switches (points), rail laying machinery, telecoms and and tunnel construction. A further Sch3bn to Sch4bn was achievable under the agreement and Mr Viktor Klima, the Austrian transport minister, held out the prospect of up to Sch30bn in railway-related contracts with China in the longer term. Mr Klima said China was suffering from severe bottlenecks in transporting its raw materials, and so had given the highest priority to railway construction. The crude oil deal was signed with the Austrian integrated oil group OMV. It calls for the delivery to China of up to 1m tonnes of crude oil at prevailing market prices over a year beginning in August. OMV produced 2.1m tonnes of oil last year, about half of it in Austria, the remainder in the UK and Libya. Half of the volume was fixed, with the remainder to be determined, OMV said. The total value of the deliveries was expected to be Sch1.5bn. For its part, VA Technologie, partly privatised through a public flotation in May, signed a Sch500m contract for a two-strand steel slab casting machine at a steel works in Benxi, China. VA's sister company Voest Alpine Stahl signed a declaration of intent which foresees a joint steel production venture in Ningbo, China. The agreements were reached in spite of protests from some influential Austrians about China's poor human rights record. Mr Erhard Busek, the vice-chancellor and leader of the conservative Austrian People's Party, is boycotting the visit and a plan for Mr Li to visit Vienna's city hall to sign the Golden Book was cancelled because of scheduling problems.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Comedy turns Establishment It has been a funny year. In the old days anyone who forced you into a corner and then went on and on about nose hair, the problem with Lycra underpants, and their traumas with contact lenses, would have been locked away. Now they are given their own television show. The era of 'alternative' comedy is over: monologues about the horrors of modern living, and stream of consciousness outpourings on flared trousers, have captured the mainstream: this brand of humour no longer needs a qualifying adjective. With the new breed of comedians sweeping the awards at last weekend's televised comedy prize giving while Newman and Baddiel were almost filling Wembley Arena; with Paul Merton playing the Palladium for two weeks in the spring and Ben Elton available in movie, book, video, theatre and TV, this particular comic bandwagon is on a seemingly unstoppable high. The nation is desperate for a laugh. The man with prime responsibility for this shift in popular taste is Don Ward. In 1979 he converted a room above a strip club in Soho's Dean Street into a comedy club. It was a popular idea in the US, but new to the UK. The club flourished, and moved to Leicester Square. On Monday the Comedy Store moved again, into expanded premises around the corner in Oxendon Street. As Paul Merton said at the opening cabaret, 'Comedy Store 3: This Time its Serious'. In the 14 years virtually every big-name comedian has received their break at the Comedy Store. Ben Elton, Alexei Sayle, French and Saunders, Rick Mayall, Sean Hughes, Julian Clary: the list is endless. Many appeared in public for the first time at one of the open spots on Thursday night when three strangers get the chance to die for five minutes. If they survive they might get a paid booking a month or so later when they have worked up a longer set. After that a TV show, perhaps after winning the Perrier Comedy Award at the Edinburgh Fringe, is a formality. Many of the most successful graduates turned up last Monday at the Comedy Store to usher in the new era. It is pointless to deny that comedians, like beauty queens, are hit and miss affairs. The funniest people, like the prettiest girls, prefer to blush unseen: egomaniacs with a propensity towards manic depression are the first to leap on to the stage. It is extraordinary how gauche and uncomfortable even seasoned comics can be when put on the spot of entertaining a capricious audience. 'I've not done a solo spot for 15 months', said Nick Revell, before wriggling prematurely from the stage on Monday. Simon Fanshawe failed to win over the audience and left even more quickly. But despite the sad joes, who somehow, in this uncritical business, achieve premier league status, the first show in the new Comedy Store was a jolly occasion. Sight lines are better; the 400 seats give a sense of space with no loss of intimacy; the location is ideal: Don Ward expects to be there for 25 years, in which time he could have satellite Comedy Stores around the country, perhaps on the continent. Ward, watching his proteges make millions, is belatedly attempting to cash in. And the successful comedians still return regularly to the Store to try out new material in return for a modest share of the gate. The heroes on Monday were the three comperes - Jo Brand ('no chocolate in it, no point: that's what I say'); Julian Clary ('Man About the Heath'); and Arthur Smith, who jollied things along by wearing a Lycra Superman outfit with fitted accessories. Among the stars were Eddie Izzard, who for 10 minutes made washing powders seem the funniest thing on earth; John Hegley, with a poetic pean in favour of spectacles; Hattie Hayridge, who, along with Jo Brand, has confirmed the wit in women; Jack Dee, with well received new material, and Paul Merton, with equally acclaimed old material. Merton had polished up the policeman sketch which marked his Comedy Store debut around a decade ago. These comedians are now the Establishment, roaring into their 30s, and, through the expansion of media into videos and niche publishing, making money faster than old Tarbie or Brucie could ever have imagined. What we need now to keep them on their toes is a new generation of comedians with the ability to lift their material above personal idiosyncracies to embrace a broader imaginative world. They might even consider reviving that almost forgotten art form, the well rounded joke.</p>

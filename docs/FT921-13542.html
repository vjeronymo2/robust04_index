			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Savage contrast between US and Japan There was a savage contrast last week between the US and Japan. Having consolidated its Christmas and new year gains, the Dow showed new strength last week with three all-time highs in five days. US shares are not popular with many analysts, who think they are priced on a corporate earnings recovery which will not materialise to the extent that will be needed in 1992. Tokyo, for which there is analytical support, saw the Nikkei average at its lowest since October 1990. It was the main reason why the World index, in spite of strength in Europe, shows a rise of only 0.1 per cent in local currency terms. James Capel said in a recent global seminar that Japan will enjoy a sharp consumer-led recovery starting in the second quarter of this year. Nomura followed with a recommendation of the market last Friday. However, Tokyo cannot seem to escape from a combination of technical weakness and political scandal. Last week, a senior politician was arrested for alleged bribe taking. The encouraging aspect of this situation is the way that neighbouring equity markets have mostly refused to reflect Tokyo's depression, with Hong Kong, in particular, scoring a succession of record highs. The best European performances came from Finland and Norway, which seem to have decided that there is life after the slow death of 1991. Finland has now accumulated a sizeable recovery since its Hex index low of December 23, but Kleinwort Benson's Scandinavian team, which has recommended Helsinki as a long-term buy, noted recently that the market has three weak years to improve upon. Norway, emotionally flattened by the collapse of its banking sector, has recovered mostly on North Sea oil price prospects. In a report just out, Goldman Sachs says the Norwegian economy is close to bottoming out, and will benefit from an international recovery led by the US. It adds that cyclical stocks will benefit from the global upturn.</p>

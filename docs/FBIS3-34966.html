			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri has affirmed that real preparedness to confront  developments in the region lies in two basic fields. The first  is to strengthen and fortify our internal front using all the  elements needed to destroy divisions among Lebanese. The second  is to build the establishments of the state in the vital and  industrial fields and try to develop and confront the  requirements of the coming stage.    Prime Minister al-Hariri's speech came during a seminar held  in Juniyah yesterday evening. Answering questions from people  attending the seminar, the prime minister said he supports the  implementation of al-Ta'if, but the Syrian forces will be  staying for the time being because they are helping the Lebanese  security forces preserve internal security. He stressed that  Lebanon came to the negotiations with Syria and will leave them  when Syria does. [passage omitted]    On relations among the three leaders, the prime minister  said: We do not differ over the essence, but over the form.  Differences are natural in a democratic system. On the absence  of balance in national decision-making due to the absence of  Christian representation, al-Hariri said the Chamber of Deputies  was elected within an election law. The current government is  not responsible for the elections that have already taken place.  He affirmed that when the time comes to hold new parliamentary  elections, which will not be soon, then we can rectify the  representation proportions.</p>

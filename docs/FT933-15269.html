			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: On the big dipper The summer should be a happy time for Euro Disney. But the dismal start to what should be its peak season raises questions over whether the project was fundamentally misconceived. The issue cannot be ignored even though its US parent has agreed to tide the project over until next spring. That should give time to work out the best way to take the scheme forward and restructure its finances. Whatever solution is devised, though, is unlikely to hold much appeal for Euro Disney's 200,000 ordinary shareholders. For Walt Disney, the longer term question will be whether to resurrect plans to build the second stage of the project at a cost of some FFr8bn. Without a second park, Euro Disney could never defray the substantial development costs of the first phase. The difficulties of financing the scheme through further equity issues may eventually prompt Walt Disney to try to buy out the 51 per cent of the shares it does not already own. But its own shareholders might then complain their company was simply throwing good money after bad. There is no guarantee that a larger park will fill Euro Disney's under-occupied hotels. Euro Disney may draw some comfort from its visitor numbers, which have shown reasonable progress in hostile conditions. Particular difficulties undoubtedly apply. The French economy is slipping fast. Property sales have been stymied. Local visitors are not as inclined to splash out on hamburgers and hotel rooms as foreign tourists. They, though, have been deterred by the strong franc. Euro Disney's travails also stimulate broader worries. They are hardly the best advertisement for the joys of owning shares just as the French government tries to offload rather a lot of them.</p>

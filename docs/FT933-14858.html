			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bronfman empire makes further disposals THE troubled business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family is making further disposals, selling its controlling interest in Consumers Packaging, Canada's biggest glass container maker, as well as a 50 per cent stake in a British Columbia paper mill. Consolidated Enfield, a Bronfman-controlled company, will receive CDollars 9.7m (USDollars 7.5m) for its 58 per cent stake in Consumers from the owners of Glenshaw Glass, a privately-held US glass maker based in Pittsburgh. Glenshaw has agreed to invest an unspecified amount in Consumers and to keep all its seven plants in operation. Separately, Noranda Forest, which is also controlled by the Bronfmans, has sold its 50 per cent stake in Island Paper Mills, which makes coated and uncoated papers, to EB Eddy, a Canadian forest products group. Eddy has bought the remaining 50 per cent from MacMillan Bloedel of Vancouver. Terms were not disclosed. The purchase price for Consumers of 65 cents a share is less than half the current market price, and reflects the company's fragile financial condition. Losses over the past five years have totalled CDollars 229m, and Consumers is in default on a considerable portion of its bank debt and debentures. It is in the middle of a financial and business restructuring, which included the sale earlier this year of its plastics packaging interests. Mr Brian Lawson, Enfield's president, said a fresh owner 'committed to injecting new capital and providing strategic support' greatly improves Consumers prospects. The company has a market share of roughly 70 per cent, with 1992 sales of CDollars 410m. Consumers and Island Paper are the latest in a string of asset disposals by companies in the Bronfman orbit. Others sold this year include controlling interests in MacMillan Bloedel, the west coast forestry group; John Labatt, the beer and entertainment group; and Royal Trust, Canada's second-biggest trust and loan company. The convoluted structure of the Bronfman group, which includes several private holding companies, makes it hard for outsiders to estimate the extent of its financial difficulties which led to the spate of asset sales.</p>

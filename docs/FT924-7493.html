			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Harvard hopefuls hazy on details: America It's morning in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After being out of favour for 12 long years, this little town on the Charles River is once again gearing up for a Democratic presidency. Mr Bill Clinton has already called on his old friend, Mr Bob Reich, of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, to head his economic transition team. Others who helped out during the campaign are anxiously waiting for the call from Little Rock. Down Memorial Drive at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, even the scientists are getting excited: the technological revolution promised by Mr Al Gore, Mr Clinton's deputy, will surely require a big input from this premier engineering school. The influence this town will exert is already evident in macroeconomic policy. A year ago, two old Cambridge hands, economists Robert Solow of MIT and Francis Bator of the Kennedy school, argued cogently for a two-tier economic package: an immediate fiscal stimulus that would address the short-run problem of sluggish demand, coupled with tough medium-term measures to reduce the budget deficit and hence encourage savings and investment. The first leg - accelerated infrastructure spending and a temporary investment tax credit - probably now sounds familiar. Last week Mr Clinton confirmed that he would follow just such a strategy. Nearly everybody in Cambridge seems convinced that this 'have your cake and eat it' approach is ideal for the US. Never mind that retail sales and consumer confidence are perking up, you have to get the economy really moving before fiscal austerity can be contemplated. Provided legislation is passed, mandating future spending cuts and tax increases either at a certain date or, say, when unemployment falls below a certain level, Mr Solow and others reckon the package will appear credible to financial markets. More important, the Cambridge crowd seems strangely certain that the second, unpleasant leg will be implemented. I found only one dissenter: Mr Greg Mankiw, a young Harvard economist who had the temerity to vote for President George Bush. Mr Mankiw does not believe that a Democratic White House and Congress will have the discipline to reverse a stimulus and then cut deeply into the deficit in the approach to the 1996 election. I hope he is wrong but I share some of his doubts: no Congress, after all, can bind its successors. In fact, some of the US's most famous Keynesian economists have misgivings. Mr Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate, told me that Mr Clinton would be good for growth over the next four to six quarters but conceded the 'jury is still out' on medium-term deficit reduction. Harvard and MIT are also trying to formulate Clintonite strategies for tackling microeconomic problems. At a meeting of the MIT World Economy Laboratory last week, three speakers addressed flaws in US education and training. I have to say I was disappointed. They trotted out the usual gloomy statistics, but were clearly only groping toward solutions. Echoing Mr Clinton, one suggested a Germanic apprenticeship programme, adapted to reflect 'the realities of US labour markets'. But he offered no details. If voters expect Mr Clinton to make rapid progress in complex areas such as industrial training or healthcare, they will be sorely disappointed. Many of the 'plans' are just headings on sheets of paper. Industrial policy is a third area of vigorous debate. Most of the experts I met advocated federal action to promote 'strategic' civilian technologies as well as investment in the 'information infrastructure' that so interests Mr Gore. But again most were surprisingly hazy about the details. Mr Charles Sabel, an MIT political scientist, was an exception. He regards traditional industrial policy as 'crazy' and sees the main challenge as finding institutional structures that can support the myriad of small and medium-sized companies that form the economy's backbone. Mr Bush set up seven manufacturing technology centres to provide 'extension' services to small companies, for example advice on relevant new technology. Mr Sabel supports Mr Clinton's plan to expand the network of regional technology centres. But he says more is involved than transferring technology. Small companies face a host of problems - from finding appropriate organisational structures to training and product development - that they can no longer tackle in isolation. Yet vehicles for inter-industry co-operation and dialogue, such as trade associations, are moribund. He thinks the industrial future lies in promoting flexible clusters or networks of companies that compete, yet which also benefit from many formal and informal links. This is the kind of industrial structure that seems to account for the continuing dynamism of Silicon Valley. The bustle following Mr Clinton's victory reminds older Cambridge residents of a November 32 years ago when another young president-elect, John F Kennedy, was tapping the town for talent. But the parallels do not run very deep. The only problem then was a mild cyclical downturn. And in those days economists like Samuelson and Solow were innovators: in 1960 the investment tax credit was a brand new idea. The task today is to get beyond slogans and articulate credible programmes. The Cambridge gurus have only just begun.</p>

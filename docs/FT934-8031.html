			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley up 64% in quarter MORGAN Stanley, the US securities house, yesterday announced third quarter earnings of Dollars 181.7m, up 64 per cent from a year earlier and in line with analysts' expectations. The results, however, were not as strong as in the record-breaking second quarter, primarily because of lower trading and investment banking revenues. Although the firm's overall earnings remained strong compared to previous years, the quarter-on-quarter decline in revenues from Morgan Stanley's two main businesses suggests that the unprecedented two-and-a-half year boom in Wall Street profits may have passed its peak. The firm said the drop in trading revenues was mostly the result of unfavourable conditions in the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market. Trading revenues totalled Dollars 285.3m in the period, down from Dollars 300.8m a year ago and well below the record Dollars 517.9bn reported in the second quarter. Although Morgan Stanley did not provide details on the MBS situation, several big Wall Street firms and institutional investors have encountered problems in the MBS market recently. This follows a surge in the number of borrowers paying off their mortgages early, which has led to losses on portfolios of securities that pay only the interest portion of a mortgage. With trading revenues declining, investment banking took over as the firm's main source of earnings during the quarter, bringing in a total of Dollars 295.5m, up 62 per cent from a year earlier. The improvement was accredited to growth in structured debt underwriting volumes, a strong equity new issues calendar, and an increase in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate advisory business. Brokerage commissions totalled in Dollars 101m in the quarter, up from Dollars 76.3m a year earlier, and asset management and administration fees contributed Dollars 67m, up from Dollars 51m. Interest and dividend income climbed 61 per cent to Dollars 1.57bn. Non-interest expenses increased 32 per cent to Dollars 757.6m, mostly because of a rise in compensation payments that was related to the growth in profits. Morgan Stanley's shares closed up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 76 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

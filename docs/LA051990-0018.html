			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERRYMANDERING IN CALIFORNIA AND MERITS OF PROPS. 118, 119  </P> <P> Your editorial opposing Proposition 118 was right on target in pointing out  that the measure really changes nothing in the ways incumbent politicians draw  lines to ensure their own political survival ("Prop. 118: Chaos in Sacramento,"  May 12).  </P> <P> Rather than being a reform, Proposition 118 is really the "incumbent protection  plan."  </P> <P> Under the two-thirds scheme, Democrat and Republican leaders would assure the  preservation of incumbents and go further to reward and punish party members to  maintain power for the leadership.  </P> <P> Remember also, that the current districts were approved by a two-thirds vote of  the Legislature and could have been vetoed by the governor -- so what's new?  </P> <P> It is time to put the public back in charge. Only the nonpartisan, independent  commission approach in Proposition 119 puts citizens in a position to establish  district lines for the politicians.  </P> <P> Proposition 119 is the best chance for fair redistricting for the 1990s. With  the League of Women Voter's support, the voters may actually get the chance to  pick their politicians rather than politicians picking their voters.  </P> <P> ROY ASHBURN  </P> <P> Kern County Supervisor  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 29, BNS -- Latvian Cabinet, meeting  urgently on the eve of Moscow summit, accepted the protocol at  the initial agreement on social rights of Russian military  retirees in Latvia.    In addition, the government set up the country's delegation  for the April 30 Moscow summit and considered the amount for  rent for the radar facility at Skrunda.    The ministers decided that Russia should pay for Skrunda 130  million U.S. dollars per year but it could also remunerate the  worth of the sum in natural gas, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs  told reporters after the government session.    Latvian officials are now negotiating the proposal with  Russian counterparts in Moscow.    In another action, the Cabinet decided to announce a  competition for the dismantling of the new building of the  Skrunda radar compound. For the purpose, foreign countries have  already extended 3 million U.S. dollars.    Birkavs prognosticated the interest in the dismantling would  be large. The task, however, may pose technical problems  because the building was constructed safe against nuclear  attacks.    The government also ruled to form a working part to create a  repatriation fund for Russian war pensioners.    Birkavs said that the U.S. Government allotted for the fund  2.5 million dollars in housing vouchers. Consequently, the  officers won't be able to use the money for other purposes,  Birkavs noted.    Commenting on the agreement signature, Birkavs said Latvia  would propose that it is signed by two representatives of each  country.    Birkavs described Russia's commitment to submit Latvia a  list  of military retirees as the principal achievement of the  additional protocol.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (8): Cut-throat scraps over space - Profitability in this high-risk sector is threatened THE BLUE skies that once attracted aerospace companies to commercial space markets are clouding over. A combination of technological and political changes is saturating the markets for launchers, satellites and ground equipment and threatening profitability and confidence in this high-risk business. Most of the commercial space industry is about telecommunications, a sector being driven so quickly by technology that future growth prospects are being undermined. Each generation of satellites packs in yet more transmitting power, using the latest miniaturised electronics. At the same time, the rocket improvements have gradually pushed up the average weight of a satellite: launchers can now put satellites weighing several tonnes into space. The result is huge jumps in the numbers of telephone calls each satellite can handle, a rate of increase far larger than the growth in the number of long distance telephone calls actually made. At the same time, improvements in rocket accuracy and satellite design mean that satellites last longer in orbit. Lifespans have crept up from less than 10 years a decade ago to more than 14 years now. With satellites lasting longer, they need to be replaced less often. Add to that the power of undersea fibre optic cables, which compete with satellites to carry long distance calls, and it is clear that the number of new satellites that will be needed by the world's telephone companies is likely to be limited. That is not the end of the commercial space industry's concerns. While established companies fight each other over a shrinking market, new competitors are entering the fray. The end of the cold war has brought in Russia and China, eager to sell their launch services for hard currency. Japan, too, is nearing the end of the development of a large rocket, the H2, and its electronics companies now supply many of the essential parts of US-built satellites. The non-commercial space industry is suffering as well, as governments seek to cut spending. Nasa, the US space administration, is in the throes of a re-organisation triggered by budget cuts. And the European Space Agency has cancelled or postponed several large projects such as the Hermes manned space station. The governments of France and Japan are exceptions with their increased space budgets. These developments have affected all three parts of the space industry, rocket launchers, satellites and ground equipment. In launchers, Europe's French-led Arianespace consortium is strengthening its grip on the market. Rivals in the US have slipped further behind in the last year. Confidence in General Dynamics has suffered badly as three of the last eight Atlas launches have failed while McDonnell-Douglas' Delta rocket is smaller than launchers made by Arianespace and is being left out in the trend towards larger satellites. China, too, has been hit by question marks over who was to blame for the failure of a launch late last year. The giant Russian space industry is being constrained by tight restrictions placed on it by the US government. And despite the uncertainties facing Russia, China and General Dynamics, Japan will not try to sell its H2 rocket for commercial contracts. Executives at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, one of the contractors on the Y260bn project, say the market is simply too small for another new entrant. Even Arianespace faces an uncertain future. The next model of launcher is the Ariane 5 which was designed partly to put the European manned space station Hermes into orbit. Now it will have to rely more on the commercial sector. In satellites, Hughes Aircraft of California maintains its dominant position, largely against US rivals GE and Loral. Between them, the US companies have all but overwhelmed the European communications satellite construction industry. Some Europeans have carved niches as subcontractors supplying parts such as solar panels for US satellites. Others have not even been able to do this: British Aerospace, for example, has all but abandoned satellite construction and was unable to find a buyer for the remains of its business. Many, such as France's Aerospatiale, and Matra-Marconi, a joint venture between France's Matra Group and the UK's GEC, rely on domestic or European public sector contracts for scientific research and earth observation projects. Ground equipment markets are dominated by Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi, NEC and Toshiba. But they, too, are concerned that space markets are limited. Mr Hiroshi Kanai, general manager at Mitsubishi Electric's commercial space programs department, says there is pressure in Japan to buy US technology to help reduce the Japanese trade surplus. The increasing power of telecommunications ground equipment, in parallel with developments in satellites, means that the market will not grow quickly, says NEC, Japan's biggest supplier of antennas. Despite all these concerns, there are still opportunities for growth for the space industry. One that many have pinned their hopes on is the construction of global mobile telephone communications networks based on satellites. There are several rival proposals. Motorola, an electronics company that was at the forefront of the spread of conventional cellular telephone networks, has its Iridium scheme. The plan is to launch 66 small satellites to ring the planet and allow mobile telephone users to dial anywhere from almost anywhere. Similar schemes, using fewer satellites, have been proposed by Loral and Inmarsat, the international mobile telecommunications consortium, and others. If any took off, satellite builders and ground equipment makers should enjoy a stream of orders. Rocket builders might not fare so well. Since the satellites for the network would be small, the number of organisations able to launch them increases. Several US companies could launch small satellites, perhaps with rockets carried into the upper atmosphere on aircraft. Lockheed, for one, has plans to cut launch prices to as low as Dollars 14m for such satellites - less than a quarter of typical rates on existing launchers. Even this might not be enough to match Russia. It can launch several small satellites at a time on converted multiple warhead ballistic missiles. The threat of such competition from Russia last month led to the US to impose strict limits on the frequency of Russian launches. It also put a floor on the price that Russia could offer. Critics point out that there is no provision for retaliation against Russia should the deal between the two countries be broken. They argue that a similar agreement with China failed to prevent deep discounting by Beijing. Such scraps are likely to continue as the space business becomes more cut-throat. The combination of technological and political change has transformed the space industry from one accustomed to relative certainties, with few suppliers and few customers, to one where uncertainty rules. It is, perhaps, no longer a business that can be run by former civil servants and air force chiefs, but one that will have to live by the rough rules of international commerce.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, June 3 (AFP) -- The Croatian Government  appealed Friday to the United Nations to take "effective"  measures to end the "policy of genocide" being carried out  against civilians in Bosnia-Herzegovina by Serb authorities. In  a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Croatian  Foreign Minister Mate Granic expressed his government's "deep  anxiety and indignation" over what he called the Serbs'  "systematic policy of ethnic cleansing" against the Croats and  Moslems. Granic said the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) had  "not taken adequate measures" to stop the abuse which had led to  a "tragic exodus" of non-Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In all, Croatia is sheltering some 300,000 refugees from the  conflict, with up to 250,000 others having additionally fled  Serb-held Croatian regions.    A UN commission has concluded in an official report that the  ethnic cleansing programme against the Moslems was a  premeditated scheme. While all parties were responsible for  acts of sexual abuse, most of the victims were Moslems, and most  of the perpetrators were Bosnian Serbs, according to the report.  In Zagreb, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees had expressed  concern Thursday about the Serb pursuit of ethnic cleansing,  which meant victims had no other choice than to flee.    Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic meanwhile said in Paris he  was concerned at the continuing lack of a peace accord with the  Serbs, who, he said, would not hesitate to extend the conflict.  After meeting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Silajdzic  pointed out his government had said at talks last week in France  it was ready to compromise on territorial issues.    At the talks in Talloires, in the French Alps, an  international contact group proposed to award 51 percent of  Bosnian territory to the new Moslem-Croat federation, which is  demanding 58 percent, and 49 to the Serbs, who control 70  percent. But federation sources said the Moslems and Croats  were prepared to negotiate.    Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic meanwhile arrived in  Geneva  reiterating he would not take part in ceasefire negotiations as  long as the Serbs did not give an assurance they would evacuate  their troops from around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. Ganic  said he would attend political discussions with the  international contact group on Saturday but would only go to  military talks if UN envoy Yasushi Akashi could verify the Serbs  had left the area. But the United Nations warned in Geneva  Friday it would cancel the peace talks if Bosnian Serb forces  did not fully withdraw from around Gorazde by Saturday morning.    Talks on a truce should have begun in Geneva Thursday, but  Bosnian Moslems refused to attend so long as Bosnian Serbs  continued to occupy the UN-declared exclusion zone around  Gorazde from which they had promised to pull out.    "As of 18:00 tonight there still remained about 20 to 25  armed Serbs, mainly civilians it seems" inside the  three-kilometer (two- mile) exclusion zone," said Michael  Williams, spokesman for UN envoy Yasushi Akashi.</p>

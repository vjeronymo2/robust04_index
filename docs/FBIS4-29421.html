			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Song Mun-hong] </F>   [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue became a focus of  world attention when Pyongyang declared its withdrawal from the  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on 12 March last year, only 15  days after the start of the Kim Yong-sam government. More than a  year has passed since then, but the issue remains unresolved and  no light is seen at the end of the long, long tunnel. The  nuclear issue is proving to be an increasingly heavy burden on  the new government committed to a civilian age.    The discontent of the people is also on the rise amid the  battles procrastinating between North and South Korea and  between North Korea and the international community. There have  been frictions between hard-liners and moderates, confusion  between ministries and agencies, and conflicting remarks by the  president. Public criticisms have intensified, both in range and  tone.    In an interview with this reporter, Chong Chong-uk, the  senior presidential secretary for foreign policy and national  security, who was one of the "quartette of scholars" in the  first cabinet of the new government, first referred to the  criticisms and said that "as one of the government officials  responsible, I feel sorry for the people that the nuclear issue  is still unresolved."    The interview was held in Chong's Chongwadae office on 9  April, the very next day of the first session held by the  Security Policy Coordinating Council, a new organ for  adjustments on policies relating to the nuclear issue, which the  government created to cope with mounting criticisms by media  over controversial remarks made by officials one after another  since late March--including those by Ambassador Hwang Pyong-tae  and Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong.    [Song Mun-hong] There has been strong criticism against our  government's policy concerning the North Korean nuclear issue in  the past year. Especially, many people point to the fact that  differences between the advocates of dialogue and the  hard-liners remain unresolved.    [Chong Chong-uk] "I am hoping that our people will  understand  these points: First, the government is holding on to its  position seeking a peaceful settlement on the issue.    "Second, it is, essentially, an issue difficult to resolve  by  our independent will and capability alone. While an issue  between North and South Korea, it is also an international  issue. It is a dual issue in nature. Therefore, it requires  exploring for a settlement through two axes.    "Under the present circumstances, a North-South mutual  inspection through dialogue is a dead plan, while our  discretionary power under international cooperation system is,  inevitably, a very much limited one.    "Hence, it has been unavoidable, I think, that the  government  appeared to be shifting between a pro-dialogue course and a  tough line depending on whether the nuclear issue was in a good  or in a strained situation. In other words, I would like to  point out that it all reflects the fundamental nature of the  issue, not any deficiencies in the diplomatic ability of the  government.    "Another point is that the people have been extremely  sensitive to the nuclear issue. They were very sensitive to  developments as the issue was taken to the UN Security Council  following North Korea's rejection of the IAEA inspection.  Accordingly, the government cannot but be extremely cautious not  to cause uneasiness among them."    Chong Chong-uk disclosed that the new government had set out  with a policy concept on North Korea that was quite innovative.  It was based on that concept, he said, that President Kim  declared in his inauguration speech that "no alliance can  supersede the interests of the nation." The senior Chongwadae  secretary explained that the president's statement reflected his  ambition to free the nation from an alliance based on its Cold  War-era posture toward North Korea and the anticommunist  ideology and to establish a new relationship worthy of the  post-Cold War era. The progressive posture, however, faced a  setback when North Korea declared its withdrawal from the NPT,  he said.    [Song] With regard to its responses in the past year, there  have been widespread complaints that our government was shunned  in negotiations with the United States and that it kept making  concessions to North Korean demands. Is the government now  prepared to take a firmer position?    [Chong] "My view is that it is neither necessary nor  desirable to keep up with the so-called brinkmanship diplomacy  of North Korea. Should we respond with our version of  brinkmanship, we will have to follow carefully-thought-out  tactics to keep us from falling off the precipice together. If  North Korea had really been prepared to go to war, it would not  have even mentioned the word war, never. So, I see the recent  `Seoul in a sea of fire' remark by the North Korean delegate [at  Panmunjom] as part of a shrewd psychological tactic against our  people."    [Song] A series of comments on North Korea by President Kim  Yong-sam have caused repercussions. Some even accused Chongwadae  secretaries of failing to properly assist the president.    [Chong] "The reportedly controversial comments were quoted  out of context, I believe. For instance, a careful study of the  context about the sentence 'we cannot shake hands with those who  possess nuclear weapons indicates that the president never meant  to say that he will hold no dialogue with North Korea. He meant  to say that the North Korean nuclear issue is so important that  an era of coexistence and co-prosperity can come only when it  has been resolved. The expression he used was intended to  emphasize his position that gives top priority to national  security, not to say that North Korea has nuclear weapons or  that there will be no meetings with it until the nuclear issue  has been resolved.    "The same thing can be said about the president's 25  February  remark that `a summit is possible if it is to help achieve a  settlement on the nuclear issue.' An exchange of special envoys  was first proposed by the North Korean side. The proposal that  all North-South problems, including the nuclear issue, be  discussed and settled at a summit also came from the North  Korean side, did it not? When the president made the remark at  issue, both sides had agreed on working-level contacts for an  exchange of special envoys; under such circumstances, the  president meant to say that `there isnothing I wouldn't do if it  was for achieving settlement on the nuclear issue.'    "Media overinterpreted the president's comments, claiming  that he made contradictory remarks, thus deliberately distorting  the president's original intent."    [Song] We even hear criticism that the president has no  basic  understanding of the nuclear issue.    [Chong] "It is a grave misunderstanding about the president.  Needless to say, the nuclear issue has technically complicated  aspects. Speaking for myself, although I have been absorbed in  this issue almost daily since the start of the new government,  there still are many things I am unable to understand. The  president bears overall responsibility for state affairs, and I  don't think he needs to be familiar with specific, technical  details. And when I brief him of the nuclear issue, I do not  include such details.    "For what the nuclear issue means politically, and for  things  a supreme leader should know about the nuclear issue, the  president has perfect understanding. He usually uses the kind of  expression that does not resort to a logical way of explanation  on this or that. While thinking very deeply, he expresses the  thought in sentences short but full of implications. That is his  style.    "As a result, when such implicative thoughts are delivered  in  general terms, the public may have difficulty in correctly  grasping the meaning, I think. I am not saying this to defend  the president as a senior secretary for him. But I must say that  what I have been feeling about the president briefing him on  developments in the nuclear issue over a year is considerably  different from reports in media. The North Korean nuclear issue  is the most important of all issues. How could the president be  unconcerned about it?"    [Song] A look at developments in our nuclear policy  indicates  that there often were differences and confrontations between  ministries and agencies concerned. Also, we hear criticisms that  in the system of cooperation with the United States, the roles  of the two sides are not properly defined. It is also said that  U.S. officials have a complaint that they cannot make out what  the Korean government's nuclear policy is all about.    [Chong] "With respect to responses to the nuclear issue,  there are differences among U.S. authorities, too. It is a fact,  of course, that within our government, there are some  differences in views between ministries and agencies. It would  be rather unrealistic and unnatural, I think, if all the  ministries and agencies concerned should come up with an  identical view about the nuclear issue. The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs takes the position seeking a diplomatic settlement while  the National Unification Board gives priority to North-South  relations. At the same time, the Ministry of National Defense  and the Agency for National Security Planning have their  respective views.    "Eventually, under the presidential system, the president  decides the direction of national policy based on his  comprehensive judgment. Inter-ministry differences are put  through this inner coordinating process, which, when viewed from  outside, might appear to be a wavering between hard-line and  moderate approaches. This has something to do with what I  mentioned earlier--our limitations within the international  community and the fundamental nature of the nuclear issue. Let  me emphasize that there is absolutely no such thing as the  inter-ministry differences which directly lead to policy  confusion.    "One more thing. I know the fact that a small number of  Americans are saying that they `cannot make out what the Korean  policy is all about.' As for us, we must, in dealing with the  nuclear issue, display tactical flexibility while holding on to  our principles firmly. This process inevitably involves  dilemmas. When efforts for a through-dialogue settlement fail to  produce results, causing tension and a sense of crisis in the  Korean Peninsula, we are forced to take the position of putting  the brake on the international community, the United States in  particular. From the U.S. point of view, it could appear that  Korea often takes a hard-line approach but--when the United  States actually tries to take a tough stand -- puts a curb on  it."    [Song] The North Korean nuclear issue can be viewed from two  separate angles: the special inspection to ascertain the lack  of transparency of North Korean nuclear activities prior to the  IAEA inspection of May 1992, and the temporary, general  inspection for the continuity of nuclear safeguards thereafter.  Also, when the North Korean nuclear issue is viewed from another  two points of view--namely, the issue being used by North Korea  as a trump card and as a tactic to gain time for actual  development of nuclear weapons--we can assume that the situation  becomes more unfavorable for us as time passes by.    Also, the atmosphere in the United States is showing a  subtle  change, according to many scholars. From the U.S. point of view,  the issue is critical more for the importance it attaches to the  preservation of a global NPT system than for the stability on  the Korean Peninsula.    Meanwhile, arguments that the United States will be  compelled  to tolerate one to three nuclear bombs which North Korea may  already have are gaining ground both in and out of the U.S.  government. The quarterly journal FOREIGN AFFAIRS carried an  article even calling for U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea. The  point is that U.S. troops should not be left on the Korean  Peninsula, a danger zone, at a time when North Korea apparently  has nuclear weapons. Is our government prepared to deal with  these problems?    [Chong] "You are saying that the present situation remains  unchanged from a year ago or even shows deteriorations. As I  said earlier, our influence in the international community is a  limited one; nevertheless, we achieved IAEA inspections,  intermittent though, in the past year, paving the way for an  assessment of North Korea's nuclear development to some degrees.  I would like to count it as an achievement if it can be called  that.    "Second, regarding the question of whether North Korea now  has nuclear weapons, and whether the possibility of North Korea  having developed nuclear weapons has increased now that a long  time has passed since its withdrawal from the NPT in March 1993  or since May 1992...so far, no one in any country in the world  has produced firm evidence of North Korea's possession of  nuclear weapons. While media have carried a wide range of  conflicting speculations, the government has confirmed that at  present there is no specific, irrefutable evidence that North  Korea has nuclear weapons.    "Third, with respect to your question if the U.S. policy is  shifting from halting North Korea's nuclear program to imposing  a freeze on it at the present level, my answer is that it is  not. A careful study of opinions recently voiced in the United  States indicates that no one has ever said that the United  States would tolerate North Korea's possession of nuclear  weapons.    "In its current position, the United States divides its  policy goal into two phases, striving for a settlement by stage.  Efforts for accurate information on North Korean nuclear  activities through temporary inspections and for a freeze on  them represent the first phase, while realization of special  inspections to secure the transparency of North Korean nuclear  activities prior to May 1992 constitute its second phase. These  are the goals of the two nations, Korea and the United States.  It is not intended to abandon special inspections after all."    [Song] Some specialists say that if North Korea conceals its  nuclear weapons, it is impossible to uncover them even through  special inspections and North-South mutual inspections, and that  therefore, it is a matter of political judgement on the part of  the president to secure complete transparency on North Korean  nuclear weapons.    "It is not so. If special inspections and North-South mutual  inspections are carried out, accurate data can be obtained on  North Korean nuclear activities in the past. Special inspections  will produce accurate figures on the quantities of nuclear  material which North Korea extracted in the past by operating  its reprocessing facilities. The mission of the IAEA is to  ensure that nuclear activities are not diverted for military  purposes; therefore, if inspections produce evidence of such  diversion, it is to lead to another round of discussion.    "Furthermore, there is the Joint Statement of  Denuclearization in effect between North and South Korea, which  precludes not only the possession of reprocessing facilities and  enriched uranium but also the deployment, manufacturing and  possession of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula. If North  Korea has nuclear weapons, we can demand their dismantling under  this joint statement."    [Song] But it is still possible that Pyongyang conceals its  nuclear weapons somewhere in North Korea, is it not?    [Chong] "In that case, there is legal basis for the IAEA and  our government to make an effort to find them. If another  problem arises after the transparency has been secured on North  Korean nuclear weapons, it shall be discussed then. In the  present stage, I do not think it is a right approach to the  issue to abandon our current efforts by saying that `North Korea  may already have nuclear weapons.'    "What we need now is to find out how much weapon-worth  material North Korea has secured through its nuclear activities  in the past. At present, our problem is that we are not only  unaware of all the facts about North Korea's past activities but  also unable to shut off its possibility of continuing nuclear  activities in the future."    [Song] The Security Policy Coordinating Council held its  first meeting yesterday. The creation of the new council, on one  hand, appears to be a show of the president's will to control  discords among ministries and agencies as reported; on the  other, however, it overlaps the existing councils that make  decisions concerning the nuclear issue. Some say that it is like  adding a fifth wheel to a coach.    [Chong] "There were four similar councils established  earlier--the National Security Council, the Council of  Unification-Related Ministers, the High-Level Strategy Council,  and the Council of Security-Related Ministers. The National  Security Council is a constitutional organ, which seldom met in  the past. The Council of Unification-Related Ministers meets  about once a month on nuclear- and unification-related issues,  presided over by the deputy prime minister for unification  affairs. It is deficient in promptness and effectiveness. The  High-Level Strategy Council was originally created to prepare  strategy for the North-South High-Level Talks, which are prime  minister-level contacts. Although media reported that this  council met frequently in the past, the sessions were quite  irregular.    "Finally, the Council of Security-Related Ministers, chaired  by the president, has its problems because it is realistically  difficult for the president to have a hand in working-level  business. Thus, it is not very effective in dealing with issues  requiring quick responses.    "I understand that those were the reasons why the Security  Policy Coordinating Council was created recently by a  presidential directive. The new council meets every week. It is  for the heads of offices concerned with the nuclear issue--the  deputy prime minister for unification affairs, the minister of  foreign affairs, the minister of national defense, the director  of the Agency for National Security Planning, the Chongwadae  secretary general, and the senior presidential secretary for  foreign policy and national security--to meet regularly for more  prompt responses."    Since its inauguration, the Kim Yong-sam government has  apologized to the people five times altogether, including three  times in connection with the opening of the nation's rice  market. Should it fail to resolve the nuclear issue  satisfactorily, however, no amount of apology would suffice. It  is because the nuclear issue is directly linked to the destiny  of our 40 million people and, further, that of the entire Korean  nation.    Senior Presidential Secretary Chong Chong-uk said that the  government is "doing everything in its power" to get the nuclear  issue resolved. In fact, however, the government has so far been  merely absorbed in confrontations and frictions, giving no such  impression as that it is "doing everything in its power." Only  when it proves to the people that it is "doing everything in its  power" will the Kim Yong-sam government perhaps be able to come  out of the prolonged "North Korean nuclear issue" tunnel.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Aleman Aleman and Oscar Camacho Guzman] </F>   [Text] The PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] should  choose its new presidential candidate by Sunday at the latest,  according to sources of the PRI National Executive Committee.  Inside the party the names mentioned as possible successors for  Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta are Fernando Ortiz Arana, Ernesto  Zedillo Ponce de Leon, Fernando Gutierrez Barrios or  "possibility another former governor."    The same sources recognized that the two days of national  mourning -- Thursday and Friday -- in memory of the former PRI  presidential candidate "in addition to being justified, served  the federal government by giving it time to maneuver in the face  of a possible destabilization of the financial markets."    The PRI has not decided yet how the new presidential  candidate will be chosen, but "it is clear" that the decision  will not be prolonged past this coming Sunday. The reason for  this is that both the PRI and the government would be running a  big risk if they do not contain as soon as possible the emotions  unleashed by the assassination of Colosio Murrieta. The  credibility of the PRI ranking leadership could be undermined,  and there should be security in the economic sphere to avert a  financial disaster.    In the meantime, in the Chamber of Deputies a general  comment  heard among legislators and leaders was that following the  assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio serious tensions have  arisen between the federal government and old PRI members, some  of whom belong to the National Political Council. Several  leaders said the reason is because in the PRI political ranks  they are demanding that it not be the president, as the foremost  PRI leader, who chooses the new candidate. They are demanding  this to avoid "an erroneous decision," which might cause more  friction and internal breaks. The stalwart PRI political class  demands a part in the designation of the new candidate.    Senator Humberto Lugo Gil spoke yesterday about the  mechanisms that would have to be followed. He contends that the  new election should be carried out in keeping with the statutes.  It would require that the National Executive Committee convoke  the Political Council in order to issue a call for the  registration of candidates. The senator for Hidalgo denied that  the announcement would be made in a surprise manner between  Thursday and Friday night. He said that the period of national  mourning should be observed first out of respect for the memory  of Colosio.    According to the sources of the Executive Committee, the PRI  machinery will be in motion again tonight, once the leadership  sectors have attended the funeral for Luis Donaldo Colosio  Murrieta in his native hometown of Magdalena de Kino, Sonora. In  other words, they will conduct a meeting of the Political  Council, which would have to meet on Saturday to announce a call  for the registration of presidential hopefuls, if the tradition  is to be followed. Otherwise, according to its statutes, the  council is empowered to designate a presidential candidate,    At the same time, results were obtained of an assessment  made  among PRI deputies regarding the possibility of resorting to  constitutional reforms to give the PRI a broader margin of  maneuver in view of the situation surrounding the wake for Luis  Donaldo Colosio Murrieta.    For the time being, the PRI has ruled out "forcing the  Constitution" and promoting amendments to eliminate the  requisite established in Article 82 of the Constitution that  persons who aspire to being presidential candidates must resign  six months before the elections.    It was also considered unadvisable to change the date of  the scheduled 21 August elections. In this respect, Maria de  los Angeles Moreno, president of the Grand Commission of the  Chamber of Deputies, said in an interview that the elections  "should be held on the date established by law."    The PRI legislator appealed "for calm, peace, prudence, and  unity, because times of crisis and confusion are when we most  need prudence and when we must rally around the president of the  republic."    Regarding the presidential hopefuls within the PRI, Fernando  Ortiz Arana has a good chance, because he would represent a  unifying force among those groups that voiced opposition to the  presidential candidacy. He is considered to be one of the most  politically experienced politicians, but he is also criticized  for lacking experience as a businessman and because he has no  connections to the financial and economic communities.    Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon is said to be the "natural  replacement" for Colosio. In fact, as a coordinator of past PRI  political campaigns, the party's unwritten rules would naturally  tend to select him to replace Colosio. Important factions  within the PRI, however, believe "he has not matured" and that  his nomination "might signify maintaining the status quo of the  political system."    Regarding Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, former Veracruz  governor and former government secretary, there are those who  believe he could play a decisive role in enforcing internal  party discipline and, above all else, in overcoming the  nationwide unrest that is following in the wake the Indian armed  uprising, the kidnapping of Alfredo Harp Helu, and the  assassination of Colosio Murrieta.</p>

These hearings will provide an opportunity for interested persons to present their views on the term ``fresh'' as used on the labeling of raw poultry products, and will assist FSIS in developing policy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The public hearings will be held on September 12, 16, and 20, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Written notices of participation in the hearings should be filed by September 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The public hearings will be held at the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> September 12: Holiday Inn Hollidome, 1612 Sisk Road, Modesto, CA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 16: Radisson Hotel, 165 Courtland Street, Atlanta, GA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 20: Loews L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, 480 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Transcripts of the public hearings and copies of data and information submitted during the hearings will be available for review at the office of the FSIS Docket Clerk, Room 3171, South Building, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC., under Docket Number 94&hyph;022N. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Charles R. Edwards, Director, Product Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, (202) 254&hyph;2565. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and maintain an inspection program designed to assure consumers that poultry and poultry products distributed in commerce or within designated States are wholesome, not adulterated, and are properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Under this authority, FSIS regulates the labeling of poultry and poultry products and has established a policy on the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of poultry products. The current U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) policy permits poultry kept at or below 40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F and above 0 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F to be labeled as ``fresh.'' This policy is based on Federal regulations that set temperatures, and chilling and freezing procedures for poultry products, and the labeling of such products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of California enacted a State law (Section 26661 of the California Food and Agriculture Code) restricting the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labels of poultry that has ever been kept at or below 25 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. Three trade organizations filed suit to prevent enforcement of the California law, claiming, among other things, that it was preempted by the PPIA. Federal preemption authority granted in the PPIA prohibits States from imposing requirements on the labeling of poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, Federal labeling requirements. On April 8, 1994, a United States District Judge ruled that the labeling provision in the California law was preempted by Federal law and permanently enjoined the State from enforcing its law. The USDA, at the judge's request, filed an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> amicus curiae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  brief on the Federal preemption issue. A Federal appellate court, which heard argument on the appeal, has not yet ruled. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of issues raised by the California law and the litigation, the Secretary of Agriculture directed FSIS to reexamine its policy for the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry products. The Secretary stated that the current labeling policy in this area should be reexamined to ensure that it ``is reasonable and meets today's consumer expectations.'' The Secretary also directed FSIS to ``make sure that any policy change does not open the door to problems like the growth of bacteria that could cause foodborne illness.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS is actively pursuing the Secretary's objective to consider both the scientific bases for the policy and the consumer's expectations and perceptions of the term ``fresh'' as applied to raw poultry. To ensure that consumers, as well as all other interested parties, have a voice in establishing the Department's ``fresh'' policy, FSIS is holding three public hearings. These hearings will provide consumers, processors, producers, industry, State and local government officials, health officials, and all other interested parties the opportunity to present oral and written views on this issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS has scheduled 1-day public hearings at Modesto, CA; Atlanta, GA; and Washington, DC (see locations and schedules under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ``dates'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ``addresses'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  above). These public hearings will focus on specific issues regarding the industry's practices and controls, and consumer expectations and perceptions of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry. Participants should be prepared to respond to those issues which are identified below. Participants may comment on other issues relating to the labeling of poultry as ``fresh'' that have not been identified by FSIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Industry's Practices and Controls <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELPS CONTROL DISEASES;  </P> <P> MOSQUITO 'SWAT' TEAM LESSENS SUMMER'S STING  </P> <P> They thrive beneath dead bouquets in cemetery flower vases. They lurk in  discarded tin cans and abandoned tires.  </P> <P> Summer is their season and, left to their own small devices, they multiply in  staggering numbers. A single unkempt swimming pool can become an Olympic-sized  nursery for a million or more.  </P> <P> The creatures are mosquitoes, unlovable little insects that can make summer a  misery with their bites and can transmit such genuinely dreadful diseases as  encephalitis and malaria.  </P> <P> There are remarkably few mosquitoes in much of Los Angeles because of men like  Mark Brooks, one of the exterminating angels of the Los Angeles County West  Mosquito Abatement District, headquartered in Culver City.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mosquito Zappers  </P> <P> Brooks, 33, who lives in Mar Vista, is one of the district's dozen full-time  employees, a deadly cadre of mosquito zappers who seek and destroy the insects  from the gurgling creeks of Malibu to the horse troughs of Rolling Hills  Estates, from the sumptuous back yards of Beverly Hills to the littered  concrete floor of Ballona Creek.  </P> <P> In summer, the full timers are joined by nine seasonal employees. They chase  their prey with specialized equipment that includes trucks with the steering  wheel and a door-mounted tank of pesticide on the right, so the driver can  spray a curb-side infestation and drive at the same time.  </P> <P> Like his counterparts in the three other mosquito abatement districts in Los  Angeles County, Brooks is used to people laughing when they hear what he does.  But Brooks knows his job is important. "Without the mosquito abatement  district, there would be encephalitis, there would be malaria, and it would be  no joke."  </P> <P> Indeed. Worldwide, mosquitoes are the insects most dangerous to human health.  They are carriers -- or vectors, as public health officials call them -- of a  host of diseases, including yellow fever and dengue fever.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tar Pits Still Tricky  </P> <P> Of the 600 square miles that Brooks and his colleagues patrol, perhaps the  hottest single spot is the La Brea tar pits in Hancock Park. The tar pits,  which once doomed mastodons and saber-toothed cats, are now odoriferous pools  of asphalt and water that attract Culex tarsalis, a mosquito that can transmit  encephalitis, a sometimes deadly inflammation of the brain.  </P> <P> "Millions would hatch out every night if we didn't spray," Brooks said. Every  Monday, when the museums are closed and few visitors are in the park, a  mosquito abatement crew blankets the tar pits with a petroleum product called  Golden Bear that floats on the surface of the water and suffocates any mosquito  larvae present.  </P> <P> "It's a guaranteed kill," Brooks said.  </P> <P> Hancock Park is also the home of the district's flock of "sentinel" chickens.  As Brooks explained, the district keeps two dozen laying hens in a coop in the  park to serve as an early warning system for encephalitis.  </P> <P> Blood is drawn from the chickens each month and sent to a laboratory at UC  Berkeley, where it is examined for evidence of the virus that causes  encephalitis. Although an occasional chicken tests positive, there have been no  reported cases of human mosquito-borne encephalitis locally since 1984.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diversified Methods  </P> <P> In the old days, DDT and other dangerous chemicals were used to kill adult  mosquitoes. Today the abatement crews work at destroying the larvae with  relatively benign agents, including mosquito fish. Brooks said the Westside  district distributes about 25,000 of the gray, guppy-like fish each year. Many  are given free to homeowners to put in their fishponds. The fish also work in  horse troughs, Brooks noted. "When the horse goes to drink, the fish will just  dive."  </P> <P> The computers that are now a feature of mosquito abatement in Los Angeles keep  track of thousands of spots where mosquitoes are known to multiply, including  the holes left in the ground when oil derricks are dismantled. New construction  often creates breeding grounds, and a major fire can turn a neighborhood's  swimming pools into entomological time bombs. After the Baldwin Hills fire,  dozens of back-yard pools were added to the district's route books for regular  inspection and treatment.  </P> <P> To help pinpoint problematic pools, a mosquito-abatement technician often flies  along when County Sheriff's Department helicopters are out on surveillance or  pursuing suspects. The film is turned over to the county Health Department,  which scrutinizes it for murky pools and alerts the relevant abatement  districts.  </P></p>

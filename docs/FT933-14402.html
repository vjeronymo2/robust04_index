			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts shrug off 1.8% rise in manufacturing output THE LATEST batch of UK economic data may have suggested that a recovery was in full swing but the gilt market failed to react accordingly, and was only slightly lower on the day. Ultra long-dated gilt yields were at their lowest for more than 20 years when trading began yesterday morning. News that manufacturing output had risen by 1.8 per cent in May against market expectations of only 0.3 per cent should have provided a perfect opportunity to take profits. That argument could have been strengthened by the weakness of government bond markets in mainland Europe. There was a knee-jerk reaction and September gilt futures tumbled  5/8 to 108 after the data was released. However, the Central Statistics Office said the data had been distorted by the late May bank holiday. This dampened the enthusiasm and gilt prices rose again. Although the futures contract closed at 107 29/32 , most dealers said the slide was testing buying interest and reflecting the weakness in Europe rather than a fundamental shift in economic opinion. Gilts has been rising steadily since May and the lack of volatility has meant buyers have found few opportunities to get into the market. Therefore, there was still strong demand. Mr Andy Tweed, gilts specialist with BZW, said: 'Each time the market came back we saw buyers.' Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist with Midland Global Markets, said: 'The market had been expecting a moderate increase in output and it got a staggering increase. The trend is undeniably upwards but the market does not believe the underlying trend to be as strong as these figures suggest.' The price of 15-year gilts eased only  1/32 to 109 3/8 and dealers said there was switching into index-linked gilts, which have been left behind. GERMAN government bonds slipped, although the markets were looking for a cut of around 5 basis points in the repo today Bund futures for September fell 0.22 to 96.08 on low volume as recent heavy foreign buying faded away. Economists are hanging fire over a reduction in the key floor rates at the Bundesbank council meeting tomorrow until they see what happens at the repo. Some argue that if the funds injected at the repo top DM72bn and the cut is more than five basis points that would be a clear signal for a cut in lending rates on July 29 and possibly as soon as tomorrow CONTINUING pressure on the French franc failed to check the French bond market which tested a new high before ending the day around 0.20 up on the previous close at 119.92. Mr Kit Juckes, economist with SG Warburg Securities, said: 'If there is a problem in France it's a currency problem and not a bond problem. Real yields are very high, a protracted rise in interest rates is not on the cards and the Balladur auction has shown that there is an excess of spare savings.' JAPANESE government bonds held on to their gains in London as investors bought on renewed hopes of a rate cut. Dealers said that there had been investment buying during Tokyo trading by domestic life insurance firms and pension funds, taking the yield on the JGB No 145 from 4.28 per cent to 4.26 per cent. AMONG the high yielders, Spanish bonds were barely moved after the Bank of Spain left key money rates unchanged and June CPI figures came in as expected. Italian government bonds were firmer ahead of the Bundesbank repo today with BTP September futures rising by 27 basis points to 104.41. US TREASURY prices were mixed across the board in the wake of June inflation numbers that were in line with, but no better than, expectations. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 106 19/32 , yielding 6.611 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was slightly weaker, down  3/32 at 100 3/16 , to yield 4.007 per cent. The keenly-awaited June producer prices report confirmed that inflation does not pose a threat to fixed-income markets. The Labor Department announced that its producer prices index fell 0.3 per cent in June, and its core measure of prices - excluding the volatile food and energy components - declined 0.1 per cent. The data were consistent with Wall Street forecasts, although some analysts had hoped for a bigger decline in core producer prices. This accounted for the early selling, said dealers. While prices at the short end remained lower, the long end staged a modest rally in the wake of declining commodities and gold prices. Ultimately, however, the good inflation news was already priced into bonds, so there was no need for investors to rush into Treasuries. It was not long before attention turned to the next set of data, today's release of the June consumer prices index, which analysts expect to mimic the performance of the PPI. Technical problems with the information service meant that closing benchmark government bond prices were unreliable yesterday. Consequently the table has not been published</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Economists in City 'head pay league' BIG PAY rises for City economists in the past two years have pushed their salaries well above those of economists in other sectors, a survey by the Society of Business Economists says, Peter Marsh writes. The average salary of an economist in financial services, mainly in the City, was Pounds 52,800 at the start of this year, up 38.9 per cent on the Pounds 38,000 paid in 1991. Economists in banking and production industries were paid an average of Pounds 38,200 and Pounds 38,000, 7 per cent and 11.7 per cent up respectively on two years previously. In the consultancy field economists suffered a 3.8 per cent fall in their average salaries, to Pounds 39,000 from Pounds 40,500 in 1991. The figures do not include bonuses and other fringe benefits. Since 1988 the pay of financial-services economists has risen by 71.4 per cent while the comparable figures for economists in banking, consultancy and production industries are 29 per cent, 14.3 per cent and 35.7 per cent respectively.

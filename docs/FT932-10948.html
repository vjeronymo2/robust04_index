			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: ERF launches vehicle for recovery ERF, the last independent publicly-quoted UK heavy truck maker, launches today its new EC range of heavy trucks following a four-year, Pounds 14m investment programme. The EC truck range will play a crucial role in the company's effort to recover from recession and end three successive years of losses. In parallel with the new product development programme ERF has: carried out a reorganisation of its assembly operations in Sandbach and Middlewich, Cheshire; reached agreement with its hourly-paid employees to allow team-working and flexibility in working practices with the removal of demarcation lines; entered the continental European market with the establishment of 13 distributors in France and five in Spain. The EC range, which will replace ERF's existing E-series heavy-duty trucks, has been developed during the harshest recession endured by the UK truck industry in the post-war period. ERF has suffered losses for the last three years, as the UK heavy truck market (above 16 tonnes gross vehicle weight) has more than halved with overall UK heavy truck registrations plunging to only 16,427 last year from 38,935 in 1989. ERF's production in 1992 fell to 1,904 from 2,102 in 1991 and 4,319 in 1989. Its UK registrations improved modestly by 2.6 per cent last year to 1,636 giving it an unchanged 10 per cent share of the UK heavy truck market. Mr Peter Foden, chairman, said yesterday that new orders had started to recover during the early months of 1993, and the company had returned to full time working. Output had been raised to 10 trucks a day, five days a week. During the depth of the recession output fell as low as six trucks a day with only a three-day week compared with a peak output of 21 a day in the first half of 1989 before the onset of recession. Mr Foden said that capacity at the Sandbach assembly plant had been increased from 21 a day to 30 a day on a single shift as part of the preparation for the launch of the EC truck range. Cab assembly and painting has been transferred to the nearby Middlewich plant. ERF is aiming to increase productivity by about 20 per cent as a result of its new labour agreement, which has: replaced the separate trades of body-builder, fitter, electrician, welder and sprayer with a single category of 'assembler'; established team working with each member in the 12-15 strong teams trained to carry out all of the jobs covered by the team; abolished clocking in for a six-month trial period. ERF has agreed a 4 per cent increase in basic pay rates from July 1 (or the rate of inflation if higher) following a pay freeze since July 1992. The company suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.7m, including exceptional costs of Pounds 945,000, in the six months to the end of September 1992. The second half results have been burdened by similar exceptional charges of some Pounds 1m arising from the new EC truck range launch costs and the costs of setting up the distributor networks in France and Spain.</p>

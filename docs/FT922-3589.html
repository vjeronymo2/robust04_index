			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Labour exploits Tory split by changing Maastricht tactics THE Conservative party was in disarray last night over the Maastricht treaty as Labour maximised its discomfiture by warning it may vote against ratification. Amid reports of wide-ranging Tory divisions reaching as far as the cabinet, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, said his party would back ratification only if Britain accepted a new social chapter of workplace rights. The move came as Tory backbenchers, reportedly with the tacit backing of some cabinet ministers, met to plan a broadly-based group to oppose further progress on the Maastricht bill, shelved until the autumn. Speaking at Commons' question time, Mr Hattersley said Labour would only support a bill which included those parts of the treaty most of benefit to the British people 'and that specifically includes the social chapter'. His words were taken as giving notice that Labour would no longer abstain from voting but would instead side with Tory opponents of the Maastricht agreement by voting against it. The tactic adds to pressure on the government from by its own backbenches to abandon the agreement. Several rightwing members of the cabinet have also emerged as doggedly opposed to ratification of the treaty as it stands. While some may favour a dilution of the existing terms, there is no prospect of the government dropping its opt-out from the treaty's social provisions. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said it was now up to all 12 member states to find ways forward following the Danish decision to oppose ratification. In Strasbourg, Mr John Smith, favourite for the Labour leadership, put the case for a realignment of currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism. In a significant policy development for Labour, he said an upward alignment of the D-Mark against other currencies would trigger reductions in interest rates across the Community.</p>

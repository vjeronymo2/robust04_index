			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Martina Fietz report: "FDP Quarrels About Coalition"] </F>   [Excerpt] Bonn -- Helmut Kohl, chairman of the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] and the German chancellor, yesterday  expressly thanked the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] for  its intention, expressed the day before, to continue the  coalition with the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] after the  Bundestag elections in October.    During the first coalition meeting after the Easter break,  Kohl assessed the decision by the FDP Presidium as a signal that  there is the determination to achieve goals together. The  "spirit of comradely togetherness" will lead to success at the  elections.    At the same time, a quarrel broke out in the FDP about the  coalition statement in favor of the CDU/CSU. Juergen  Moellemann, chairman of the largest FDP land association, that  of North Rhine-Westphalia, demanded that the statement in favor  of the CDU and the CSU be linked with conditions. There must  not be a "blank check for the CDU/CSU." Moellemann suggested  that at the party congress in Rostock at the beginning of July a  "statement of preference" should be made, which must be linked  to "specific basic topics." FDP Bundestag Deputy Gerhart Baum  said that the coalition statement was made too early.    Yesterday FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel refused to comment on  Moellemann's demands. According to the decision of the FDP  Presidium, now there has to be a wait until the meeting of the  Federal Executive Committee on 2 May and the party congress.  Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of the FDP Bundestag group, stated  that the formulation of the election statement must "in no case"  contain options for other government alliances. His deputy,  Wolfgang Weng, called on the party to refrain from any  speculations about other constellations for a potential  government. [passage omitted]</p>

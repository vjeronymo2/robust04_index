			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] The relationship between the government and the  president has a multifaceted character, Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak told the "Panorama" program, adding that the coalition  maintains the proposed candidacy of Dariusz Rosati. Until such  time as the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or the candidate  himself makes a decision on this matter, the candidacy remains  in force.    [Begin recording] [Pawlak] Apart from this matter, there is  an entire series of other problems that must be taken into  account. A decision was made by the Council of Ministers  yesterday, in the presence of the president, on the presentation  of an application for membership in the EU. The decisions of  the president on the matter of the budget law await us, and this  decision has a very significant and important meaning from both  an internal and an external point of view. Even if this budget  does not fully fulfill all expectations, it is still an  exceptionally important matter--that the decision on this matter  be a very serious one, taking into account the needs of the  economy and of society because, after all, this budget also  contains amendments and modifications decided in parliament.    An important matter is the decision on the electoral law to  parish councils. Here, we will shortly have elections to parish  self-governments and the Senate by-elections. This shows that  the relationship between the government and the president ought  to have a substantive and concrete character. That is how it  ought to be seen.    [Unidentified correspondent] Discussions are in progress  among politicians on the subject of a possible coming together,  as between the Polish Peasant Party and the Belweder camp, at  the cost of the SLD. How do you judge the permanency of the  current coalition?    [Pawlak] I think that the facts show the reality at the  moment. The coalition is behaving in a manner that is in accord,  and these relationships of which I spoke earlier ought to be  seen in their entirety. Then they take into account all the  circumstances, both those associated with the functioning of the  coalition, with the functioning of the government, and those of  the office of the president. All of these activities ought to  take into account the expectations and needs of society and the  interests of the state, the interests of Poland. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Rethinking City regulation A NEW consensus is emerging in the City: that the current system of UK financial services regulation is so deeply flawed that sweeping changes are needed. The latest advocate of this view is Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential. 'The Financial Services Act is an unsatisfactory basis for the protection of savers,' he said yesterday, calling for 'investor protection on a fully statutory basis under direct government control'. He is not alone in urging the abandonment of the system of 'practitioner based' regulation introduced by the act. In private, other City grandees join the chorus. And even Mr Andrew Large, charged with operating the system as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), clearly has his doubts. He envisages 'a clear shift to a less self-regulatory basis' as a result of his current review of the way SIB works. The current system, say its critics, doesn't catch crooks; it allowed the Maxwell pensioners to be defrauded; it imposes an irritating and costly burden on inter-professional business; it consists of too many second-rate regulators, imposing too many rules; it has failed to resolve some very difficult problems of consumer protection; and - says Mr Newmarch - it has become too prescriptive, imposing the regulators' view of best practice rather than the legally enshrined criterion of adequacy. Clumsily divided Most of these statements command general assent. The enforcement of the present system - clumsily divided between too many regulators and criminal prosecutors - is clearly unsatisfactory. The Maxwell affair scarcely came within the regulatory structure - in itself a criticism of the law - but where it did, the safeguards failed to work. There is too weak a distinction between the regulation appropriate to inter-professional business and that necessary for the protection of savers. There are too many regulators, with overlapping jurisdictions and conflicting styles - and, probably, too few really first-rate people. These issues are largely resolvable within the current legal framework, though additional legislation would be necessary to protect pensions and to give SIB the power to exact civil penalties as an alternative to unwieldy criminal prosecutions. The remaining criticisms are more intractable. Consumer protection of individual savers is the most difficult issue tackled by the Financial Services Act. The imbalance of knowledge between salesman and client - and, arguably, between industry and regulator - creates very difficult problems of investor protection. In other countries, this has been resolved by tight control of the products that can be offered, at the price of stultifying innovation and entrenching market share. Free hand The UK, by contrast, has traditionally allowed insurance companies and other financial institutions a free hand in product innovation. Since what is sold is uncontrolled, the debate has shifted to how it is sold. Here, the regulators have arguably failed most dismally: an industry increasingly desperate to find outlets for its products is permitted to feed customers inadequate information and competes through higher commissions for intermediaries rather than better value for investors. This is rather different from the problem identified by Mr Newmarch: that regulators are 'predisposed to believe that the answer to every problem lies in the extension of their own powers'. Rather, the flaw lies in the unwillingness of the regulators and - as Mr Newmarch acknowledges - the industry seriously to address the complaints of consumers. By urging the industry to face up to these complaints, Mr Newmarch has done it a service. He deserves credit, also, for saying in public what others have only been willing to murmur in private. The way that financial services regulation is conducted does require scrutiny and debate - and preferably the independent inquiry which Mr Newmarch recommends. It is too soon to judge whether that debate should lead to a change in the legal framework that surrounds financial services. What is certainly needed, though, is a change in the attitude of the retail financial services industry and those who supervise it.</p>

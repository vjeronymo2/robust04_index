			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: Hot clothes for men In the hottest week London has seen for many a year, British men are still going about their business the way they have since time immemorial - swathed in dark woollen suits. As the hot weather goes on it is worth knowing that there are some splendid bargains to be found in the sales. For instance, a few pieces from Marks and Spencer's splendid pale beige and stone summer collection will be on sale in some of the larger stores. Look for the fashionable ingredients of the male wardrobe - the collarless baggy linen shirts (Pounds 25 upwards), the loose waistcoat (Pounds 30), the unstructured casual jacket (Pounds 75), the light linen/wool suits (Pounds 160) and the linen/cotton beige jeans (Pounds 25). Christopher Brown's drawings show how the basic elements can be combined to produce a summer wardrobe that can go from the boardroom (far left and right) to the most casual weekend picnics.</p>

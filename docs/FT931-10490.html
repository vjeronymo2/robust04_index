			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Reward for Enterprise Enterprise Oil's disposal of assets yesterday - like Lasmo's last week  - suggests rumours of the North Sea's decline have been exaggerated. Both companies realised a fair price from buyers anxious to gain a toe-hold in the region. Yet a broader recovery in asset prices looks too much to hope for. Established operators are already sinking cash into existing North Sea projects and more inclined to buy elsewhere. Low dollar borrowing costs must be tempting for opportunistic buyers, but without a revival in the oil price serious buyers will remain few and far between. Enterprise was right to take what was on offer. The Scott and Nelson fields should secure growth up to 1996, but Enterprise needs oil reserves for the second half of the decade. The cash raised yesterday - and the proceeds of last year's preference share issues - should allow it to acquire them. Unlike Lasmo, the balance sheet is hardly stretched. With Scott and Nelson starting to generate cash later this year, gearing of 45 per cent could quickly be reduced. It remains to be seen, though, whether Enterprise can pick the right move. With the shares trading at a healthy premium to net assets - in contrast with the majority of its peers - the market is demanding nothing less. By buying outside the North Sea, Enterprise could also diversify its development portfolio. But any acquisition will be based on an assumption about future oil prices and, therefore, carry a commodity risk. There is a rare consensus in the industry about the prospects for the oil price, namely that it will remain depressed. That should make it easier to strike a deal. But it by no means removes the risk of over-paying.</p>

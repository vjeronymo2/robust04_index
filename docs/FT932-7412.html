			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television What would we do without BBC2? It is beginning to look like the last bastion of intelligent programming. Tonight it continues the Crime and Punishment short season with two likely-looking offerings. Horizon (BBC2, 8pm) is subtitled 'Wot U Looking At?', that popular greeting familiar from almost all venues featuring contact sports, pop music and Oxbridge May balls. It's a stitch-up (BBC2, 9pm) is an inventive attempt to bring the arcane obscurities of the judicial system into closer focus, by turning it into a game show. But everything that happens to the hapless defendant is quite accurate and rather unfunny. But for bad taste, tonight's Singles (ITV, 10.40pm) is unbeatable. The unwitting buffoon of this edition is Nick, who believes that dressing up as a bear will help him find true love - or at least quick sex. Compellingly awful and genuinely more damaging than Arnold Schwarzenegger's biceps. To end the evening, Channels of resistance (C4, 10.55pm) is the final programme in a splendid documentary series examining the workings of television.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Fashion: Just never mind the quality. . . - . . . feel the designer label. Colin McDowell calls for a return to value-for-money clothing It is fun - and VAT free - to laugh at the fashion victim, dressed to the nines in a hideously unselective mixture of the most extreme of the latest looks. But no matter how far we consider our own mode of dress to be from the wilder shores of such lunacy, few of us are left unaffected by label fever. Label chic in the modern, fashion sense started in the 1970s. Then the Italians - the most confident show-offs and entrepreneurs in Europe - came up with a startlingly logical solution to the problem of how to let people know that serious money had been spent on clothing: wear fashion labels on the outside. A rash of embroidered flashes bearing fabled names appeared on the outside of handbags, on the cuffs and collars of garments, and across the front of jerseys and sweatshirts. It was vulgar, but it worked. More refinement was to come. The next stage was subtle, insider flaunting. Nothing as obvious as the designer's name was paraded. This time it was simply a logo that was prominently worn. Suddenly, shirts were awash with tigers, crocodiles and polo horses. Even the shark found itself emblazoned on a range of golf clothing. But there were other varieties of shark patrolling the muddier waters of the rag trade world, producing 'rip-offs' in their millions. But not even they could kill the lure of the symbolic tag. Today, the label has gone underground but the logo is still flourishing  - and seems likely to continue to do so. In the 1970s it seemed innocent and amusing but, as always, there was a hidden agenda. As the 1980s dawned, it became clear that a new generation of first-time buyers in the luxury market had no concept of quality. They had no idea of how to differentiate between good and bad items - of well-cut and properly finished garments or those that had been thrown together. The mere inclusion of the word 'designer' was enough. It had a name, what else could matter? Clever advertising made new buyers aware of the talismanic quality of a prestigious label but they had been given no concept of the quality for which such labels should stand. It was open season for rag trade charlatans. Ignorance is always exploited and, as the 1980s began to boom, shrewd heads were put together in the boardrooms of Paris and Milan. They were asking the same question: why bother with high standards if the public fails to appreciate them? If, as was increasingly obvious, the public was more interested in the label than the garment, surely the next step was clear? Advertise around the name, make the logo desirable and cut corners on production in order to keep profits buoyant. And, bizarre as it now seems, they were right. In the spending bonanza of the 1980s - which, it is often forgotten, began not with property but with fashion - the designer became pre-eminent to such an extent that even merchandise far removed from the world of fashion jumped on the bandwagon and 'designer label' became the buzz phrase which released 1m credit cards. The fashion designer stopped being the humble little artisan of the past and became the grand signeur that he is today. Furthermore, he became so omnipotent and so valuable to society that the word 'label' seemed to be gilding the lily. 'Designer' on a product was enough. Designer stationery, designer bathroom accessories, even designer refrigerators were eagerly bought for the value of that word alone. Never have so many people been so easily separated from their money in pursuit of a mirage. It could not last, of course, but the fallout has. What happened in the 1980s was that quality was swallowed by hype. The 1990s have seen no call for its return. Even value for money has now become a nebulous concept. Buttons that fall off at first wearing, linings that slip and hang below jackets, polyester priced as if it were top-quality silk . . . these faults are increasingly accepted as the norm. The fashion industry is in disarray. Economic confusion is found at all levels. Now is the time for consumers to exert their power. We can bring back quality by demanding value for money. After all, we were the ones who threw it out in the first place. We will be doing the fashion industry a favour as well as ourselves.</p>

It was  founded jointly by the Communist Party of China (CPC),  democratic parties, individuals without party affiliation,  people's organizations, and personages from various social  circles.    The first plenary session of the CPPCC was held in Beijing  between September 21 and 30, 1949 and attended by 662  representatives from all sections of the Chinese society. At  the time, CPPCC exercised the functions and powers of the  later-formed National People's Congress (NPC), China's  legislature. The first CPPCC session adopted the "Common  Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference," proclaiming the founding of the People's Republic  of China (PRC), and elected the committee of the central  people's government of the PRC with Mao Zedong as its chairman.  It also decided the national flag and anthem, elected the first  180-member National Committee of the CPPCC.    The Second CPPCC National Committee convened its first  plenary session in Beijing in December, 1954. It declared that  because of the convention of the First National People's  Congress (NPC), CPPCC ceased to function as the country's  legislature, but continued to exist as an organization of the  People's Democratic United Front.    The plenary session elected Mao Zedong honorary chairman and  Zhou Enlai chairman of its national committee. The Second  National Committee of the CPPCC held three plenary sessions.    The Third CPPCC National Committee held its first plenary  session in Beijing in April, 1959. From this session on, CPPCC  members have begun to attend NPC sessions without voting rights.  The session elected Mao Zedong honorary chairman and Zhou Enlai  chairman of the National Committee. The Third CPPCC National  Committee held four plenary sessions.    The first plenary session of the Fourth CPPCC National  Committee was held in Beijing between December 1964 and January  1965. It re- elected Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai its honorary  chairman and chairman respectively. CPPCC was forced to stop  operation during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and, as a  result, the Fourth CPPCC National Committee held only one  plenary session.    The Fifth CPPCC National Committee convened its first  plenary  session in Beijing in February 1976. Deng Xiaoping was elected  its chairman. The National Committee held five plenary sessions.    The Sixth CPPCC National Committee, which convened its first  plenary session in Beijing in June 1983, elected Deng Yingchao  its chairwoman. The National Committee held five plenary  sessions.    The Seventh CPPCC National Committee, which held its first  plenary in Beijing between March 24 and April 10 of 1988,  elected Li Xiannian its chairman. The National Committee  convened five plenary sessions altogether.    The Eighth CPPCC National Committee held its first plenary  session in Beijing during March 14-27, 1993. Attended by 2,093  members, it elected Li Ruihuan its chairman.    CPPCC has always been an organization for patriotic united  front work under the leadership of CPC. It consists of members  of CPC and eight democratic parties, democratic personages  without party affiliation, members of people's organizations,  representatives of minority nationalities, prominent figures  from all walks of life, representatives of Taiwan, Hong Kong and  Macao compatriots and returned overseas Chinese, and specially  invited people.    CPPCC is an important instrument for promoting socialist  democracy in China's political life. It participates in  political consultations on major state policies and important  issues concerning people's life, and exercises democratic  supervision over CPC and the government by making suggestions  and criticisms.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TARZANA MAN'S DEATH RULED STRANGULATION  </P> <P> An autopsy has determined that a 74-year-old Tarzana man, whose body was found  in his apartment on Friday evening, died of strangulation, the coroner's office  reported Monday.  </P> <P> The body of Harry Simon of 18375 Collins St. was already decomposing when it  was found, said Michael Riddle, an investigator with the Los Angeles County  coroner's office. This made it difficult to determine the cause of death  without an autopsy.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Department homicide detectives were investigating.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SAN FRANCISCO INITIATIVES;  </P> <P> A BATTLE TO KEEP HOTELS AT BAY  </P> <P> To build or not to build hotels on San Francisco's waterfront?  </P> <P> That long-simmering issue, one of many facing the city's voters on Election  Day, has provoked a storm of controversy for the beleaguered Port of San  Francisco.  </P> <P> The self-supporting agency, desperate for new sources of cash to fund freight  shipping and fishing operations, has endorsed two projects with small hotels  proposed for rundown piers south of Fisherman's Wharf. The San Francisco Port  Commission, in fact, has vowed to allow no more than two hotels.  </P> <P> But slow-growth activists fear that the port could change its mind and open the  floodgates to a wave of tourist hotels that would destroy the flavor of the  picturesque waterfront and put it off-limits to residents.  </P> <P> They have sponsored an initiative on Tuesday's ballot that would prohibit all  hotel development within 100 feet of the shoreline and require that the port  complete a comprehensive land-use plan before further non-maritime development  could proceed.  </P> <P> "We don't think the hotel construction would stop there," said Jack Morrison, a  former supervisor and slow-growth proponent who helped kill Mayor Art Agnos'  plan for a downtown ballpark. "The threat is there would be a string of hotels  north and south of the Ferry Building (the landmark port headquarters building  at the foot of Market Street)."  </P> <P> At issue are two projects already approved by the port. One is a $70-million  sailboat harbor, 170-room hotel, museum and conference facility for Piers 24  and 26, near the base of the Bay Bridge, planned by Koll Co., a developer based  in Newport Beach. The other is a $120-million cruise terminal, hotel and  exhibition hall on Piers 30 and 32 that has Scandinavian backing and is aimed  at beefing up San Francisco's flagging cruise ship business.  </P> <P> The developers contend that they have been sensitive about keeping their  projects in scale. At 40 feet high, a limit set by the port, both hotels would  be shorter than existing buildings or bulkheads on the piers. Moreover, one  member of the Scandinavian team said, the project's architectural firm is Utzon  Associates of Denmark, designers of the Sydney Opera House. Hotels, both  developers say, are key to making the projects feasible.  </P> <P> "We would have to have another use that pays for construction of the cruise  terminal," said Erik Norgaard, president of Scandinavia Center Inc., the group  behind the cruise terminal.  </P> <P> Port officials say the two projects would provide 1,300 jobs and revenue to  help pay for improvements to the port's container-shipping facilities. One  official added that the developments would save the port the cost of tearing  out rotting piers at the sites.  </P> <P> "To preempt them would be utter foolishness," said James Herman, president of  the Port Commission and president of the International Longshoremen's and  Warehousemen's Union.  </P> <P> Both projects have the support of Mayor Art Agnos, who promised as a candidate  to revitalize the port.  </P> <P> "He's very much opposed to the ban," said Scott Shafer, the mayor's press  secretary. "Although the intentions may have been noble, the (Proposition H  backers) have written an initiative that will paralyze the port."  </P> <P> Port Executive Director Michael Huerta contends that the demand for a new  land-use plan could stymie other projects, such as an aquarium planned for Pier  39, and freeze the flow of cash as the port is embarking on a $100-million  overhaul aimed at making it more competitive with Oakland and other West Coast  ports. The port is already restricted by three land-use plans that prohibit  housing and office buildings on the waterfront.  </P> <P> Morrison countered that a land-use plan could be completed in three to six  months "if they really set their minds to it." He added that one way the port  could increase revenues would be to renegotiate leases with existing  restaurants and shops.  </P> <P> As it is, many San Franciscans contend that they have been burned by past  developments along the northern waterfront near Fisherman's Wharf. Touted  originally as projects that would lure city residents, Pier 39, Ghirardelli  Square and the Cannery cater primarily to tourists.  </P> <P> Earlier efforts to put hotels on the waterfront have met with stiff resistance.  </P> <P> A furor erupted in 1987 when Mayor Dianne Feinstein and port authorities pushed  for a hotel at Pier 45 as a way to pay for fish-handling facilities. The port  voted down the hotel idea.  </P> <P> Despite limited funding, Morrison's group appears to be making headway. For  weeks, volunteers have distributed leaflets door to door and handed out  brochures at bus stops.  </P> <P> A poll conducted for the San Francisco Chronicle in late October showed  Proposition H leading among voters, 49% to 35%.  </P> <P> Should it pass, Huerta, for one, is thinking ahead.  </P> <P> "If you're developing waterfronts," he said, "you have to be very patient. . .  . The port has to look very seriously at writing that (two-hotel) limitation  into law."  </P> <P> Times researcher Norma Kaufman contributed to this story.  </P></p>

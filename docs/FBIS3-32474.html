TRABAJADORES, the official newspaper of the Cuban Workers  Federation, has written in an editorial the subject has gained  prominence in all of the meetings taking place in factories and  institutions to gather opinions and proposals aimed at drafting  regulations that will contribute to the improvement of the  economy.    TRABAJADORES has said during the past four years the breach  between monetary liquidity in the people's hands and the  official offering of goods and services have broadened the  negative consequences of a recessed economy [economia sumergida)  and the black market to limits that are increasingly unbearable  economically, socially, and politically.    The editorial then explains the recessed economy, with a  relatively small physical volume of products, is taking away the  largest part of workers' salaries due to high prices, something  which reflects an inflationary process that is hardly noticeable  in the state price policy.    TRABAJADORES has said the huge difference in prices is an  invitation to crime, because many people who handle state funds  and become sellers can be tempted to take advantage of lack  administrative controls and actions against the so-called  "missing funds" ["faltantes"] to steal merchandise and obtain an  additional income.    The labor parliament--the name given to the meetings held by  workers to discuss the country's economic problems and give  possible solutions--has expressed its rejection of these  practices, which are amoral and harmful to the country.    The editorial acknowledges, next to private producers, the  state enterprise today is the main source of income to that  recessed economy.    The editorial later criticizes the irresponsibility and  neglect displayed in the economic control operations in both the  flow of goods [flujos materiales] and basic financial elements.    TRABAJADORES stresses the accounting, cost, inventories,  exact measurement of consumption, and discipline of collection  and payments are the tools to fight corruption and disorder in  any workplace.    The editorial stresses it is the unions' responsibility,  because they own the means of production, to insure worker's  control and a proper settlement of accounts for the proper use  of material and financial resources.</p>

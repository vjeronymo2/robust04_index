			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Observer: Tom-Tom Tim Tim Renton, Britain's arts minister and humble mortal, recently found himself ushered into the presence of a God, blissfully unaware of the protocol crisis which preceded the auspicious event. One of Westminster's few true gentlemen and far better suited to being arts supremo than Chief Whip, the Machiavellian assignment dumped on him by an increasingly isolated Margaret Thatcher, Renton was heading for the Horniman Museum to meet the Ooni of Ife, divine king of 15m Yoruba people in south west Nigeria. The legacy of a Victorian tea merchant, the Horniman collection embraces artifacts and art from cultures and religious faiths around the world. Proud owner of a stuffed walrus and its very own mummy, the museum has now added an exhibition of Yoruba art, which Renton was invited to look over. But the museum's big-wigs were unsure of the correct procedures to be followed when a minister meets a god. After considerable anguish, it was eventually decided that Renton need not kneel. At the moment of their meeting, however, it was agreed that tom-toms would sound - a salute considered sufficiently grand because the Ooni, it emerged, is only a part-time god. Off-duty, the divinity is a commodities broker.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Over 70,000 protest against religious strife in India More than 70,000 people came out in a scorching summer sun yesterday to call for an end to the politics of religion which has led to widespread Hindu-Moslem riots in India, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The rally to affirm India's secular constitution was called by 13 left and left-of-centre political parties near the historic Red Fort in the old city of Delhi. Speakers at the rally charged the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which spearheaded the movement for building a temple on the site of the mosque, for injecting religion into politics. The Indian government has removed cars and white goods, such as refrigerators and washing machines, from the list of industries requiring licences, the Press Trust of India said, Reuter adds from New Delhi. It quoted an official spokesman as saying that, since the government has introduced full convertibility of the rupee, investments should be determined by the availability of foreign exchange, making licensing in these sectors unnecessary.</p>

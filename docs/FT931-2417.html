			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: French bank up by 7.6% despite sector pressure CREDIT Commercial de France (CCF), the French banking group, saw net profits rise by 7.6 per cent to FFr978m (Dollars 173m) last year from FFr909m in 1991, in spite of the strains on the banking market. The French banks have in the past year come under intense pressure because of the impact of the slowdown, which has depressed demand for credit from consumers and industry, and the fall in value on their investments in property and industry. Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman, said CCF, which earlier this year joined forces with BHF Bank of Germany to take a significant stake in Charterhouse, the London-based merchant bank, had been affected by the pressures on the banking market. However, he said, it managed to maintain growth because of cost cutting, productivity gains and prudent provisioning. The group saw net banking income rise by 3.1 per cent, just above the French inflation rate, to FFr7.86bn from FFr7.62bn in 1991. Cost-cutting measures produced a slight fall in operating costs to FFr5.15bn from FFr5.19bn over the same period and gross operating profits rose to FFr2.33bn from FFr2.06bn. CCF also managed to restrain provisions at a manageable level, mainly because it is less exposed than other banking groups to the most vulnerable areas of the economy, notably commercial property and small businesses. The level of provisions rose to FFr1.26bn from FFr1.15bn.</p>

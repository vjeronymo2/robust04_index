			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST political desk] </F>   [Text] One out of four public office holders on Hong Kong  district boards and municipal councils has been appointed by  China in its first batch of district affairs advisers. On top  of the 128 office bearers in Hong Kong's district councils,  China extended its united front to another 146 prominent  community leaders and one legislator. The group will advise  Beijing on local district affairs up to 1997.    Notwithstanding the 274 community leaders offered the new  title, China is prepared to enlarge the team of district affairs  advisers in the near future. With the change in sovereignty  3-1/2 years away, China's team of district affairs advisers is  comparable to those serving the British Hong Kong  administration. One hundred and eight out of 414 district board  members were offered the title, including 20 out of 76 municipal  councillors. More importantly, 12 of the 19 district board  chairmen were appointed.    With the two municipal council chairmen and three district  board chairmen already Hong Kong affairs advisers, only four  district board leaders are left with no Chinese post. But the  four remaining district board chairmen are likely to be among  the third batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers to be announced  soon. Nearly all district board chairmen have strongly  supported China in the Sino-British row over political reform.    Also named yesterday were 40 out of the 140 appointed  district board members who are set to lose their seats after the  board election in September, when appointed seats are to be  abolished. Among the 274 appointees, 62 have party affiliations.  The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, which  is pro- China topped the list with 43 members appointed. Second  on the list is the biggest party in the Legislative Council, the  Liberal Party, which had seven members named.    The party's former executive director Sylvester Tse Tak-kan  was also appointed. It is followed by another conservative  party, the Liberal Democratic Federation, with six members,  including the party's only legislator, Alfred Tso Shiu-wai. Two  liberal parties, the Association for Democracy and People's  Livelihood and the Meeting Point, had four and two members  appointed respectively. But liberal flagship United Democrats  had no members named.    Those without party affiliation came from neighbourhood  kaifong associations, pro-China trade unions and local district  groups. Two expatriates were appointed -- Urban Councillor  Brook Bernacchi and Eastern District Board member Joseph  Salaroli.    Mr Bernacchi, who came from Britain in 1945, said he  believed  his experience in the Urban Council would be helpful to a smooth  transition. "China is entitled to understand the organisation  of Hong Kong at the district boards and the Urban Council," said  the most senior Queen's Counsel and veteran leader of one of the  oldest political parties in Hong Kong, the Reform Club. Mr  Bernacchi, 72, admitted the advisory body was set up partly for  the purpose of propaganda. But he said China knew little about  the operation of the district boards and the municipal councils.    Another appointee, Mr Salaroli, an Italian, said he had  accepted the appointment in view of the Sino-British row. Asked  if he was happy about the appointment, Mr Salaroli from the  Democratic Foundation said: "Why should I be happy... But  after all, I was picked from so many people and I am quite  proud. [no closing quotation marks as published]    As for the appointment of liberals as district affairs  advisers, Meeting Point legislator Fred Li Wah-ming said his  party respected members' decision to accept the offer. He said  he hoped the two advisers from his party would reflect their  opinions about district affairs to the Chinese Government. He  said China should appoint more people from the liberal camps to  think tanks such as the Preliminary Working Committee and the  future Preparatory Committee for the Special Administrative  Region. "I think the Chinese side should at least let Hong Kong  people feel that it can tolerate different views to enhance the  credibility of their organisations and advisory bodies," he said.</p>

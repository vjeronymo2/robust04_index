			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Management: How to hire an incompetent - It's harder than you think. John Wareham offers tips Many people enjoy hiring incompetent underlings. After all, an incompetent subordinate can make a near-incompetent boss seem, by comparison, a near-genius. And, uncertain of tenure, the incompetent is likely to take special precautions to please the boss. He or she will want to do exactly as told in any circumstance. The incompetent will usually be more than delighted to follow foolish instructions and, when problems arise, to screen the boss from all fallout. A good living is thus to be commanded by the canny incompetent's well-honed fawning and grovelling skills. Given that an incompetent underling can offer many satisfactions to the boss, how should a recruiter go about finding one? The knack of appointing such individuals is a talent shared by many senior executives. But it is largely unconscious - although the would-be recruiter constantly hires incompetents, he is likely to be unaware of the precise techniques exploited. Indeed, unless properly instructed, the recruiter may actually wind up accidentally recruiting a competent subordinate. This is likely to cause untold heartache, for such a subordinate is likely to prove a troublemaker for the boss, always querying instructions, refusing to carry out orders that do not seem to make sense, maybe even indulging in 'whistle blowing'. So how can the intelligent executive assure himself that the person he hires will be a genuine incompetent, and not one of those emotionally mature, stable, savvy achievers who always turn out to be troublemakers? The answer lies in heeding the following eight commandments. Never conduct a real search for qualified candidates. Instead, restrict yourself to hiring other people's rejects and make all your appointments from the unsolicited CVs that cross your desk. These, for the most part, are going to be directed to you by out-placement firms that specialise in finding new employment for people whose present employers do not want them around anymore. This is a rich pool which, if carefully fished, can be relied upon to produce out-and-out incompetents over and over again. Place great emphasis on appearance and presentation. Take to your bosom the advice of Oscar Wilde that: 'It is only shallow people who do not judge by first appearances.' Favour the kind of candidate who most fits your own notion of what an executive ought to look like. Pay close attention to the candidate's clothes. Work upon the assumption that a Brooks Brothers suit denotes stability, and that silver hair bespeaks wisdom. Never hire an executive who wears unseemly hose, or who sports scuffed shoes. Hire the best-looking candidate, the individual who bears the strongest physical resemblance to your own attractive personage. By all means feel free to hire your own offspring and siblings. Talk to candidates but never interview them. It is naturally very important to impress upon those in your organisation that you are serious about hiring 'good people'. Thus, you will probably want to spend a lot of time talking to candidates about your job, sharing your values and philosophies. Tell them at length about your company and yourself, your upbringing, your view on everything. If the would-be recruit's attention flags at any point, then throw the ingrate out, for the candidate who cannot at least seem to be paying attention for hours on end to incoherent ramblings from a prospective boss is unlikely to be a proper incompetent. Don't bother to ask for too much material on the candidate. Simply assume that it is all on the CV. Or adopt an avant garde attitude and work to the assumption that you must not invade anyone's privacy by inquiring about any possible 'employment gaps'. Hire from your own social circle. Explain to your colleagues that 'the chemistry has to be right' before you will hire. This way you can restrict your hiring to people who not only look and dress like you, but who also share your opinions on pretty well everything. Put a great deal of emphasis on 'name' colleges and clubs. By so doing, you will more or less exclude the kind of independent-minded person likely to prove a troublemaker. With any luck at all, you will wind up recruiting a first-rate non-threatening incompetent with whom you can harmoniously co-exist. Reject generalists in favour of technicians. A wonderful way to by-pass competent people is to make technical - as opposed to emotional - qualification your key selection criterion. This is a much-favoured technique, because spotting and quantifying technical education and exposure is infinitely easier than spotting and hiring the emotional qualities that go to make a truly competent person. Place great reliance on references from past employers. A good way to hire an incompetent is to solicit bland comments - about the only comments offered these days - from previous employers. It is vital to take such comments at face value, and to ignore or overlook cagey endorsements. So, when someone says: 'In my opinion you'll be fortunate to get this candidate to work for you,' tune out the sub-text and delve no further. Never get a psychological evaluation on the candidate. The vital thing in hiring incompetents is for everyone to believe or pretend to believe that the incompetent is a great prize. Unfortunately, a psychological evaluation may let the cat out of the bag. So, when the company chairman - having suddenly noticed what can no longer be hidden, that your staff never seem to get anything done - suggests that it might be smart to have your future candidates screened by a professional before any hiring, proclaim loud and long that you simply do not believe in all that mumbo-jumbo. And, never let yourself be evaluated. That could be the end of everything.

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Review sets the scene for cutting and dealing: Michael Smith finds the Recs poised for a bout of change Regional electricity companies (Recs) in England and Wales are expected to undergo a series of profound changes, with takeovers among the possibilities, following publication today of the industry regulator's pricing review. Takeover talks and stake building could begin within weeks, according to some analysts. The 12 Recs in England and Wales have a market value of about Pounds 15bn, while their two Scottish counterparts - the review of which will be completed later this year - total Pounds 4.6bn. The review covers the distribution business, which provides the companies withof their annual profits. While the regulator has been scrutinising the sector, plans for change have often been put on hold. So whatever his conclusions, the review's completion should trigger activity. The Recs are likely to: consider acquisitions to help transform them into more broadly based utility groups; make more job cuts and changes to working practices. Staff cuts of 10-25 per cent have been common in the four years since privatisation; decide what to do with the National Grid, the transmission company which they own. Valued at Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn, it is expected to be floated on the London Stock Exchange next spring. Some of the companies will become bid targets. Their attractions include their financial strength - most have net cash or low borrowings - and their conservative accounting. New management might see the potential for reducing tax charges and releasing provisions made for eventualities which may never happen. Several companies, for example, put aside money years ago to cater for the possible adverse effects of a European Court ruling on pensions. Potential predators, or suitors, include overseas utilities groups and UK-based conglomerates. However, it is also possible that some of the Recs will get together voluntarily. Some analysts believe Scottish Power and Northern Electric would make a good fit. Others mentioned as potential takeover candidates tend to be the smaller concerns such as Manweb, Seeboard, South Wales Electricity and South Western Electricity. Obstacles to deals are likely to include the unwillingness of managements to give up their power bases. Since the City rates most of the companies similarly, it is unlikely that one of the Recs will go for another without prior agreement. Any contested bid is likely to come from outside. The second obstacle is the government's ownership of a 'golden share' in each company. This limits other stakes to a maximum of 15 per cent. However, the government has shown flexibility in the past and, in any case, the golden shares expire in the English and Welsh companies next March. This puts pressure on the companies to reform from within. One way of lessening attractions to a hostile bidder would be to unlock hidden value before a predator points to it. Flotation of the National Grid is an obvious example. The Recs could also make themselves less digestible to some predators by making large acquisitions. Norweb and Yorkshire Electricity have already made overseas purchases. Other companies are likely to tread cautiously, partly because of City wariness about utility companies' diversification. For that reason the companies may prefer to concentrate on improving internal efficiency.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Electricity Companies  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                             Performance since flotation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Compound    Compound     Share                                    annual      annual      price                                   earnings    dividend   relative                                   per share   per share  to sector                                    growth      growth   since 1.1.91  --------------------------------------------------------------------- East Midlands Electricity*          21.4        14.7       -3.11% Eastern Electricity                 19.2        16.8       -5.53% London Electricity                  23.3        14.7      -10.83% Manweb                              34.6        29.5       -0.40% Midlands Electricity                20.0        30.2        6.28% Northern Electric                   28.4        15.2        6.00% Norweb                              65.3        13.7        2.01% Seeboard                            27.5        16.8       14.86% South Wales Electricity             22.5        14.8        5.56% South Western Electricity           24.6         9.6        2.19% Southern Electric                   26.5        15.6       -0.05% Yorkshire Electricity                8.6        15.0       -8.28%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports                     *before exceptional costs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

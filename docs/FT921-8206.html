			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Reshuffle of Israel's old guard may unlock peace process: Today's Labour leadership election could free the logjam of Jerusalem politics BETWEEN them, Yitzhak Shamir, 76, Shimon Peres, 68, and Yitzhak Rabin, 69, have occupied the office of prime minister of Israel for 12 of the last 18 years. The overwhelming likelihood is that one of them - polls favour the present incumbent, Mr Shamir - will do so again after the June 23 general election. Nevertheless, leadership elections in the Likud and Labour parties today and tomorrow promise more than just a reshuffling of the all-too familiar old guard. The two contests may not produce new faces at the top. But they will have a considerable effect on the shape of the inevitable coalition government that will emerge from the election, and especially on its posture towards the Middle East peace negotiations launched in Madrid last October. They may determine whether the process, currently sustained chiefly by US pressure on the participants, will achieve anything of substance. The more bitter is being fought in the Labour party, which under the leadership of Shimon Peres has led a government for only two years since Likud first came to power under Menachem Begin in 1977. In an unprecedented ballot of its 150,000 members today, Yitzhak Rabin, replaced as leader by Mr Peres in 1977, is seeking to take over the party once more. Two other candidates, Mr Israel Kessar, leader of the Histadrut trade union federation, and Mrs Ora Namir, a veteran party activist and MP, are also on the ballot. But the real contest is between old rivals Peres and Rabin. Mr Rabin, Chief of Staff during the triumph of the 1967 Six Day War, when Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and Arab east Jerusalem, believes Labour is fatally handicapped by Mr Peres' leadership. His supporters say Mr Rabin can recapture voters who have gone over to the Likud because of fears that Mr Peres is too willing to make concessions to the Palestinians. Like Mr Peres, Mr Rabin favours giving up some 'land for peace', in line with the peace talks formula espoused by the US and demanded by the Arab side. But his record and stance is perceived as much tougher than that of Mr Peres. Mr Rabin, who has the support of most Labour MPs, is the favourite, although Mr Peres is a tenacious fighter who is hoping to deny his rival the 40 per cent support needed for outright victory on the first ballot. A run-off will be held on February 26 between the two leading candidates if no clear result emerges. According to opinion polls, a Rabin victory would dramatically improve Labour's prospects in June. One showed Labour with 32 per cent support, only one point behind the Likud, under Mr Rabin, but nine points behind on 27 per cent under Mr Peres. Labour would probably lose more voters to a new united front of three small 'dovish' parties if Rabin is the leader rather than Peres. But they would still be in the camp of natural Labour allies against Likud. The contest for the Likud leadership tomorrow appears less uncertain. Mr Shamir is challenged by Mr David Levy, his foreign minister, and Mr Ariel Sharon, the hardline housing minister, but should comfortably win in the first round outright. The vote will be an important indicator of the relative strengths of the various camps within the party. In particular, Mr Levy has much at stake. As the most vociferous supporter of the peace talks within the government, he needs to achieve a good showing - 25 per cent or more - to secure his future claims on the leadership, his present status as number two to Mr Shamir and to demonstrate backing for his relatively conciliatory stance. Mr Levy's supporters, mainly drawn from the less privileged Sephardic, or Oriental Jewish communities, tend to be less ideologically committed to the occupied territories than the old Ashkenazi, or European leadership represented by Mr Shamir. With unemployment at more than 10 per cent and rising because of the strains of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, they are concerned that Likud is losing ground to Labour on economic issues. Opinion polls showing up to 80 per cent of the electorate dissatisfied with the government's economic performance bear this out. The polls show a solid majority of Likud supporters back Mr Shamir's uncompromising line in the peace talks. But at the same time, more than a third express a less dogmatic approach. For example, a recent survey showed 39 per cent of Likud voters in favour of freezing Jewish settlements in order to win Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees from the US. If Mr Shamir - and perhaps even Mr Sharon - roundly defeats Mr Levy, Likud will go into the June election in as tough a mood as ever. If, in addition, Mr Peres survives as Labour leader, then the betting in Israel is that Likud will emerge again as the biggest party, the economy notwithstanding. The customary long period of coalition bargaining would ensue (no party has ever won an outright parliamentary majority). But given the deep animosity between Mr Shamir and Mr Peres, a revival of a Likud-Labour partnership is extremely unlikely, leaving instead the option of a right-wing coalition hostile to any peace talks compromise - similar to that which collapsed last month. Even with Mr Rabin at the head of Labour, the party is given little chance of defeating the Likud. But a Shamir-Rabin coalition would be a distinct possibility. The two have worked closely together before. They disagree on the shape of a final settlement in the occupied territories. But they could almost certainly formulate a joint approach on Palestinian autonomy which would improve the prospects for the peace talks to reach the interim solution on the West Bank and Gaza sought as an initial breakthrough by the US. Such an outcome would not be easily achieved, but it would be enhanced if Mr Levy achieves a good result in the Likud vote.</p>

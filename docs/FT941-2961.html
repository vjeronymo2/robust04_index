			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / London radio talks may reopen LBC, the London commercial radio station due to go off the air in October, is trying to reopen talks with London News Radio, the company that won both its licences last year. The move to reopen the talks follows LBC's failure this week to win the national commercial licence for a predominantly speech service. There is growing doubt whether Talk Radio UK, the highest bidder with Pounds 3.8m, will be awarded the licence because its bid may be too high to be financially viable - but LBC, which was fourth in the bidding, stands no chance. LBC, in effect owned by Bank of Scotland, could take a stake in LNR, which has not yet announced that it is fully funded. If agreement could be reached LNR could use existing LBC studios and some of its staff, avoiding an abrupt transition when the new company takes over. If agreement cannot be reached, an application by LBC for one of the four new London-wide frequencies due to become available at the beginning of next year has not been ruled out. Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that Dame Shirley Porter, the controversial former Conservative politician, had resigned as chairman of LBC on Tuesday.</p>

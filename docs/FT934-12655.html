			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Radio survey finds BBC losing out to independents COMMERCIAL radio stations increased their share of radio audiences in the third quarter of the year at the expense of the BBC, independent audit figures released yesterday show. The BBC's share of listeners dropped to 56.1 per cent from 57.2 per cent in the second quarter and 59 per cent in the first quarter of the year. Commercial radio's share, meanwhile, has grown to 41.1 per cent from 38.9 per cent in the second quarter and 37.4 per cent in the first. The balance is mostly made up of listeners to foreign stations The figures are collected by Radio Joint Audience Research, (Rajar), jointly funded by the BBC and commercial radio. Mr Douglas McArthur, managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau, said the figures showed that BBC radio had lost 1.3m listeners to commercial radio in the past year. The results were 'great news for advertisers - not just in terms of higher audience but in terms of the broadening of listener appeal'. Analysis of Rajar's findings showed that commercial radio was reaching a quality audience, Mr McArthur said. The BBC said its radio audience had 'remained firm in spite of intense competition from independent radio'. It said it wanted to see the full year's figures before it could confirm whether the Radio Advertising Bureau's claims were correct. The BBC said local and regional radio was its most popular service after Radio 1. A total of 10m people listened to local stations each week, while more than half of people aged 15 to 34 tuned in to Radio 1 each week as part of the total audience of 16m. Mr McArthur said it was clear there was now a 'true commercial radio generation where there is a genuine appreciation and acceptance of radio with commercials'. It was only in the 55-plus age group where commercial radio's listening share fell below 40 per cent.</p>

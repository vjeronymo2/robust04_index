			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE;  </P> <P> PARK EXPLORES PERSONAL, CULTURAL IN HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Just when "Dandelion," Young-Ae Park's modern dance program Friday at the  Barnsdall Park Gallery Theatre in Hollywood, seemed hopelessly mired in  prettiness, the choreographer pulled a fast one.  </P> <P> She dropped all the outdated sylph-like imagery for the raw irony of "English  Lesson."  </P> <P> Here, in a context of a mock rock video (music by Nobuko Miyamoto, lyrics by  Park), Park attempts to communicate her emotional needs through broken English  to her lover (Allen Tombello), but finds his insistence upon good grammar  ultimately defeating. The personal becomes the cultural and vice versa.  Intriguing.  </P> <P> Nothing else on the program measured up to this work. Park could find, arrest,  manipulate and dismiss force fields of energy within and around her tensile,  lithe body ("Da Mong"). She could express moments of wistfulness or  vulnerability ("Return"). But while she always looked interesting, rarely did  she induce you to empathize with her.  </P> <P> As a choreographer for others, Park could draw on a sense of pictorial balance  and design, utilize movement counterpoint and wrap everything up in cyclic  structures ("Descent" and "Moon Ya"). The program opened and closed, for  instance, with a soloist isolated under a light from the ceiling, and that  image recurred in many of the works on the program.  </P> <P> But she also could seriously misjudge proportion and effect. While the pretty  images occasionally gave way to more horrific suggestions (in "Descent" and  "Moon Ya"), Park spent so much time drawing out the lyric side of things that  by the time the characters got around to expressing any suffering, who could  care?

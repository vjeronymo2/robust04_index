			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TINY TELESCOPIC DEVICE PUTS LEGALLY BLIND DRIVERS ON ROAD IN INDIANA  </P> <P> "I'm going to get a motor car. I'm going to learn how to drive," said Bruce  Quinn, who is 32 and legally blind.  </P> <P> Quinn, who by next summer expects to be running two radio stations 50 miles  apart in northern Indiana, may be licensed to drive for the first time, thanks  to eyeglasses equipped with small telescopes for making out details such as  road signs and stoplights.  </P> <P> "I'm excited about it. I got a moped a few years ago, and I've had a lot of fun  with it and never any trouble, so I should be all right," Quinn, of Delphi,  said. "It offers me a lot of opportunities -- something called freedom. Goodby  to Greyhound. A lot of handicapped people are stuck on Greyhound."  </P> <P> California and Texas have been licensing bioptic drivers for more than 10  years, and about 25 states have such programs for as many as 2,000 drivers  nationwide, said Warren Brown, Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles director of  licensing.  </P> <P> Brown developed Indiana's bioptic registration program at the urging of a  vocational rehabilitation counselor and with help from low-vision optometrists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enthusiastic State Help  </P> <P> "I thought it was the greatest idea in the world when I heard it. It's nice to  do a little good for someone," he said. "You wouldn't believe how sad it is to  tell a man he cannot drive again. I've had men cry. Driving is probably the  single most important thing in any man's life."  </P> <P> Optometrist Paul Bither, who helped write Indiana's licensing guidelines, said  not everyone fits the program. Getting a license to drive is "a major step  toward independence," but "it's not something that I push," he said. "Driving  is a great privilege, but it's also a great responsibility."  </P> <P> In Indiana, drivers must have vision correctable to 20-200 with glasses and to  20-40 through telescopes with up to 4X magnification, a horizontal visual field  of 130 degrees and no major blind spots, color-perception defects or other  visual problems. They must be evaluated and fitted for the telescopes, get a  six-month learner's permit and pass special state-sponsored training as well as  the usual road test.  </P> <P> The telescopes cost from $500 to more than $2,000. They vary in size and  weight, but the most commonly used ones are about one inch in diameter and  weigh about 6 ounces. They may extend a few inches at a slight angle upward  from the top of the glasses over the user's strongest eye, in some cases both  eyes. When the driver needs to see something he tilts his head forward to peer  through the scope.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Driving Range Limited  </P> <P> "Most bioptic drivers, especially the older ones, tend to drive only in  familiar areas," optometrist Dr. Debra McConnaha of Indiana University said.  "It's possible they might be able to drive to the grocery and back without  using the telescope. It's there if they need it."  </P> <P> Supporters of the program say a bioptic driver must be able to glance through  the telescope and spot something in less than a second -- about as quickly as a  normal driver might glance into the rear-view mirror -- but critics say this is  impossible.  </P> <P> Dr. Gerald Fonda, a Livingston, N. J., ophthalmologist who's been prescribing  bioptic glasses since 1947, said bioptic drivers need at least three seconds to  adjust their focus to the telescope, spot the detail and then readjust to  looking through their glasses. He said the telescope creates a blind spot that  is twice as wide as the field of vision through it.  </P> <P> "The purpose of the telescope is to pass the driver's test. There's no evidence  this device is safe, and there is overwhelming evidence it is a hazard," Fonda  said.  </P> <P> Dr. Arthur H. Keeney, professor of ophthalmology at the University of  Louisville Medical School, said the telescope makes objects appear to be closer  than they are and that its "awning effect" obscures overhead signs. He and  Fonda say that poor-vision people should be allowed to drive, but under  restrictive conditions such as under 35 m.p.h. only and never on freeways.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Telescopes Criticized  </P> <P> "There are lots of ways to help people without encumbering them with an optical  device that imposes limitations," Keeney said.  </P> <P> Bill Gengler of the California Department of Motor Vehicles said that a 1983  study of the state's bioptic drivers found that they were nearly twice as  likely to have accidents as others.  </P> <P> "The accident rate was higher, but not significantly. In fact, it was lower  than rates for a variety of other types of California licensed drivers with  different medical conditions," Gengler said.  </P> <P> Advocates for bioptic drivers say they are among the most careful people on the  road. Bioptics say they know their limitations and won't exceed them.  </P> <P> "We stress the safe-driving aspect as part of the privileges we get as  drivers," said Marc Sessions, president of the 1,000-member American Bioptic  Certified Drivers, based in Laguna Niguel, Calif. (He said the group's  initials, ABCD, also stand for Always Be Careful Driving.)  </P> <P> Teresa Canada, 34, of Jasonville, started driving at 16 but lost her license  eight years ago because of poor eyesight. "I have to be more careful than  others. If I feel I am not capable, I am not going to be on the roads," said  Canada, driving through downtown Indianapolis after her road test in October.  </P> <P> Until she got a bioptic license, Canada had to call her husband at work if an  emergency came up at home with any of their four children. "It's been eight  years since I've been able to drive, so I've been in a kind of a prison."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the second, less common form of CAA implementation, EPA is primarily responsible both for setting standards or interpreting the requirements of the Act and for implementing the Federal requirements that are established. Under this approach, the Act provides little formal role for States. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, this approach is reserved for programs requiring a high degree of uniformity in their implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  States nevertheless often actively participate in federal rulemakings and policy development even if the CAA does not call for primary implementation by the States. EPA similarly encourages Tribes to participate actively in EPA's rulemakings and policy development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title VI of the Act, which provides for the phase-out of certain substances that deplete stratospheric ozone, is one such program, since it affects products sold throughout interstate commerce. 42 U.S.C. 7671&hyph;7671q. Title VI is both a Federally established and Federally managed program. EPA is charged with issuing the rules to implement the phase-out. Through, for example, reporting requirements and enforcement, EPA also ensures that the restrictions in production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances that are called for by the Act are, in fact, met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 301(d)(2) of the Act authorizes EPA to issue regulations specifying those provisions of the Act ``for which it is appropriate to treat Indian tribes as States.'' 42 U.S.C. section 7601(d)(2). Thus, the CAA programs where States have a formal implementation role will be the programs that are directly affected by today's proposed action. Conversely, those programs that are established and implemented primarily by EPA will largely be unaffected by today's proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Description of Section 301(d) of the CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 301(d)(1) of the CAA authorizes EPA to ``treat Indian tribes as States'' under the Act, so that Tribes may develop and implement CAA programs in the same manner as States within Tribal reservations or in other areas subject to Tribal jurisdiction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For a Tribe to be eligible for such treatment it must be Federally recognized (see section 302(r)) and must meet the three criteria set forth in section 301(d)(2)(A)&hyph;(C). Briefly, these criteria consist of: (1) a showing of an adequate governing body; (2) that is capable of implementing the particular requirements of the CAA and applicable regulations for which the Tribe is seeking program approval; and (3) within the exterior boundaries of the reservation or other areas within the Tribe's jurisdiction. The precise criteria are set forth in today's proposed rule and are described in detail in Part III.A. below, together with EPA's proposal as to how this eligibility determination should be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  For convenience of expression, portions of this rule refer only to Tribal programs within reservations. However, these references should not be interpreted to limit Tribal programs solely to lands within reservation boundaries since the CAA acknowledges that tribes may possess authority over off-reservation lands.'' See Part II.A, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the same time, the Act recognizes that it may not be appropriate or feasible in all instances to treat Tribes and States identically. Accordingly, EPA is required under section 301(d)(2) of the Act to promulgate regulations ``specifying those provisions of [the CAA] for which it is appropriate to treat Indian tribes as States.'' Tribes that satisfy the criteria discussed above are eligible to implement those provisions specified by EPA if the minimum Federal requirements set out in the provisions have been met. In general, EPA is proposing that Tribes be eligible to implement the same provisions as States, with some exceptions, as set forth in today's proposed rule and discussed in Part III.B. below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 301(d)(3) of the Act gives EPA the discretion to promulgate regulations establishing the elements of Tribal implementation plans (``TIPs'') and procedures for approval or disapproval of those plans or portions thereof. See Addendum A, ``Title I'' discussion. These regulations would be implemented in conjunction with section 110(o) of the Act, which provides that any TIP that is submitted to EPA under section 301(d) shall be reviewed in accordance with the provisions for review of State implementation plans (``SIPs'') set out in section 110, except as otherwise provided by this regulation. Once effective, the TIP would be applicable to all areas located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation. See section 110(o). In today's action, EPA is proposing TIP regulations and procedures, as well as procedures for the review of other Tribal air programs (``TAPs''). These procedures are discussed further in Part III.C. below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, section 301(d) of the Act makes provision for EPA to furnish grant and contract assistance to Tribes. See section 301(d)(1), (5) of the CAA. The grant provisions proposed today are described in Part IV of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / ITV campaign aims to boost market share THE ITV network is running an unprecedented promotional campaign this winter, worth an equivalent of Pounds 9m in airtime value, to increase its market share, Raymond Snoddy writes. Mr Malcolm Wall, chairman of the ITV marketing committee, told advertisers yesterday that, for the first time, each ITV company will contribute 15 per cent of its promotional airtime to a central network campaign. A new drama may have a launch promotion equal to Pounds 1m in airtime value. ITV is also considering advertising in other media. The campaign is part of the move towards a more commercially competitive ITV system which will begin in January, when the new ITV franchises begin and Channel 4 starts selling its own advertising time. ITV has had the greatest share of viewing every week this year apart from the Olympic fortnight. It said it had beaten BBC1 by more than 10 percentage points eight times.</p>

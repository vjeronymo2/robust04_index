			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: Wipe away the tears When Max Factor took the last solid block mascaras off the shelves, many women were disappointed. A few, possibly, shed a blackened tear at the loss of the peculiar 'spit and slick' ritual which allowed them to control exactly how much mascara they applied to their lashes. Chanel has come to the rescue with a 1990s version of the traditional cake mascara. Le Regard (Pounds 29) is what Chanel terms monochromatic make-up; it contains an eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara in one sleek compact - and the right tools to create the smouldering, smoky eyes that the Chanel models peered through on the catwalk. To complete the look, false eyelashes with a difference are now available. These 'One by One Semi-Permanent Eyelashes' (Pounds 3.95) have nothing in common with the 1960s variety that left women looking heavy lidded and drowsy. The new eyelashes can last up to three weeks and are light, waterproof, and can be used happily by contact lens wearers. The British Designers Sale has become a fixture in the shopping lives of many a chic lady who lunches. Here the canny shopper often finds her designer numbers at sharply reduced prices. Unfortunately, membership of the list for the women's sale is full but there is a menswear version of the designer sales at which would-be snappy dressers can search for bargains. More than 25 top European designers (no, we are not allowed to mention names but they are English, French, Italian, American and German) will be selling samples, ends of lines and surplus stock at greatly reduced prices - anything and everything from suits, jackets, ties, socks, shirts and overcoats plus (curiously) a selection of silk lingerie to gladden the eye of women who accompany the men. The men's sale takes place twice a year and the next is on Saturday December 3 from 10am to 5pm at the Kensington Hilton. There is a Pounds 2 charge at the door and only cash or cheques (no credit cards) are accepted.</p>

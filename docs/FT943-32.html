			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Europe (40): Faster start than expected - France / The recovery appears to be gathering pace The French economy has left the starting blocks faster than expected as it heads for recovery after the sharp recession of 1992-1993. Growth of 1 per cent in the second quarter, following a rise of 0.7 per cent in the first three months, has prompted most private sector economists to predict an expansion of about 2 per cent in gross domestic product this year, a target endorsed by the government. Such a growth rate may this year bring only a marginal dent in the ranks of the country's 3.3m unemployed. But government officials argue that it provides the basis for a steady longer-term recovery. Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, believes growth next year will be at least 3 per cent and that such a rate of expansion is sustainable over the medium term. The rate of revival undermines the claims of those who argued during last year's currency crisis that France's anti-inflationary stance and its allegiance to the Bundesbank's monetary policy would prevent economic revival. But while inflation appears firmly under control, with consumer prices growing at an annualised rate of about 1.7 per cent, some question marks remain about the stamina of the recovery and about the government's ability to tackle the structural problems facing the French economy. Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has himself warned about bumps on the road to restored economic health. 'This is the beginning of a real recovery. But it may be that in the months ahead we have some disappointments . . . whether it is production, export or employment figures,' he said in August. So far, economic revival has been largely powered by the corporate sector and by sporadic specific bursts in consumer spending. French industry has sharply reduced its rate of destocking, particularly in the intermediate goods sector, providing a boost to growth figures. In the first quarter this re-stocking represented the most important source of growth, maintaining its effect into the second quarter. French industry has also benefited from improved demand in international markets. Stronger growth in Germany, France's most important trading partner, has added to the boost to exporters from the dynamic US and east Asian markets, prompting a series of substantial trade surpluses. The surpluses, which amounted to FFr7.6bn in May, for example, are expected to narrow as imports revive in line with the economy. If the corporate sector has provided the basis for recovery, however, the key questions facing policy makers relate to whether consumption and investment will be able to take up the running and keep the economic cycle turning. France's consumers have yet to prove that they are willing to play their part in a sustained economic revival. Spending in the second quarter was robust, but this partly reflected special incentives - notably a strong boost to car purchases stemming from a government offer to provide FFr5,000 to those who traded in an old vehicle to buy a new one. That effect started to wear off towards the end of the quarter and consumer spending has remained fragile. Many economists believe that such fragility is just a passing phase, to be ended by the improving labour market situation. Recent statistics demonstrate a stabilisation in the unemployment rate and hold the promise of a fall in joblessness from the end of the year. 'We are already seeing a big increase in jobs created,' says Bernard Godement, chief economist of Nomura Research Institute in Paris. 'There will be an important psychological effect on consumers.' Others, however, are yet to be convinced. Esther Baroudy, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais, questions the quality of jobs being created and cites structural factors, such as reduced payments from the creaking state pension scheme, as important determinants of consumer behaviour. Investment is another area of uncertainty. 'The corporate sector has a strong financial position, and many firms reported big gains in turnover in the first half,' says one economist at a US merchant bank. 'Set against this are still high levels of capacity and interest rates that make financial investment attractive.' Most economists expect investment to strengthen from the third quarter of this year and many companies, such as Saint Gobain, the glass and building materials group, are already planning new investment programmes. But the strength and breadth of an investment recovery will depend on demand, particularly from consumers. Should any of these sources of growth falter, the government has relatively limited room for manoeuvre. A central budget deficit targeted at FFr300bn this year and FFr275bn in 1995, the convergence requirements of European monetary union, and the potential pressure on long-term borrowing rates, already pushed up to more than seven per cent by the turmoil on the bond markets, leave little scope for fiscal stimulus. With respect to monetary policy, the newly independent Bank of France has been gradually trimming short-term interest rates. The intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, has been reduced to 5 per cent from 6.2 per cent at the beginning of the year. The strong performance of the German economy and the rise in interest rates in other industrialised nations suggests, however, it will be hard to ease borrowing costs further. With inflation moribund, the real cost of borrowing will remain higher than in most of France's rivals. Increased importance is therefore placed on the government's ability to implement structural reforms, notably in the labour market and in the social security system. Mr Balladur's instincts are in the direction of reform, but progress has been limited by political sensitivities. The introduction of private pension schemes, aimed at easing the burden on the state system, has been delayed, while a plan to lower the minimum wage for graduate apprentices was abandoned in the face of student protests. Such caution largely reflects Mr Balladur's reluctance to rock the boat ahead of next spring's presidential elections. Failure to press ahead with reforms after the election, however, will mean that the emerging recovery will only serve to mask the structural weaknesses which persist in the economy.</p>

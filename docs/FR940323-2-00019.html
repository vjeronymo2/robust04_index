			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These adjustments are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from crating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners argue that since Goldstar, in the preliminary results, a zero margin, it may suggest that no dumping margin will be found in the final results of review. In that event, petitioners request that the Department should not count this POR for the purposes of an antidumping order revocation because the quantity of the CTVs shipped by Goldstar to the United States during this review was `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'' Petitioners further state that ``a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  volume of shipments is also no indication of the absence of price discrimination, because any producer seeking to dump its product would find it advantageous and a simple task to sell a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  volume of a product fair at fair value in the short-term so as to obtain revocation and then be freed to dump its product in the future.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Goldstar rebuts this allegation by claiming that: (1) There is no request for revocation in this review, therefore, the issue is irrelevant; and (2) the Department should not grant ``advisory opinions'' on issues not relevant to this review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with respondent. No request for revocation has been made and, therefore, this issue is not revelant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners allege that respondents under-reported their U.S. sales during the POR and claim a discrepancy between the reported U.S. sales and entries of the subject merchandise made during the POR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Daewoo rejects petitioners' allegations, pointing out the Department's extensive verification of its sales and the cost of production (COP) data. Respondents maintain that such a thorough verification would have revealed any discrepancies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with petitioners. The factual information alleging unreported entries was submitted to the Department after more than 180 days from the initiation of the review. As such, it is untimely and cannot be used during the current POR.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19 CFR 353.31(a)(1). Finally, all sales information and their respective entries pertaining to the current POR have been verified. We found no discrepancies between the reported sales volume and the source documents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 5:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners submitted comments concerning three computer programming/clerical errors in the Department's preliminary results analysis of Daewoo's response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with the petitioners and have made the following corrections to the appropriate programs in our final results calculations for Daewoo: (1) We replaced the gross commission expense with the net commission expense in the exporter's sales price (ESP) cap; (2) we did not adjust USP for home market tax when we compared USP to a constructed value (CV) in both the purchase price (PP) and ESP sales; and (3) we corrected the cost of manufacturer value in model DTB&hyph;1404PW when it is used in the CV application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Daewoo's Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Daewoo asserts that the Department incorrectly used CV for a home market model DTB&hyph;1404PW when the ``90/60'' day matching procedure revealed that there were not enough matching sales in every month of the POR. Instead, Daewoo requests the use of another model in the home market which, allegedly, can be qualified as similar merchandise and has sales in every month of the POR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners object to the use of another model in the matching procedure because it does not meet the physical criteria necessary to qualify as similar merchandise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with Daewoo. Prior to determining FMV under section 773(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, the department must first select the most similar merchandise. Section 771(16) of the Tariff Act defines such or similar merchandise and provides a hierarchy of preferences for determining which merchandise sold in the foreign market is most similar to the merchandise sold in the United States. Section 771(16) also expresses a preference for the use  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> identical over similar  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> merchandise. The cost test is not conducted until after the most similar model match is found under section 771(16). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, section 771(16) directs us only to ``the first of the following categories *&blank;*&blank;*'' and not to the next category when the first match is below the COP. If this were not the case, the COP test would inappropriately become part of the basis for determining what constitutes such or similar merchandise, which is clearly not the purpose of the COP test. Consequently, it appears that the statute directs us to the use of CV when the most similar model is sold below the cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

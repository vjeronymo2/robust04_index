			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Heseltine broadens scope of energy review THE GOVERNMENT voiced confidence last night that it had averted a House of Commons defeat over the coal industry by broadening the scope of its review of the industry to include a detailed analysis of Britain's long-term energy needs. The latest concessions, following a dramatic U-turn on Monday over the scale of shutdowns, were unveiled by Mr Michael Hesel-tine, the trade and industry secretary, to meet the demands of the remaining Conservative critics of the programme. After a series of meetings between Mr Heseltine and backbench MPs yesterday, Mr John Major felt confident enough to state publicly that the government would defeat a Labour motion calling for a complete moratorium on closures. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's industry spokesman, responded to the new shift in the government's position with a demand that it support the opposition's motion to keep all the pits open pending an independent inquiry. Labour was encouraged that a similar motion was approved by the House of Lords last night, with the government being de-feated by 25 votes, but Tory optimism about the outcome of tonight's Commons' vote was boosted when Mr Winston Churchill, a leading rebel, said the policy had changed enough for him to support the government. As miners prepared to converge on Westminster to lobby MPs before today's debate, Mr Cook also called for the resignation of Mr Heseltine after what he termed the government's latest 'humiliating retreat'. In exchanges earlier in the Commons with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major said the fall in demand for coal from electricity generators meant a substantial reduction in coal capacity was inevitable. But in reference to the 21 mines covered by the government's moratorium, the prime minister insisted subsequently he would keep an open mind while the review continued. 'We are not closing the pits and we are not closing our minds,' he said. The widening in the scope of the government review was foreshadowed by Mr Heseltine in meetings with Tory MPs designed to win over all but the most die-hard critics of any pit closures. Mr Heseltine promised that the analysis of the future of 21 threatened pits would be wide-ranging and open, embracing a strategic analysis of Britain's energy requirements. That pledge was reinforced by Lord Wakeham, the Lord Privy Seal, in the House of Lords. The former energy secretary said that a broad range of issues would be covered by the review - including the level of coal imports, the relationship between electricity suppliers and the owners of gas generation stations, and allegations that suppliers could abuse their market positions. Mr Heseltine had suggested previously that the study would be more narrowly focused. Pit losses challenged, Page 8 Parliament, Page 9 Clean coal technology, Page 16</p>

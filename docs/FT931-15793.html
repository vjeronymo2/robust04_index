			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Letter: Inevitable conclusions about bank motives Sir, The receivership of Lilley is a clear indication that the inept custodians of Britain's financial institutions have decided that companies should be refused additional financial support where the banks will receive a full payout for their money in a receivership. The spectacle of banks sprinting for the receivership door when they can see an opportunity to make an exit without any loss of book value illustrates the fundamental malaise of the financial system. It is hard not to conclude that these moves will be taken by banks in order to reinforce their capital ratios against the inevitable write-downs that they face on the truly bankrupt companies that they continue to support. The inevitable consequence of this behaviour is the destruction of relatively healthy companies in favour of those which are dead in all but name. It is only a pity that the UK has neither a Chapter 11-type process to protect companies operating profitably, nor sufficient legal remedies for investors to challenge the banks' motives in forcing companies into receivership. Richard Davis, 47 Heyford Avenue, London SW8 1EA</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Fashion: Screaming to be seen as individuals - Ralph Atkins studies Westminster's moths and butterflies / Dressing for the Professions, The Politician PARLIAMENT, wrote psychologist and former Welsh Labour MP Leo Abse, is a Mecca 'for all those who wish, even as they did in their nurseries but now without fear of disapproval, to scream with anger, spit at their enemies, attack opponents, boldly hit out at wrongs, real and imagined. 'Like moths around a flame, the aggressive flutter around Westminster.' He should know. The violently-coloured shirts and bowler hats he wore on Budget days in the 1960s stood out like a Red Admiral in a field of corn. He wanted to convey a message about something more pugnacious than fiscal stabilisers. Politics is about individualism, a bid for attention. Dress is integral and sends out signals. It has to resonate with a politician's convictions - and, to be successful, that usually means distinctive. 'If you put Lady Thatcher into Laura Ashley it would interrupt what she was saying,' says Barbara Follett, past couturier to Labour's frontbench. 'Individuality is the most important factor when choosing what to wear. It is a mistake to look like an IBM executive clone.' More than any other professional, the politician is constantly visible - to local voters or colleagues they want to impress, to lobby journalists practising their own peculiar school of political lepidopterology, and, above all, to the television cameras. Bright media lights capture, as their first image, a politician's attire. Chosen in pre-dawn darkness, before dashing to breakfast television studios or taking leisurely breakfasts before the 2.30pm Commons sitting, clothes emit hints of mood, sincerity, competence, dedication, determination and affability. The boundless range of political characters turns Westminster into a laboratory of fashion experimentalism. Margaret Thatcher is a pacesetter in her stateswoman-like but, oh-just-slightly, slinky suits. Together with her practical Marks and Spencer shoes, her outfit is a cocktail of chemicals - powerful, moral, respectful, ruthless and, to some fanatical admirers, sexual. Hers is the uniform most mimicked by women MPs. She was always impeccably turned out as prime minister. Perhaps the image was too contrived. Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, wears pastel shades - the 'Mumsie look,' miaows another female on the Tory benches - and has a softer image. Her outfit says: 'The National Health Service is safe in my hands.' But there are constraints. Tenderness has to be combined with toughness if we are to be sure that she can stand up to the brutal, mean-suited boys at the Treasury where tailoring is usually black or very dark from the chancellor, Norman Lamont, downwards. Bottomley dresses to care. Thatcher looks as if hiding a bent to kill, her armoured glamour suppressing the human being inside. If there is one. Employment secretary Gillian Shephard wears similarly aggressive outfits to those of the former prime minister - sometimes in flamboyant yellow, like a fiery Brimstone butterfly. She is a fighter, battling, sometimes semi-publicly, over coal policy with Michael Heseltine, the epitome of gentrified political ambition - down to the last groomed hair riding over his double forehead to the collar of his tailored suit. Heseltine's clothes are precise and calculated, shirts stiffened and reeking of purposefulness - telling us, maybe, that his hopes of winning the prime ministership are not yet thwarted. The variety of butterflies and moths fluttering at Westminster, searching for a collar or trinket - or frequently more - that will make them stand out, is plentiful. Spats and hats have gone but there are still waistcoats around, distant echoes of parliamentary fashion when Winston Churchill was polishing his sound bites, gold chain dangling from his waistcoat. 'I regard Parliament as a formal occasion,' says Greg Knight, government whip, who wears his slate-grey three-piece suit even in the height of summer. 'It is not a branch meeting of the boilermakers' union. MPs should dress accordingly.' A single item of clothing is enough to make a statement. Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Tristan Garel-Jones, Europe minister, wear green Austrian Loden coats favoured by the continental bourgeoisie. At once, the Foreign Office's image of dusty Victorian sensibility is draped in European culture and idealism. Together they are formidable. 'I see you are wearing your single European coat,' said John Major as they approached him once. Labour may have been mistaken at the last election in using standardised clothing guidelines to reinforce a particular image. The party wanted respect and credibility; it needed to build trust with the electorate. But the forced image backfired, a warning, perhaps, that to dress against the grain of your character can be as bad as not worrying about dress at all. Lack of sincerity and passion loses votes. More flair was in order. The grey jacket of Dennis Skinner, the Labour MP for Bolsover, has chips woven into the shoulders - but, no matter how unappealing his stubbornly left-wing rhetoric, he scores high in sincerity rankings. So does Jeremy Corbyn, Labour MP for north Islington, who wears sport jackets - often without a tie - and baggy trousers. He shows off his working class conscience by carrying papers in a plastic bag. At the opposite extreme, Richard Ryder, the government's chief whip, is the most pianissimo of statesmen. His suits are anonymous. His mannerisms gentle as he prowls Westminster's corridors. Former prime minister Harold Macmillan would put on his Grenadier guards tie when the government was in trouble. Likewise, Ryder vents his feelings via bright blue, green and red ties. He wears them like warning signs. Red tie at night, Euro-sceptics delight. The boundary between individualism and eccentricity is narrow. 'We are not pop stars. We are serious managers of the country,' says Ann Widdecombe, social security minister, who wears smart-but-practical skirts to visit benefit offices under construction. She would not be so presumptuous as to cite examples. But Nicholas Fairbairn, Tory MP for Perth and Kinross, is famous for his tartan trews - and little else. Eric Forth, education minister, mixes glowing colour ties and handkerchiefs with classic waistcoats but is in danger of undermining his credibility as a minister. People talk about Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby. They talk about his garish ties. At Conservative Central Office, the advice of the communications experts is that politicians should not dress in a way that distracts from what they are saying. But there is a paradox. Too much effort in creating an image can be misspent. 'Sharp changes are not advisable. The important thing is the comfort of the person,' says one senior official. 'The way you dress is an expression of how you see yourself.' He is right. Kenneth Clarke could not be a teddy bear-like rogue of a home secretary if he tightened his belt or swopped his Hush Puppies for shiny black Lobbs. William Waldegrave, public services minister, could not keep up his impression of 'Academic Tortured by the Febrility of Westminster' if his trousers were pressed and the waistband not turned inside out. They are making statements; what they are is more important than the way they dress. So too is Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader and former marine, who  -in spite of his action-man image - dresses from head to toe in Marks and Spencer menswear. His dress sense says he wants off-the-peg respectability without too much effort. For John Smith, Labour's leader, there is no expression of anger or reformist zeal in the sonorous, dark suits he buys from Slaters, the Glasgow tailor favoured by lawyers. But there is a tad of ardour from the floral ties chosen by his fashion student daughter. On the Tory backbenches, among the sea of suits, there are chrysalids of youthful ambition waiting to break out and steal the show. Alan Duncan, suave MP for Rutland and Melton, says MPs 'need to show authority and a little bit of wit'. He recommends a tailored suit (four buttons per sleeve); silk ties (small motif), cotton shirts (double cuff, not white) and good shoes (tassels permitted). It sounds wizard advice. But he has yet to get a government job. A better guide would, perhaps, be more general. Politicians need to dress according to their personality but without being fastidious. Dress is both important and not important: there are limits - the need to look respectable, to inspire confidence - but the politician's character needs to shine through, to shout for attention. Yet, as if to prove there will always be exceptions, there is John Major. He lacks even a smidgen of wit in his dress, and he avoids individualism. In his accountants' suits and pale shirts, the prime minister would be lost on a commuter train. What is his message? Respect but ordinariness, a man of the people, perhaps. He has made it to the top yet is still - not quite - seen as a natural leader. In his dress, there is no aggression or dash. He is the Cabbage Grey that sucks the best nectar.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat proposals sent GREYCOAT, the property company that last week recommended a rescue refinancing led by the UK Active Value Fund, yesterday posted share and bond holders a document outlining the proposal. The document included valuations for the three main Greycoat properties, Embankment Place, Britannic House and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, that show slightly higher yields than might be expected for investment quality properties. Unlike with the Postel proposal which was rejected by investors in October, the new deal spells out the individual property values. Britannic House is valued at Pounds 128.5m, up from Pounds 118.5m in March or Pounds 105.5m as it was valued on a forced sale basis in July. This corresponds to a 7.5 per cent yield, only slightly higher than market rates for investment grade properties. Embankment House is valued at Pounds 184.25m, up from Pounds 174m in March, representing a 8.2 per cent yield as the lease is still being ironed out.</p>

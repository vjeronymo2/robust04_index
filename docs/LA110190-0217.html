			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> PIERSIDE ACTION OFF COUNCIL AGENDA  </P> <P> Pierside Village has been withdrawn from the agenda for Monday's meeting of the  City Council.  </P> <P> Mayor Thomas J. Mays said Wednesday that the item was withdrawn because of  legal considerations.  </P> <P> The mayor said he was informed by the city attorney's office that state law  requires Planning Commission action before transfer of land to a Redevelopment  Agency. Thus, Mays said, the proposed action on the agenda would not be legal.  </P> <P> The council majority had initially proposed transferring the 3.5 acres of  beach-bluff land proposed for Pierside Village from city ownership to ownership  by the Redevelopment Agency, which is an arm of the state. Such a move would  have sheltered the Pierside land from Measure C, a citizens' initiative that is  on Tuesday's ballot.  </P> <P> Measure C, if passed, would prohibit the city's selling or leasing park or  beach land without a citywide vote. Supporters of the initiative have said that  a key goal is to try to block the city from building Pierside Village.  </P> <P> Pierside Village calls for construction of at least two new commercial  restaurants on paved land abutting the beach at the municipal pier.  Reconstruction of the existing Maxwell's Restaurant would be part of the  project.  </P> <P> Debbie Cook, spokeswoman for Save Our Parks, the group that is spearheading  Measure C, said Wednesday that residents from all over Huntington Beach had  been calling her to express anger about the council's scheduling last-minute  action on Pierside Village. "I'm relieved it's now off the agenda, but it makes  you wonder about what kind of people would try to do something like this," Cook  said.  </P> <P> "They (members of the council majority) only took it off because of legal  advice. They still don't care how the people feel about this project." BILL  BILLITER  </P></p>

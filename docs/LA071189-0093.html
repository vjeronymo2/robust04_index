			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 13 CARIBBEAN STATES OK PROPOSAL FOR ECONOMIC UNION  </P> <P> After decades of disharmony and jealous squabbling, leaders of the 13 countries  of the English-speaking Caribbean -- mostly microstates smaller than the  average American county -- have adopted an ambitious plan for economic union  that will brace their economies against the damaging side effects they expect  when trade barriers go down in Europe in 1992.  </P> <P> Until their just-concluded summit meeting in Grenada, the pace toward unity  among the members of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom) had  been slower than the migration of sea turtles that breed on some of their  beaches.  </P> <P> "But now, we are looking at what is happening in Europe and realizing that we  are foolish to think that we as small countries can go along on our own when  even large countries are realizing that they have to get together much closer,"  said Prime Minister Mary Eugenia Charles of Dominica, a banana-growing island  of 82,000 in the Windwards chain.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Historically Languorous  </P> <P> According to Charles and other Caricom heads of state who concluded a week of  anxious summit talks here last week, the threat of what will happen to their  own tiny and fragile economies when Western Europe forms a single trading  market in 1992 has finally forced the historically languorous Caribbean  countries to accelerate their pace toward economic integration.  </P> <P> "We have to get down to the nitty-gritty now," said Prime Minister Michael  Manley of Jamaica, Caricom's largest member, "because 1992 is just around the  corner."  </P> <P> The free European market could have disastrous consequences for the former  colonial possessions, which have enjoyed special trade protection on many  exports -- mainly bananas, sugar and rum.  </P> <P> England, for example, buys two-thirds of its bananas from Caricom producers who  could not otherwise compete with cheaper and better-looking fruit from Central  America and elsewhere. Unless special exceptions are made for them, the  Caribbean countries will lose in free market competition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vulnerable Economy  </P> <P> "If the market 'went' suddenly in bananas, Dominica simply wouldn't be,"  lamented Charles, who has been one of the leading proponents of both economic  and political integration in the Caribbean.  </P> <P> To forestall such a piecemeal battering of the tiny states -- whose populations  range from only 11,000 in the smallest, Montserrat, to a city-sized 2.3 million  in the largest, Jamaica -- the Caricom heads of state agreed upon a series of  steps toward economic integration that they hope will allow them to speak in a  single strong voice.  </P> <P> "With the single market in Europe coming into effect, with the United  States-Canada single market arrangement and ultimately the Pacific Rim," said  Deputy Prime Minister Lester Bird of Antigua, "I think it came clear to the  heads of government that unless the Caribbean integrates its market and becomes  a single market, then we are going to be marginalized and pushed aside."  </P> <P> Among other moves, the leaders agreed to level their varied and often  restrictive import tariffs, move quickly toward customs cooperation and  eventual union and remove all other existing barriers to trade by July, 1991.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unifying Stock Markets  </P> <P> They also adopted a plan to unify the region's three stock exchanges -- in  Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago -- with the eventual hope of creating  a single Caricom stock market and a free flow of capital among the 13  countries.  </P> <P> Air and sea transportation among the hard-to-reach countries -- all but two of  them islands dotted across tens of thousands of square miles -- would be  coordinated by 1992, and the requirement for passports and work permits among  Caricom citizens would be dropped.  </P> <P> The heads of government also agreed to establish an assembly of Caricom members  of parliament as a small step toward creating a sense of cultural and political  unity among their historically insular peoples. But they are wary of taking any  direct steps, such as a call for an island-by-island referendum, toward  political union.  </P> <P> "It's still very early days for that," said Manley, the only survivor among the  four heads of government -- from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and  Guyana -- who founded Caricom on Aug. 1, 1973. The four founding countries were  later jointed by Antigua, the Bahamas, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat,  St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  </P> <P> Manley spearheaded several initiatives in the Grenada summit, including a  unanimous call for a U.N.-supervised international organization to combat drugs  and an international criminal court to prosecute major drug offenders. He said  he was elated that the leaders moved as far as they did toward economic  integration.  </P> <P> "For the last 10 years, the idea just collapsed," Manley said. "Everybody was  so crisis-ridden by the debt problem, the oil-price problem, the terrible  recession of the early 1980s, that all of the intellectual energy was absorbed  in individual questions like 'Can the (U.S.) Caribbean Basin Initiative save  us?' "  </P> <P> "It will take a long time before political unity," agreed Charles, the region's  only female head of state. "But at last there's a real desire to get economic  unity going."  </P></p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Yeltsin warning to Chechnya Russia yesterday sharply raised the stakes in the civil war in the North Caucasian republic of Chechnya by threatening to use 'every means' to quell the conflict if the republic's government did not disband its forces, hand over all weapons and release Russian prisoners. President Boris Yeltsin said the hope of an independent solution had been exhausted. He gave the Chechen authorities until 6am tomorrow to comply with the conditions. President Dzhokar Dudayev of Chechnya - who has claimed independence since the end of 1991 - said that the conflict which brought opposition forces to the doors of his palace in the capital, Grozny, on Sunday had been quelled. He said no 'repressive action' would be taken against the Russian soldiers captured in the fighting - which Chechen sources put at 70 but which independent sources say number no more than about 12. The Chechen authorities have claimed that Russia is supplying weapons and men to the opposition forces, one of whose leaders is Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, former speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet until its suppression by President Yeltsin last October.</p>

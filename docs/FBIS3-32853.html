Martin Faz from the National Network of Civilian  Organizations All Rights for All [Red Nacional de Organismos  Civiles Todos los Derechos para Todos] assured at a news  conference that Severino, Sebastian, and Hermelindo Santiz were  arrested by the Army on 7 January in Altamirano, one of the  municipalities taken over by guerrillas. Since then, they had  been reported as missing.    Faz said ONG members today found the "remains, bones,  clothing, and footware, allowing us to assure that they  correspond to the people who were reported as missing."  According to Faz, reports from residents of Morelia in  Altamirano municipality indicate that the three people were  "arbitrarily arrested by some Mexican Army soldiers on 7  January." Fax added that "there is no doubt" that the remains  correspond to those three people; a relative has identified the  clothing and a "dental bridge" that belonged to one of the  missing.    Thomas Craine, a member of the organization Medical Doctors  for Human Rights [Medicos por los Derechos Humanos] that  participated in the search, said, "We did not find evidence of  the cause of death, but we have asked for a completed forensic  and anthropological investigation." Craine said the remains  have been turned over to the Attorney General's Office and the  National Commission for Human Rights which had initiated earlier  investigations.    The Mexican Army's conduct during the Indian armed rebellion  has been criticized by the ONG for engaging in extreme actions,  such as secret executions and arbitrary arrests.</p>

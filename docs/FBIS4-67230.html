			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from column prepared by Olga Saprynina, V. </F> Vishnevskiy, A. Maksyuk, V. Aloyan, V. Lebedev, and D. Babich:  "Tanks on the Move in Alma-Ata?"]    [Text] In addition to the bemedaled veterans, armed  military details were to be encountered at all Alma-Ata's  [Almaty's] intersections on Victory Day. An unpublicized state  of emergency has been introduced in the Kazakhstani capital.  Rumor has it that this was due to an attack on Bulat Abilov,  president of the Kazakhstani firm Butya. According to other  information, the reason was the escape of two convicts. The MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] attributes it to the complex  crime situation in Kazakhstan.    A city crime-fighting staff has been formed in Alma-Ata. It  will operate until the capital of Kazakhstan becomes a safe  city. All hotels, hostels, and suspect apartments are being  checked over. In the last two days alone 11 kg of opium worth  around $55,000 have been confiscated. All urban transport  routes have begun to be "processed" as of yesterday.</p>

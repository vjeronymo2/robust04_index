			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Argentina pursues sale of privatised utilities ARGENTINA intends to begin a new round of flotations of privatised companies in November with the sale of its minority stakes in two Buenos Aires electricity generators. Mr Daniel Marx, the government's top financial negotiator, said yesterday the sale of 30 per cent stakes in the Costanera and Central Puerto power stations should raise about Dollars 100m for the government. The announcement follows the successful Dollars 3.04bn international flotation in June of 45 per cent of YPF, the state-owned oil company. Mr Marx said the electricity flotations would open the way for the sale next year of minority government stakes in the larger gas transport and distribution companies. The sale of three Buenos Aires electricity distribution companies and other generators would come later. Central Puerto, with 1,009MW capacity, and Costanera, a 1,260MW station, were privatised in April and May last year. Chilgener of Chile paid Dollars 92.2m for 60 per cent of Central Puerto, and Endesa, also of Chile, paid Dollars 90.1m for 60 per cent of Costanera. Mr Marx said the two were 'extremely well-run and we think are mature and can be floated without any problem'. He said these companies, given their relatively small size, would be aimed mainly at local investors. The flotation would be handled by local banks. The remaining 10 per cent equity will be held by company employees in a share ownership scheme. Next year the government plans to sell its minority stakes in 10 gas transport and distribution companies carved out of the former state-owned gas monopoly. Gas del Estado was privatised last December in a Dollars 3.99bn cash and debt-for-equity swap for stakes ranging from 60 to 90 per cent. Mr Marx said the sale of government stakes in the electricity distribution companies would come last.</p>

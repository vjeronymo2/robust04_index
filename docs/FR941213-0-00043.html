Comments and Responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received comments from 21 commenters on the proposed discharge planning provision, including a number of favorable comments. The commenters consisted of hospitals, advocacy groups, local and State government agencies, individuals, provider and supplier associations, and a medical equipment supplier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter disagreed with our limiting the new condition of participation to Medicare patients only. He believed we should extend coverage to all patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. We believe it is a good management practice for hospitals to assure continuity of care for all patients, and we recognize that most hospitals achieve this result through discharge planning. In this regard, we note that the JCAHO, which accredits approximately 6000 hospitals, has a discharge planning requirement that applies to all patients and that is, in our view, even more comprehensive than the one required under the law and these regulations. The practical effect of the JCAHO requirement is that discharge planning does apply to all patients in the vast majority of the nation's hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on our further review of the issue raised by this commenter, we now believe that the requirements in this regulation, which will be applied in the approximately 1500 hospitals not accredited by the JCAHO, should be applied to all patients who need them. Accordingly, under the authority contained in section 1861(e)(9) and 1861(ee)(1), we are expanding the applicability of the discharge planning requirements to all hospital patients who require it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several reasons why we believe it is appropriate to expand the discharge planning requirement to all patients. First, expanding the requirement to all patients is consistent with the requirements set forth in current &sect;482.21, which has been in place since June 17, 1986 (51 FR 22042). Section 482.21(b) includes a discharge planning requirement that applies to all patients, Moreover, the commenter's suggestion also is consistent with our long-standing position that the Secretary's responsibility under section 1861(e)(9) of the Act to promulgate health and safety requirements for hospitals applies to all patients. Rather than limiting the Secretary's responsibilities to Medicare beneficiaries, section 1861(e)(9) refers to the ``health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution.'' Thus, the statute supports our decision to require that the new discharge planning procedures be applicable, as the old procedures were, to all of a hospital's patients. Clearly, adequate discharge planning is essential to the health and safety of all patients. It is not just the Medicare patient that may suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge without the benefit of appropriate planning. Such planning is vital to mapping a course of treatment aimed at minimizing the likelihood of having any patient rehospitalized for the reasons that prompted the initial hospital stay. To this extent, all of the elements of the discharge planning process that Congress has made explicitly applicable to Medicare beneficiaries are of equal value to all hospital patients in the interests of their health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, expanding the scope of the discharge planning provisions would parallel current JCAHO and AOA requirements, which also apply to all patients. We do not believe that it is administratively feasible to separate Medicare and other patients for discharge planning purposes. Furthermore, such a separation of Medicare and other patients for discharge planning purposes might have the adverse affect of fostering a dual level of care system for Medicare and other patients. The discriminatory aspects of such a situation would be neither desirable nor supportable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, we do not believe that the cost of expanding the application of the requirement is significant. There will be no expense in the approximately 6000 hospitals accredited by the JCAHO. Moreover, in the approximately 1500 hospitals directly subject to the requirement, the marginal impact on hospital staffing is likely to be relatively small. Since our current hospital conditions of participation already require discharge planning, hospital staff must already be employed to carry out this function. We believe that the new discharge planning provisions impose only a minimal additional workload on these staff, and applying these requirements to all patients, rather than just to Medicare beneficiaries, will not have a significant incremental impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters explicitly suggested and many others implicitly suggested that we require written policies and procedures for the discharge planning process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree and are revising proposed &sect;482.43 to require the hospital to commit its discharge planning policies and procedures to writing. This requirement will help assure that the process is well thought out, clear, comprehensive and understood by all staff. It will also assist in monitoring the process. We believe most hospitals already have written discharge planning policies and procedures and will have little or no difficulty in complying with this requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Edgars earnings advance 25% Attributable earnings at Edgars, the South African retail clothing group, grew 25 per cent for the six months to the end of September to R125.6m (Dollars 35.8m) from R110.3m for the same period last year. Sales rose 16 per cent to R1.92bn from R1.65bn, an improvement due largely to the successful launch of new credit lines to consumers. Trading profit rose 15 per cent to R235.6m from R204.2m, while financing costs dropped slightly to R27.5m from R28.2m. All the group's divisions performed well, with flagship Edgars contributing the bulk of sales. These improved 15 per cent, to R1.27bn from the R1.1bn reported last year. Jet, which is targeted at the lower end of the market, had a very good half, raising sales by 30 per cent to R236.3m from R181.4m. Sales House, the group's other leading division, raised sales 12 per cent to R385.3m from R342.5m. The group attributed the good results to the improved economic climate after the elections in April, and predicted that sales and profits for the full year would be broadly in line with the interim results. The interim dividend was raised 24 per cent to 56 cents, but the group announced that this would be made in the form of a capitalisation share award unless shareholders requested cash.</p>

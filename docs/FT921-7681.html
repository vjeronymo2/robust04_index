			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Hatton case sent to Welsh crown court MR DEREK HATTON, former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, and six others have been sent to crown court on charges of conspiracy to defraud the council. The case against Mr Hatton and his co-defendants was switched from Liverpool City Magistrates Court to Mold Crown Court in north Wales. Papers have been served on lawyers for the seven by the Crown Prosecution Service for a transfer under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1987. This process, used only in serious fraud trials, allows a case to be transferred to the higher court without a formal committal hearing before magistrates. No date has yet been fixed for the first appearance at Mold. Mr Hatton, of Childwall, Liverpool, faces eight charges of conspiracy to defraud the council relating to periods during and after his time in office. Two other former Labour councillors have been charged with conspiracy. Ms Hannah Folan, of Liverpool, faces four counts and Mr John Nelson, of Liverpool, faces five. Mr Hatton's tailor, Mr John Monk, of Liverpool, faces two conspiracy counts, and builder Mr Roy Stewart, of Woolton, Liverpool, faces one charge. Businessmen Mr James Mutch, of Aughton, Lancashire, and Mr Michael Hanlon, of Blundellsands, Crosby, Merseyside, face three conspiracy charges each.</p>

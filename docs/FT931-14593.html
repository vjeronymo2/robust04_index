			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Venture capital fund for Ukraine A venture capital fund, with private investments and a Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2.3m) contribution from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is being established in Ukraine, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. Mr George Yurchyshyn, a former senior vice president of the Bank of Boston who is now based in Kiev as director of the fund, is optimistic the fund will reach its target of Dollars 10m within the next few months and says there may be enough investor interest to establish a second fund. He expects the fund to give a return on investments within seven to 10 years. The fund will make small investments in a variety of private businesses with proven track records, rather than in start-up projects. All its investments are made in hard currency and Ukrainian foreign investment law allows the fund to convert coupon profits back into dollars.</p>

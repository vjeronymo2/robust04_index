			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Observer: WilTel, won't tell Travellers along the information superhighway must still watch out for the potholes. When LDDS, a US long-distance telephone company, announced its Dollars 2.5bn acquisition of WilTel, an advanced fibre-optic operator, reporters keen to learn more about the deal were given a toll-free number to join in a telephone conference-call hosted with WilTel's big cheese. But the first call to the assigned number went unanswered. On redialling, it produced an engaged tone. After that, nothing. When the conference call finally started, there was not enough room for everyone who wanted to join in. Those left out were given the option of either listening to a replay of the conference later in the afternoon - too late for most newspaper deadlines - or waiting for a faxed transcript the next day. Oh bright dawn of a new age.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Shanghai strengthens its state-owned </F> enterprises"]    [Text] Following General Secretary Jiang Zemin's  instructions on "making even greater efforts from now on to  improve large and medium state-owned enterprises," the Shanghai  Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have regarded  the improvement of state-owned industrial enterprises as the  major basis for Shanghai's development and have stepped up the  reform and structural readjustmens of state-owned industrial  enterprises, made them increase their sales income, profit  delivery and tax payment, and foreign exchange earnings year by  year. As a result, the state- owned industrial enterprises are  continuing to play a dominant and backbone role in Shanghai's  industry and economy.    According to statistics, the total sales value of Shanghai's  state-owned enterprises rose year after year -- 15.7 percent in  1991, 10.9 percent in 1992, and 2.3 percent in 1993, as compared  with the year before. The 1993 sales income amounted to 158.3  billion yuan, accounting for 56.6 percent of the total sales  income of Shanghai's independent-accounting industrial  enterprises. In the three years, the total amount of profit  delivery and tax payment made by state-owned  independent-accounting industrial enterprises rose 15.7 percent  in 1991, 1.7 percent in 1992, and 12.9 percent in 1993, over the  previous year. In 1993, their profit delivery and tax payment  totalled 21.1 billion yuan, accounting for 55 percent of the  total amount made by Shanghai's independent-accounting  industrial enterprises. In 1993, the state-owned industrial  enterprises covered in local budget earned $2,196 million in  foreign exchange from export trade, and their earnings accounted  for 29.5 percent of Shanghai's total foreign exchange earnings  in the year.    Shanghai has enhanced the overall strength of its  state-owned  industrial enterprises mainly because of its efforts in  deepening reforms and changing the operational mechanisms of  enterprises. At present, most of Shanghai's state-owned  industrial enterprises have been given the decisionmaking power  in operation. The ratio of mandatory plans has dropped to 2.4  percent in Shanghai. The number of products subject to price  control by the municipal government has been reduced to seven.  The state-owned industrial enterprises have made great efforts  to open up market with the development of products of high  marketability, quality, and economic returns. In 1993, the  sales rate of their products exceeded 98 percent. In the  meantime, new internal operational mechanisms are taking shape  within enterprises. The labor contract system, operating and  marketing mechanism, development mechanism, and motivational  mechanism have been gradually set up, and the local accounting  system is converging with the international accounting practice.  As of the end of 1993, the 1,118 state-owned industrial  enterprises covered in local budget were practicing the labor  contract system for full-time workers, as well as the job post  contract system [shang gang he tong zhi 0006 1511 0678 0681  0455]. These systems, concerning 1.49 million workers and staff  members, have helped reduce surplus personnel, widen the wage  difference, and arouse the enthusiasm among workers and staff  members. The number of marketing personnel in state-owned  enterprises have generally increased, and they now account for 2  to 3 percent of the total number of workers and staff members. A  sales contract system has been implemented. In Shanghai, 147  enterprises (involving 1,108 factories) have been given the  import-export trade authority. In 1993, the foreign exchange  earnings from their export trade totaled $835 million, up 38  percent from 1992.    In recent years, Shanghai's state-owned industrial  enterprises have accelerated the shift from an adaptive  structural readjustment to a strategic structural readjustment.  They have invested more than 50 billion yuan in technological  transformation focusing on a number of key projects, and have  imported advanced technology and equipment. As a result, more  than 1,400 old state-owned enterprises have greatly improved  their products, technology and equipment, so that their  technological level remains higher than other industrial  enterprises in Shanghai. Shanghai has accelerated the  development of a number of new pillar industries and  technologies, based on state-owned industrial enterprises. In  1993, the total sales volume of six pillar industries -- iron  and steel, automobile, telecommunications equipment, power  station equipment, petrochemical, and household electric  appliances -- amounted to 106.9 billion yuan, accounting for 33  percent of Shanghai's total industrial sales value.    In recent years, a number of Shanghai's state-owned  industrial enterprises, using foreign capital and local private  funds, have run joint ventures or turned themselves into limited  liability joint-stock companies. In 1993, the total sales  income of those joint ventures and limited liability companies  whose shares are under state control was 236.7 billion yuan,  accounting for 84 percent of Shanghai's total industrial sales  income; and the total amount of their profit delivery and tax  payment was 32.8 billion yuan, accounting for 84 percent of the  total profit delivery and tax payment made by all industrial  enterprises in Shanghai.    Many of Shanghai's state-owned industrial enterprises are  old  enterprises with old factory buildings, old equipment, and old  products. During the course of shifting to socialist market  economic structure, their efforts to improve economic efficiency  are impeded by their economic setup, industrial structure, and  internal weakness. This is why some state-owned industrial  enterprises are having difficulties and a small number of them  are operating in deficits, while other state-owned industrial  enterprises continue to play a dominant role in economy. To  deal with the problem, the municipal party committee and the  municipal government, acting in accordance with General  Secretary Jiang Zemin's instructions on "having a new concept of  development and truly switching onto the track of enhancing  economic efficiency," are continuing to deepen reforms, adopt  effective measures, and strive to make all Shanghai's  state-owned enterprises operate successfully.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CARPET PULLS RUG OUT FROM LIBRARY PLANS  </P> <P> The reopening of the Garden Grove Regional Library, closed since December for  refurbishing, has been delayed once again until early or mid-June because of  another remodeling snafu.  </P> <P> This time, it's a carpet that doesn't match.  </P> <P> The library was closed Dec. 11 by the county for a periodic face lift and was  supposed to reopen Feb. 13, said Gary C. Gray, chief of facilities and  construction for the county's General Services Agency. Other complications  delayed the reopening until March 26, but when a new carpet arrived in early  March, portions of it did not match in color.  </P> <P> "You'd have to be blind to not see it," Gray said.  </P></p>

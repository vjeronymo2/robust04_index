			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Personal communicator set for launch AN international consortium including AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, and Matsushita of Japan, the world's leading consumer electronics company, is poised to win the race to launch the first 'personal communicator' - a combined pocket telephone and personal computer. The consortium, also including Marubeni, the large Japanese trading house, and EO, a Californian computer designer, will today announce a partnership to market a family of portable communicators combining voice telephony, electronic mail, facsimile and a personal word processor accepting handwritten input. Development work is complete and the first of the devices is expected to be announced by the end of the year. The first personal communicators will probably cost as much as a notebook computer - about Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 580) - but prices are expected to fall sharply as sales volumes grow. Mr Alain Rossman, chief executive of EO, said: 'Personal communicators integrate telephony, messaging and computing to create a compelling new device which will have as much impact on person-to-person communications as the telephone had in the early 1900s.' The consortium is in talks with a potential European partner with a view to strengthening its marketing position. It is the latest example of a growing number of cross-industry and global alliances being formed as advances in technology start to erode the boundaries between the computer, consumer electronics and telecommunications industries. It is understood that the partners have subscribed a total of Dollars 38m to bring the devices to market. Personal communicators are examples of a new class of portable devices, combining the power of personal computers and the communications capabilities of cellular telephones.</p>

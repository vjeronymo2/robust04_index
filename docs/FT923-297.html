			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (5): Earth first - and humans second THE WAY: AN ECOLOGICAL WORLD VIEW by Edward Goldsmith Rider Pounds 12.99, 442 pages NATURE'S WEBB: AN EXPLORATION OFECOLOGICAL THINKING by Peter Marshall Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 9.99, 502 pages HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH? by Alan Durning Earthscan Pounds 8.95, 128 pages TEDDY GOLDSMITH'S book is readable only if you share certain beliefs with him. First, that 'if current trends persist, the planet will cease to be capable of supporting complex forms of life'. Second, that science, economic growth and individualism are undesirable. Third, that these messages are so important that they justify considerable repetition. Goldsmith, brother of financier James, has found inspiration in the 'Gaia' philosophies of the maverick British scientist James Lovelock. According to Gaia, the planet and its oceans, rocks and life, form a unifed system which regulates the conditions that sustain life. Goldsmith maintains that 'there is thus a single law which governs the behaviour of the whole cosmic hierarchy'. He adds 'our modern society has quite clearly set out systematically to deviate from the Way' - the path that allows this stability. Goldsmith's 66 chapters, which assert principles such as 'Ecology seeks to establish the laws of nature' and 'Gaia is alive', by the end become claustrophobic, defining his philosophy by the things he rejects. He is contemptuous of birth control as an aid to the population problems of the Third World. He dismisses the use of medicine to cure 'individual sufferers' because 'it will always serve the interests of industrialists and their political allies (through pharmaceutical profits) but it will do nothing to reduce the incidence of the disease', which is a symptom of the world's divergence from the Way. This shows little regard for people and less for accuracy - what about smallpox? Peter Marshall also finds a solution to the world's problems in Gaia. A broad though shallow survey of ecological thinking, his book is full of ill-expressed aphorisms such as 'The Indians went down with the the buffalo. Ecocide was followed by genocide.' His technique is to award points to the world's religions, poets, philosophers and scientists for ecological soundness. Thus he compliments Plato for 'anticipating Gaia' in describing the world as a 'living being', but criticises Benedictine monks for dominating nature by 'stealing' honey from bees. When he turns to musing on Gaia he becomes tangled in its incoherence: how to describe a system that regulates its 'organs' to sustain life without personifying the planet - a vocabulary to which he eventually surrenders. He concludes with relief that something bigger than mere humans is looking after the planet's fate and that 'Gaia offers almost a new pagan religion in a secular age'. Guilt as well as fear appears to be the impulse behind How Much is Enough?, one of a series from the environmentally-pessimistic Worldwatch Institute in Washington. Like Goldsmith, Alan Durning believes that economic growth is undesirable, and he is similarly trying to find 'a path of development that does not lead to ruin'. He blames advertising, commercial television and shopping malls for creating 'needs' in people where none existed. He sees the growth of material desire as the corruption of morality: 'Sadly, hard-pressed developing nations sell their ecological souls all too often in the attempt to make ends meet'. Material goods, beyond a basic level, do not make people happy and their production damages the environment. These propositions can be contested, as can his pessimism. He does not distinguish between growth and the environmental damage it produces, which can often be reduced by forethought or regulation, so he has no prescription for reducing that damage except reducing growth. Mistrustful of science, he does not believe it can offer solutions to the expanding population and - as he sees it - fast vanishing resources of the planet. But the past few decades have multiplied the yield of many cereals, and estimates of the planet's reserves of oil and gas have risen eightfold in the past 40 years. Without justifying the reasons for pessimism more solidly, the book seems puritanical in its equation of material desire with guilt. These authors share a longing for a simpler, more spiritual or more innocent life. They are dismissive of other people's desires, which include material goods, and of the ingenuity that people devote to achieving them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gianfranco Fini is once again confronting the  eternal triangle of himself, Silvio Berlusconi, and the other  man, Umberto Bossi, who is continually raising the stakes for a  possible pact. Fini is maintaining his usual calm, even if he  has said that Bossi is not fit to be prime minister. He has  pointed out that although the National Alliance has accepted  decentralization, it will continue to defend Italian unity. He  is awaiting the outcome of the patient tactics of Silvio  Berlusconi, the spinner of webs.    [Begin Fini recording] I believe that at this stage it is up  to Berlusconi, who has obtained the most votes, to set up a  series of meetings. We met this afternoon and discussed the  tremendous election results. We discussed the fact that  Italians have chosen who they want to govern them. I believe  that in the next few days Berlusconi will also meet Bossi, after  which we will meet again. There will certainly be two of us  present -- I do not know if there will be three people at the  meeting. As far as we are concerned, the problems connected  with the Northern League remain the same: We want an absolute  guarantee that Italy remains united and a policy of solidarity  between north and south. [end recording]    [Announcer] Fini warned, however, that without Bossi they  would not have sufficient numbers to form a government.</p>

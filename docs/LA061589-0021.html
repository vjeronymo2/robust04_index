			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Movieline, Los Angeles' free bimonthly film listings and features magazine,  will launch a monthly publication in September with an initial 100,000 copy  run. Hearst-owned Eastern News will handle worldwide distribution. Publisher  Anne Vulokh says the new magazine will focus on providing "the film buff with a  sense of the city where movies are made. Our goal is to be the publication that  reports from the show business front." In addition to the monthly -- which will  have a $2 newsstand price -- Movieline will continue its giveaway (available in  theaters and selected stores) on a weekly basis with emphasis on film listings  and existing columns.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

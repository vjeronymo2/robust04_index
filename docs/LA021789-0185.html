			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRADE DEFICIT DOWN IN '88 -- 1ST ANNUAL DECLINE SINCE CARTER  </P> <P> The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $137.34 billion in 1988, the first annual  decline since 1980, as a surge in exports offset a relentless climb in imports,  the government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said exports shot up to an all-time high of $322.22  billion last year, a dramatic 26.8% above the 1987 level, led by a boom in  sales of U.S.-manufactured products and farm goods. The huge gain in exports  was enough to offset an 8.3% increase in imports, which also rose to a record  level of $459.56 billion.  </P> <P> For December, the trade deficit shrank slightly to $11.9 billion, down from a  revised November figure of $12.2 billion.  </P> <P> However, both November and December represented the highest imbalances between  what the United States imported and what it sold abroad since August.  </P> <P> Analysts are worried that the improvement in America's trading performance has  stalled out. After improving dramatically in the first half of 1988, the  deficit actually began to widen again toward the end of the year.  </P> <P> Reversing that trend and getting further trade improvements is one of the major  economic challenges facing the new Bush Administration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeking Further Reduction  </P> <P> Reacting to the report, the Administration said it is committed to working for  a further reduction in the trade deficit by boosting America's competitiveness  on world markets and shrinking the budget deficit.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the decline "good news. It  does show steady improvement, a trend of improvement." He said the trade  deficit has dropped 22% on a year-to-year basis.  </P> <P> Many analysts say the budget deficit has played a major role in the worsening  trade performance of the 1980s by making America more dependent on foreign  investment.  </P> <P> Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said congressional approval of the Bush  budget, along with a cut in the capital gains tax, would help to further reduce  the trade deficit.  </P> <P> "Reducing the cost of capital, increasing personal saving and promoting  research and development will go a long way to ensure that America wins at home  and in the global marketplace," Mosbacher said in a statement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Down 19.4% From Peak  </P> <P> The $137.3-billion deficit for all of 1988 was down 19.4% from the all-time  high of $170.3 billion set in 1987. It was the first year that the trade  deficit has shown any improvement since it fell 12.5% to $31.4 billion in 1980,  the last year of the Carter Administration.  </P> <P> During the Reagan years, the deficit soared above the $100-billion mark as  Americans' appetite for foreign goods proved insatiable. In 1985, then-Treasury  Secretary James A. Baker III engineered a coordinated effort with major U.S.  allies to devalue the dollar on foreign currency markets in an effort to make  American goods more competitive and imports more expensive.  </P> <P> The strategy has proven successful in boosting exports but has had much less  impact in curbing imports.  </P> <P> Some economists believe that the dollar will have to fall further to see more  improvements in trade. Other analysts, however, worry that steeper declines  could scare off the foreign investors the United States has come to depend on  to finance its borrowing needs and could run the risk of igniting a new  inflationary spiral.  </P></p>

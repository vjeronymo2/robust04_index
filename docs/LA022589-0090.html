			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICES WON'T DROP CASE AGAINST EX-JUDGE  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court has refused to dismiss disciplinary charges against  former Los Angeles Municipal Judge David M. Kennick, saying allegations of  misconduct must still be resolved even though the judge has retired from the  bench.  </P> <P> Kennick's removal had been sought by the state Judicial Performance Commission  on charges that he improperly favored attorney-friends in court appointments  and suggested to a highway patrolman that the officer could drop the  drunk-driving case in which the judge was later convicted.  </P> <P> The justices, in an order filed Thursday, said that when the commission  recommends removal, the court must determine whether such action would be  warranted had the judge not retired -- and, if so, whether Kennick should be  permitted to practice law.  </P> <P> The action followed a series of unusual moves in the case of the 51-year-old  Kennick, who took medical leave from his post in 1987 after serving as a judge  for 15 years.  </P> <P> Last year, after the commission asked for the judge's removal, Kennick informed  the court he had retired irrevocably from the bench and urged that the case be  dropped as moot.  </P> <P> The court then ordered the case dismissed, but hastily reinstated the matter  when the commission objected. The disciplinary process would be frustrated, the  commission argued, if accused judges could evade final resolution of the  charges simply by voluntarily stepping down.  </P> <P> Last December, the court sent a letter to Kennick offering to drop the case if  he agreed not to practice law or again seek judicial office. In reply,  Kennick's attorneys told the justices that if the purpose of the proceedings  was "protection of the public," his retirement from the bench was sufficient  and the case should be dismissed. But he would not voluntarily relinquish his  right to practice law, the attorneys said.  </P> <P> "Any decision ordering disbarment without a hearing on that precise issue, even  if in line with the California Constitution, would result in the denial of  equal protection and due process under the United States Constitution," the  attorneys said in a letter to the court.  </P> <P> In Thursday's one-page order, signed by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, the  court formally denied Kennick's motion to dismiss the proceeding as moot.  </P> <P> The court gave lawyers for both Kennick and the commission until March 17 to  file additional briefs on whether Kennick should be suspended from the practice  of law.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Yekaterina Achalova and Yekaterina Poymenova: </F> "Zyuganov, Anpilov, and Rutskoy Are Prepared To Be President"]    [Text] A review of the forces of the Russian  opposition was conducted last weekend. The Communist Party of  the Russian Federation held an all-Union party conference, the  Working Russia movement, a congress, and the National Salvation  Front, a session of the National Council. While having  unanimously rejected the Social Accord Treaty offered by Boris  Yeltsin, the opposition parties and movements were unable to  achieve unity concerning a possible candidate at the future  presidential elections.    The most likely candidate of the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation for the office of president will be, by all  accounts, its present chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov. Zyuganov was  successful at the conference in warding off all attacks of the  intra-party opposition demanding that the leadership of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation adopt a stricter  dogmatic position. The delegates supported by a huge majority  the party's program propositions offered by Gennadiy Zyuganov,  which were sustained in a statist style, which will undoubtedly  improve relations between the communists and the patriots.    A far more complex problem for the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation are relations with other parties and  movements cleaving to positions of dogmatic communism.  Addressing the congress of the Working Russia movement, its  leader, Viktor Anpilov, accused Zyuganov of class collaboration  with the "Yeltsin regime" and declared that the present leader  of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation is "an even  bigger traitor than Gorbachev." The orthodox named as their  possible candidates for the office of president Vasiliy  Starodubtsev, Oleg Shein, Sazha Umalatova, Aman Tuleyev, and  Viktor Anpilov. The delegates were of the unanimous opinion here  that the main task of a president they elected should be  abolition of the presidency and the restoration of Soviet power  in full. Only Ilya Konstantinov, leader of the National  Salvation Front, intends as yet, it would seem, to support  Aleksandr Rutskoy, the former opposition president. But such  support is hardly likely to increase Rutskoy's chances of  success at the future presidential elections. As the session of  the National Salvation Front National Council showed, this  opposition organization has now virtually ceased to exist and  unites only a few political chiefs. A large part of the regional  organizations, on the other hand, has joined Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's party.</p>

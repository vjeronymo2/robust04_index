			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Concern over pension fund property investment returns SOME UK pension fund managers may be overstating their returns on property investments, the head of a leading performance measurement firm said yesterday. Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Combined Actuarial Performance Services, said that pension fund performance returns suggested that 'there is a problem there'. The CAPS service, which surveyed 2,760 separate portfolios with a market value of Pounds 156bn, showed a great disparity between the weighted average returns on property and the median performance. The numbers showed that while the median return was 3.8 per cent - the lowest of any asset category in 1991 - returns giving greater weight to larger funds showed returns of -2.8 per cent. Mr Clamp said that most of the larger funds sought formal valuations of their property holdings annually, but he believed smaller funds were not doing so. 'We have those who quite literally produce back-of-the-envelope calculations,' Mr Clamp said. Thus the inflated returns from smaller managers have distorted the picture of average returns. Separately, CAPS noted a number of significant shifts in pension fund investment last year. First, funds are increasing their exposure to overseas equities, with the average fund raising exposure to 23.8 per cent from 20.2 per cent in 1990. The best performing sectors were Pacific Basin stocks, excluding Japan, and US equities. The two produced returns of 35.1 per cent and 32.3 per cent respectively. Overall, median rates of return were 18.3 per cent, inclusive of property. Also, the trend towards indexation appears to be slowing, although on average, UK indexed funds outperformed the index they tracked by a significant margin. Tracking error is much narrower among managers using index-matching for their overseas portfolios.</p>

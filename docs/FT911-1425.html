			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Walking the plank at Allied-Lyons FT-SE Index: 2,522.7 (-8.0) Allied-Lyons' remarkable letter to shareholders shows why the company was initially so unwilling to elaborate the bare facts of its foreign exchange fiasco. It is now apparent this was the corporate equivalent of the Hammersmith and Fulham swaps debacle. Such has been the damage to Allied's reputation that it clearly had no alternative to telling all and re-shuffling the board. The fact that an internal inquiry in the summer of last year failed to spot any irregularities is the best measure of the inadequacy of its financial controls. Small wonder the chairman and chief executive felt it appropriate to step aside. One could ask what took them so long. In coming so clean, Allied may have been too frank for its own good: the immediate challenge will be to knock takeover speculation on its head. That aside - and it might have been more quickly achieved by bringing in an outsider or two - the biggest strategic question mark hangs over the group's brewing operations. Commercial logic says Allied should dispose of its brewing assets and concentrate on exploiting its retailing muscle. The new management team, with its retailing background, might be so inclined. The problem is that if it waits too long, the breweries will fetch much less than today's value of up to Pounds 400m. The other nettle is already giving rival Bass plenty of pain. Allied must find a solution to the inefficiencies of its clutch of regionally managed brands. The recent failure to pull off this trick in the catering division is a measure of the challenge. The real irony of the last few months is that Allied's shares are better under-pinned than at any time since Hoylake bid for BAT in July two years ago. It remains to be seen what Allied will do by way of a dividend policy, but profits should bounce towards Pounds 700m in 1992, which puts the shares on a reasonable prospective rating of around 12. Investors who think the new management will pass its test might see this as a good time to jump aboard; for if it fails, the rewards could be even greater.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Camco turns in Pounds 20.6m Camco International, which until December 9 last year was a wholly owned US subsidiary of Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, yesterday published its results for the year to end-December. Because the figures were prepared under US accounting rules they are not directly comparable, but will account for some Pounds 20.6m of Pear-son's operating profits when it announces its 1993 re-sults on March 28 this year. Camco now has a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

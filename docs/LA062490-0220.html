			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: TRULY HAPPY DAYS  </P> <P> The real happy days were before America discovered the Fonz.  </P> <P> They were during the first season of Happy Days. Before the series became "The  Fonzie Show," with these typical plot lines: Fonzie conquers Suicide Hill,  Fonzie goes blind, Fonzie saves the world from nuclear destruction.  </P> <P> Before the live studio audience went berserk whenever the Fonz (Henry Winkler)  entered the set. And before "Aaaaay" became part of the language of TV  watchers.  </P> <P> Those who have forgotten what a sweet, mellow show it was will have a chance to  rediscover the earlier "Happy Days" this week, when the series starts all over  again on KTLA. The first episode airs Saturday at noon; the second follows.  </P> <P> The first episodes showed the Cunningham familyat its '50s best: unliberated  mother, Marion (Marion Ross); small-business owner dad, Howard (Tom Bosley);  typical teen-ager, Richie (Ron Howard), and smart-mouth daughter, Joanie (Erin  Moran).  </P> <P> Those fans who stuck through all 10 years of the series will want to watch its  finale (Sunday at noon), a two-parter that brings back Richie (who had left the  series four years earlier), Al, Jenny Piccalo and Lori Beth.  </P> <P> (One person you won't see in that final show is Richie's big brother, the  not-too-bright, basketball-playing Chuck, who disappeared from the show in 1975  and was never heard from again.)  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CHINA PROTESTS U.S. SANCTIONS  </P> <P> China lodged "a strong protest" against the Bush Administration and Congress  today for imposing economic and military sanctions in response to the crushing  of pro-democracy demonstrations last year.  </P> <P> Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu delivered the toughly worded protest to  James Lilley, the U.S. ambassador to Beijing, the official New China News  Agency said.  </P> <P> "I am instructed to express our utmost indignation and lodge a strong protest  with the U.S. government against the hegemonistic (aggressive) act of the U.S.  Congress," Liu said.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is responsible for "the unbridled anti-China waves  stirred up by the U.S. Congress," he charged.  </P> <P> While China has aimed its previous attacks at the Congress over the sanctions  issue, the latest protest was also clearly directed at the White House.  </P> <P> President Bush, who signed the long-stalled sanctions bill this week after  modifying it in the face of a hostile Congress, was not mentioned by name in  the Chinese protest.  </P></p>

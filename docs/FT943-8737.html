			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Unfinished business of the Uruguay Round - Gatt negotiations on four key services sectors have quietly restarted Trade negotiators in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks can claim as one of their biggest achievements the writing of a framework of rules which put all services under international fair trade disciplines for the first time. But securing specific commitments to open individual services markets to foreign competition proved a daunting task - so much so that when the Round concluded last December some key sectors were left undone. Largely unnoticed, negotiations on the four unfinished areas - financial services, maritime transport, basic telecommunications and labour movement - have quietly restarted under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. These sectors between them represent perhaps 10 per cent of total cross-border trade in commercial services of more than Dollars 1,000bn last year, and much more when business by foreign subsidiaries is taken into account. For the rapidly-growing sectors of basic telecommunications and financial services in particular, the trading opportunities offered by liberalisation on a global scale would be immense. But these high stakes also guarantee some rough bargaining to come. Basic telecommunications: It became clear early in the Uruguay Round negotiations that there were going to be big problems in securing agreement to open the basic telecommunications sector (mostly voice telephone networks) to foreign companies. This was mainly because in many countries the telephone network is still the exclusive domain of state-owned monopolies. However, all over the world, state telecoms companies are being privatised and/or deregulated and trade officials hope the timing may be right to start bringing down trade barriers on a global scale. The 22 countries involved (the 12 EU countries counting as one) are due to wrap up the talks by April 1996. The obstacles remain formidable. But rapid technological advance and the development of new services (such as multimedia) are forcing the pace of liberalisation almost irrespective of what negotiators discuss in Geneva. Maritime transport: Talks foundered late last year when it became clear that Washington was prepared to offer virtually nothing on ocean shipping. Though the US claims to have a fairly open deep-sea shipping market, the sector is in effect subsidised and protected by a cargo reservation system that requires certain ocean-going freight to be transported by US carriers. Under pressure from Greece and Denmark, the EU took its own modest offer off the table altogether, while Japan curtailed its commitments to cover only access to port services. In the end the US and EU agreed neither would offer anything at that stage, though 32 other nations, including Japan, have done so. The possibly forlorn hope, given the inordinately influential US shipping lobby, is that by June 1996, when the talks are due to end, Washington will be forthcoming enough to persuade Japan and the EU to restore their original offers. Even then many restrictive practices in shipping - such as shipping conferences which tie up routes between operators - would remain in being. Financial services: The US nearly scuppered the entire services negotiations last year when it proposed a two-tier market-access arrangement for financial services that would have discriminated against Japan and some developing countries deemed to have done too little to open their markets. This idea directly contravened the basic most-favoured-nation non-discrimination principle on which the open international trading system is founded and led to threats by trading partners to dilute their own offers or withdraw them altogether. Under a Gatt-brokered compromise, the US agreed to open its financial services market to all-comers for six months after the Uruguay Round comes into force next year, to allow others to improve their offers. If the improvements are not to Washington's liking, it may then refuse MFN access for new market opportunities. These might include the planned lifting of restrictions on interstate banking or any relaxation of the demarcation between investment and deposit banking. Though there is to be a multilateral negotiating group on financial services, which will hold its first meeting in September, this issue is in essence a bilateral argument between the US and Japan and is being discussed in the so-called framework talks intended to prise open Japan's markets. Labour movement: At the instigation primarily of India, Uruguay Round negotiators agreed last December to hold further negotiations on the 'movement of natural persons'. This concerns people moving temporarily abroad to provide services. India, which has a big software industry exporting both computer programmes and software writers, was disappointed that most countries confined liberalisation offers to the transfer of company managers and specialist staff. The negotiations on labour movement are due to end at the same time as the financial services talks, six months after the Uruguay Round comes into force. But it is doubtful whether much will be achieved, since few nations (India included) are keen on encouraging large numbers of foreign workers.</p>

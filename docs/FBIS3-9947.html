Arab  terrorists buy weapons on the Brazilian-Paraguayan border to  perpetrate attacks that jeopardize the peace-seeking process  between Israel and the PLO. This is not just the product of the  imagination of an author. About 15 days ago foreign  intelligence services agents in Foz de Iguacu (Parana) detected  five Arabs, presumably Palestinians from Lebanon, contacting  local weapon traffickers. They wanted to buy plastic  explosives, and AR-15 and FAL rifles.    News of the presence of these Arabs reached Brasilia.  Brazilian intelligence services and Federal Police were placed  on a state of alert. There is fear that an attack like the one  on 17 March 1992 against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires --  which resulted in 29 deaths -- may take place. Brazilian and  foreign intelligence experts are working on the theory that  fundamentalists linked to the Hizballah -- Party of God, a  pro-Iranian organization headquartered in Lebanon -- are trying  to obstruct the peace-seeking plan between Israelis and  Palestinians. An attack would disqualify the PLO as a reliable  interlocutor. Iran and some Arab extremist organizations are  against any sort of agreement between Palestinians and the State  of Israel.    It is believed the five individuals may have entered  Brazilian territory through Argentina or Paraguay, taking  advantage of the Argentine-Brazil-Paraguay border region and,  especially, of the possible logistic support they may have  obtained from members of the important Arab community in the  region.    Federal Police Director Colonel Wilson Romao told ISTOE that  "this is a potentially explosive situation and we are taking the  necessary measures to identify these five individuals and  prevent them from using Brazil as a springboard for  international terrorism." Romao confirmed that since January he  has been receiving reports from the border region on movements  of suspicious members of the local Arab community. Romao said  the terrorist threat is real in Foz de Iguacu. He asserted:  "There are all the necessary facilities there to acquire weapons  and the flights that may be used for terrorist actions."    The existence of links between terrorists and sectors of the  Arab communities in the south of Brazil was established when the  intelligence services discovered that Quarai town in Rio Grande  do Sul was used as a logistic base for the attack in Buenos  Aires. An extremist cell was established here years ago to  collect funds from the Arab communities established in Rio  Grande do Sul and Parana States to finance sabotage operations  against Israeli or Jewish targets in Argentina and Uruguay.  ISTOE found out that weeks before the attack on the Israeli  Embassy in Buenos Aires, the bodies of a Palestinian couple from  Jordan were found inside a vehicle that went over a precipice in  the town of Banhado do Taim (Rio Grande do Sul). The police  found a large quantity of gold bars with the bodies. The case,  at that time, was regarded as an unfortunate story of gold  smuggling. It was even said that the gold belonged to the well-  known dollar trader Najum Turner, who was involved in the  so-called "Uruguay Operation," to cover a loan for Fernando  Collor de Mello's electoral campaign. Turner, who is Jewish,  was allegedly dealing with gold on the black market for Arab  clients unaware that those funds could be used to finance  terrorist operations against Israel.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Baotou-Lanzhou double-track rail laying project,  a key project of the Ministry of Railways in the Eighth  Five-Year Plan period, started construction a few days ago.    The Baotou-Lanzhou railway line is a key railway line  linking  northeast China with north China. The Baotou-Lanzhou  single-track railway lines cannot meet the spiralling  transportation needs resulting from the development of the  national economy, and it is extremely urgent that the railway  lines are expanded and rebuilt into double-track ones.  According to the preliminary designs, the construction on the  Baotou-Shiguai section begins first and will be built in stages.  The first-phase project will be completed by the end of the  Eighth Five-Year Plan period. Upon the completion of the  first-phase project, the transportation capacity can increase to  six pairs of passenger trains and its annual goods  transportation volume will reach 28 million tonnes. Upon the  completion of the entire double-track railway line project, the  passenger train transportation capacity will add to eight pairs  and the annual goods transportation volume will surpass 40  million tonnes. The trains on these lines are drawn by  internal-combustion engines so the driving equipment is  automatically blocked.</p>

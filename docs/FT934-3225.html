			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: CU in demand Some large composite insurers, always boosted by big share price rises, which increase the composites' solvency ratios, were further influenced by a Hoare Govett note on the UK private motor market which favoured Commercial Union. CU shares moved ahead 14 to 629p after Hoare told its clients that within the next three years one of the composites will be compelled to withdraw from the private UK motor market. Hoare analysts plump for Sun Alliance and, to a lesser extent, Guardian Royal Exchange. They expect a similar fate to befall at least one other general insurer. Hoare said CU has the best UK motor insurance portfolio in the sector and 'will prosper more than in the past'. The broker adopted an increasingly bearish stance on Sun Alliance, however, telling clients to switch from Sun, and GRE, into CU. Hoare's recommendation left Sun Alliance one of only a handful of Footsie stocks to lose ground, finishing 2 lighter at 367p.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: McDonald's advances 11% to Dollars 187.4m MCDONALD'S, the world's largest fast food company, reported that its first-quarter net income had risen 11 per cent to Dollars 187.4m, or 51 cents a share, from Dollars 168.5m, or 46 cents, in the 1991 quarter. Worldwide sales increased 9 per cent to Dollars 4.92bn from Dollars 4.53bn in the year-ago period. Its domestic business, in which sales had been growing slowly and profit margins had declined, benefited from price discounting and other promotional programmes, coupled with efforts to reduce development and operating costs. Domestic sales grew by 5 per cent during the first quarter and margins at company-operated restaurants improved to 17.9 per cent of sales, compared with 15.9 per cent a year ago. Sales outside the US continued their fast pace at 14 per cent, in spite of the drag of a stronger dollar. In the first quarter, the company added 50 restaurants, 42 of which were outside the US.</p>

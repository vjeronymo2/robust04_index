Jayaraj] </F>   [Text] Terrorism has developed into epidemic proportion the  world over causing much concern to humanity as it subverts  economic development and progress of nations. Reiteration to  fight this menace rightly came from the visiting Uzbekistan  president, Mr. Islam Karimov, and the prime minister, Mr.  Narasimha Rao, when they addressed a joint press conference in  New Delhi yesterday. The two leaders resolved to fight  terrorism and counter religious fundamentalism for the  well-being of their citizens. They also agreed that the forces  of extremism threaten the democratic and secular fabric of the  two nations.    This is exactly in confirmation with the erstwhile Soviet  policy of supporting India's stand that recourse to violence  leads nowhere and that any problem should be resolved through  peaceful negotiations. As Uzbekistan discarded the totalitarian  ideology and accepted the norms of multiparty system and  diversity of opinion, it is now [willing] to seek meaningful  cooperation with countries having the same perceptions. Mr.  Karimov's three-day stay in the Indian capital as a follow up of  Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit to Tashkent in May last year is a  reassurance for the growing geopolitical relationship between  the two Asian neighbors. During the talks, Mr. Karimov had with  several Indian leaders both the countries came out with renewed  vigor to tackle cross border terrorism and accelerate the pace  of economic ties for mutual benefits.    The six agreements signed between the two leaders on joint  ventures, economic ties, trade, and science and technology are  expressions of the desire for strengthening the traditional good  relations for faster economic progress of the two countries.  Indeed, there is an urgent need to prevent conflicts and work  towards expanding and developing regional and international  cooperation. The first meeting of the Indo-Uzbek Joint  Commission held in July last year and the measures it devised  were efforts towards achieving this goal.    Economic cooperation is not simply for monetary benefits  alone, but it provides a forum for consolidating views on  promoting political stability and world peace. Today, a nation  cannot grow in isolation. History has witnessed the Central  Asian region as a major confluence of cultural and economic  activity. It is hoped that the future will witness creative  interaction between the two Asian neighbors.</p>

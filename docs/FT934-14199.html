			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (1): This time IT has to work - With Cadcam - computer-aided design and manufacturing - reaching new levels of sophistication, the challenge for customers is to find what is right for them rather than pay for what the equipment vendors want them to buy THERE CAN be few markets where the disappointments of the past are so closely matched by the promise for the future as that of the computers and information technology products used in manufacturing. Customers faced with an increasingly complex array of technologies are trying to forget the frustrations of the mid-to-late 1980s - when many of the products they bought simply failed to live up to expectations. Now, in the more straitened circumstances of the 1990s when all capital investments have to be scrutinised closely, especially in the recession-hit engineering sector, advances in technology promise to make real some of the illusory gains of the past. That, at least, is what IT vendors will be hoping to prove at the Computers in Manufacturing Show (CIM '93), which runs from tomorrow until Thursday at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre - under the motto: 'Squeeze harder.' Behind the optimism lies the conviction that their customers have learnt from the past, too. No longer dazzled by technology, manufacturers are learning the hard way that they need a business strategy that is supported and enhanced by IT, rather than vice versa . The state of the current market place is revealed by recent studies, backed up by the views of leading vendors, which show spending on IT continuing to rise even as customers try to achieve value for money. In July, the annual survey by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants of spending on IT suggested it had slipped out of the grip of British managers and might be racing away out of control. It found that spending had risen by 9 per cent last year, bringing the increase in the past three years to nearly 50 per cent. British managers had yet to tackle effectively the problem of how to make the computer work more cheaply for their companies, it said. The Price Waterhouse survey covered all UK businesses and included the public sector, but figures produced by Benchmark for CIM '93 show that spending on IT in the manufacturing sector has also continued to rise. Total spending by manufacturers on computers for manufacturing applications rose from Pounds 1.37bn in 1992-93 to a projected Pounds 1.41bn in the 12 months from this summer, with engineering industries accounting for Pounds 780m and process industries for Pounds 628m. Further research by Benchmark during the summer revealed what Mr John Puttick, European director of manufacturing for PA Consulting Group, sees as a communication gap between IT suppliers and manufacturers that is holding back UK industry. The research showed that manufacturers remained unconvinced and distrustful of the benefits of IT and reverted to manual methods during critical production runs. Some 43 per cent of managers polled still believed that manual methods were more suited to control shopfloor processes and 21 per cent were convinced that manual methods were better for scheduling production. Mr Puttick says manufacturers are 'so caught up in the chaotic world of the factory floor that they are unable to define their problems adequately, let alone explain them to anyone else. Meanwhile, IT suppliers do not fully understand the manufacturing world and are so sales-oriented that they are not focusing on the real problem.' On top of that, manufacturers clearly worry about what the spending on IT has achieved. Mr John Farrant, consultant at IBM Consulting Group, says that over the past 10 years there has been a dramatic increase in the performance of IT systems, with the change from mainframes to personal computers and now workstations, and 'staggering' development in Cadcam technology. 'But over the last couple of years, people have been saying: 'I've invested, I've bought the technology, but I'm not sure it's doing anything for me'.' A few years back, he says, potential purchasers of a new Cad system would be 'literally bedazzled' by the vendor's presentation, and would burst into spontaneous applause. 'But the recession has changed all that. People are saying that they must quantify the benefits of a new investment.' Mr Farrant contrasts the hard-nosed approach to IT buying in the US - where it is a 'business-led decision, not driven by the technology' - to the more experimental approach in the UK, where industry has tended to use technology to see what the benefits are. But some see another contrast between attitudes in the UK and those of continental Europe. Mr Ray Krienke, sales co-ordinator for European manufacturing industry at the Cadcam supplier Intergraph, says UK manufacturers have always tried to get value for money, because of the cyclical nature of the UK market. 'In Germany, it has been the other extreme - companies have stuck with a system if it did a job, and expanded it regularly every year. But in the past nine months, that attitude has changed because of the recession, and capital spending has halted or been called into question.' Across Europe as a whole, he says, most manufacturers have invested significantly in Cadcam. 'They have speeded up a function or a department, and they have made a return, but so has everyone else. 'Now they are trying to take another step forward on return on investment. They can continue increasing efficiency through departmental solutions, and can also recognise the huge benefits from sharing data across departments.' It is in this area, integrating through IT all the functions involved in product development and manufacturing, that most progress still has to be made, and where the future competitive advantages from spending on IT could well be derived. Mr Farrant sees the main challenge for IT vendors as helping companies to integrate the engineering world with that of manufacturing itself which, after going through several painful phases, is about 15 years ahead of engineering in terms of the control offered by IT over business functions. He suggests that, if companies wish to reduce the cost of the design phase in product development - often estimated to be as much as 80 per cent of the total - they need to ensure that the design engineer has all the relevant information available about the product and its business context, rather than just its design data. 'This is where artificial intelligence can help enormously,' he says. The desire by manufacturers to ensure that information is available throughout the business also points to an increasing role for powerful databases and their related applications software, as illustrated by the experience of Ford Electronics in Spain (see Page 2). The need for companies to 'pull things together' via their IT investments also convinces Mr Krienke that there are still good opportunities in relatively mature industrial sectors such as automotive and aerospace industries. 'Their huge investments in systems have delivered some of the benefits they expected but not all. Now they are asking whether there is a better way of doing things. So they are looking at systems that can help them see the big picture as well as give them more 'functionality' at departmental level.' From the customer's point of view, though, the big picture also involves having a clear idea of how the business works before using IT. Then the pay-backs that have proved unachievable in the past can become a reality.</p>

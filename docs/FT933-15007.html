			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Top dealer cashes in his lot - An upcoming bargain basement auction in Paris THE ELEGANT field of 18th century French furniture is heading for a big shake-up on September 28, when leading Paris specialist Camille Burgi shuts his shop and auctions his entire stock at Drouot salerooms without a single reserve price. Two hundred and fifty lots of top-quality 18th and early 19th century furniture, art objects, paintings, ceramics and sculptures will be put under the hammer by auctioneer Jacques Tajan in one of the biggest sales of its kind which Paris will have seen in a long time. Burgi is selling up less than a year after opening premises at 77 Faubourg Saint Honore - just opposite the Hotel Bristol and a prime location for an antique dealer. Burgi has 10,000 square feet, four-storey premises complete with a restoration workshop and employs 10 permanent staff. Painting dealer Colnaghi is across the road, Sotheby's is just up the street and all the biggest names in 18th century French furniture and art work are nearby. None of the stock will have been seen before in an international saleroom - Burgi is the only important Paris dealer who visits private sellers and salerooms in the provinces to find material. Aged 42, he began his career with an eight-year stint in Paris's flea markets. He spent the next 17 selling two furniture dealers on the Faubourg Saint Honore and bought a gallery on Rue Rossini, near the Drouot salerooms. He has another on Rue Richer, in the north of Paris, and also sells from a chateau in the Yonne region, near the capital. In October, 1992, Burgi joined his former clients on the Faubourg on their terms, furnishing his new headquarters at No 77 with some of the best pieces he had collected over 20 years. He spent FFr3m (Pounds 350,000) renovating the premises, believing that an energetic approach and modest profit margins could poke the market into life. However, the American and European clientele he acquired were rich but penny-pinching. After 11 months of trading only one item a week, earning one-third of what he needed to cover costs and losing a total of FFr8m (nearly Pounds 1m), Burgi decided last month to throw in the towel. The failure of such a big dealer could, ironically, prove very damaging to his competitors by breaking prices. Last week, Paris's Tribunal de Commerce gave the go-ahead necessary for Burgi, as a tradesman, to auction his stock, which could raise anything between FFr11m and FFr33m (Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 3.5m). No estimates will be published: those used by experts cataloguing Burgi's stock are based on their feeling for the market in its current depressed state. They are often one-third of those which Burgi quotes in his gallery, which are, in turn, considerably lower than the prices some of his near neighbours ask for similar items. 'I decided that it was not sporting to use reserve prices. Everything must go and a lot of people could make the bargains of their lifetimes. Prices will only depend on the buyers and this sale will fix prices in the field of 18th century furniture for a long time to come. At last, we are going to see what this stuff is really worth on the open market,' Burgi said. The September sale will include a very rare pair of early 19th century English benches in beautifully-moulded mahogany and red leather, a Louis XIV Boulle bookcase and a pair of Louis XVI oak consoles painted in trompe l'oeil marble, similar to a couple the Getty Museum bought in Paris for FFr400,000 (Pounds 46,000) five years ago. Burgi is also selling a Japanese screen in Coromondelle lacquer. It is the type stocked by most of his colleagues on the Faubourg but could sell for a fraction of the normal asking price of around FFr800,000 (about Pounds 96,000).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian military has admitted that it blew up  ammunition earlier this month at the military training ground of  Colbitz-Letzlinger Heide. The explosions caused earthquake-like  tremors and alarmed people living in and around Stendal and  Gardelegen. A Russian major general said the withdrawing troops  had destroyed ammunition which was old and unsafe to transport.  They had neglected to obtain an explosion permit.</p>

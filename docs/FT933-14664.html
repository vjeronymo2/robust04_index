			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BAA may redevelop US airports BAA, the UK airport operator, is in talks with several large US airports including Chicago's O'Hare, the world's busiest, and New York's JFK, over redeveloping the airports. The company wants to take an equity stake in an airport or buy a lease on a terminal. A deal could be signed in the second half of 1994. The move would extend BAA's presence in North America beyond Pittsburgh Airport where last October it opened a Pounds 4m shopping mall. Since then, the average amount spent by a passenger at the airport has more than doubled to Dollars 6 (Pounds 4) and BAA sees the project as a success. The company is only in talks with international airports. That is where its experience lies and where it can build lucrative duty free shops. The Pittsburgh project has also served to introduce UK retailers such as WH Smith to US airports and US retailers to the UK.</p>

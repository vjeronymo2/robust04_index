			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Perry reverses to Pounds 1.38m Profits at Perry Group, the motor vehicle retailer, fell from Pounds 2.23m to Pounds 1.38m for 1992 after taking account of exceptional income of Pounds 1.3m. Turnover declined by 4 per cent to Pounds 289m and operating profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 3.12m. The company had an excellent August but said a downturn in business in the final quarter, particularly in London and the south-east, was 'unprecedented in its severity.' Earnings were little changed at 9.1p (9.2p) but a 3p reduction in the final dividend to 3.25p leaves the total at 6p (9p).</p>

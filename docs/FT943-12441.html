			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Friday's release of advance data on the growth of Gross Domestic Product in the second quarter is the main event of the week on the bond market but the figures seem unlikely to give much of a clue as to the future direction of the yield on the long bond, which ended the week still hovering at just above 7.5 per cent. Wall Street expects GDP growth to come in at around 4 per cent, up from 3.4 per cent in the first quarter. The pick-up has not been driven by consumer spending, which is thought to have grown by no more than 1 per cent, but by a build-up in inventories. The growth in inventories can be read two ways. Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers may simply have misread demand during the period. If so, production should fall off in the third quarter, making manufacturing capacity constraints less of a concern. That would be good news for inflation and, by implication, the bond market. Alternatively, the second-quarter inventory picture may reflect a greater confidence about future consumer spending, and an intended reversal of the long-term trend towards lower inventory levels. After the Fed chairman's growing warnings about inflation last week, the bond market may decide to mark time ahead of next week's more significant employment data, due on Friday.</p>

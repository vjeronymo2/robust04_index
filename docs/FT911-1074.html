			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Observer: Hanson lady If Yve Newbold, Hanson's company secretary, is good enough to sit on the board of BT, Britain's biggest company, how come she has not yet found a place on the inbred male board of Hanson - a company half BT's size? After all, it could do with some beefing up. Like all good lawyers, the 50-year-old Mrs Newbold knows how to duck that question. She admits she wouldn't mind a seat on the Hanson board, but as company secretary she sits in on all the meetings that matter. Clearly, she isn't just your ordinary tame company secretary. A governor of London business school, she has shot up the legal ladder at IBM, Xerox, Walt Disney and since 1986 Hanson, besides rearing a sizeable family. 'If the 1980s was the age of the yuppie, the 1990s will be the age of women in management,' she predicts. And while there may not be many female finance directors at present, just look at who is winning the top accountancy prizes. 'It is scary' - for men that is. One senses that Mrs Newbold will not be spending the next decade with Hanson unless their elderly lordships loosen up a bit.</p>

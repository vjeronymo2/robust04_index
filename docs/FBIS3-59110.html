"We also approached the issue regarding the concurrent  support that we wish to gain from the alliance for the  elaboration of the necessary documents regarding our offer of  participation in the Partnership for Peace and I may say that  the answer was extremely positive and determined," Melescanu  said.    The Romanian top diplomat also added that consultations were  already held regarding "technicalities and administrative  issues" related to the future appointment (under the  Partnership's provisions) of liaison active officers with the  alliance headquarters and with "the gray cell" of the  Partnership for Peace headquartered at Mons.</p>

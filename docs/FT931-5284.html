			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and sterling soar BOTH the dollar and sterling soared against the D-Mark yesterday after the Bundesbank announced a cut in money market interest rates on the same day that the US non-farm payroll figure showed an astonishingly strong rise, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank's decision to cut the interest rate on its 14-day repo to 8.25 per cent from the previous 8.49 per cent announcement took financial markets completely by surprise. The expectation had been that a change in the central bank's money market rates would be announced on Thursday afternoon, following the Bundesbank's last council meeting, or that it would come next Tuesday when details of the weekly money market intervention are broadcast. The release of the US non-farm payroll figure, which showed a rise of 365,000 in February, was the second big surprise of the day. The market had, at best been expecting a rise of 150,000. Around 90 per cent of the rise in the payroll figure consisted of part-time workers, but this did not stop the dollar breaking through the critical level of DM1.67 for the first time in nearly a year. The dollar later closed at DM1.6670, more than 3 pfennigs up on the day. Sterling also performed strongly, helped by a statement from the UK Treasury that cuts in German rates would not necessarily be followed by an easing in UK policy. The pound closed at DM2.4100, also up more than 3 pfennigs on the day. The German central bank said that it had cut the repo rate to deal with the unusually high interest rates being set for call money in the cash market. But Mr Brian Hilliard of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said that it would have been more normal policy to deal with a short-term liquidity problem by adding emergency funds, as dictated by paragraph 17 of the Bundesbank constitution. Another analyst suggested that the Bundesbank had decided to move in response to new pressures on the French franc in Thursday night's trading in the US. But the central bank may have taken its decision to wean the markets away from expecting policy changes only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. According to Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank, the next crucial test for the dollar will be to get through the DM1.68 level. He is confident that this will happen and continued to forecast a level of DM1.80 for the US currency this year. However, the high percentage of part-time workers in the payroll may be a freak, forcing dealers to wait for the next monthly employment figure before pushing the dollar up further.</p>

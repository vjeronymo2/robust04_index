			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [XINHUA Commentator: "A Grand Blueprint for China's </F> Sustained Development"]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State Council  recently approved "China's Agenda 21," representing a practical  step that China has taken to implement the resolutions of the  United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development and  a major event in China's efforts toward sustainable development.  In a sense, the "Agenda" sketches for China a blueprint for  development in the 21st century.    China is a developing nation with nearly a 1.2 billion  population. China's foremost goal and task at present is to  develop the economy and shake off poverty and backwardness.  Like many developing countries, China faces global  environmental problems such as climatic changes, ozone layer  depletion, and reduced species diversity. In developing the  economy, it also needs to address the problem of environmental  pollution, ecological destruction, and devastation of natural  resources. Due to low productivity levels, in the past China  opted for economic development on a grand scale, seeking to  realize high levels of growth through massive investment in  industries with high levels of energy consumption and pollution.  This led to the depletion of natural resources, the worsening of  environmental pollution, and ecological destruction. As China's  economy has now entered a stage of high-speed development,  greater pressure will surely be brought to bear on our natural  resources and environment if we continue to stick to an outdated  development pattern and only emphasize quantitative growth to  the neglect of qualitative improvements to the economy. If we  fail to change our direction, we will be forced to pay a greater  price; China's modernization process will be delayed; and the  foundation of the existence and development of the Chinese  nation will even be undermined.    Sustainable development is a great cause that has not yet  been taken up in the course of human history.    Sustainable development in China is an important component  of  global sustainable development. The only way for China to  ensure sustainable and high-speed development is to opt for a  development path that will not only promote the economy but also  protect the environment. The idea behind the formulation of  "China's Agenda 21" is to promote sustainable development in  China.    For human beings at the close of this century and the next,  the issues of population, natural resources, and the environment  will be common themes. As a developing country, China is  entrusted with an important mission. The scope of the rational  use of resources and environmental protection is no longer  limited to the prevention of environmental pollution and to the  restoration of the ecological system, but is being extended to  a greater range of economic development and social progress.  This marks a great leap in the cognitive level of human beings.  It is precisely because of such a cognitive leap that we are  presented with a new opportunity for development. It is  necessary to realize high economic efficiency and to conserve  natural resources and to lower energy consumption through  setting a rational industrial setup, standardizing the types and  scales of industrial enterprises, formulating and implementing  correct industrial policies, accelerating the pace of  readjusting industrial structure and technological  transformation, and popularizing non-polluting production  technologies and adopting non- polluting production methods. It  is also necessary to continue experimenting with ecological  farming projects; to greatly popularize non-polluting  technologies for farming production; to rationally develop,  utilize, and protect farmland; to enhance the capability to  combat natural disasters; to gradually build an  intensive-farming industry; and to help establish a rational  structure for city planning.    The birth of "China's Agenda 21" marks a good beginning for  China's sustainable development. Now, the most important task  for us is to advance the comprehensive implementation of  "China's Agenda 21" in a down-to-earth manner.    The Chinese people have made tremendous contributions to  human civilization. The Chinese people, by adhering to the  policy of reform and opening up, are now advancing step by step  along the path of sustainable development. We will surely have  a bright future. China will surely make new contributions to the  global environment and development.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hydro-Quebec advances 5.1% Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's biggest electric power utilities, posted net profit of CDollars 761m (USDollars 567.9m) for 1993, up 5.1 per cent from 1992. Favourable natural conditions, tighter cost control and lower interest rates helped the advance. The utility derives nearly all its power production from hydro-generating sites. Total electricity sales were up 5.2 per cent, mainly due to higher industrial demand and higher exports to the US. Total sales revenue rose 3.5 per cent to CDollars 7bn. Operating expenses, fuel, depreciation, amortisation and taxes totalled CDollars 3.76bn, up 3.6 per cent but operating expenses alone rose 1.7 per cent. Taxes plus debt guarantee fees totalled CDollars 650m, up from CDollars 594m in 1992. Financing activities reduced the weighted average interest rate on long-term debt to 9.24 per cent from 9.79 per cent. Exchange losses were down 52 per cent to CDollars 31m. Total investment was CDollars 4bn, slightly lower than 1992. Most of the money went to the new generating capacity in the James Bay area. Hydro-Quebec said its financial ratios remained steady compared with 1992. Its capitalisation ratio was 23.9 per cent, compared with 23.7 per cent in 1992. Being under the minimum 25 per cent threshold, no dividend will be paid.</p>

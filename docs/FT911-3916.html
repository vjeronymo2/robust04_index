			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (23): Moore's law passes the test of time - Memory Devices, a prime driving force in computer developments THE prime driving force behind the panoply of developments in computing has been the ever-increasing availability of memory. It is considered quite normal for a portable computer to have more main memory and on-line disk storage than could have been crammed into a mainframe system 15 or 20 years ago. A significant element in such developments has been the fundamental law of semiconductor manufacturing first postulated by Mr Gordon Moore, chairman of Intel. This states that the number of transistors which can be designed into a given circuit area doubles every 18 months. This law has held true since Intel developed the first semiconductor memory in the late 1960s. This held just 1,024 binary bits, roughly equivalent to 20 words of text. In the intervening 20 years, the capacity of a conventional Dynamic Random Access Memory (Dram) has risen to 4 Mbits, the equivalent of about 77,000 words of text. The next big step, to Drams holding 16 Mbits, will take that figure to about 300,000 words per chip. The availability of this capability to store programs and data has created a large demand for it, which in turn has led to a continual stream of new players entering the market and, in their turn, dominating it. At the start it was US manufacturers such as Intel, National Semiconductor, Mostek and Motorola. However, in a highly competitive market with high demand, and with other product lines such as microprocessors to service, they were soon overtaken by other companies that specialised in memory production. These were the Japanese suppliers that still dominate the semiconductor memory business, such as Hitachi, NEC and Fujitsu. It is they that have taken the lead, not only in memory product, but also in research and development in the area. Few US companies now bother making memory chips at all. Because of the nature of semiconductor manufacture, where the investment required to make devices of this capacity is large whether 1m or 2m are produced, the volume production skills and benevolent investment climate of Japan was always likely to make those companies significant in the market. Similar circumstances are leading manufacturers in other Asia Pacific countries to target the Japanese suppliers. Well-known names from Singaporean, Tiawanese and Korean consumer electronics, such as Samsung, Goldstar, Daewoo and Hyundai, are established as suppliers of leading edge devices that rival the dominant Japanese for capacity, quality, quantity and price. There is a certain irony in this last factor, for they are proving to be highly price competitive at a time when their presence is creating the potential of an over-supply of components. This same sequence of events brought the Japanese suppliers to prominence in the first place when their aggressive pricing on world markets pushed most US semiconductor manufacturers out of the memory business and prompted the imposition of trade tariffs and sanctions by the US. The fact that Moore's Law continues to hold true means that it is perfectly possible to predict the future capacity of memory devices, and when they might appear. Not only brute capacity will feature, for by the turn of the century it is confidently predicted that a wide range of special purpose memory devices will have appeared. For example, the turn of the century should see a technology capable of producing 512 Mbit memory chips but there is, according to companies such as Fujitsu, a more important market in using some of that potential capacity to produce other functionality on the same chip. It could be possible, for example, to provide logic circuitry on a 256 Mbit chip that will allow the memory to be customised to suit the requirements of a specific application. Fujitsu suggest it would be possible to include several current state of the art 32-bit processors in just one corner of such a memory chip, with other logic such as analog to digital converters - important for turning real-world measurements into a form which can be handled by a digital computer - also squeezed on to the same device. Such a memory could have wide-ranging applications in industry, engineering and commerce, simply because it would be re-programmable. Another area which is expected to see rapid developments is the Flash Eprom, a type of Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory which offers high capacity, non-volatility and a fast re-write capability. What this means in practice is that companies such as Intel, which is a leader in this particular technology, can produce memory cards the size of a credit-card for portable computers and other space/size critical applications that can be written to with applications and data, stored safely without the need to be electrically refreshed, be read from as often as needed, and be erased and over-written as required. In all but two important areas, price and capacity, this is an excellent semiconductor analogy of the magnetic hard disk system. Even the most enthusiastic semiconductor suppliers do not see the technology, which boasts 1Mbyte memory cards, taking over from the hard disk in the near or medium-term future as the prime vehicle for on-line data storage. For shear on-line, available data storage capacity, the magnetic disk is still waiting to be beaten. It is also unbeaten on the classic measure of price per megabyte of storage. The manufacturers show no signs of giving up such advantages without a fight. Conner Peripherals, the leading US purveyor of small disk systems, has helped to open up the burgeoning notebook PC market by producing systems using disks just 2.5 inches in diameter, yet capable of storing more than 20 Mbytes of data. At the other extreme, high capacity 5.25 inch disks are being cascaded together in desk-side PC systems from the likes of Dell and Compaq to provide over 1 Gigabyte of capacity - more than many a mainframe system. The long-standing role of magnetic tape as the medium for storing archive data is under threat. Variations on the CD-ROM, based on established Compact Disk Technology, are providing much higher capacities in a safer and more usable form. In addition, they are starting to prove an excellent delivery vehicle for comprehensive published data, such as directory information. Most important of all, they open up new markets for companies to publish vital product information such as documentation. Using multi-media systems, such information can be shown in many new forms, including speech, videos and animations, as well as the old standby of text.</p>

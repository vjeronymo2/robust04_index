The Knesset Presidium is to  meet at this hour and will determine the format of the  deliberation that will follow the premiers' statement: how many  Knesset members are to speak and for how long. Before this  afternoon's Plenum session, Rabin is to appear before the Labor  caucus. The meeting is being closed to the media.

[end recording]    [Announcer] [passage omitted] David Ze'ev reports from the  Knesset that a decision has been reached to keep the debate on  the Hebron massacre relatively short. Only one representative of  each party's faction will be given the opportunity to speak.</p>

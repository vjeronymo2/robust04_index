			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Warning issued on software taxation COMPANIES that write their own software could find their tax position under attack from the Inland Revenue, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange, warned yesterday. The exchange itself is being challenged by the Revenue over its practice of writing off all the costs of software development in the year they are incurred. Last year that amounted to Pounds 25m, all of it spent on Taurus, the planned new settlement system. The Revenue has challenged the exchange, arguing that software development costs are a form of capital spending. As such, these costs should only be eligible for capital allowances, which amount to 25 per cent of the spending in the first year. If applied to all companies that generate their own software, the rule could prevent companies claiming immediate tax relief on significant costs. The Computer Services Association, a trade association, estimates that companies spend Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn a year on developing software for their own use. Sir Andrew warned that the ruling would be particularly costly for financial institutions, which spend large sums on software development. 'This will have quite an effect on the level of investment in the City as a whole,' he said. According to Mr John Barnsley, head of tax at Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, companies have, however, increasingly been switching to capitalising their software development spending, rather than writing it off in the year it is incurred, The escalating cost of developing computer systems, and the impact of the recession in reducing profits, means that many companies are reluctant to write off their development costs in the year in which they are incurred.</p>

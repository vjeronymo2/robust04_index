			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Miscalculation calls time on an era at Foster's - Kevin Brown outlines the rise and fall of an Australian entrepreneur THE appointment of receivers to International Brewing Investments (IBI) marks the end of Mr John Elliott's role as a significant influence on Foster's Brewing Group, and the downfall of another of Australia's best-known entrepreneurs. However, Mr Elliott remains in a different class to entrepreneurs such as Mr Alan Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, who was jailed for two-and-a-half years last week after being convicted of dishonesty. Mr Elliott is guilty only of misjudgment, primarily in relation to the 1989 buy-out of Foster's shares. That decision left his private company lumbered with ADollars 2.6bn (USDollars 1.96bn) debt acquired to finance shares worth about ADollars 1.6bn. He built Foster's into the world's fourth-largest brewing group. However, he also acquired an ill-judged assortment of property, finance, and pastoral businesses which were to prove highly vulnerable to recession. The non-core assets were largely responsible for a record ADollars 1.3bn loss in 1989-90 which triggered the removal of Mr Elliott from Foster's day-to-day management. They remain a serious problem for Foster's, which has been unable to find buyers for non-brewing assets worth about ADollars 2.8bn. Mr Elliott's involvement with the group which is now Foster's began in 1972, when he acquired Henry Jones (IXL), a small South Australian jam-maker. He used it as a vehicle to take over bigger companies such as Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort, later called Elders IXL. A pivotal decision was made in 1984 when he orchestrated a takeover of the much larger Carlton &amp; United Breweries, the manufacturer of Foster's lager. In 1988, Mr Elliott and BHP agreed on a substantial cross-shareholding which was designed to protect both companies from bids by the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court, the Australian corporate raider. Mr Elliott's luck changed in May 1989 when Harlin Holdings, a private company controlled by Foster's executives, sought to buy an 18 per cent stake in Elders IXL as a further defence against Mr Holmes a Court. Harlin, now known as International Brewing Holdings, misjudged demand from small shareholders and was forced to acquire 56 per cent of Foster's, using borrowed funds which it could not repay. Harlin's financial instability worsened when it became clear that the dividend stream from the Foster's shares - its only asset - would not be sufficient to pay interest on its debt. That debt trap, combined with Foster's losses and write-downs on non-core assets, contributed to a downward spiral in Foster's share price which left Harlin technically insolvent. Mr Elliott resigned as chief executive of Elders in May 1990, but remained as chairman until November when he was replaced by Mr Nobby Clark, a former chairman of National Australia Bank. IBH later sold a 17 per cent stake in Foster's to Asahi Brewing. It has since suggested several plans to extract value from the group through a break-up, but has failed to convince other shareholders. Mr Elliott's last hope of disentangling IBH from Foster's was a merger proposal put forward last month by SA Brewing, which contained special provisions for IBH. However, BHP has clearly lost patience.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met  with Adrien Houngbedji, president of the National Assembly of  Benin, here this afternoon.    Houngbedji and his party arrived here this morning on an  official goodwill visit to China as guests of the NPC Standing  Committee.    During the meeting, Qiao Shi, on behalf of the NPC Standing  Committee, extended his welcome to Houngbedji, who is leading  the first delegation from the Beninian National Assembly.    Qiao said that Sino-Beninian relations have been developing  smoothly and bilateral cooperation in various areas has been  strengthened.    Qiao expressed his hope that the exchanges between the two  countries and their parliaments will be enhanced so as to  further improve the friendly cooperative relations between them.    Qiao also briefed the guests on the just-concluded second  session of the Eighth NPC and the situation of China's economic  development.    The NPC chairman noted that due to the implementation of  reforms and the opening up policy, China's economy has been  developing quickly.    China is establishing the socialist market economy system,  said Qiao, presenting the NPC with a heavy legislative workload,  but the Eighth NPC will, in its term, make efforts to form the  framework of a legislative system for the socialist market  economy.    Houngbedji said that he and his party are here to learn and  draw from China's experience. Both Benin and China are  peace-loving countries, he added; therefore, the friendly  cooperative relations between them will be further strengthened.    Houngbedji expressed his belief that China will play a still  greater role in safeguarding peace in Asia and in the world as  well.    Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Cheng Siyuan and  Zhu Liang, chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, took  part in the meeting.    Following the meeting, Qiao hosted a dinner for Houngbedji  and his party.    This afternoon, Zhu Liang and Houngbedji held working talks.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A House subcommittee unanimously recommended impeachment of convicted federal  Judge Walter Nixon, accusing him of undermining the integrity of the judiciary.  The full Judiciary Committee will now decide whether to place the three  articles before the House for a vote. Nixon, who is serving a five-year perjury  sentence, will remain a federal judge and continue to collect his $89,500  salary unless impeached by the House and then tried and convicted by the  Senate. He has maintained his innocence but was convicted in 1986 of lying to a  grand jury about his knowledge of drug charges against the son of Mississippi  millionaire Wiley Fairchild and his efforts to intervene in the case.  </P></p>

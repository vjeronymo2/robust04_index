			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A BETTER TRIBUTE  </P> <P> Regarding the San Diego Convention Center, that name is appropriate and should  remain as such.  </P> <P> As for Martin Luther King Jr., there are many other things that could be named  after him. My favorite would be Presidents Way in Balboa Park. That would be a  tribute equal to his accomplishment.  </P> <P> PAUL HERRMANN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

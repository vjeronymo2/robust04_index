			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Annette Millet: "ADEME: Between Politics </F> and the Environment"]    [Text] The biotechnology research work backed by the ADEME  [Environment And Energy Use Agency] attempts to find a  compromise between protection of the environment and new  openings for agricultural production. The creation of a  scientific interest grouping [GIS] for the economic development  of energy crops could provide the ADEME with fresh impetus.    The multidisciplined vocations of the ADEME include backing  and coordinating research projects. Hit by the 1994 budget  which shaved some 30 percent off its research and development  funding, the young agency will no longer be able to meet the  aims of its research program for the 1992-1996 period. It will,  however, maintain its effort to finance scientific theses and,  in the agroindustrial field, it hopes to receive fresh impetus  from the creation of a GIS for the economic development of  energy crops.    During the restructuring program carried out last year, the  ADEME -- created in 1992 from the merger of the French Energy  Use Agency [AFME], the National Agency for the Recovery and  Elimination of Waste [ANRED], and the Air Quality Agency  [AQA]--began to work in four major sectors: industry, the  habitat and renewable energy sources, transport, and agriculture  and bioenergy. Its research budget for 1994 took heavy cuts in  the number of programs it could authorize from two of its parent  ministries, Industry and Research (the Research Ministry cut its  program authorizations by 30 percent while payment  appropriation, abnormally low since 1991, rose by 20 percent).  Globally, agency funding remained more or less stable, thanks  to an increase in funds from the tax levied on waste products.  This money, however, must be spent on research into household  and normal industrial waste, and atmospheric pollution from  large installations, leaving by the wayside certain of the  priorities set out in the research and development program for  1992- 1996: energy use, the restoration of contaminated sites,  and research into untaxed air pollution. These are all areas  that are liable to suffer from the reduction in ADEME funding.    Of the three bodies merged into the ADEME, only the AFME  received research credits for the financing of its work, the  creation of support networks, and enabling it to work with  public and industrial research laboratories. In the  biotechnology sector, the AFME was active in three main areas.  Firstly, solar bioenergy, with the joint creation in 1982 with  the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] of the Association for  Research into Solar Biotechnology [ARBS]. Participants from  industry included Rhone-Poulenc, Total, and Elf. This  association worked for six years researching into a way of  producing hydrogen or hydrocarbons from plants and  photosynthesizing bacteria. The ARBS was then integrated into  an AEC laboratory. The second line of research was the  methanization of industrial effluent, slurry, and household  waste. One of the agency's functions in this area was to  support the research and development stages of the Valorga  process. The third line of research was in replacement fuel  sources from the biomass. The AFME's finest achievement in this  domain (and the most expensive) was the financing of the  Soustons platform (southwestern France), originally designed  around the "green refinery" concept and which is currently  operated by an industrial company (SAF-Isis).    Over the years, the changing socioeconomic context has  altered the purpose of the work financed by the agency. Thus,  research into methanization, which was commenced with the aim of  achieving energy independence, now aims at environmental  protection, for example with the treatment of food industry  effluent. With the creation of the ADEME, biotechnology  reasserted its role of serving the environment, already  established with biomass and cellulolysis research. New avenues  were explored, such as biomatter, food, and pharmaceutical  constituents (flavorings, colorings, texturing agents, and  enzymes), bioprocesses applied to effluent and solid waste  treatment, etc. This clarification of issues is particularly  well-defined in the ADEME policy on cofinancing thesis grants.    Currently financed research is split equally between  environmental protection and energy use. Given the severe  cutback in funding, the ADEME has fallen back on the hard core  project of cofinancing, with industrial companies or local  communities, thesis students working in priority areas.  Awarding thesis grants allows a certain freedom of action since  it is thus possible to examine more adventurous subjects or  subjects whose results are less certain.    Between 1988 and 1993, the field of biological engineering,  for example, was the subject of 21 theses. In 1993 these  included work on the microbial production of surface active  agents (cofinanced with the French Petroleum Institute [IFP])  and the enzymatic alteration of cellulosed materials (cofinanced  with a laboratory of the National Scientific Research Center  [CNRS]). Biological engineering does not completely dominate  biotechnology work, however. In 1993, the Impact and  Environment Research Service [SRIM] financed theses on the  development of a biosensor for the prevention of accidental  pollution (air and waste) and on the bioevaluation of polluted  soil, researching toxicity biomarkers in rats (sentinel  animals). Biotechnology still accounts for just 15 percent of  the 80 thesis grants cofinanced by the ADEME each year.    In the field of biotechnology, research could take off again  thanks to the creation of the agency for the economic  development of energy crops. Announced in December 1992 and  confirmed by Hubert Curien at the Agricultural Show of March  1993, this agency should become operational in the first quarter  of 1994. The project will initially take the form of a GIS  controlled by the ADEME and based on a contractual agreement  between different partners: the ADEME, the national agronomy  research institute [INRA], and the IFP, working closely with the  ministries of agriculture, research, and industry. The Industry  Ministry would also like to involve industrial groups. The  fields of operation of this national research and development  project are fully in line with the recommendations of the Levy  report on biofuels--to develop research to improve the  competitiveness of biofuels. They are defined in terms of  product lines. Under examination will be: lipidic plants (rape,  proteaginous species) and their possibilities for producing oils  and methylic esters; lignocellulose plants that are sources of  biofuel; and carbohydrate plants (wheat, beetroot, corn, and  sorghum), producing ethanol and ethyl tertiobutyl ether (ETBE).  A fourth program will aim at finding new uses for agriculture  producing neither food or energy, but biopolymers, biodegradable  surface active agents, vegetable lipochemistry, etc.). A fifth,  cross-disciplinary program will be dedicated to the economic  aspects and environmental impact of new products being studied.  The idea is to be able to one day make concrete proposals to  farmers offering them a choice of production systems. The  public expenditure set aside for the GIS should amount to some  40 million French francs in its first year.    Current ADEME research projects therefore operate according  to a double logic: stimulating protection of the environment and  finding an answer to the problems posed by agricultural policy.</p>

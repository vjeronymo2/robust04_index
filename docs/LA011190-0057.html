			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> WALL ADVOCATES ASK CITY AID  </P> <P> Residents who want a wall to muffle sound between their apartment building and  the nearby San Bernardino Freeway have asked the city to represent them in a  class-action suit against state transportation officials.  </P> <P> The stretch of freeway near the apartments does not qualify for a sound wall  because the units were built after construction of the freeway, state officials  have said.  </P> <P> But a spokesman for Royal Gardens residents, Michael Rotstan, told the City  Council on Monday that a wall is needed for safety, especially to protect  children who may wander onto the freeway. The complex is in the 3100 and 3200  blocks of West Ramona Road.  </P> <P> The council agreed to consider the residents' request on Feb. 13, when results  of a freeway noise test by Caltrans will be available.  </P></p>

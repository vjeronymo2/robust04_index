			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: COUPLE FIND THEIR PLACE IN EARLIER TIME  </P> <P> Nights and weekends, John and Carrie Oliver live in another time and proudly  covet their strange kind of alter ego life.  </P> <P> They and an estimated 60,000 others are members of the worldwide Society of  Creative Anachronism who seek happiness by living a make-believe life based on  the Middle Ages.  </P> <P> For example, they greet other members with such terms as Milord and Milady, and  if that isn't acceptable, they might invite each other to an honorable mock  fight to the death with wooden swords.  </P> <P> "We kind of attract a different type of person, people who don't fit into the  mundane modern world," said Oliver, an Anaheim cable television employee who  goes by the name Lord Colin Mordrake, the swamp dragon, after he leaves work.  </P> <P> Carrie is a computer company administrator and is called Lady Nikki Zotsdrake  in her other life. She met John on an isolated field of combat in Colorado  where she was clad in a highly polished suit of armor.  </P> <P> "I killed 10 combatants there," boasted Carrie, who was decked out in a  medieval costume and loads of gold chains as she strolled one recent Saturday  around Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Part of the park had been transformed into the mythical Kingdom of Caid.  </P> <P> Her husband added: "When they are dressed in armor you can't tell whether it's  a man or woman fighting. My wife is an itty-bitty thing, but she held her own  during the course of the day."  </P> <P> Elegantly clad women and men who were trying to live a different life for a day  were quartered in colorfully decorated tents for the happening there.  </P> <P> Spectators milled about wondering what was going on.  </P> <P> "My wife and I joined because we were looking for a simpler life than the one  we have to live in today's society," said John, who gave up judo and karate to  fight with a wooden sword. "I end up with a lot less bruises fighting with a  wooden sword."  </P> <P> He finds the mock fighting "fascinating. We all try to entertain each other  because we like to do it. We all keep in mind it is just a game or else it  could get out of hand."  </P> <P> Before joining, John said, he belonged to a number of community and service  organizations that didn't meet his personal needs.  </P> <P> "We all have jobs, but we're looking for something else," he continued. "The  Middle Ages and the philosophy of that time is what we like to foster. In the  world today everyone seems to have that us-versus-them philosophy."  </P> <P> When the group meets, the Olivers say, "We're armed with an attitude and  weapons."  </P> <P> Besides the mock fighting, they added, "everyone in the society is friendly and  polite, even to the newest members. We are a very polite society when we battle  or meet each other."  </P> <P> He said when a gentleman meets a lady at their gatherings, he is prone to kiss  her hand.  </P> <P> The society holds most of its gatherings in isolated areas, but meets at times  in more populated areas to attract new members.  </P> <P> "The more people that see and know of us, the more members we can get," said  John, whose main hope is to become knighted by the group.  </P> <P> It is the most prestigious honor besides becoming king.  </P> <P> "I'd also like to become king," he confided.  </P> <P> If it isn't enough to have police officers knock heads with firefighters to  draw spectators at the third annual Orange County 911 Football Bowl on April 27  at 7 p.m. at Orange Coast College, the sponsors are offering other incentives.  </P> <P> One will come in the form of a silent auction the same evening.  </P> <P> The items up for auction will include an autographed Wayne Gretsky hockey  stick, a Rams helmet signed by quarterback Jim Everett, a team-signed Lakers  basketball, a team-signed Angels baseball and a Chuck Norris autographed karate  belt.  </P> <P> All proceeds go to Drug Use Is Life Abuse Foundation and the Olive Crest  Treatment Center for abused and neglected children.  </P> <P> And if that doesn't draw a crowd, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will be in  attendance to help give out official Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to children  in attendence.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev has urged the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization to drop the threat of air strikes on Bosnian Serbs.    At a news conference, the Russian minister claimed that the  planned NATO air attacks, especially the massive ones, can make  the conflict uncontrollable and result in its spreading outside  Bosnia- Herzegovina.    He argued that NATO air strikes did not and will not at  present bring any results within the military sphere.    In Grachev's opinion, settlement of the conflict lies in a  summit meeting involving Russia, the U.S., European Union allies  and the United Nations, which can be held in any European state  and should include the political leadership of the whole former  Yugoslavia.    The defense minister urged the Peace-Keeping Forces in the  Moslem-held town of Gorazde be reinforced to avert bloodshed,  adding that Russia intends to send a 19-men strong platoon to  the stricken city.    He strongly opposed the withdrawal of Russian troops from  war- torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, warning that this would be an  untimely and inappropriate decision fraught with a further  political isolation of Russia in the world community.    Grachev said that it was not only Serbs but both conflicting  sides who are to blame for the current crisis.    Gebnardt Von Moltke, NATO deputy secretary general for  political issues, who is heading a NATO delegation participating  in an international conference here, said earlier Monday [25  April] that NATO is going to cooperate closely with Moscow in  solving the Bosnian crisis.</p>

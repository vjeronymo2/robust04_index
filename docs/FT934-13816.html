			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Dockyard labour terms in danger FULL-SCALE privatisation of Devonport and Rosyth naval dockyards, announced on Monday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is likely to mean less generous conditions of employment for the workforce. Babcock Thorn, the consortium of Babcock and Thorn EMI which operates Rosyth, said yesterday that it would 'examine' employment conditions, including pay, pensions and redundancy terms, if it were successful in a bid. Unit labour costs at the dockyards are higher than those in comparable private-sector operations because of terms inherited from the Ministry of Defence when private-sector managers took over in 1987. The MoD also covers the cost of redundancies, something that will probably cease on privatisation. The government intends to sell the two dockyards to separate companies by 1996 as part of its drive for defence savings. Both Babcock Thorn and Devonport Management (DML) consider themselves well placed to bid for their yards, though both want to see the tender documents first. VSEL, the submarine builder, GEC, which owns the Yarrow warship yard, British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce all registered an interest in bidding for the yards when the MoD asked for expressions of interest last year. As well as being concerned about employment terms, unions at the yards fear privatisation will lead to further redundancies. Despite winning the contract to refit Trident submarines in July, DML announced this month a further 500 redundancies which will reduce the workforce to 4,400, while Rosyth has cut its workforce from 4,100 to under 3,700 since the start of the year. Babcock Thorn said yesterday that job cuts after privatisation depended on how successful Rosyth was at winning warship and outside commercial work. Mr Peter Whitehouse, business development manager of DML, said the company regarded itself in 'a very strong position as sitting tenants' to bid successfully for the yard.</p>

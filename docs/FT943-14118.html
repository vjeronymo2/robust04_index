			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): Investors take a longer view - Unit trusts / Sales figures suggest a healthier attitude on the part of savers, as competition grows to offer them more attractive charging structures Traditionally, the period after the end of the tax year is a relatively quiet one for unit trusts. Most unit trusts bought by private investors are in the form of a personal equity plan (Pep) and, since the rush to use up annual limits tends to be confined to the end of the tax year, that is the time when unit trusts sales also tend to be highest. Sales have fallen off since March when net investment in unit trusts topped Pounds 1.37bn, making it the best March figure on record, but subsequent investment has still been sizeable, dropping only to Pounds 976m in April and to Pounds 726.4m in May. Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, said the figures indicated a healthy change in saving habits, as investors appeared to be ignoring short-term market movements and investing for the long term. Last year was a record for the unit trust industry, helped by prevailing low interest rates, with net inflows of Pounds 9.1bn. Net investment of Pounds 4.2bn in the first five months of this year was still strong, despite - or possibly because of - the dip in the UK market since February. With sales still buoyant, competition continues apace, with the main emphasis on charging structures and on dressing up an existing product to sustain the interest of potential investors. At the end of June, Fidelity packaged its existing Peps into a mortgage to launch Fidelity Pep Mortgage Plan. Borrowers can either use a Fidelity Pep - the company recommends three in particular - to bolt on to an interest-only mortgage secured from one of 40 lenders who have said they will sell the Pep; or they can choose Fidelity's package, with Bank of Ireland providing the mortgage and Zurich Life the term assurance. At the same time, Fidelity has changed the charging structure of its Peps by lifting the three-year exit fees, from July 4, but by pushing up the initial charge from 2 per cent to 3 per cent from August 1. When it pioneered the introduction of withdrawal fees on unit trust Peps, in June 1992, and cut the initial charge from 5.25 to 2 per cent, it said it wanted to avoid diluting the tax benefits of a Pep with a high initial charge. Other companies followed, including Gartmore, Guinness Flight, Scottish Equitable and, most recently M&amp;G, which on January 1 abolished the initial charge on its Managed Income Pep, but introduced five-year withdrawal charges. Gartmore has also lifted withdrawal charges on its unit trust Peps and raised its initial charge from 2 to 3 per cent. The two gave the same reason for the move: investors found the dual charging structure 'confusing.' Fidelity also said that it did not want any penalties attached to the new mortgage package; but both companies have also found that few investors have been cashing in their Pep early. Others may follow, although M&amp;G says that it has no intention of abolishing withdrawal charges on the Managed Income Pep, and may indeed extend the charging structure to other Peps. It says it has not found customer confusion, but attributes this to the lack of an initial charge. M&amp;G's Rachel Medill said: 'There is only one set of charges, so for us it is a simple message. Two sets of charges may give investors the impression that they are being charged twice.' Fidelity's and Gartmore's 3 per cent initial charge is still competitive compared with the industry average of 5.25 to 6 per cent, but it is confined to unit trust Peps. Murray Johnstone's initial charge on its unit trusts is 1 per cent, and Lazard has not levied an initial charge on its unit trusts since 1988. At the beginning of May, Invesco cut the initial charge across the range of its unit trusts to 3 per cent. Alan Wren, managing director of Invesco fund managers, made no secret that the idea was to increase greater market share and attract longer-term investors after two years of stagnation at Invesco, where funds under management had not increased despite a market average growth of between 50 per cent and 100 per cent. Although initial and annual charges are one factor in any decision to buy a unit trust, performance is far more important in the long run. Here, Invesco is on weak territory and says that one of its tasks is to improve performance. With the exception of its Japan Smaller Companies fund, which has a good record, many of its UK funds are to be found in the lower half of the performance tables. MORE MANAGERS PLAN TO EXPLORE EMERGING MARKETS The Far East and emerging markets have been the main geographical areas acting as a spur to new launches. Hypo F&amp;C hopes to capitalise on future growth in the Japanese market with its Japanese Growth fund, while Exeter Fund managers is using closed-end funds to invest in the Far East through its Pacific Growth fund. Save &amp; Prosper has turned its attentions away from the Far East to South America with its Latin America Fund. Portfolio's Emerging Markets Fund aims to take the pick of emerging market unit trusts through a fund of funds trust. OPTIONS SAFETY-NET RULES OUT PEP STATUS There were at least two unusual ideas. John Govett, which has a range of index funds, some using derivatives, launched the UK Safeguard Fund which aims to replicate the performance of the FT-SE 100. The use of options is meant as a safeguard against sharp falls, but it also means that the trust does not qualify for Pep status. Hargreaves Lansdowne, the Bristol-based independent financial adviser, launched the Warrant Portfolio Trust, its first unit trust, which invests in all types of these geared (and therefore risky) investments.</p>

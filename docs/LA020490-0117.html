			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAPPLETHORPE IMAGES  </P> <P> Really, Wilson, why all the fuss?  </P> <P> Maybe it's because Mapplethorpe had an intense courage to photograph his world  and present it to the public instead of leaving it in some crowded closet to be  discovered after he was dead.  </P> <P> I don't think it had anything to do with Jim Morrison, Andy Warhol or a  6-year-old Almodovar film. I think Mapplethorpe was a genius, now a casualty  who will be missed.  </P> <P> RANDY LUJAN-PESQUEIRA  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

The group led by Naoto Kan, a House of Representatives  member  of the United Social Democratic Party (Shaminren), will submit  the bill to the next ordinary session of the Diet beginning on  January 31, they said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa serves  as adviser to the group.    Under the panel's plan, the organization would hear  complaints from the public about the administration, check such  opinions and report the outcome of the study to the House of  Representatives speaker or the House of Councillors president.    The commission would also advise the lower house speaker or  the upper house president on enacting or abolishing laws for the  purpose of cutting administrative organizations.    The planned organization would have the right to demand  administrative bodies to submit documents and to open hearings.    The Management and Coordination Agency plans to set up a  similar organization in the Prime Minister's Office, but the  group led by Kan doubts the administration can make the  appropriate cuts on its own, they said.</p>

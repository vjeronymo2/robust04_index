			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Newton and Gartmore top fund manager list Newton and Gartmore are the two best-performing managers of UK pension funds over five years according to this year's performance league table compiled by the Financial Times. Newton was also the leader on a one-year view, reporting a median return of 37.4 per cent, followed by M &amp; G with 34.0 per cent. The median return for managers as a whole was 29.2 per cent, according to the performance measurement firm Caps. Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, second a year ago, has slipped to fourth after an indifferent 1993 in which it suffered by anticipating a stock market downturn too early. However, in the first quarter of 1994 it has gained 2.2 per cent compared with the estimated Caps median, which was minus 4.6 per cent. The figures for the house median rate of return have been supplied by the managers and calculated in accordance with the National Association of Pension Funds Code. However several managers, including industry leader Mercury Asset Management, did not provide information. The performance figures are regarded in some quarters as controversial, because they are subject to a degree of cosmetic adjustment and because they obscure differences between individual client funds. 'Half of our clients are below our in-house average, so 50 per cent will be unhappy if the figure is published,' says one new business director. 'That is a slightly silly position to be in.' This is generally thought to be a particular problem for MAM, which had 442 clients at the end of last year. Big managers such as MAM offer a broader range of products, and the concept of a standard discretionary management strategy is difficult to apply. Nevertheless, performance over the short to medium term is still the most powerful factor driving new business. The biggest gainers of new client money last year were PDFM, Schroder and Gartmore, all of which are leaders in the five-year table. Two smaller managers, Newton and Baillie Gifford, raised their pension fund assets under management by 60 per cent last year, in spite of being closed to new clients at various times. To beat the median last year in UK equities, managers needed to be heavily exposed to cyclical recovery stocks - a characteristic style of M &amp; G, for instance - and light in formerly highly rated growth sectors such as pharmaceuticals and food retailing. Small company shares outperformed the big blue chips. Overseas, the US was relatively weak and Japan neutral, so funds did well to be heavily invested in continental Europe and especially in south-east Asia and emerging markets. Property was a drag compared to the sparkling performance of global equities. But fund managers have needed to perform some rapid U-turns this year. Property has been the best asset to hold so far, and unless managers have quickly got out of Hong Kong and the emerging markets they could be at the bottom of the 1994 performance league.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------             RATE OF RETURN* OF SEGREGATED FUNDS TO 31.12.93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Over 5 yrs    Over 1 yr                                          (annualised %)      %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Newton Investment Management                  19.9         37.4 Gartmore Investment Management                18.8         29.4 Queen Anne's Gate Asset Man.                  18.5         33.8 Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management               17.8         28.6 Schroder Investment Management                17.8         32.7 Baring Investment Management                  17.3         31.2 Clerical Medical                              17.3         31.7 M &amp; G Investment Management                   17.2         34.0 HSBC Asset Management Europe                  17.2         29.4 Morgan Grenfell Asset Management              17.1         32.6 Cazenove                                      16.9         30.0 Rothschild Asset Management                   16.9         27.0 Hill Samuel Investment Man.                   16.8         30.2 Caps median fund                              16.8         29.2 Lloyds Investment Managers                    16.6         29.5 Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inv.

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: ML Holdings appoints new chief executive ML Holdings, the aerospace, defence and electronic components group, appointed Mr Howard Grant as chief executive yesterday, more than two months after the departure of Mr Peter Pollock, his predecessor, on the day before the company announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.24m. Mr Grant, 51, is currently chief executive of the rail division of BTR, the engineering conglomerate. From 1976 to 1986 he was group managing director of Westinghouse Brake and Signal (Australia), controlled by Hawker Siddeley since 1979. BTR bought Hawker last November. Mr Grant accepted the post at ML in June, but the announcement was delayed until the closure of a contract he was negotiating for BTR. The reshuffle came about as the company fell into loss last year, although Mr Pollock's departure was over 'management style (rather) than bottom line performance', Mr Sallitt said at the time. Mr Sallitt became chairman in March with the remit to turn the company round by strengthening its non-military businesses. ML Holdings' shares fell 2 1/2 p to 16p.</p>

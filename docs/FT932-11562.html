			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / France 'sliding into recession' FRANCE is set to slide into recession this year with the economy declining by 0.1 per cent, according to the latest government forecast, because of further cuts in industrial investment and a fall in export growth. The Commission des Comptes, the public accounts committee, suggests gross domestic product in 1993 will follow the downward trend begun in the final quarter of 1992, falling in real terms by an average of 0.1 per cent. This decline will reflect slightly slower growth in consumer spending of 1.1 per cent, against 1.4 per cent in 1992, and a continued fall in industrial investment of 3.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent the previous year. Import growth is expected to slow from 3.8 per cent in 1992 to 2.7 per cent this year, but the Commission also forecasts a sharp reduction in export growth from 7 to 1.7 per cent. The sluggish economy could complicate the new centre-right government's attempts to reduce the general budget deficit, which is expected to reach FFr330bn (Pounds 39.6bn) this year. The government yesterday continued its cost-cutting efforts by announcing there would be no new increase in public sector salaries for 1993. Mr Andre Rossinot, public services minister, said the government would stick to the 6 per cent increase in the total public sector salary bill agreed by the last administration. The pay freeze forms part of the efforts of Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, to cut government expenditure. Good soldier's end, Page 16</p>

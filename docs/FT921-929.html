			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Hotel industry at 10-year low ROOM occupancy at English hotels last year fell to its lowest level since 1982, according to a survey carried out for the English Tourist Board. Horwath Consulting, which carried out the survey, said that although early returns this year suggest some improvement, it would be some time before the industry returned to the high levels of occupancy that were achieved in the late 1980s. Mr Geoff Parkinson, a director of Horwath, said: 'Unfortunately, with the hotel industry's high level of fixed costs, continuing occupancy at these low levels will inevitably lead to further bankrupt-cies.' The survey showed that average room occupancy in England fell by 6 percentage points to 51 per cent last year. Bed occupancy fell by 5 points to 41 per cent. London suffered particularly badly, with room occupancy in luxury hotels falling by 17 points. Occupancy in the next most expensive group of London hotels - classed at Pounds 56 to Pounds 85.50 a night - dropped by nearly 20 points. Although the Gulf war and the recession were the principal reasons for the country-wide fall, English hotel occupancy has been in decline since 1988, when the average number of rooms filled reached 60 per cent.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Posts to go at chemicals company BRUNNER MOND, the Cheshire-based chemicals company, said yesterday that it was shedding 400 jobs as part of a cost-cutting programme. The company, owned by Imperial Chemical Industries until last year, said it hoped to avoid compulsory redundancies. The move comes after a 12-month review of the business and follows 200 job cuts last year. Mr Bob Collicutt, Brunner Mond general manager, said the job losses would be across all parts of the company. 'It's going to take 12 to 18 months for us to see this change through,' he said. The latest move will take the workforce down to 650 at Brunner Mond's two sites making soda ash - used in glass production and several chemical processes. In 1979 the company employed 3,000 people. 'We are offering very attractive redundancy terms,' said Mr David Wertheim, who was behind the Pounds 90m buy-out of Brunner Mond from ICI in September last year. He said the redundancy terms were 'better than ICI's' and would cost 'many millions of pounds'. Mr Collicutt said the company would reorganise its plant operations, distribution, administration, sales and marketing over the next 18 months. He said that the reorganisation would involve some extra investment by the company. Brunner Mond produces about 1m tonnes of soda ash a year and supplies 90 per cent of the UK market.</p>

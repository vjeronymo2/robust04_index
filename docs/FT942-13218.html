			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pascoe's falls Pounds 970,000 into red Pascoe's Group, the west country-based maker of pet foods which has recently undergone a financial restructuring, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 970,000 for the six months to December 31. There were losses of Pounds 764,000 for the half year to December 31 1992 and a restated Pounds 3.27m deficit for the year ended June 30 1993. The company, formerly known as Sheldon Jones, has changed its year end from June 30 to December 31. Mr David Gwyther, chief executive, said that performance was broadly in line with the forecast made in December at the time of the Pounds 1.35m rights issue. A small overrun reflected slightly higher than expected costs and losses associated with discontinued businesses. Turnover on continuing operations came to Pounds 3.53m (Pounds 8.03m). Mr Gwyther said the group was now focused on its core pet food business, where a development programme had continued through the period of change. New distribution had been achieved, new products introduced and marketing support maintained. Losses per share were 18.75p and no dividend will be paid for the period. For the previous 12 months losses came out at 59.75p.</p>

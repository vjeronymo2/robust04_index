			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska </F> republic, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. President, the Croat and Muslim  sides in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina have reached an agreement  on federation. The Serbian side was generously offered the  opportunity to join the agreement and express its stand on this  federation agreement between Croats and Muslims. What is  understood so far is that the Serbian side is not going to join  the agreements bilaterally.    [Karadzic] First of all, the agreement was made without us  and without any participation by us, so I do not see how  somebody can expect us to join and accept something that others  have adjusted to their own needs. As regards their own right to  live as they want to, we have no comment. This is derived from  their sovereign right to determine the way in which they are  going to live, as well as their mutual relations. We are  retaining this same right for ourselves. However, within the  European Conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina we accepted certain  obligations toward the European Community and have fulfilled  these obligations. The European Community, as a representative  of the international community, has accepted some obligations  toward us and should fulfill these obligations. We are not  going to enter any new conference until these obligations are  fulfilled, and they mostly regard the lifting or suspension of  sanctions against the Serbian people. Any further talks imply a  relation on an equal footing between the negotiating sides and  in this respect the Serbian side cannot negotiate if it is not  freed from sanctions, that is to say, if it is not treated in an  equal fashion.    In any case, we are not going to refuse to negotiate all  possible alternatives. What we see as priorities are, first,  that the war should stop. Second, a just delimitation  [delimitacija] should be carried out and borders established.  Third, only then should we decide what relations should be  established between these new entities. Here I do not think  only about the Serbian Republic, but also about the Republic of  Serbian Krajina and Croatia and the Croatian-Muslim Federation  and Yugoslavia. In any case, relations between the new entities  will present much less problem than the delimitation, and  delimitation is much less of a problem than putting a stop to  war. Therefore, one should first stop the war. The Serbs are  ready to stop the war without setting any conditions, so we  should not fight anywhere. However, as regards all other  things, that would nevertheless rather like starting a new  conference and to enter a new conference, we demand that the  international community fulfill its obligations towards us.</p>

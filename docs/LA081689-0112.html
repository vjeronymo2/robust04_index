			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANISCHEWITZ SETTLES CLAIMS, SAYS IT'S NO LONGER FOR SALE  </P> <P> B. Manischewitz Co., a New Jersey maker of matzo and other kosher food  products, said Tuesday that it has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle claims  by a Beverly Hills investment firm relating to an aborted, $44.6-million buyout  effort.  </P> <P> Manischewitz also officially took itself off the sale block, saying it had  informed Shearson Lehman Hutton, its investment bank, that it was "no longer  interested in acquisition proposals."  </P> <P> Under terms of the settlement, Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co., a Beverly  Hills firm that tried for months to buy Manischewitz, apparently compromised in  accepting the $1.5 million. It had argued that it was entitled to a  $2.4-million "cancellation fee," while Manischewitz contended that it didn't  owe the firm anything.  </P> <P> After friendly negotiations during which it seemed that a deal was all but  certain, Manischewitz and Levine Tessler suddenly soured on each other late  last month. That was after Levine Tessler sweetened its bid to $841 a share to  top that of rival kosher foods maker National Foods.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grand Jury Looking Into Alleged Violations  </P> <P> Manischewitz, based in Jersey City, accused the Beverly Hills firm of dragging  its feet. Levine Tessler, for its part, countered that Manischewitz was  unwilling to disclose information about the possible effects of a long-running  grand jury investigation into alleged antitrust violations in the kosher food  business.  </P> <P> In an Aug. 4 letter mailed to shareholders, Manischewitz said it informed  Levine Tessler in mid-July that the investigation "had intensified (and) now  probably encompassed most, if not all, of the company's products." Several  company officials have testified before a New Jersey grand jury looking into  the matter.  </P> <P> On July 31, Levine Tessler said it would not proceed with its acquisition.  Since then, the two companies have been scrambling to reach a settlement to  avoid going to court.  </P> <P> Manischewitz also said it settled two shareholder suits related to the failed  merger effort. The company said the shareholders agreed to drop those suits in  exchange for Manischewitz's agreement not to oppose a court award of up to  $375,000 for the plaintiffs' legal fees.  </P> <P> All terms of the settlement are subject to approval by the Court of Common  Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Ohio.  </P></p>

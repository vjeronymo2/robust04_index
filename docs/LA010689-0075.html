			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: THEATER / NANCY CHURNIN: CASSIUS CARTER'S 20TH YEAR BLOOMS  WITH A LOVE STORY  </P> <P> The first play in the 20th year of the Cassius Carter Centre Stage is a love  story, and it may be a hot one.  </P> <P> Playwright Lanie Robertson expects several New York producers to check out his  "Alfred Stieglitz Loves O'Keeffe" at the Carter for a possible on- or  off-Broadway production.  </P> <P> The Old Globe presentation, which opens Saturday, marks the third in five  already scheduled regional productions of the play. The Globe is the only  theater that has asked for script changes from Robertson. The playwright  originally came out to see if doing the play in the round would require any  rewriting. In the course of working with director Robert Berlinger and artistic  director Jack O'Brien over the last three weeks, the three agreed that minor  alterations might yield major thematic differences.  </P> <P> "A writer has to be very protective of the script," Robertson said. "But I  think they're terrific changes."  </P> <P> Robertson, who has written 17 full-length plays and 21 one-acts in the 13 years  since taking up playwrighting, drew his inspiration for the play in 1985 after  seeing "A Portrait of Georgia O'Keeffe," a collection of 50 photographs that  Alfred Stieglitz took of the painter in the 1920s. Robertson describes his work  as "a love poem, a Valentine. . ."  </P> <P> "My image is a heart carved on an oak tree, with 'Alfred Stieglitz Loves  O'Keeffe' on the heart," he said. "D. H. Lawrence has a phrase about love  called star equilibrium, that describes two people, each being attracting and  repulsing at the same time, each remaining in their own orbit rather than  overwhelming the other. I felt Stieglitz and O'Keeffe had star equilibrium for  a very long time. In those photographs, one can sense an intangible essence  passing between the model and the photographer -- it was such a whimsical and  caring and careful collaboration between them. I felt there was some essence of  their affection for each other that was quite exciting."  </P> <P> Is this ideal relationship anything the 43-year-old Texas-born playwright has  experienced first hand?  </P> <P> "One searches for it," he said. "One always thinks, 'Maybe this time.' . . .  But, sad to say, no, I haven't experienced it -- yet."  </P> <P> The first productions of "Alfred Stieglitz Loves O'Keeffe" were in March at the  GeVa Theatre in Rochester, N.Y., and at the Alaska Repertory Theatre in  Anchorage in October. Next stops are the Alley Theatre in Houston and the  Cricket Theatre in Minneapolis.  </P> <P> The Old Globe has been looking for a permanent all-purpose rehearsal and  audition space ever since it converted the former Falstaff Tavern into the  Cassius Carter Centre Stage in 1968. Still, the conversion is one no one  regrets.  </P> <P> The Falstaff Tavern was originally used as a restaurant during the 1935  California-Pacific Exposition and later converted into a multipurpose space. In  1963, then-artistic director Craig Noel experimented with producing plays that  wouldn't need to appeal to the larger audiences that the Old Globe was  accustomed to serving.  </P> <P> Noel produced 25 shows at the Falstaff Tavern before the space underwent the  renovations that transformed it into the Cassius Carter, where it has since  been host to 112 plays, beginning with Peter Ustinov's anti-war play, "The  Unknown Soldier and His Wife." A. R. Gurney's first world premiere at the  Globe, "Another Antigone," was stage there, and Stephen Metcalfe's "Vikings."  Metcalfe, an associate artist of the Globe, has since been produced in each of  the Globe's theaters ("The Incredibly Famous Willy Rivers" played on the main  stage and "White Linen" at the Lowell Davies Festival Stage). His latest effort  will soon be released, not on a stage, however, but at the movies:  advertisements for "Cousins," Metcalfe's adaptation of the French film, "Cousin  Cousine," have already reached local theaters.  </P> <P> PROGRAM NOTES: Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds, who won the San Diego Critics Circle  award for best actress last year, will appear in "Catch Me If You Can," playing  Jan. 9-Feb. 18 at the Lawrence Welk Dinner Theatre. . . . Allison Brennan, who  last wowed local audiences with her performance in "Hard Times" at the San  Diego Repertory Theatre season before last, will replace Los Angeles actress  Barbara Sohmers as the weary daughter of an elderly tall-tale-telling idealist  in "I'm Not Rappaport," at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre Jan. 18-Feb. 26.  Sohmers bowed out when she landed television work. . . . Don't bother waiting  for Steve Martin or Robin Williams at this one, but you can start "Waiting for  Godot" at the Marquis Public Theatre in March. The choice of this play by  Samuel Beckett continues in a line of thoughtful, and thus far effective  classical choices at the Marquis that have included "Six Characters in Search  of an Author," "Madwoman of Chaillot" and "Rashomon." The cast for "Rashomon"  will go into rehearsal for "Godot" when that play closes Jan. 14. . . . "A  Raisin in the Sun," Lorraine Hansberry's classic story about a black family  torn apart by conflicting dreams of how to leave poverty behind, premieres with  Esther Rolle and Danny Glover on American Playhouse on KPBS-TV (Channel 15) on  Feb. 1 from 8-11 p.m. . . . Performance artist Rachel Rosenthal will present  "Rachel's Brain" at Sushi Gallery on Feb. 3-4. . . . San Diego's homeless will  be the headliners when director John Malpede of the Los Angeles Poverty  Department returns to Sushi Gallery for the last weekend in February to  organize them in a series of talent shows.  </P></p>

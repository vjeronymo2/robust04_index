			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Russia and west split on Europe's security Growing differences between most western nations and Russia over the future of European security are expected to surface at a conference of 53 nations which begins today in Budapest. Russian officials want the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to be transformed from a weak talking shop into a powerful institution which could effectively manage the division of Europe and the former Soviet Union into western and Russian spheres of influence. The ideas mooted by Russia include the creation of a 10-nation steering committee - with the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany as permanent members, and the other seats rotating - that could intervene in conflicts and allocate peacekeeping mandates. During the recent ceremonies in Berlin marking the Russian withdrawal from Germany, General Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, redoubled calls for the CSCE to become the apex of a new European security structure which would subsume both Nato and the Commonwealth of Independent States. In Russia's vision, the CSCE committee would license Nato, the CIS or forces drawn from both blocs to maintain peace in regional trouble spots. Most western nations, in particular the US and Britain, have rejected this idea out of hand, but senior German officials have suggested there is room for a little movement in the direction Russia is proposing. Germany and the Netherlands have aired proposals for the CSCE to become a kind of intermediary between its members and the United Nations, but this has met with a cool response from English-speaking countries. Critics have suggested that Russia wants to use the CSCE to gain as much influence as possible over the decisions of Nato, while gaining maximum freedom of action for its own military activities in the southern republics of the CIS. Western CSCE members were taken aback during the summer by Russia's abrupt withdrawal of support from a draft set of 'peacekeeping guidelines', apparently because the text provided for too much western influence over Russia's military posture in central Asia and Transcaucasia. Other versions of the text - giving Russia a freer hand  - have been endorsed by Moscow but so far rejected by the west. The two-month meeting which starts today will provide an important sign of the success or failure of Russia's diplomatic offensive. President Boris Yeltsin wants the session to culminate in December with a meeting attended by himself, President Bill Clinton and as many other leaders of CSCE nations as possible. But it remains unclear whether the US president will go to Budapest.</p>

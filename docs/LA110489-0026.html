			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROSSELLI, ALEMANY RALLY TO DEFEAT ST. FRANCIS  </P> <P> Unfazed by Alemany High's slow start in a Del Rey League game at home Friday  night, Joey Rosselli threw four second-half touchdown passes to lift the  Indians over St. Francis, 32-17.  </P> <P> Rosselli, a left-handed senior, found Richard Dice on touchdown passes of 33,  45 and 33 yards and Brian Brison on one of 44 yards to erase a 17-7 halftime  deficit.  </P> <P> "I knew we would score," said Rosselli, who entered the week with a Valley-area  high 1,584 yards passing. He completed 18 of 26 for 301 yards. "The line gave  me that split second I needed to get the ball off. I got whacked afterward but,  hey."  </P> <P> Alemany (5-4 overall, 2-1 in league play) kept alive its hopes for a  second-place finish. St. Francis dropped to 1-8, 0-3.  </P> <P> Dice, a sophomore, made adjustments and was able to get behind the Golden  Knights' secondary on each scoring pass.  </P> <P> "Their defense was the opposite of what we were practicing this week," Dice  said. "Their corners would go back and stop and I would go right by them."  </P> <P> Initially, it appeared as if St. Francis was poised to cruise right by the  stunned Indians.  </P> <P> Pete Morales charged in from the two on fourth down with eight seconds to play  in the first half. Kevin Hurley added the extra point to give the Knights a  surprising 17-7 advantage.  </P> <P> The scoring drive was kept alive when John Willis connected with Mike Torres on  a 38-yard pass to the Alemany 18. On the following play, Torres caught a  10-yard pass to put St. Francis in scoring range.  </P> <P> Morales, a 6-foot, 205-pound senior, gained 100 yards in 18 carries before  intermission.  </P></p>

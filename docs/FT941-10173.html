			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: PPG paint deal with Akzo near completion Competition in the European market for painting cars during manufacture  - worth about Pounds 650m (Dollars 975m) a year - is likely to intensify following the German and Dutch authorities' approval last week of the sale of Akzo's share in the business to PPG, the US industrial coatings specialist. The takeover, now in the final stages of European Union approval, will reduce numbers of principal competitors to three - PPG; Herberts, the industrial coatings subsidiary of Hoechst, the German chemicals group; and BASF, another big German chemicals company. This rationalisation will allow each group to step up the fight for market share. Although Herberts and BASF dominate their national market, PPG is believed to have at least 35 per cent of total European sales, while industry sources estimate Herberts' European share at around 25 per cent and BASF's as approaching 20 per cent. Akzo claimed a 9 per cent share. ICI withdrew from the market last month when it abandoned IDAC, a six-year joint venture with Du Pont based near Cologne. Du Pont will continue alone, with what was claimed as an 11 per cent share at the time of the break-up. Mr Austin O'Malley, managing director of PPG's European business, said yesterday he was expecting vigorous competition as PPG hurried to integrate Akzo technology, products, research and development. PPG's tactic will be to offer manufacturers the chance to completely outsource the painting process at a lower cost than buying materials and technical support at competitive prices and doing the job themselves, as now. PPG's acquisition of Akzo's business - coupled with an earlier alliance with Bollig and Kempe, a German spray painting specialist - will give it a full range of all the products and technologies involved.</p>

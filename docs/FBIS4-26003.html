			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China has attached  great importance to intellectual property protection and will  spare no efforts in further raising its current level of  intellectual property protection, according to a white paper  issued by the Information Office of the State Council here today.    The white paper says, the Chinese Government holds that the  intellectual property protection system plays a significant role  in promoting progress in science and technology, enriching  culture and developing the economy.    It functions both as an important institution ensuring the  normal running of the socialist market economy and as one of the  basic environments and conditions for conducting international  exchange and cooperation in science, technology, economy and  culture.    China considers the protection of intellectual property an  important part of its policy of reform and opening to the  outside world and of the building of its socialist legal system.    Beginning in the late 1970s, China has been formulating laws  and regulations for intellectual property rights [IPR]  protection, and has been participating in activities organized  by the relevant international organizations aimed at  strengthening international exchange and cooperation in the  field of intellectual property rights.    From its inception, China's intellectual property rights  protection system was directed towards the world and geared to  high international standards.    Spurred on by its reform and opening up, China has carried  on  its intellectual property protection legislation at a speed  never before known.    The white paper points out that since China joined the world  intellectual property organization in June, 1980, it has gained  accession to a number of international intellectual property  right protection pacts, including the Paris Convention for the  Protection of Industrial Property, the Treaty on Intellectual  Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits, the Madrid Agreement  for the International Registration of Trademarks, the Berne  Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,  the Universal Copyright Convention, the Convention for the  Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized  Duplication of Their Phonograms and the Patent Cooperation  Treaty.    Meanwhile, China has adopted a series of laws and  regulations  in this regard which include the Trademark Law, the Patent Law,  the Copyright Law and the Law on Combating Unfair Competition.    The basic framework for China's intellectual property rights  protection legal system was completed for the most part in the  1980s, says the white paper. In the 1990s, international  economic relations and the international economic environment  have already undergone great changes. In November, 1990,  multilateral trade negotiation in GATT's Uruguay Round produced  a draft agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual  property rights. This signaled that a new international  standard of intellectual property rights protection was taking  form.    The Chinese Government actively participated in the  negotiations and made unremitting efforts towards their final  success. In order to meet the needs of the ever-wider opening  up, China has consciously sought to fulfill its international  obligation in intellectual property rights protection,  endeavouring to bring its intellectual property protection level  near the new international standards, and has taken many major  measures to further raise its current level of intellectual  property rights protection.    The Chinese Government's sincerity in its efforts to  scrupulously abide by international conventions and bilateral  agreements regarding the protection of intellectual property  rights, its capacity to fully implement its international  obligations have been appreciated and supported by world opinion.    The white paper notes that when reviewing the World  Intellectual Property Organization's past 20 years of  cooperation with China, Dr. Arpad Bogsch, director-general of  the organization, pointed out that "China had accomplished all  this at a speed unmatched in the history of intellectual  property rights protection."    The white paper says that as the intellectual property  rights  protection system has only comparatively recently been  introduced in China, and some portion of the population has a  rather incomplete understanding of intellectual property rights,  China has spared no efforts in publicizing and providing  education about the intellectual property protection legal  system and in accelerating the training of professional  personnel in this field. In China the promulgation of every  intellectual property law was followed by widespread publicity  through the media and distribution of large quantities of  educational video-tapes and separate editions of the law.    In order to speed up the training of personnel in this  field,  the Chinese Government has, in close cooperation with related  international organizations, sent people abroad to study or to  attend training classes and seminars.    Together with the world intellectual property organization,  China has held more than 30 training classes and seminars, with  the attendance of over 3,000 people. Programs in intellectual  property rights education and research have also been initiated  at over 70 institutions of higher learning throughout the  country, the white paper says.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (18):  More refinement is still needed - A Pep currently offers a higher-rate taxpayer a better return than a building society. But changes to the rules, and more ingenuity by the institutions, may be necessary if the small saver is to be attracted THE FUTURE of the personal equity plan looks a lot brighter than it did a year ago. First, Chancellor Norman Lamont did the sensible thing and allowed the vast majority of unit and investment trusts to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep limit. The need for investors to rely on the high-charging (and often poorly-performing) managed Peps disappeared overnight. Then, the Conservatives won the general election and the Labour party's plans for Pep reform evaporated for at least four years (although not before some dubious 'buy now while Peps last' marketing campaigns). At the end of 1992, the crash disappeared from five-year performance figures and the stock market reached record highs. At last, advisers had a realistic chance of persuading investors that equity-based products could offer higher rewards, and not just higher risks. Finally, the industry started to offer attractive new charging structures that rewarded long-term holders and reduced the burden of initial fees. One fundamental problem of Peps - that the charges often outweigh the tax benefits - has started to be addressed. With equities yielding around 4.4 per cent and base rates at 7 per cent at the end of 1992, a higher-rate investor could look forward to a post-tax income from Peps equal to, or higher than, that available from the building society - with the prospect of capital growth on top. Not that the result of all these favourable factors was an automatic boost for Pep sales. According to calculations by BESt Pep, an advisory service, Pep sales in the first half of the 1992-93 were actually slightly lower (at Pounds 900m) than in the first half of 1991-92. However, there had been a shift within the market towards unit trusts and away from managed Peps. Some perceive that a change in rules is needed to make Peps more successful. ProShare, the organisation established to promote wider share ownership, called for the creation of a 'MegaPep' to encourage those who come into lump sums, via inheritance or retirement, to invest their capital in equities immediately. Rather than the current annual limit of Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 6,000 in a general, and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company, Pep), the MegaPep would allow an individual to invest a maximum of Pounds 80,000 over a rolling eight-year period. Existing Peps could be rolled into the new scheme tax-free. And the Unit Trust Association called for gilts and corporate bonds to qualify for Peps, arguing that this would help the government to fund its growing borrowing requirement. But the government appeared to rule out the UTA's proposal in December, when it blocked a loophole in the rules allowing gilt funds to qualify for Pep status. What will really make Peps take off, however, is if they come to be perceived as tools for financial planning for specific events - such as paying off a mortgage or meeting school fees. To date, this market has been dominated by life insurance-related products, such as endowment policies. Whether this represents 'best advice' or simply the higher commissions available from life companies is open to question. Certainly, advisers would have some justification in arguing that Peps, by virtue of their youth, have not established the kind of long-term performance record which could allow investors to be reasonably certain that they will grow sufficiently to meet their commitments. But Peps do offer: tax-efficiency (no income or capital gains tax is payable on returns); flexibility (most make no redemption charge and the investor can easily transfer allegiance to a new plan manager at the start of a new tax year); and (on some plans) relatively low charges. If held for the long term (at least five years), they are a highly attractive product. More sophisticated investors are fully aware of the Pep's advantages. Some have been using their annual allowances to shelter their existing portfolios; others have spotted the attractions of products such as Gartmore's index-tracking fund with a low front-end charge (Pounds 30 plus VAT when held in a Pep, available through the broker WI Carr) and a 0.5 per cent annual fee. But it takes a while for a new product to become accepted by the general investor. When selling Peps, a high-street name seems more important than a reputation for fund-management skills. Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest, TSB and the Bradford &amp; Bingley and Woolwich building societies all featured in the top 10 for sales in the first half of the current tax year. Realistically, it is only these institutions that have much hope of achieving the government's original aim when it established Peps - that of persuading the small saver to invest in shares. But they may yet need to make further refinements to the product (such as the guarantee of no capital loss, as offered by Legal &amp; General) before the Pep can break out of its niche and into the main market.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    PEPS: VALUE OF FUNDS IN PLANS, WITH A BREAKDOWN BY TYPE OF HOLDING  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       Type of holding                                Value                                   of           Unit  Inv.                                funds   Total  trust  trust  Shares  Cash                             Pounds m       %      %      %       %    %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 1987                    440     100     15      1      68   16 December 1988                    720     100     13      5      68   14 April 1990                     2,600     100     31      3      53   13 April 1991                     4,520     100     32      4      54   10 April 1992 -                  Total plans   6,970     100     33      8      51    8                General plans   6,700     100     34      8      50    8         Single-company plans     270     100                    78   22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Inland Revenue statistics 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

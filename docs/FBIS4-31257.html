			<p>BFN     [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, June 7 (AFP) -- The only  road link between Albania and Montenegro has been closed to  traffic for five days, a local daily reported Tuesday. The  Albanian authorities have forbidden any vehicles from crossing  into or out of Montenegro -- which together with Serbia forms  rump-Yugoslavia -- at Bozaj, said Lazar Jankovic, spokesman for  the Yugoslav Commission for Border Incidents, quoted Tuesday by  the local daily POBJEDA. The road is open to pedestrians.    The Albanian authorties apparently took the action after  Albanian truck drivers had blocked the border because, Jankovic  said, they were "unhappy at the changing criteria imposed by  Yugoslav customs officials." Since a total embargo was imposed  on Yugoslavia two years ago, the Bozaj border-control post has  become the focus of traffic in oil and other supplies for the  Yugoslav market. Several Montenegrins were arrested recently by  Albanians for trafficking oil, according to rumours which  Montengrin authorities refuse to confirm.    PJOBEDA said it had learnt from unoffical sources that six  policemen and a Montenegrin customs officer were being  questioned for their role in the trafficking.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australian golds ebullient as Japan remains subdued SHARE prices moved within a narrow range on continued fears that the bribery scandal which shook the market on Tuesday could spread further, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average finally rose marginally on investment trust support, closing 45.58 higher at 19,590.00 after a low of 19,433.99 and a high of 19,616.81. Trading was dominated by arbitrage-related selling, and buying by investment trusts and some overseas investors. Volume remained subdued at 230m shares against 229m. Losers led gainers by 594 to 395, with 166 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.01 to 1,580.25 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.31 to 1,195.10. Most investors remained on the sidelines after Tuesday's 1.7 per cent fall, which followed the arrests of general contractor executives and Mr Toru Ishii, mayor of Sendai in northern Japan, on allegations of bribery. Officials at Hazama, Shimizu, Nishimatsu Construction and Mitsui Construction were charged with giving a combined Y100m in bribes to Mr Ishii. Shares of construction companies were sold heavily in the morning, but the sector ended mixed on buying by overseas investors and investment trusts. Nishimatsu fell Y20 to Y990 and Mitsui lost Y3 to Y502, but Shimizu ended up Y6 to Y826. Rohm, a leading maker of integrated circuits, drew heavy buy orders at the start of the session on reports that the company had won a patent on flash memory chips, a next generation technology, in the US. The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading to allow investors to confirm the news. Large capital issues were slack on arbitrage selling. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, fell Y3 to Y366, while Mitsubishi Heavy lost Y20 to Y710. Brokers also lost ground on fears of lower profits due to the recent fall in market turnover. Nomura Securities fell Y20 to Y1,950 and Daiwa Securities lost Y20 to Y1,250. Game makers were in favour among traders. Sega Enterprises gained Y240 to Y10,000, recovering the level for the first time since April, and Nintendo advanced Y100 to Y9,600. Konami, which also supplies liquid crystal displays for pachinko games, Japanese pinball machines, rose Y220 to a new year's high of Y5,320 on a rise in shipments. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 113.89 to 21,680.39 in volume of 13.1m shares. Roundup EBULLIENCE in Australian golds conflicted with muted sentiment in Hong Kong and Singapore. Pakistan was closed at the start of a four-day holiday. AUSTRALIA closed its financial year with another lift from gold stocks. Bullion traded at around USDollars 380 an ounce in Sydney with brokers predicting that it would test the USDollars 400 level in the short term, and the gold share index rose 54.2 to 1,928.3. Most blue chips were also higher, led by strength in National Australia Bank as book-balancing dominated trade. The All Ordinaries index rose 19.6 to 1,738.1, while turnover rose from ADollars 392m to ADollars 407m. Among gold stocks, Kidston rose 28 cents to ADollars 2.40 and Placer 15 cents to ADollars 3.10. National Australia Bank rose 10 cents to ADollars 9.88 and Western Mining 16 cents to ADollars 5.80 NEW ZEALAND edged up to a new 1993 high, thanks mostly to a four-cent gain in Fletcher Challenge to NZDollars 2.79. The NZSE-40 index rose 1.32 to 1,680.66 in healthy turnover of NZDollars 40m with Fletcher Challenge attracting some NZDollars 11.15m.

SEOUL saw institutional intervention in financial shares as the composite index rose 3.18 to 748.87 in turnover up from Won451.3bn to Won526.9bn. The financial sub-index added 8.24 to 1020.95 and Kepco gained Won300 to Won17,600. MANILA closed higher for the third straight day, fuelled by a technical rally and efforts by companies to improve their second quarter performance reports.

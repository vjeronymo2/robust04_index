			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The exhibit at the end of this document outlines the tiered screening approach proposed in paragraphs (c)(1)&hyph;(4) to guide issuance of grazing permits in compliance with NEPA procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Klamath, Mendocino, Shasta-Trinity, and Six Rivers National Forests in the state of California are without approved forest plans. Under the provisions of the planning regulations (36 CFR 219.29) these national forests continue to be managed under existing land use and resource plans. In such cases, provisions of proposed paragraph (c)(1), (3), and (4) would provide a reasonable mechanism for the continuation of livestock operations which are in compliance with the terms and conditions of their permits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is committed to the long term improvement of rangeland condition. Therefore, proposed paragraph (c)(5) would require the authorized officer to develop and maintain a schedule for rangeland project decisions and site specific disclosure of environmental effects on affected allotments pursuant to NEPA procedures. These schedules will be developed in consultation with grazing permittees and other interested parties. Priority for scheduling the completion of rangeland project decisions will be given to those areas with significant resource concerns such as protection of threatened and endangered species, riparian and aquatic habitat, and water quality. These schedules are necessary to ensure an orderly transition for completion of rangeland project decisions through both the short term (1&hyph;3 years) and long term (10&hyph;13 years). It it not the intent of the transitional procedures proposed in this section to avoid or delay the completion of rangeland project decisions, but rather to complete rangeland project decisions on all allotments within 13 years from the effective date of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(6) of this section clarifies that where grazing permits are issued under the transitional procedures of paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (3), and (4), the timely issuance of a grazing permit is an administrative act and not a separate decision subject to additional NEPA analysis and disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(7) of this section states that adoption of these rules would not compel the agency to immediately initiate rangeland project planning and decisionmaking. This provision is necessary to prevent any claim or assertion that, upon the effective date of this rule, the agency would intend to immediately initiate rangeland project decisions for issuance or renewal of all grazing permits. This provision also provides the necessary transitions from the current allotment-by-allotment decisionmaking process to a more streamlined process for future decisionmaking in an orderly and planned manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) of &sect;222.3 of the proposed rule requires the authorized officer to delineate lands suitable and authorized for grazing use into allotments. The introductory text retains the current policy of including nonfederal lands in an allotment where doing so would form logical management units. Proposed paragraph (d)(1) would require that maps delineating allotments must be on file at the office of the District Ranger. Proposed paragraph (d)(2) would make clear that the delineation of allotments is merely an administrative act and not a decision subject to further NEPA analysis for disclosure of environmental effects. The intent is to eliminate confusion and future disputes over the decision point, the requisite environmental disclosure requirements, and administrative appeal opportunities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, proposed &sect;222.3 would make clear that planning and decisionmaking for National Forest System rangeland management, including authorization of livestock grazing use, is a two-level process, just as is the case for all other National Forest resources. As a consequence, the agency would discontinue the use of the allotment management plan. Additionally, this section signals the agency's intent and provides the foundation for moving toward an ecological approach to rangeland management decisions. Under an ecological approach, the agency will seek to focus on appropriate larger geographic scales for ecological analysis purposes, while incorporating and building on the best science available to ensure the sustainability of the land to continue to produce goods and services to meet public demand. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the ANPR, the Department specifically asked the public for input on appropriate scales of rangeland ecosystem analysis. Public comments received support a broader scope of analysis and planning with consideration of the human element of the ecosystem. However, mandating a particular hierarchical level of analysis for planning is inappropriate in this proposed rule on rangeland management. The framework for overall agency land management planning and planning for all resources must be set out in a cohesive and integrated way in the agency's land management planning regulations in Part 219. Accordingly, the comments received on the scales of rangeland ecosystem analysis and planning in response to the ANPR on rangeland management will be considered in the agency's development of a proposed revision of the land management planning regulations, which is now underway. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Section 222.4_General Provisions Applicable to All Grazing Permits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section of the proposed rule establishes some of the fundamental ground rules governing grazing on National Forest System land and other lands under Forest Service control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 222.4(a) of the proposed rule is essentially the same as &sect;222.3(a) of the current rule and provides that grazing activities require written authorization in the form of a grazing permit. Similar to current practice, certain minor exceptions for temporary grazing are allowed under proposed &sect;222.6(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At &sect;222.4(b), the proposed rules describes the permit as a privilege subject to the terms and conditions contained therein. As in the current rule, &sect;222.3(b), proposed &sect;222.4(b) states that the grazing permit does not convey any right, title, or interest in United States lands, resources, or permanent range improvements to the permittee. This is entirely consistent with statutory and case law which, for nearly a century has recognized grazing permits as a license or privilege to use federal lands for grazing activities which can be revoked at anytime without requiring the payment of compensation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;222.4(c) states that the issuance of the grazing permit implements an existing decision to authorize grazing and that issuance of the permit is an administrative act that is not a decision point subject to NEPA procedures as provided in &sect;222.3(b)(3) of this subpart. This provision is intended to eliminate the confusion of permittees and the public regarding the role of the grazing permit in management of National Forest System rangelands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

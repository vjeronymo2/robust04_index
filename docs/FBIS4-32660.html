			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E. Ambrozic: "President Tudjman Is Ignoring the </F> Istrian Reality"]    [Text] Pula -- "It is good that the main celebration to  mark the Day of Antifascism in Croatia was held in Istria, for  that proved the importance of the Istrian peninsula in this  country," said Ivan Jakovcic, president of the IDS [Istrian  Democratic Congress], at a news conference yesterday. He  emphasized that antifascism made it possible for Istria to be  joined to its native country.    Jakovcic said that President Tudjman could not have said a  part of his speech delivered in Pazin on Wednesday anywhere else  but in Istria, and that the speech was an attempt to restore the  Croatian reputation in the world, which has been seriously  tarnished. Jakovcic said that in Pazin President Tudjman had  proved himself consistent in denying everything that Istria had  achieved on its own. So it turned out, Jakovcic said, that  Istrian fighters could not have managed anything without the  help of fighters from other parts of Croatia, and that Istria  had not done anything in the past 50 years. Furthermore,  Jakovcic said that President Tudjman's speech implies that, in  the future, Istria would only be able to achieve anything under  the reign of the HDZ.    The IDS president is particularly worried that Franjo  Tudjman  is negating the election results in Istria, for he criticized  the commitment of Istrian voters to regionalism, coexistence,  and tolerance.    Jakovcic added that when the president of the Republic, who  also happens to be a historian, uses false information and says  that the Italians in Istria mostly supported Italian fascism,  then that is a blatant lie. Jakovcic also said that some people  in Istria did indeed support fascism, but they were in the  minority, and that there was an overwhelming number of  freedom-loving, democratically oriented people.    "Ignoring the fact that Istria and its civic, i.e. municipal  councils want to introduce bilingualism in their region,  President Tudjman displayed a complete lack of tolerance toward  Istria and the wishes of its inhabitants," Jakovcic said,  commenting on the president's speech in Istria. In Jakovcic's  opinion, Mr. Tudjman used a national holiday to promote the  political views of a party, which is quite improper.    Jakovcic also commented on the formation yesterday of a  presidential Council for Istria on the island of Brijuni and  said that this was, for a change, a new, somewhat more subtle  attempt to push through the HDZ vision of Istria and the HDZ  program. Jakovcic added that this attempt was indeed based on  the Constitution, but shows that the president is aware that the  HDZ is not able to win the trust of Istria with its program and  political views. Jakovcic considers the founding of the  presidential Council for Istria hypocritical, while Emil  Soldatic, IDS secretary, said that the masks have fallen, and  the Council advocates the HDZ Motovun program. Soldatic also  claims that it is now obvious that the "Dom" Society in Pazin is  nothing but a branch office, or transmission of the HDZ.  Furthermore, he wondered whether the HDZ and "Dom" are offering  Istria a civic society like Glavas's fief in Osijek, a town with  a similar destiny to Split's.    Jakovcic said that not a single member of the IDS, HSLS  [Croatian Social Liberal Party], SDP [Party of Democratic  Changes], and HSNZ [Croatian Party of Natural Law], was invited  to lunch with the president at Bijela Vila [White Villa] on  Brijuni, and that this gesture proved that the people in Istria  who voted at the latest elections were being ignored. The IDS  supports principled views of Istrian mayors and representatives  of the County of Istria who spurned the invitation.    Emil Soldatic said that the fact that former IDS member Ivan  Herak was present when the Council was formed, showed that Herak  "had come where he belonged," and that this move of Herak's is  interesting, since HSLS President Drazen Budisa told him Herak  would not go to Brijuni. "If that decision was made by the HSLS  after all, then one can say the party is the HDZ in sheep's  clothing and that the HDZ program is beginning to be realized in  Istria," said Soldatic.    Denis Jelenkovic, IDS member appointed to the Council for  Istria, was not on Brijuni, and Jakovcic repeated that the  County Assembly decided it would not send their members to the  Council, and if someone were to go against this decision, the  party would not ignore it. Jakovcic said that he was aware  Jelenkovic was trying to benefit Istria, but that it should not  be done through para-state institutions.    Asked to comment on the presence of the defense minister and  police at the constituent assembly of the Council for Istria,  Jakovcic replied that this could be explained by the view of  some HDZ members who hold that the problem of Istria can also be  solved with the army and police.    The IDS president also commented on the latest developments  in the Croatian Parliament and the negotiations between the  opposition and the ruling party, and concluded that the HDZ had  accepted a new proposition of the opposition, but that it was  obvious that the negotiating team of the ruling party was not  capable of implementing it as it had been agreed.</p>

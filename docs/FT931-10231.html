			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: IBM unveils machines to bolster mainframe market IBM, the US computer maker, has launched a range of products designed to persuade customers that mainframe computers will remain an important feature of corporate data processing. This is the company's first significant announcement since Mr John Akers said he would step down as chief executive. The statement, packed with technical detail, would be of interest chiefly to data processing specialists were it not for IBM's financial difficulties and the central role mainframe computers have played in the company's history. It unveiled 18 new machines, some air cooled, some water cooled, in its flagship Enterprise Systems range. One model, comprising eight processors coupled together is said to be the world's most powerful general purpose computer. No prices have been announced; IBM strikes individual deals with customers. IBM lost money in 1991 and 1992 in a reversal of its earlier easy mastery of the computer business. Its Dollars 4.9bn loss in 1992 was the largest in US corporate history. Its financial difficulties have been attributed largely to its fixation with mainframes. They are large, expensive machines which command high gross profit margins but which are increasingly unpopular with customers. They favour smaller, less expensive computers and desk top systems linked together in networks, a trend called client-server computing. IBM's move seems designed to convince doubtful buyers that mainframes have a legitimate role both in client-server designs and in open systems. Mr Nicholas Donofrio, general manager of the company's Enterprise Systems division said: 'People think we are just in the mainframe business. In fact we are in the large problem solving business. Compared to the traditional mainframe market, this is a much broader opportunity. It is a Dollars 150bn market which will grow at about 7 per cent over the next five years.' However, he added that IBM's traditional opportunities would probably shrink over the next four years. IBM's mainframe revenues are reckoned to have declined by about 15 per cent, to Dollars 9.3bn From Dollars 10.9bn last year. However, computer experts said that for many data processing applications there was no substitute for the raw power and flexibility of a mainframe. These include, for example, airline reservation systems, where transactions involving thousands of individual requests have to be processed simultaneously. Among yesterday's announcement was a batch of software products which would make it easier for mainframes to act as system manager in a client-server network. There was an open systems version of its operating system MVS - the crucial software which manages the working of the computer and determines which applications it can handle. Within hours of the launch in Europe yesterday, Siemens Nixdorf of Germany announced its own eight processor mainframes, also using an open operating environment.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Automotive side behind rise to Pounds 1.97m at Ricardo Ricardo Group, the engineering consultancy, more than doubled pre-tax profits for the six months to end-December. They rose from Pounds 875,000 to Pounds 1.97m on turnover of Pounds 30.1m. The previous turnover of Pounds 31.7m included Pounds 2.92m from the discontinued technical publications business. The 1992 figures also showed a loss of Pounds 197,000 from the technical publishing division, sold in spring 1992, as well as interest payments of Pounds 54,000 from discontinued operations. The group also took a Pounds 650,000 exceptional property charge. Stripping out the exceptional items leaves profit on continuing activities before tax for the first half up nearly 11 per cent from Pounds 1.78m to Pounds 1.97m. Mr Christopher Ross, chief executive, attributed the rise to the continued strong performance of the automotive division, one of the top three in the world. This had won market share, although at some cost to margins. Its turnover rose from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 14.1m. Turnover in the nuclear-based high technology division also rose, from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 6.4m. But the aerospace division's sales fell from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 9.5m, reflecting the downturn in the world industry. Net interest payable on continuing operations fell from Pounds 191,000 to Pounds 118,000, and gearing at the year end was under 4 per cent (20.2 per cent). Earnings per share were up from 1p to 3.9p. The interim dividend has been raised from 1.9p to 2p. Mr Ross said the prospects for this year were good. The group had launched a limited slip differential gear, aimed at the family car and patented worldwide. 'We now have to turn a technical success into a commercial success.' Earlier this week Ricardo added a further division with the acquisition for Dollars 2.26m (Pounds 1.54m) of Airflow Sciences Corporation, a Detroit-based company that looks at fluid flow and heat transfer problems. 'It has few competitors and is a science we can already understand and manage,' said Mr Ross.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Fang Yuan (2455 0337): "In Li Peng's </F> Government Work Report, Passage Concerning Hong Kong Will Be  Amended in Response to Deterioration of Sino-British Relations"]    [Text] According to sources in Beijing, after the Hong  Kong Legislative Council passed the first part of Governor  Patten's constitutional reform package, after the British side  unilaterally publish the White Paper on the happenings in the  Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political arrangements and  after Patten brought the remaining part of his reform package to  the Legislative Council, in addition to a series of reactions  that the Chinese side has made and will make, the relevant  passage in the government work report Premier Li Peng will  deliver to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress [NPC] next month also will be amended correspondingly.    Reportedly, in the draft of the government work report for  soliciting opinions, the passage on the Hong Kong issue is  placed in the sixth part, entitled "Actively Advancing the  Motherland's Peaceful Reunification." The Hong Kong issue is  mentioned there, together with the issues of Taiwan and Macao.  The gist of the passage is: With time elapsing, the date for  China to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and  Macao is drawing near. The British side must bear complete  responsibility for the termination of the Sino-British talks on  arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong. We hope  the British Hong Kong authorities will not move farther and  farther ahead along the wrong course. No matter what twists and  turns there are, the Chinese Government and people have the  determination and ability to resume the exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong on time, and are full of confidence in  guaranteeing Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity.    By contrast, the gist of the passage on the Macao issue is:  Since the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration,  cooperation between China and Portugal on the Macao issue has  made smooth progress, and we are satisfied with this.    It was generally held that the passage of the government  work  report (draft for soliciting opinions) concerning Hong Kong was  mildly worded and still left some leeway. It was not quite  different from what Li Peng said at the Spring Festival gala,  and did not express anything new. As the draft was written  before the recent political events in Hong Kong, it was expected  that the passage concerning Hong Kong would be amended before  the official delivery of the report.    Last year, at the First Session of the Eighth NPC, Li Peng  made a major impromptu amendment when reading the relevant  passage in his government work report. At that time, the Hong  Kong governor had just gazetted part of his constitutional  reform package. Li Peng added the following passage: "Now, the  British side again has placed artificial obstacles to  cooperation, and the British Government must bear whole  responsibility for all serious consequences caused by this  action."    The sources in Beijing said: Because Sino-British relations  this year have become worse, added to the recent events, Li  Peng's amended government work report will express the Chinese  side's stronger attacks against the British side, and such words  as "it is hoped that the British Hong Kong authorities will..."  are to be deleted and replaced with a call for Hong Kong people  to unite and make contributions to maintaining Hong Kong's  stability and prosperity. It is still unknown whether the work  report will reiterate the point that the three-tiered council  structure built by the British Hong Kong authorities will be  completely brought to an end on 1 July 1997.    In short, at the coming NPC session, the passage on Hong  Kong  issues in Li Peng's government work report may again include  something "impromptu" like that of last year.</p>

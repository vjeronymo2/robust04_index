			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ASKED ABOUT: DISTINCTIVE ROSIN-COVERED POTATOES  </P> <P> Question: I came across a recipe in "Joy of Cooking" (Bobbs-Merrill: 1986)  called Potatoes Cooked in Resin. Can you tell me what kind of resin they are  referring to and where I can purchase it?  </P> <P> Answer: Others must have had the same question because in the newest edition of  this cookbook authors Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Rombauer Becker change the  spelling to rosin and include the following information:  </P> <P> ". . . no other method turns out a potato so distinctively flaky. Allow a  minimum of three hours for this recipe; because of the fumes, never try it  indoors. Rosin can be purchased at athletic and dance supply stores."  </P> <P> However, in researching the safety of this recipe, we discovered that neither  the U.S. Department of Agriculture nor the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  were aware of the exact identity of the rosin used or its function in this  recipe. Perhaps readers familiar with this cooking technique will share their  thoughts.  </P> <P> For those who don't have a copy of the cookbook, we provide the recipe:  </P> <P> Place 15 to 25 pounds rock rosin in a three-gallon iron kettle or galvanized  bucket. The rosin may be used repeatedly. Heat it to 275 degrees over a grill  or hot plate. Carefully lower into it on a large slotted wooden-handled spoon,  one at a time, six large baking potatoes.  </P> <P> After about 45 minutes in the simmering rosin they will float to the surface.  Simmer them 30 minutes longer. Remove one potato and wrap in heavy brown paper,  twisting the ends tightly. Let cool 10 minutes and serve. If the texture is not  exceptional, cook the remaining potatoes 10 minutes more before testing.  </P> <P> Serve with butter, salt and freshly ground pepper. Avoid eating the  rosin-covered skins.  </P> <P> Q: Would you please give the vital statistics -- calories, vitamins, minerals,  etc. -- for jicama, kiwi, chayote and sunchokes? I can't find them in any table  of food composition.  </P> <P> A: We were able to find the following information for kiwi and sunchokes in  "Nutritive Value of Foods," U.S. Department of Agriculture Home &amp; Garden  Bulletin Number 72:  </P> <P> Kiwi -- 1 (about 5 per pound with skin), raw, without skin contains 45  calories, 1 gram protein, a trace of fat, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 11 grams  carbohydrate, 20 milligrams calcium, 30 milligrams phosphorus, 0.3 milligrams  iron, 252 milligrams potassium, 4 milligrams sodium, 130 international units  Vitamin A, 0.02 milligrams thiamine, 0.04 milligrams riboflavin, 0.4 milligrams  niacin and 74 milligrams ascorbic acid.  </P> <P> Sunchoke (Jerusalem-artichoke) -- 1 cup raw, sliced contains 115 calories, 3  grams protein, a trace of fat, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 26 grams carbohydrate,  21 milligrams calcium, 117 milligrams phosphorus, 5.1 milligrams iron, 644  milligrams potassium, 6 milligrams sodium, 30 international units Vitamin A,  0.30 milligrams thiamine, 0.09 milligrams riboflavin, 2.0 milligrams niacin and  6 milligrams ascorbic acid.  </P> <P> Although we could not find a complete breakdown for chayote and jicama, in  "Fresh Produce A to Z" (Lane Publishing: 1987) the editors of Sunset books and  magazine say "Chayote provides some Vitamin A and potassium. A 3 1/2-ounce  portion of raw chayote has 28 calories" and "Jicama is high in potassium and a  fair source of Vitamin C. One cup of shredded raw jicama contains about 50  calories."  </P> <P> Elizabeth Schneider, author of "Uncommon Fruits and Vegetables -- A Commonsense  Guide" (Harper &amp; Row, 1986) adds that both chayote and jicama are low in  sodium.  </P></p>

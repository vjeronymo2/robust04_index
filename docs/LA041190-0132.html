			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> WILLIAM WEGMAN GOES BACK TO THE FUTURE  </P> <P> William Wegman's 21 recent photographs at Linda Cathcart Gallery, which date  from the past 15 months, show the artist working at top form. The pictures  range from the decidedly fashion-conscious -- the artist's Weimaraner, Fay Ray,  eloquently modeling haute-couture finery for the camera -- to the high-mindedly  formal, in doggy portraits whose chiarascuro effects are exquisitely arrayed. A  few even manage to straddle these two poles, with Fay decked out as if in  preparation for photographic enshrinement in some official hall of fame.  </P> <P> At James Corcoran Gallery, meanwhile, Wegman shows seven recent paintings and  10 works on paper. Childlike renderings on gentle fields of washed color, the  New Yorker's paintings have only been seen here once before, in a small 1988  show at Thomas Solomon's Garage. This larger display is welcome, if only  because it helps to bring into focus the artist's otherwise seemingly  disconcerting decision a few years back to begin painting at all.  </P> <P> When Wegman began to make videotapes and photographs 20 years ago, his work  emerged from the larger suspicion of the day that painting, as a medium, was  moribund, gelled in an aspic of pompous rhetoric. Wegman's simple tapes and  snapshots, underscored by boy-and-his-dog subject matter and sight-gag wit,  emphasized a "homemade" quality that effectively knocked art off its lofty  pedestal.  </P> <P> That unpretentious, homemade element is evident in Wegman's doodle-like drawing  style, both in the works on paper and in the new paintings. What's curious  about the latter is the washy fields of mottled color on which the images, many  adapted from elementary school textbooks, are arrayed. These colorfully stained  fields are executed in the very style of abstract painting Wegman successfully  sought to undermine from the start. A poignantly lyrical quality emerges from  the strongest of them, "Evolutionary Aquarium" and "Social Studies," and the  titles tell you why.  </P> <P>  Through April 21 at Linda Cathcart Gallery, 924 Colorado Ave., and James  Corcoran Gallery, 1325 5th St., both in Santa Monica.  </P></p>

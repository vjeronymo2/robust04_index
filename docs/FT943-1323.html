			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (4): A walk on the waterside in Britain's cities - New horizons on old waste sites Marina developments. Two boring words that strike pleasure into the heart of any UK property developer. In truth, these areas are often relics of the Industrial Revolution - old ports well suited to conversion. They can give new life to their cities, providing space and visual pleasure. And, usually, they are next to city centres - often because they were the reason the city was founded. Now that the Department of the Environment is tilting against edge-of-town greenfield sites for development, these brownfield/grey-water sites are an alternative to regenerate Britain's great cities and clean up industrial wasteland. In its heyday, around 1913, Cardiff, the Welsh capital, supplied coal from the south Wales valleys for the world's steamships. But this rich commerce had to take into account the extraordinary tides in the Bristol Channel. For 14 hours a day Cardiff Bay is mudflats. Boats laden with coal could leave only at high tide. The Coal Exchange in Mount Stuart Square (the pre-first world war equivalent of OPEC headquarters) had clocks flanking the entrance to the trading floor to indicate tidal times. Today the tides, which can rise and fall more than 30 feet, are the reason for the largest scheme in the regeneration of waterfront Cardiff  - the building of a barrage across the bay to pen in a 500-acre freshwater lake with a stable water level that will be a haven for watersport enthusiasts. After many delays, work has started and the barrage should be completed in 1998. This huge space of water will lie between Penarth on the west and the inner harbour of Cardiff to the east, which is the centre of the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation's schemes for new housing, jobs, facilities and shops around the old coal port. (The working port is the adjacent Queen Alexandra Dock, which dates to Cardiff's prosperous years.) The port at Penarth is already the Portway Village marina and is set, like town squares, around two dock basins under the dominating presence of the old customs house on the cliff above. Camper and Nicholsons runs the marina, a development by Crest Nicholson (its joint company with Crest), which has about 230 boats permanently. Two housing units are still available, and some are for resale. With visiting boats, 18 per cent up on last year, it always has something to watch. 'I'd like the activity - and the barbecue parties here,' says Pat Lewis, who moved from the Midlands to be housing strategy manager for CBDC. The tides make for exciting trips on a Bristol Channel cruising route that stretches from Padstow, in Cornwall, to Gloucester, says marina manager Charles Bush. Once it has a stable water level, Cardiff Bay will become a major venue for boating, he says. In Cardiff, access to the port has been improved. The new peripheral distributor road, which links Cardiff Bay with the M4, has been put in a tunnel and a boulevard, to be called Bute Avenue, will lead from the city centre to the waterfront. A new opera house for the Welsh National Opera, and a 'virtual reality' cinema will join the Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum, Techniquest (a hands-on science museum) and a Harry Ramsden's for fish and chips. Job opportunities are rising with several new offices - including NatWest's resuscitation of its grandiose bank of 1916 in West Bute Street, another symbol of Cardiff's wealth. Nippon Electric Glass and Schott of Germany have recently invested Pounds 200m in a new factory. Cardiff is different from ports such as Manchester and Liverpool. Its history as a coaling port means that it needed only large flat areas to dump its product. There are no warehouses to turn into flats, except for the isolated conversion by Lovell, a few years ago, of a Spillers' flour warehouse. Instead, it gives a rare chance to use lots of space to build a high-quality townscape from scratch, which is CBDC's aim. People may enjoy living and working around the inner harbour - and praying; they will have an Anglo-Catholic church, a Greek Orthodox church and a mosque within 100 yards of each other. The new housing schemes have a target of 6,000 units, with 1,700 built or being built. Barratt, Beaser, Tarmac, Westbury and Windsor Quay are the developers for a variety of housing, of which 25 per cent will be social. The whole is an exciting plan to reunite a city with its roots in the water. Swansea's wealth was in metalworking, but only two chimney stacks are left of the 300 that were there at the turn of the century. Two years ago it opened its barrage at the mouth of the river Tawe, creating a lake with excellent moorings and eliminating the mudflats problem. A licence for the lock costs Pounds 80 a year. Inside the barrage is the water entrance to the marina at the south dock. It closed in 1969, but the decision in the 1970s to make a maritime quarter created the country's first marina on old industrial land. The scheme finished in the mid-1980s - although one housing site and two leisure sites await development. Grosvenor Waterside, the development arm of ABP, has plans for the less used part of the eastern commercial docks, using public and private money and providing everything from sheltered housing to Pounds 200,000 homes. Westrec of the US, a Marina management company, took Swansea marina on as its first in Europe, and aims to raise the 66 per cent occupancy of berths by providing better facilities and, probably, a club for owners (most of whom live within 25 miles of Swansea). In London the Chelsea Harbour development by P &amp; O sits on an old coal dock and goods yard. Residents value its security and quiet, the harbour club and restaurants, a nearby supermarket, and stunning views. (For the best view of it take a helicopter from the Battersea heliport across the river.) A car is necessary since it is a long walk to the London Underground. The marina has 55 berths (at Pounds 160 a year per metre) and can be left or entered 90 minutes either side of high tide. Yachts may repair to the Harbour's five-star Conrad hotel. The 310 units in the eight blocks are all sold, bar a house or flat or two. But about 10 per cent are for resale at any time, at prices from Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 1.3m. Rentals are also available. Harbour Estates is the agent on the spot. Beaney Pearce, Parkway, and Strutt &amp; Parker also offer flats for sale. In Edinburgh the decision to move the Scottish Office with 1,600 staff to the port of Leith has given an impetus to plans there. Known for its restaurants and wine bar, Leith now boasts an hotel converted from an 1883 sailors' home. (a joint project by Forth Ports and Ken Mculloch of One Devonshire Gardens hotel in Glasgow). Forth Ports has shops, offices and housing in train. Information: Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (0222-585 858); Chelsea Harbour Beaney Pearce (071-589 2333). Harbour Estates (071-351 2300).

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No reasonable and prudent alternatives may be available for some proposed actions. For example, due to the size of a unit or high levels of existing fragmentation, no level of habitat disturbance may be possible without resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. In these situations, the Service would issue an adverse modification biological opinion with no reasonable and prudent alternatives. The Service recommends that agencies initiate discussions at the earliest opportunity to help avoid this type of situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research on desert tortoises and their habitat may negatively affect critical habitat. Wherever possible, research should be conducted outside of CHUs, coordinated throughout the listed range of the tortoise, and based upon an approved long-term strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation Measures on Non-Federal Lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> State, private, and Tribal lands have been included within the designation of critical habitat. Critical habitat designation will not affect non-Federal lands except for actions that are authorized, funded, or carried out by a Federal agency. Actions on State and private lands will continue to be subject to section 9 of the Act, requiring an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act for any actions that may result in take of desert tortoises. This provision also will apply to actions on Tribal lands without a Federal nexus. Those with a Federal nexus will be subject to section 7 consultation under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9 of the Act prohibits intentional and non-intentional ``take'' of listed species and applies to all landowners regardless of whether or not their lands are within critical habitat. The term ``take,'' as defined by the Act, means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. ``Harass'' is defined as an intentional or negligent act or omission that creates the likelihood of injury to wildlife by annoying it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavioral patterns, which includes breeding, feeding, or sheltering. ``Harm'' in the definition of ``take'' means any action, including habitat modification, which actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering (50 CFR part 17).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10(a)(1)(B) authorizes the Service to issue permits for the taking of listed species incidental to otherwise lawful activities, such as housing development. Incidental take permit applications must be supported by a habitat conservation plan (HCP) that identifies conservation measures that the permittee agrees to implement to conserve the species. A key element of the Service's review of an HCP is a determination of the plan's effect upon the long-term conservation of the species. An HCP would be approved and a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit issued if it would minimize and mitigate the impacts of the taking and would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of that species in the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to limited Federal involvement, the Service expects that few, if any, formal section 7 consultations would be initiated for State lands that are included in critical habitat. The States are subject to the ``take'' prohibitions under section 9 of the Act, however, and may enter into the section 10 HCP process where appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Desert tortoises occurring on lands outside critical habitat boundaries are still subject to section 9 prohibitions. The Service envisions that the role of desert tortoise habitat in the conservation of the species will be addressed through section 7, the HCP process, the recovery planning process, and other appropriate State and Federal laws. On these lands, it is expected that recovery goals will be achieved through the use of other conservation mechanisms available to the Service and other landowners (e.g., land exchanges, conservation and development easements).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

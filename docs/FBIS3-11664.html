I want to officially  communicate on the part of the National Action Party [PAN] that  our party is suspending its presidential campaign until things  return to normal, out of respect for political equality and in  solidarity with the sorrow of Candidate Colosio's family and  because of our desire to help national emotions calm down and so  that sense and prudence will prevail.    Also, I want to tell you that I am in contact with Hector  Osuna, PAN mayor of Tijuana, who gave me the following report:  Yesterday, those responsible for security for Mr. Colosio's  delegation met with the mayor and with the person in charge of  security and asked them for all their support for Candidate  Colosio's tour. It was given immediately. The group charged  with security for Mr. Colosio said they only needed four patrol  cars because they did not foresee anything serious happening  except for maybe some demonstrations by some dissidents or  groups opposed to the PRI. Because of this, they were given  four patrol cars to clear the way for the presidential  candidate's delegation. This was confirmed this morning in a  breakfast with some members of the Army also in charge of  security and with Mr. Benitez, who is in charge of public  security for Baja California. I am saying this, so that it will  be clear that the PAN mayor of Tijuana offered as much help as  was requested. The persons in charge of security were not  anticipating anything serious except for perhaps some small  demonstrations by dissidents of the PRI in Tijuana.    [Zabludovsky] Do you mean that the scarce vigilance in  Tijuana Municipality, whose mayor is a member of the PAN, was  because the organizers of Mr. Colosio's rally felt that more  security was not needed?    [Castillo] That is right, sir. They only asked for four  patrol cars when the mayor's office was willing to give them  whatever they needed. They were given exactly what they asked  for.

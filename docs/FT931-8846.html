			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Sweden to join the rush for global issues THE international debt market is braced for a further onslaught of global deals today, when the previously-announced yen issue for the World Bank is expected to be launched. The World Bank is widely expected to raise between Y200bn-Y250bn through a 10-year deal priced to yield 25 to 26 basis points above the benchmark Japanese government bond No 145. Meanwhile, the Canadian province of Quebec's first global bond offering, a 30-year deal raising a larger-than-expected CDollars 1.4bn, was launched late yesterday. The issuer had said it would be raising a minimum of CDollars 1bn. Of the total amount raised, CDollars 150m was placed with the Caisse des Depots, the Quebec government pension fund, which an official at the joint lead manager, Merrill Lynch, said was a typical feature. He also confirmed market talk that the bond was practically sold out before its official launch. Quebec's issue is due to be priced today to yield 90-91 basis points above comparable Canadian government bonds, in line with market expectations. The Kingdom of Sweden joined the rush yesterday when it announced that it would be launching its first global bond in the near future. Syndicate managers expected the US dollar deal to be launched this week. This offering will almost complete the country's SKr230bn (Dollars 31bn) foreign borrowing programme which was announced late last year. To date, SKr200bn has been raised. Officials at Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers, which have been appointed as joint lead managers and book runners of the Swedish offering, said the issue was expected to raise around Dollars 2bn. Both the Canadian province of Ontario and the Republic of Finland have raised Dollars 3bn through global offerings in the past. Some syndicate managers said they expected the Swedish deal to be priced to yield 45-47 basis points above 10-year US Treasuries, though others said the pricing was more likely to be pitched in the low to mid-40s range. Mr Staffan Crona, director-general of the Swedish National Debt Office, said that after this deal, Sweden would continue to borrow in the foreign debt market but not as heavily as in recent months. He added that half of the funds raised to date in the foreign debt market have been used to shore up the Swedish central bank's foreign exchange reserves and the remainder has been used to finance the country's budget deficit. In the current fiscal year, ending June 30, the Swedish budget deficit is forecast to be SKr200m but is expected to narrow to SKr160bn in the next fiscal year. Elsewhere, the current fashion for Canadian dollar bonds continued as the European Investment Bank raised CDollars 350m via a seven-year deal priced to yield 27.5 basis points over the Canadian government bond yield curve. Syndicate managers said the EIB's deal had gone well considering it had been pitched at an area of the yield curve where there is little natural demand - there is no benchmark seven-year Canadian government bond, for example - and in view of its ungenerous pricing. All the recently-launched Canadian dollar Eurobonds have had maturities of three, five or 10 years, so the seven-year area stood out as the obvious gap, syndicate managers said. There were reports in the afternoon that the European Investment Bank was going to launch a Ecu500m seven-year Eurobond today. The bank's president, Mr Ernst-Gunther Broder, said in Lisbon that the EIB planned to issue up to Esc70bn worth of escudo Eurobonds in 1993, following a successful Esc10bn offering two weeks ago.</p>

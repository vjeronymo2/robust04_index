			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Can a trust go bust? - Briefcase Q&amp;A What is the probability of an investment trust or unit trust going bust? Both investment and unit trusts are collective investment schemes. Investment trusts are limited companies and unit trusts are constituted under a trust deed with an independent trustee. Unlike a public limited company, we believe a unit trust cannot, technically, go bust. In the case of investment trusts insolvency is, in practical terms, extremely remote. Performance figures for these investment vehicles are often difficult to examine because of the frequency of mergers and amalgamations. (Reply by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / One winner, lots of losers NIGEL SHORT is trailing by a dismal 2-6 margin, and he has overlooked yet another win in his growing catalogue of missed opportunities. The British challenger's long-standing guru and chief coach has returned home to the US; yet this has been a good week for Short, the breakaway Professional Chess Association and The Times world championship at London's Savoy Theatre. The games have been full of interest, sacrifices and complex tactics, as both Gary Kasparov and Short pushed hard for victories with the favourable white pieces. Audience numbers have held up well. Meanwhile at the rival Fide world championship in Amsterdam, where Anatoly Karpov leads Jan Timman 6 1/2 -4 1/2 , the players were so upset at the news that Oman has backed away from its commitment to provide a Pounds 900,000 prize fund for the second half of the match, that they agreed an 11-move draw. The Oman bid always sounded odd. The official version was that it was sparked by satellite photographs which showed eighth century chess sets and boards, the earliest known, in the desert at the junction of two camel routes. Later Timman heard that, besides himself and Karpov, only the royal family would be allowed into the playing hall. The match is due to transfer from the Netherlands next week, and the Fide president, Florencio Campomanes, is reported to be trying to patch up contingency plans for the series to switch to Hungary. Amsterdam city council have made a late donation of Pounds 65,000. The biter is certainly bit. When the original Fide bidding favoured Manchester, Campomanes said that other UK offers were invalidated by lack of bank guarantees, and that Fide had found by experience that non-guaranteed bids were unreliable. Kasparov later commented that The Times's Pounds 1.7m prize fund would demonstrate which was the real world championship, so when Fide claimed a Pounds 1.8m purse it was a moment for Campo to savour. But the evaporation of promised Dutch and Omani money is a huge embarrassment to Fide. And Fide's own finances often rely on a 25 per cent contribution from world championship prize funds. The other talking-point at the Savoy was the abrupt departure of Short's guru Lubosh Kavalek, who was widely credited with toughening up Short into a resilient match player. Short's manager, Michael Stean, said that Kavalek had returned home for family reasons, but Kavalek himself indicated that he had been dismissed and said 'I had intended to stay for the whole match. I think I prepared Nigel quite well.' Kasparov's has three experienced ex-Soviet GMs while Short's remaining team of analysts comprises the German No 1 Robert Huebner, Jon Speelman, the UK No 4 who is helping part time between television assignments, and Stean, whose active career stopped 10 years ago. There are no plans to add to the group, even though the match organisers were willing to consider flying in world no 3 Vishy Anand of India, a friend of Short's. Some observers believe that Kavalek and Speelman wanted to start the match cautiously, to compensate for Short's lack of title experience; but others in the camp preferred the gambits and open play which have entertained fans but conceded points to Kasparov. There is also disappointment among the many young English GMs and IMs who are keen students of chess theory that Short did not enlist their help. For these players, the ideas centre of the match is the grandmasters room at Simpsons-in-the-Strand, where Michael Adams, Tony Miles, Speelman and others hold court. On Thursday they predicted almost every move, and Adams found a subtle win which Short missed. Moves, Page XXIII</p>

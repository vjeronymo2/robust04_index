			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Labour's welfare plans 'would not lift taxes' An independent commission set up by the Labour party will today insist that its proposed radical reshaping of the welfare state would not lead to significant increases in public spending and tax levels. Sir Gordon Borrie, chairman of the Social Justice Commission, will launch the results of two years' work by claiming that it is not interested in 'squeezing a bit more from the tax system in order to squeeze a bit more into the social security system'. Instead he will argue that the large structural changes suggested by the report - designed to get people off welfare and into work - would create a modern social insurance system. Backing the concept of 'full employment', it will stress that social justice and economic prosperity are indivisible. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, will endorse the main thrust of the proposals at a London conference to mark the launch of the 400-page report, entitled Social Justice, Strategies for National Renewal. But he will stress that only parts of a strategy designed to reshape the welfare state for the next 15 years will be incorporated as specific commitments in Labour's manifesto for the next general election. There were signs yesterday that some of the recommendations favoured by Mr Blair will provoke a backlash from some unions and leftwing MPs. The proposal that the party drop its commitment to increase the state pension in line with earnings as part of a plan to integrate the tax and benefit system for the elderly is an obvious target. Another is the commission's support for a wider student loans system. Union leaders are also disappointed by the suggestion that a new statutory minimum wage be set below an hourly rate of Pounds 4. The report insists that a minimum wage is vital to provide a 'floor' for in-work benefits paid for by the state, but accepts the need for flexibility to avoid higher unemployment. A range of financial incentives aimed at removing the poverty and benefit traps and persuading the unemployed to take low-paid or part-time work are expected to secure broad approval, as are proposals for a drive to improve the quality of education and training.

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Ryanair to lease and buy 737s Ryanair, the independent Irish airline, is planning to open new routes out of Ireland to the UK and increase capacity on existing routes through the replacement of its fleet of eight BAC-111 aircraft with advanced Boeing 737s in a lease-purchase deal with Boeing worth Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.6m). Ryanair expects to have six refurbished 737-200s in service by the end of April, increasing capacity on existing routes by 30 per cent. At the end of the six-year leasing period ownership of the aircraft will pass to Ryanair. More 737s will be acquired according to market conditions.</p>

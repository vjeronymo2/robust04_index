			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "NDP Proposing Federalization of </F> Macedonia"]    [Text] The annual conference of the National Democratic  Party [NDP] (ethnic Albanians) held in Tetovo last Saturday [25  June] finished with an adoption of a 9-point memorandum. NDP is  not satisfied with the democratic processes going on in  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM],  particularly since the disintegration of Yugoslavia. This party  is emphasizing that the Albanian people have been deprived of  the right for self- orientation, although they are the third  largest nation in the former Yugoslavia.    The memorandum condemns the manipulations by the government  in relation to the census of the population. The NDP concludes  that these manipulations are aimed at discrediting the Albanian  political factor before the international institutions, as well  as its further splitting apart.    The NDP underlined the government's responsibility for the  further building up and functioning of the state and community  institutions on a one-national basis. This, the NDP believes,  legalizes the political discrediting and tolerance of the  advents of neofascism. Otherwise, the NDP is pushing for a  federalization of Macedonia and the formation of an autonomous  region Ilirida in Macedonia.    Guests from the PDP fraction were also present at the  conference, as well as representatives from the Demo-Christian  Party of Kosovo and the Democratic Party and Social Democratic  Party from Albania.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE SALES ON SKID ROW  </P> <P> The article by Martin M. Cohen ("Wine: a Drop in the Bucket of Skid Row Woe,"  Op-Ed Page, Nov. 1) is more a symptom of the problem than a realistic view of  the problems related to cheap wine sales in the downtown Skid Row area. Cohen  contends that some persons are destined to be miserable on Skid Rows and that  they should not be deprived of the temporary comfort of a bottle of cheap  fortified wine.  </P> <P> For every portion of intoxicated comfort achieved with the cheap wines, there  are many portions of misery. Consumption of cheap wines results in physical  deterioration, mental anguish and a loss of motivation to improve one's living  situation.  </P> <P> Gallo and other wineries have reaped enormous profits from the manufacture and  distribution of the cheap fortified wines to the Skid Row misery market for  over 30 years. Supervisor Ed Edelman and the County Office of Alcohol Programs  have now raised the issue with the plan of starting to reduce the growing  problems within the downtown Skid Row area. The fact that Gallo was embarrassed  and offered to withdraw the product from Skid Row areas is testimony to its  awareness of the damage caused. To date no reduction in the Skid Row alcohol  outlets has been observed. The county plans to conduct a study to determine if  the cheap wines availability is reduced, and, if so, what the effect is on  public intoxication and other related problems.  </P> <P> The removal of the cheap wines is not an overall solution to the massive  political, social and economical problems of Los Angeles downtown Skid Row.  There will remain a need to develop additional recovery programs and establish  long-term housing, jobs and support systems. However, reducing the availability  of the cheap wines is a positive step. Yes, some of those addicted to the cheap  wines (winos) will move to other areas and others will purchase bootlegged  bottles. But others, in time, will seek help in the several quality downtown  recovery programs. The environment for the sales of other drugs will be  reduced.  </P> <P> Let us hope more citizens become aware of the many problems that exist for the  lonely and destitute and become willing to initiate change.  </P> <P> KEN SCHONLAU  </P> <P> Executive Director, California  </P> <P> Assn. of Alcoholic Recovery  </P> <P> Homes, Los Angeles  </P></p>

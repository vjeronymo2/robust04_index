			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin,  general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central  Committee, today called for extra efforts to combat corruption,  in order to boost the flesh and blood bonds between the party  and the people.    Cases of corruption, especially those major and serious ones  that have already been exposed, must be thoroughly investigated  and severely dealt with, Jiang said.    The party chief made the remarks here today at the Third  Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection, calling upon party committees and governments at all  levels to attach more importance to the anti-corruption drive.    He said the fight against corruption, an important means to  guarantee economic reforms, opening to the outside world,  development and social stability, has achieved marked results  since the convening of the second plenary session of the  commission last August.    Jiang pointed out that the current anti-corruption campaign  must agree with and serve the basic principles of the party and  be conducted in line with the overall situation of the country.    The work must be carried out firmly and more effectively,  Jiang stressed. It can't be expected that the anti-corruption  drive will be completed in a single battle. It will be a  long-term and arduous task, the party chief noted.    Pointing to the seriousness of corrupt phenomena that have  been exposed, Jiang vowed that the party has the might and  determination to carry the struggle forward to the end.    He said "the ideology of long-term fighting should be kept  in  mind without a bit of slackening, and an `amiable environment'  for corrupt activities is by no means permitted."    The general secretary also summed up the experiences of the  previous period in the anti-corruption campaign as trusting and  relying on the broad masses, and joining the mobilization of  people in exposing indications of criminal activity and  investigations by judicial departments and party discipline  inspection bodies.    Members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing and  Hu Jintao attended today's meeting.</p>

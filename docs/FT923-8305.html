			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 2,300 mark under pressure INVESTORS underwent a further trial of confidence in the UK stock market yesterday when the Skipton Building Society raised its mortgage lending rates by half a percentage point, triggering fears that other home loan groups might follow suit. The stock market, led by the futures sector, plunged through the FT-SE 2,300 level at mid-morning but rallied later when US dollar support operations by the central banks helped some overseas earning stocks. Yesterday's session demonstrated, once again, the powerful influence of the troubled UK housing sector on the stock market. Equities opened firmer, taking more notice of overnight improvement in New York than of the Nikkei's fall below the 15,000 level. But, rumours that one or more UK building societies planned to increase lending rates - the Skipton Building Society's move was not confirmed until mid-morning - surfaced early in the stock index futures market. The September contract on the Footsie opened sharply lower and the stock market almost instantly reversed its early gain to show a loss. The loss was rapidly extended and the FT-SE Index was 30 points off before 11.00am, the timing of its low point coinciding almost exactly with that of the stock index future. The market did little more than steady on good trading results from General Accident and a satisfactory, if unexciting, set of domestic producer price figures for last month. The rally made little progress until the second half of the session when the round of official support for the US dollar brought a spin-off improvement in sterling. The fall in the stock market was trimmed to around 10 points on the Footsie scale and trading volume increased as at least two London securities houses operated trading programmes; both were weighted towards the sell side and blocks of several Footsie stocks were sold at a discount to prevailing market quotations. The impetus was lost again when Wall Street opened with a fall of 18 Dow points in UK hours. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,309.6 for a loss on the day of 16.1 points. Analysts expressed little confidence in the regaining of the Footsie 2,300 mark and continued to point warningly towards 2,150 as the nearest support level if the rout in share prices continues. Seaq volume, slow at first, jumped to 563.9m shares at the close, compared with only 331m on Monday when retail, or customer, volume was worth a mere Pounds 698.9m. The final picture was perhaps less pessimistic than the fall in the index might suggest. Oil shares continued to rally, despite further gloomy comments on British Petroleum from brokerage houses, and insurance stocks brightened after General Accident's interim results. But Wellcome sagged as the syndicate involved in the recent share sale cut its support price to 780p. Also dragging down the Footsie index was ICI, still weakened by adverse comments on the demerger proposals currently under boardroom consideration.</p>

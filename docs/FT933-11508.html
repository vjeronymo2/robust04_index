			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Technology: On the line to a wider service - The telephone has joined forces with the computer to become a potent marketing tool Sexy chat lines and quiz games have meant fast bucks for the telephone service companies and a bad reputation for premium-rate telephone calls. But increasingly, audiotex, which combines computer processing power with traditional telephone services, is being used as a marketing tool to improve customer service and sell more products, be it bottles of beer or airline tickets. UK furniture retailer Maples, for example, decided to use a special telephone service to back up its national press advertising. When the adverts appeared, the company needed one number which potential customers could call to inquire about the colour and fabric of sofas or chairs. 'Rather than try to train third-party people about our business we decided to use the trained staff out there in our stores who already knew our business,' explains Mark Collier, marketing operations manager for Maples. 'So the object of the exercise was to find a way of putting our customers directly in contact with their local store.' The answer was to advertise a single telephone number and then automatically divert callers to their nearest Maples shop. This was achieved by matching the national map of post codes with a similar map of telephone numbers - when the customer calls, a computer recognises his or her number and then ascertains the nearest store. When the stores are closed, a recorded announcement gives the location of the nearest store and invites customers to call back the following day. The 21 Maples stores receive between 300 and 400 calls a month as a direct result of the service. But the success of the venture is difficult to determine, other than through anecdotal evidence, says Collier. 'In conversations with our store managers quite a few have commented that people have called about the adverts and then come into the stores and bought something. What we do know is that we sell a lot more of the suites that we advertise than of those that we don't' In the US, audiotex services are a way of life - freephone calls are a Dollars 75bn (Pounds 50bn) market and 25 per cent of all long-distance traffic there carries freephone calls. In the UK, worries about adult, or 'pink' services and complaints from angry parents about their teenage offspring clocking up large telephone bills have tended to hamper the market. As a result business services are only just begining to establish themselves. These days, 25 per cent of all television adverts in the UK carry an 0800 number. 'In the UK, we're heading towards more serious business services,' says Jacqui Howett, business development director of Legion, the London-based voice processing company which specialises in setting up telephone services for clients such as Maples. 'More and more services are business to business.' The UK is not the only European country where this is happening. According to a recent Eurodata report on premium-rate services, the European market for such services will grow from Dollars 1bn in 1992 to more than Dollars 2bn in 1995. Maples' decision to operate a business audiotex line was taken because it was 'very cheap and easy to operate,' says Collier. 'It is an easy system to manipulate and manage if we open a new store.' Maples uses an 0345 number, so callers pay as if for a local call and Maples pays the rest of the charges - less than Pounds 5,000 a year in total. The alternatives would have been to use an 0800 or 0500 number, where the call would have been free to the caller, or a premium rate number, prefixed with codes such as 0891 and 0839 where the caller pays a premium rate of 36p or 48p a minute. 'When we started off, we didn't know how many calls would be made or how much it would cost, so we thought the fairest thing was to go for a half-way house,' explains Collier. 'We didn't want to make money, that didn't sit very comfortably.' Other companies are not so reticent. Many companies now run competitions which involve telephoning at the premium rate to give the correct answers. 'It can bring a number of benefits to the brand,' says Matthen Hooper, managing director of marketing communications company Interfocus. 'It can extend the budget and can be re-invested in the campaign. Or it sometimes gives the funds for a mail shot of information.' Charities are also big users of premium-rate lines. The choice depends on the objective, says Howett. 'If the objective is to generate revenue to help cover the costs of the promotion, then premium-rate calls are the answer. If you want to create a customer database, then an 0800 number is best. If you don't want to overcharge but you want to eliminate every Tom, Dick and Harry that calls on a freephone line, then an 0345 is the answer.' For many companies, automated answering is seen as a way of reducing costs. 'Faced with the ever rising cost of employing live telephone agents, telemarketing operations are increasingly looking to use automated telemarketing to supplement their live agent operations,' Howett says. 'The beauty of automated systems is that you only pay for the calls you receive, not for an operator sitting there all day.' Others are combining traditional human answering services with computer-aided telephony for out-of-hours or overflow calls. Automated answering is most suitable for mundane repetitive inquiries, Howett points out. 'We can weed out the people who want the basic information and then pass the more complicated inquiries on to the company's operators.' Many companies run a short-term promotion campaign, while others keep the numbers open on a long-term basis. The choice of service depends on the target audience, says Howett. 'You don't need a sophisticated service if your target market can't handle it.' That said, many organisations use surprisingly complicated services. Legion, for example, frequently runs competitions for its customers where the computer can tell whether the answers given by the competitor are correct or incorrect, either by asking them to key in numbers on the telephone keypad, or by using voice recognition technology. (The latest systems can recognise a string of common words including numbers from one to 10.) If correct, the caller is then asked to leave his or her name and address. This is recorded and the service provider can then pick the winners at random or pass the tape of all successful respondents back to the client to select the winner. Other organisations have learnt to exploit very skilfully the value of the lines. The Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Trust, for example, runs two professionally scripted lines, recorded by UK celebrities Joanna Lumley and Gary Lineker. They invite the caller to do three things: donate money; leave their name and address as potential bone marrow donors; and listen to information on the work of the trust. Other organisations are making businesses out of 'fax on demand' services where, by tapping in a premium number on a fax machine, textual information is automatically sent out to that fax number. Telecom Express, for example, runs a service for the Evening Standard sending out the financial pages to those who request it. Foreign newspapers could be sent to readers in the UK this way, as already happens in the US, says George Porchester, one of the founding shareholders of Telecom Express. Porchester believes one of the developments in the near future will be the combination of premium voice and fax services, so that if a caller wanted further information after listening to a live operator or recorded message, details could be sent automatically by fax. Eventually, says Hooper, 'people will begin to look at telephone lines as they do a traditional coupon on an ad. They will begin to see they can get information immediately and at half the cost.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                HOW POPULAR ARE TELEPHONE-BASED SERVICES?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               European To businesses                   UK     France   Netherlands    average  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base (number of respondents)    74       76         53            714 Application                      %        %          %              % Financial                       55       30         42            714 Purchasing                      65       49         30            714 Services/help lines             32       25         26            714 Government/public information   16       34         28            714  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- To consumers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base (number of respondents)    75       79         52            702 Application                      %        %          %              % Entertainment                   15        8          2             13 Televoting/fund raising         28       30         23             32 Financial                       28       41         38             37 Shopping/promotions             29       32         60             36 Services/advice lines           36       43         33             50 Government/public information   28       49         40             44  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Eurodata Foundation '1993 Eurodata Premium Rate Services Report'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK trio held in Iraq may be free by end of week Sir Edward Heath, the former UK prime minister, travelled to Baghdad yesterday to try to secure the release of three Britons jailed in Iraq, raising hopes that they may be freed by the end of the week. The prisoners, Mr Michael Wainwright, 42, Mr Paul Ride, 33, and Mr Simon Dunn, 23, are being held in the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad where they are serving sentences of 10, seven and eight years respectively. A British diplomat in Amman said: 'There's a good chance' the three may be released by Friday. Mr Wainwright and Mr Ride have been in jail for over a year, while Mr Dunn was arrested six months ago. All were charged with entering Iraq illegally. Sir Edward, who has British government backing in the mission, was asked to travel to Baghdad on behalf of the prisoners' families. He made a similar mission in October 1990, three months before the Gulf War, when he won the release of western hostages held at strategic sites in Iraq. British officials said his current trip was discussed by Sir David Hannay, Britain's envoy to the UN, and Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, in New York last month. Iraq has until now linked the prisoners' release with Britain's unfreezing of Iraqi assets in the UK, but London has refused to comply. Diplomats in Amman stressed 'no deal had been done'. Last month Baghdad freed Mr Kenneth Beaty, 45, an American, after US Senator David Boren visited Iraq. He was the sixth foreigner President Saddam Hussein had freed in less than two months. Five westerners, including the three Britons, a Frenchman and a German, remain in jail.</p>

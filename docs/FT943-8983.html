			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Books: Pride and the fall of Prussia PRUSSIA: THE PERVERSION OF AN IDEA by Giles MacDonogh Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 456 pages Prussia and England have always seemed to me to have a great deal in common. One chooses the words carefully: Prussia, not Germany; and England, not Britain. Both have a desire for order and a love of institutions. Both have been proud of their military. The term inneres Preussentum, used in this book by Giles MacDonogh, might be loosely translated into English not as 'inner Prussianness', but as 'stiff upper lip'. The two places, too, have had more than their share of eccentrics: mad professors and scientists, liberals as well as conservatives. Perhaps above all they were both colonising powers, not content to stay in their own domain. Both could claim to have had a civilising influence. The great difference between them was that Prussia was a land power and England, as part of an island, was a sea power. For a time this did not matter: they could go their separate ways. Yet, as Bismarck noted, one of the seminal events in modern history was that it was the English who initially colonised what became the United States. English was on the way to becoming the international language, and a great alliance was born. Twice this century the alliance stopped Germany in its tracks. But it was worth noting that it was Germany that was stopped, not Prussia. For by 1870 Prussia had become part of a wider German state. It may have suited the allies to say that the new Germany was typically Prussian, meaning 'militaristic', yet Prussia had other virtues as MacDonogh seeks to show, and most of the worst German crimes under the third reich were not committed by Prussians. He produces a curious statistic suggesting that of the 500 highest ranking Nazi officials, the Prussians made up only 17, or 3.4 per cent. In fact, the Prussians were twice put down themselves, the first time by Napoleon and then by Hitler. When Napoleon defeated them in battle, the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 imposed terms quite as harsh and impossible to meet as those imposed by the allies on Germany after the first world war. But Prussia gradually recovered. It did so partly through education and partly through developing its military tradition. The two went together: a good soldier needs to be educated. There was a tendency among the military to dismiss the parliament as the Idiotenhaus (house of idiots), but Prussia was not on the whole illiberal. Like England it encouraged elites. The chief of these was the general staff. Built up by Moltke, this was like a school in itself, wearing its own uniform. The French were nothing like as organised. In 1870 the Prussians took their revenge. Taking the long view, however, the unification of Germany that resulted from the Franco-Prussian war was not the triumph of Prussia. Some Prussians would have preferred to have gone it alone. Instead Prussia gradually became submerged in Germany. True, the old traditions lingered on. The Prussians were prominent under Kaiser Wilhelm, but the old Prussian state was not much loved (or perhaps too much feared) by Hitler. Nazism bloomed late there. In 1928 the party had only six members in the regional parliament. Thus Hitler began his assault. By 1934 the separate Prussian institutions were abolished in the interest of a 'non-federal Germany'. MacDonogh's book contains a nice quote from Hermann Goring, who was left in charge of the police: 'I've certainly mucked things up. How could I strengthen Prussia's position when Hitler wants to do the very same to the Reich?' So Prussia fell ultimately not to the French, but to the Germans. There was one other great problem over the centuries. It could not easily co-exist with Poland. In the end there had to be one country or the other. It seems that Poland has finally won, but no-one should think the Prussians were all demons and the Poles all saints. MacDonogh's book is not the easiest to read. He shows an almost total lack of interest in economic development (which surely must have something to do with the rise of Germany) and some of the names are obscurely introduced. But if anyone really did think that Prussia was simply a war machine, here is a useful corrective.</p>

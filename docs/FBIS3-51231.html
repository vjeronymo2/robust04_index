The airliner, flying for Air Inter, offers 412 seats, 30  percent more than an Airbus A320, with the same fuel  consumption. The airline officials said that the new model will  offer productivity gains on the airline's most popular routes in  France.    Air Inter is to receive three A330s by March, and a total of  five by the end of the year, out of an initial order for 15 put  in in 1989, at a time when air traffic was growing strongly.    The operating problems linked with the depressed conditions  in the air travel industry have led Air Inter to adjust that  initial order, so that it will be able to buy planes in the  Airbus range from the A319 to the A330, depending on commercial  needs.</p>

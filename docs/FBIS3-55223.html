That is the length of time that it  has not been printed by Krasnoyarsk's "Ofset" Production and  Publishing Combine owing to lack of money to cover paper and  printing costs.    This is a graphic example of what may happen to other  Russian  publications as a result of Russian Federation Government Decree  No. 1233 on revaluing the capital stock at national economic  enterprises. Krasnoyarsk newspapers have reprinted ahe Appeal  from Russian press personnel and the chief editors of the  leading central newspapers to V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the  Russian Federation Government.    The editors of leading Krasnoyarsk and certain rayon  newspapers, as well as the "Ofset" Publishing House, have signed  up to the appeal. As a sign of solidarity they are willing to  stop publishing during the first "week of parliament" -- 11  through 17 January.</p>

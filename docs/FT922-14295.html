			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Leading Article: After the peseta, the escudo effect THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism has become the only monetary policy game in Euro-town. Portugal's decision to join the ERM over the weekend, initially on wide bands, confirms the political importance now attached to membership. Economically, the Portuguese government's decision to give up its independent monetary policy is risky and could be highly costly. Politically, in the current European environment, it had little choice. The motivation behind the government's decision is a desire to meet the Maastricht convergence rules and join Emu at its inception. Portugal's consumer price inflation has eased in recent months but, at over 8 per cent a year, remains twice as high as inflation-obsessed Germany. To join Emu in 1997, it must halve its current inflation rate, shave more than 2 percentage points off the fiscal deficit as a share of gross domestic product and move to narrow ERM bands by 1995. Whether five years of austerity make sense for the EC's second poorest country is questionable. EC membership has delivered rapid economic growth, rising foreign direct investment and large-scale EC transfers without ERM membership or German-style inflation. Moreover, the current European environment may change. If Germany's economic and political difficulties persist and the timetable for monetary union is postponed, slow growth in socialist France and post-election Britain may become too much to take. Clear imperative Yet unless Emu is shelved the political imperative for smaller countries like Portugal is clear: if they want to be good Europeans, especially in the eyes of the Commission, they must knuckle down. No-one is sure where following the Pied Piper of Brussels will lead; but no-one wants to be left behind. Nor is there any theoretical reason why Portuguese incomes should not continue to catch up with the rest of Europe either within the ERM or in a monetary union. The US South has been doing so for the past 100 years. What would slow this real convergence is if the transitional cost of reducing Portugal's inflation rate to European levels turned out to be high. The economic rationale for ERM entry is that it will reduce the costs of nominal convergence by making monetary policy more credible and guiding expectations towards the low-inflation goal. But the ERM brings costs too. For Portugal, the problem of divergence between the need for low interest rates in Europe and Germany's tight monetary policy is not a concern. That the escudo shot to the top of its wide bands yesterday, prompting an interest rate cut, suggests that, like Spain, the Bank of Portugal's difficulty may be undesirably low interest rates. Slow adjustment The more serious risk is that Portugal's wage and price adjustment will be slow and incomplete. The longer the period of above-average wage inflation, the more serious the squeeze on the competitiveness of the traded goods sector and the more painful the eventual re-adjustment in the absence of exchange rate re-alignments, as the UK, Italy and Spain are currently discovering. Portugal starts with some advantages: its unemployment rate is a mere 4 per cent and the OECD calculates that the unemployment cost of reducing wage inflation is also low by European standards. Nor does Portugal have a structural trade problem. The current account deficit last year was very small and more than offset by inflows of foreign direct investment. Yet this small deficit masks a large trade deficit of 11 per cent of GDP in 1991. This was offset by tourist earnings and income transfers from migrant workers neither of which can be relied upon to keep on growing. Portugal's decision is admirably ambitious. But every country that has taken the ERM path to low inflation pays a price in lost output and higher unemployment. Portugal's recent growth record also suggests it has more to lose. What the government must now do is to build a consensus around the need for a rapid fall in wage inflation across the entire economy. The alternative route to European levels of wage inflation, via rising unemployment, is long and painful, as current UK experience testifies.</p>

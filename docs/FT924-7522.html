			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: Indonesian private bank suspended BANK Summa, one of Indonesia's 10 largest private banks, which is privately-owned by the Soeryadjaya family, was suspended by the country's central bank from clearing operations on Friday. Meanwhile two tranches of shares in Astra International, the Indonesian automotive group which dominates the country's stock exchange and is majority owned by the Soeryadjaya family, were sold on Friday for Dollars 197m. Bankers said the disposals were precipitated by Bank Summa's problems and appear to indicate that the Soeryadjaya family were reducing their holding in Astra. The buyers of the shares are not known. Following the suspension Dr Adrianus Mooy, governor of the central bank, met with President Suharto on Saturday to discuss, bankers believe, the possible ramifications of Bank Summa's financial problems for the banking sector. Bank Summa has been hit by a fall in the value of its property portfolio and bankers say it needs a cash-injection of up to Dollars 600m. Bank Summa officials said on Friday they hoped to resume clearing operations today. Astra has stressed that its finances and those of Bank Summa are separate. In September, Mr William Soeryadjaya, the founder chairman of Astra stepped down and was replaced by Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusomo, a former economics minister and an associate of President Suharto. Astra is Indonesia's second largest company with a market capitalisation of Dollars 1.2bn. It has suffered this year from a sharp decline in car sales and brokers estimate 1992 net profits at about Rp74bn (Dollars 35.7m), as against Rp210bn last year. Brokers say that 20m shares went to a foreign buyer and a similar number to a domestic purchaser on Friday. Astra announced two months ago that Toyota of Japan would take a stake, but Toyota yesterday denied that it had purchased any Astra shares.</p>

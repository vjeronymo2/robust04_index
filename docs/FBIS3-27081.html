			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Thirty-seven U.S.  companies invested nearly 20 million U.S. dollars in Tianjin in  January, according to a local government department.    An official of the municipal commission of foreign trade and  economic cooperation said that Tianjin, the leading  manufacturing center in north China, currently has 840  U.S.-funded businesses with a total American investment of 710  million dollars.    American investors have taken Tianjin as an ideal place to  invest in since it was one of the first group of coastal cities  in China to open to overseas investors, he said.    Tianjin experienced what he called an "American investment  wave" in 1993, he said.    The city last year approved 513 U.S.-funded firms involving  340 million dollars in total American investment.    American companies invest in a wide range of sectors,  including manufacturing industry, farming, international trade,  banking, information, hotels and real estate.    Manufacturers account for at least half of U.S.-funded  companies in Tianjin, he said.    A number of multi-national companies, including Motorola  Electronics, the Coca-Cola Company, Kraft General Foods  International Corporation, the International Telegraph and  Telephone Company, the AST Company, IBM, the Otis Elevator  Company and the Smithline Beckman Corporation, have opened  businesses in Tianjin.    The China head office of AST in Tianjin is rated as the  largest foreign investment project in China's computer industry,  the official said.    The Tianjin branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank of the United  States is the bank's first branch in China.    Local economists agreed that Tianjin's appeal to American  investors lies in its good infrastructure, a whole range of  industries, a competent technical force and a workforce with a  high sense of discipline.    In recent years, products from U.S.-funded companies in  Tianjin have become increasingly popular in Tianjin and the rest  of China. They include Otis elevators, Motorola beepers,  Smithline medicines and Coca-Cola.    Most products from these companies are sold in the Chinese  market, according to the economists. This serves as another  factor attracting American investors, one official said.    Michael E. Lin, vice-president of a multi-national company  of  the United States, said: "If you want to invest in China, you  must seize every second, because losing an investment  opportunity means losing a big market."    The third factor encouraging American firms to invest in  Tianjin is that most operational U.S.-funded businesses are  profitable.    Government statistics show that these Tianjin businesses  generated a total of 860 million yuan in profits and taxes in  1993, nearly 30 percent of the total made by all foreign-funded  firms in the city.    Four of the ten foreign-funded firms chosen as the most  efficient enterprises in Tianjin in 1993 are U.S.-funded  companies, the official of the municipal commission of foreign  trade and economic cooperation said.    Most U.S.-funded companies have already recovered their  investment, he said.    For example, the Motorola (China) Electronics Company has  generated 84 million yuan since it opened a year ago and has  decided to spend another 100 million U.S. dollars to expand  production.    The Tianmei Food Company, a joint venture between a local  company and the Kraft General Food International Corporation of  the U.S., has generated 200 million in profits and taxes since  it opened six years ago.    As a result, each partner has earned 20 million yuan in net  profits, the official said.    The American firm decided last year to increase its shares  to  60 percent from 50 percent.    The joint venture is now building a new factory in the  Tianjin economic and technological development zone to quintuple  its annual production, he said.</p>

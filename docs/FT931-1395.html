			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo declines on late selling by investment trusts THE NIKKEI average gave up early gains to close marginally lower as late afternoon selling by investment trusts and corporations depressed share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index average closed down 40.93 at 18,450.69 after a high of 18,643.62 and a low of 18,423.40. It rose in the morning on arbitrage buying, but fell on position adjustment before the March-end book-closing. Volume totalled 350m shares against 376m as declines led advances by 570 to 440, with 153 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell by 2.48 to 1,395.43. Some investors blamed political uncertainty in Russia for their reluctance to participate in the markets. Traders said the dollar remaining below the Y116 level against the yen also gave investors an excuse to remain inactive. Some analysts also noted that the Nikkei's surge in the past two weeks, accompanied by a sharp rise in trading volume, may not have reflected genuine investor interest. One analyst said that the government had pumped in extra public funds to counter the expiry of margin positions created last September, arbitrage selling and liquidation of holdings by corporate investors. A rise in selling and buying levels had activated trading, he said, but 'things would return to normal'. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was heavily traded, rising Y9,000 to Y810,000. Telecommunications related issues also rebounded on NTT's rise: Fujikura, the cable maker, gained Y33 to Y678 and Furukawa Electric firmed Y19 to Y507. Steels and shipbuilders were lower on profit-taking: Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, fell Y3 to Y327, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost Y8 to Y550. High-technology issues were lower on the higher yen with Hitachi falling Y8 to Y752 and Sony losing Y50 to Y4,100. However, Fujitsu gained Y20 to Y605 on buying by US pension funds. Construction companies lost ground on continuing investigations by prosecutors of their links with Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former kingmaker of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, currently under detention for alleged tax evasion. Taisei fell Y16 to Y639 and Obayashi Road lost Y30 to Y1,670. Speculation that game manufacturers would post firm earnings for the current year boosted Nintendo, the video game maker, which rose Y20 to Y9,510. Sega Enterprises was also strong, advancing Y100 to Y10,800. In Osaka, the OSE average closed down 21.89 to 19,440.50 in volume of 102.1m shares. Roundup HONG KONG and Manila apart, the region's equity markets were not inspired yesterday. Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Bombay were closed for public holidays. HONG KONG saw indications of a delay in legislative consideration of the governor's democratic reform proposals and bullish expectations on the property front as the Hang Seng index rose 94.24, or 1.5 per cent to 6,212.19. Turnover rose from HKDollars 2.24bn to HKDollars 2.84bn. Property stocks rose on hopes that the government will relax its ceiling on banks' mortgage lending which, developers say, would encourage more buying. The properties index jumped 207.07, or 2.2 per cent to 9,659.56. The good corporate results season continued with a 48 per cent jump in interim profits at New World Development, which rose 40 cents to HKDollars 19.10. Sun Hung Kai Properties rose HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 32.00 ahead of tomorrow's earnings figures. MANILA staged a rebound in light volume, the composite index rising 17.05 to 1,460.30 aided by Philippine Long Distance Telephone gains in New York. On the domestic market, PLDT closed 30 pesos higher at 900 pesos. AUSTRALIA firmed, but price moves generally were small as investors remained wary about developments in Russia. The All-Ordinaries index rose 3.6 to 1,663.1 in turnover down from ADollars 276m to ADollars 255m. Tuesday's cut in interest rates lifted bank shares, with Commonwealth up 12 cents to ADollars 8.04, National Australia 4 cents to ADollars 8.81 and ANZ 2 cents better at ADollars 3.48. NEW ZEALAND echoed Australia's Russia worries, and the NZSE-40 index finished down 4.62 at 1,553.25, turnover thinning from NZDollars 24.3m to NZDollars 18.6m. TAIWAN heard that construction of a sixth, TDollars 200bn naphtha cracker project is expected to start in early April. Plastics rose and Formosa Plastics, the biggest investor in what is Taiwan's largest investment project, put on TDollars 1.60 to TDollars 42.60. The weighted index closed 7.45 higher at 4,654.68.</p>

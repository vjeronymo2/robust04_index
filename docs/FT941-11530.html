			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters retreats News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings was pulled back sharply in early trading as word swept the market that US investment bank Goldman Sachs had turned bearish on the stock. Goldman has been a leading supporter of the shares and any change of stance would have been a serious blow to sentiment. But analyst Mr Eric Philo said he had merely taken the stock off Goldman's 'priority list', which contains its 30 most highly recommended companies in the UK and mainland Europe. He said he remained a buyer and predicted a share price in the UK of around 2150p within the next 12 months. The shares tumbled nearly 50p initially but clawed their way back to close only 8 lower on the day at 1967p after unusually heavy turnover of 3.1m. Speculation of an imminent share split at Thorn EMI was heard as the stock gathered steam to hit a record 1128p, a rise of 28. There were also renewed bid rumours as analysts pondered the fallout from the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications in the US between Viacom and QVC Network. While the battle has reignited the debate over the market value of groups falling in the multi-media fold, such as Thorn, it has also raised the suggestion that the losing bidder may turn its attention to the UK group. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries shed 8 to 521p as securities house UBS cut its forecasts and lowered its stance. The house turned seller and reduced its 1994 profits estimate by Pounds 130m to Pounds 1.83bn on concern over the growth potential for BAT's US insurance arm, Farmers. Analyst Mr Chris Hitchings added that he 'retained a cautious view of the US tobacco side'. Hong Kong related banks HSBC and Standard Chartered continued to power ahead on the back of a strong Hong Kong market, and anticipation of encouraging interim figures from the banking sector. Buyers of HSBC were further encouraged by a recommendation from Peregrine, the leading Hong Kong stockbroker, which put a target price of Dollars 150 on the bank's shares, equivalent to a further 200p on the UK price. HSBC rose 26 to 1040p while Standard Chartered gained 48 at 1410p. The support services sector was enlivened by the issue of a call warrant by SG Warburg on five of the stocks in the sector. Each of the 20m warrants is issued at 135p, with a basket of 10 priced at 1350p. The warrants expire in August 1995 and the exercise price is Pounds 107.50p. Three of the stocks performed strongly, with Hays jumping 10 1/2 to 331 1/2 p, while Rentokil added 11 at 279p and Chubb finished 15 ahead at 421p. BET crept 3 ahead to 154 1/2 p, while Christian Salvesen, which issued a profits warning on Monday, bounced 4 1/2 to 312p. Lasmo rose 5 to 133p on news that the company had appointed a new finance director, The shares were also helped by news of an oil discovery in Algeria, and a rise in the price of Brent crude. Biotechnology research group Celltech improved 9 to 228p on news of a breakthrough against rheumatoid arthritis. The company is developing a product which competes with the US treatment highlighted yesterday. However, UBS remains a seller, arguing that significant gains are unlikely before the turn of the century. Chemicals group Courtaulds rose 13 to 538p with the help of a buy note from Shaw, the medium-sized agency broker. Speculation that international investor Mr George Soros might be poised to invest in Medeva raised some eyebrows but the shares, which plunged from a high of 220p in the summer, gained 8 at 180p. Further losses at Euro Disney were no worse than the market feared and the shares put on 5 at 410p. Cadbury Schweppes was one of the few shades of red among food manufacturers as investors and dealers continued to fret over the possibility of the company making a rights issue with its results next month. Among stores, GUS had another strong session, adding 16 at 640p as speculation over the possibility of the group's property arm being floated continued. The company, which has denied the story, said the full-year rental income for the division was in excess of Pounds 50m. Wire and engineering group Bridon recovered from a sharp decline early in the session to close 4 up at 160p. The shares initially fell 25 to 131p after the group issued a profits warning and said it would be making exceptional provisions of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m to cover restructuring. The market continued to appreciate this week's sale of Rover by British Aerospace to BMW and BAe rose 28 further to 573p. Component suppliers were also boosted by the same deal and BBA moved 9 1/2 ahead to 223p, while GKN put on 10 at 614p. Lucas Industries closed 9 up at 232p. Consumer leisure products and packaging firm Porter Chadburn shed a penny to 21p after a profits warning. Lonrho rose 8 1/2 to 169 1/2 p as investors anticipated a successful flotation for Ashanti Goldfields, of Ghana, in which it has a 45 per cent stake. Other statistics, Page 24</p>

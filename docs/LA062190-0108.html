			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WALNUT;  </P> <P> SERVICE ASSESSMENTS SET  </P> <P> The City Council has set fiscal year 1990-91 assessments for the city's  Lighting and Open Space Maintenance District, which provides the services to  5,668 properties in nine zones.  </P> <P> The annual assessments range from $67 to more than $550 per lot, depending on  the number of lots in a development and the amount of landscaping in each zone.  </P> <P> During a public hearing last week, some residents complained that the  assessments should be spread more evenly among the city's property owners.  </P> <P> "There is no consistency in this city as far as taxation is concerned," said  Judy Uribe, who lives in the residential zone with the highest average  assessments. "It's totally ridiculous that some people are paying $1,000 per  year and others are paying only pennies."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, a city-appointed committee studied various proposals to  redistribute assessments but found that Walnut's burgeoning development  thwarted a consistent plan.  </P></p>

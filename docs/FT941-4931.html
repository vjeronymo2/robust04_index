			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Looking ahead to 2000 - How can Europe escape the doldrums? TRAINING Denis MacShane, director of communications, International Metalworkers Federation: 'Measures to provide workers with constant skilling and reskilling should not just be supported. They should be demanded as a right. People should get involved in consultations and information exchanges within their companies. We should learn from the Japanese system where you are thought of as a member of a company, not just as an employee - this helps limit unemployment. I favour reductions in working time, which is out of kilter with what is needed to produce goods and services in Europe. Employees should support policies aimed at producing new products. In 10 or 15 years, ordinary people as they grow older will have several thousand pounds worth of health diagnostic equipment at home.' SINGLE MARKET Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz - secretary general, Unice (European employers federation): 'If you project today's trends in Europe to 2000, the result is dismal. It can't be allowed to happen. We have been divided up into little national states, each one protecting what he does, each with its own airline, steel industry and so on. We have missed out on the economies of scale. We have the sees of recovery in the single market, but it's not properly working yet. 'We need to tackle the problem of rising social security budgets, by bringing in funded pensions. Our education systems need to produce people who can adapt to high technology. The world recession won't last for ever. When the upturn comes, it won't solve unemployment problems, but it will give us the confidence to make difficult decisions.' OPERATING GLOBALLY Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman of IBM UK, head of an inquiry on competitiveness by Britain's Royal Sociey for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce: 'During the next 10 years, it is inevitable that Europe's share of world income will drop. It ought not to mean actual standards of living will decline. However, we will have to reorganise social security. Just as, inside companies, people look to their own careers and plan for themselves, we are going to have to develop an increasing number of instruments to allow individuals to take responsibilty for their future welfare. 'For businesses to prosper, there is no substitute for bright people with an understanding of the industries they work in. In any high-tech area, you have to keep abreast of what is happening and where advances are being made. ' EUROPE'S PLACE IN THE WORLD Prof. Michael Sturmer, director, Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (German government foreign policy think-tank): 'We shouldn't be so afraid of south-east Asia. In the long run, these countries could get into deep trouble. The streams of weapons flowing there will sooner or later explode. Their passage is by no means assured. They have to deal with North Korea, and they may get into deep water with China. 'Europe is still one of the best places in the world to live in. We will recover. Our recession in Europe is a matter of the last 2 1/2 years. We should not extrapolate to 2005. Our problem is the excessive welfare state. But, throughout history, Europeans have shown enormous resilience. And, unlike after the second world war, we are starting out from a very high level.' SCIENCE Dr Bob Whelan, chief executive of the UK Centre for Exploitation of Science and Technology: 'Because it is inadequately prepared for change, Europe too often follows rather than sets the world agenda for new products. The European workforce must become more flexible and adaptable. If you never stop learning, you can learn new tricks. 'Europe must recognise the need for world class performance in ALL aspects of industries that force that pace of technology - information, pharmaceuticals, automotive, energy and so on. 'There is too much introverted concern that the EU is the market. Companies should show more interest in global markets, looking for new opportunities - and learning from high quality customers elsewhere in the world. Companies must to hunt in packs. There is still great scope for new collaborations.' EMPLOYMENT Padraig Flynn, European Commissioner for employment: 'If the EU can get down to a 5 per cent unemployment rate by the end of the century - half the present level - we could live with that. Governments must avoid simply standing still and waiting for a cyclical upturn to solve our difficulties. Even if we increase our competitiveness, that will not automatically lead to more jobs. We need to increase the employment intensity of growth. 'Cutting wages is not the answer, although we need moderate wage rises not exceeding increases in productivity. We must lower burdens on employers caused by high non-wage costs. 'We need to look at new types of work: part-time work and lower-paid jobs, at a fair wage and with reasonable social protection. Low-paid work can be a source of a lot of comfort. REDESIGNING COMPANIES Peter Kraljic, managing director, McKinsey management consultants, Paris: 'Cutting costs alone is not enough - if companies simply restructure downwards, Europe will just run into ever higher unemployment. Companies have to be redesigned for growth. Manufacturing techniques and the location of manufacturing are less important than people's attitudes and state of mind. 'For 40 years we have had growth in Europe. Now we are like the US at the start of the 1980s. 'Europe has to exploit its strengths. We have a large market, and an incredible mix of nations with incredible talents. If we have the will to be Number One, at an individual, corporate and national level, we can do it. But we cannot expect a miracle overnight. It will require coherent action and a lot of leadership.' WIDENING EUROPE Bela Kadar, minister for international economic affairs, Hungary 'Hungarian membership of the EU by the 2000 is realistic. We will bring a dowry - not just the Hungarian market, but the flows of trade and technology with the rest of eastern Europe. If they invest in Hungary, western companies can increase their competitiveness. If obstacles to our exports fade, Hungarian and foreign investors can produce not just for 10.5m Hungarians, but for 400m European consumers.'</p>

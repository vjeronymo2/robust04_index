			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Landscapes of distress - Radio THE PUBLIC exhibition of distressful family relationships is one of Radio 4's less attractive obsessions. A current series on Thursdays, Relative Values, offers such examples, not, as you might think, to stop other families falling into these troubles, but simply to display how such folk exist. Last week, Ian Marchant told us how his two marriages had worked out. His first wife died in mid-divorce (due to incompatibility); his second decided to set up a separate home, like Mia Farrow. Surely their problem, not ours? This week we met the Glaziers. They adopted 9-year-old Fay, daughter of a single parent, who thought they would be a nice family 'like in the Bisto advertisements'. They had two sons - Robert 'lonely' but destructive (he set fire to his school), Stephen more friendly. Fay was deliberately naughty; she got on well with Stephen, but Robert kicked her around. As she grew up, there was jealousy between the boys; then Robert died of pneumonia and Fay became pregnant by Stephen, indeed married him, to his mother's embarrassment as she told the registrar that they were legally brother and sister. The cases are presented by Dr Michael O'Donnell, but without significant comment. Tomorrow you can hear Growing Up with Grief, interviews with people who have experienced the death of a parent in their youth, many of them still young. Their reactions are not uniform: it's taken six years to get over it, says one; next day it was as if nothing had happened, says another. Why did any of them want a million or so listeners to Radio 4 to hear about it? Caroline Snell is the presenter. A better place for such matters is in the drama, where it can all come right in the end. Monday's My Girl, by Barrie Keeffe, is a close-up of a young married couple, Sam and Anita, living in poverty in the East End. They have routine quarrels, another girl is hinted at, the dejections of privation are constantly displayed (though Sam's bank manager allows him vast overdrafts). Yet it ends with the birth of a second baby and the disputes forgotten - though the concluding disc is overlaid with the girl's sobs. Karl Howson and Cathy Tyson are the players, Ned Chaillet the director. Saturday night's serial (only two parts) is Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, another landscape of distress, though more imaginative. In Boston, Massachusetts, in 1642, in the witch-hunting era, Hester Prynne is lucky not to be reckoned a witch, for she has had a daughter with no known father. Instead, she has to stand three hours a day on the scaffold, with a red capital A, for adulteress, on her dress. Later, expelled from town, she lives by needlework. It is a very good tale, more exciting than you might guess, and suitably directed by Tracey Neale. Deborah Findlay is the unhappy Hester. We have yet to learn the role of the young priest, Arthur Dimmesdale, played by Michael Maloney. Addicts to the World Service should welcome the new monthly BBC Worldwide. At Pounds 1.75 in the UK, it includes the old London Calling, listing the World Service's English-language radio and television programmes, now bound up with magazine features on news, business, arts and sport. In developing countries, the London Calling section may be taken separately, free.</p>

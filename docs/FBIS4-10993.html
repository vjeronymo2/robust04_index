			<p>BFN     [Text] In the spirit of winning the electricity-generation  battle, workers from the Antonio Maceo plant, formerly the Rente  plant in Santiago de Cuba, are working hard to reduce the period  required for maintenance.    The workers are curently working on repairing the boiler of  the 100-megawatt Unit No. 4. The Rente plant [as heard] has six  units capable of generating 500 megawatts an hour, but has this  year been working at 40 percent of its capacity due to the delay  in maintenance resulting from the national network situation and  the lack of resources, which are now being received.    For this reason, Unit No. 4 is expected to be finished by  June, and will continue operating with the other units to  provide an acceptable response to the generation needs this year.</p>

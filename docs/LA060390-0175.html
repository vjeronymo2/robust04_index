			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS / STEVE ELLING;  </P> <P> RIO MESA COACH'S SILENT TREATMENT HELPS YOUNG ENJOY BIG YEAR  </P> <P> Sometimes it's better for a coach to stand back and watch. Intervention,  suggestion and criticism are tools that should be used judiciously.  </P> <P> If Rio Mesa High Coach Rich Duran has learned anything while coaching teen  phenom Dmitri Young over the past three seasons, it is to give his player free  rein. Young, who just concluded his junior year, has followed through with an  offensive reign of terror.  </P> <P> In short, if it ain't broke. . . .  </P> <P> "I don't coach him," Duran said. "I just let him play."  </P> <P> Duran's hands-off style has paid off handsomely. Young has moved within  striking range of a handful of Southern Section career records. In three  varsity seasons, Young is 125 for 246 (.508), has 28 doubles and 18 home runs,  has scored 99 runs and driven in 96.  </P> <P> The Southern Section career record for hits (147) was set by Redondo High's  Scott Davison in 1986-88. If Young matches his 1990 total of 50, he will finish  with 175.  </P> <P> The Section career mark for doubles (36) was set by Danny Paranick of Mammoth  in 1986-89. Young, who had 14 doubles this season, needs eight to tie.  </P> <P> With 99 runs, Young is well behind the Section career mark of 142 set by Torey  Lovullo (UCLA, Detroit Tigers) of Montclair Prep in 1980-83. But if Young can  match this season's eye-popping run total of 46, he also will break that  record.  </P> <P> Davison's career mark for runs batted in (147) appears to be outside Young's  range, but Young drove in 39 as a junior, so don't rule it out.  </P> <P> Young needs just three home runs to reach 21, which would move him into the  section top 10. The section career mark of 32 set by Scott Sharts of Simi  Valley in 1986-88 might be asking a bit much.  </P> <P> Yet if Young -- who is only 16 -- had attended junior high in California, he  might already have demolished the record book. He played for the varsity in the  seventh and eight grades while living in Alabama and batted better than .400  both seasons.  </P> <P> Stand tall, coach.  </P> <P> And stand back.  </P> <P> Kiss of death: So you think the Sports Illustrated jinx is a killer? There are  some local baseball folks who would argue that the alleged curse of SI has  nothing on the mojo cast by USA Today.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P> * In 1986, Simi Valley was ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today but fell in  the semifinal round of the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs.  </P> <P> * In 1988, Chatsworth was ranked No. 1 by USA Today, but was upset by San  Fernando in the City Section 4-A semifinals.  </P> <P> * In 1990, Westlake's fate might have been sealed when, for the first time all  year, USA Today ranked the Warriors No. 1.  </P> <P> Uh, thanks.  </P> <P> The issue hit the stands just in time for Tuesday's Southern Section 5-A  semifinal game with Marina, which Westlake lost, 4-1.  </P> <P> Hmmm. Three top-ranked Valley-area teams bite the dust in the semifinals, all  in even-numbered years. Some would call it odd, even.  </P> <P> Loud and proud: Nobody really knows who uttered it first, but Mark Spitz, Jimmy  Connors and Bill Johnson are among the more recent exponents of the belief that  "It ain't bragging if you can back it up."  </P> <P> All season long, Montclair Prep Coach Walt Steele has been unabashedly singing  the praises of his team, which capped a superlative season with a 14-4 defeat  of Village Christian in the Southern Section 1-A title game Friday night. The  Mounties defeated some heavy hitters along the way, including City 4-A finalist  El Camino Real in a tournament game 2 1/2 months ago.  </P> <P> This was not overlooked by Steele, who reiterated after the championship game  that he believes Montclair Prep consistently is slighted because of the  division in which it plays. Conversely, many maintain that the 1-A Division is  not competitive enough for the men of Steele, that Montclair Prep has made a  Mountie domain out of a molehill.  </P> <P> "I don't think there are many teams who played the caliber of clubs that we did  this year and go 25-3," Steele said. "I've said all along that we deserve to be  here and that we deserved to win. That's still my opinion."  </P> <P> Add confidence: Rocky Moore, who last week announced he will leave Alemany to  coach basketball at Muir, has some lofty expectations for the Mustang program,  which competes in the Pacific League.  </P> <P> "Muir is a higher caliber of program with much more visibility, and it's  obvious that Alemany has not been known for its basketball program," Moore  said. "It's a difference of night and day. You're talking about a program that  can be built up like Crenshaw, Manual Arts or Mater Dei."  </P> <P> In two seasons under Moore, Alemany was 12-33. The losing record, Moore says,  weighed little in Muir's decision.  </P> <P> "The administration had confidence based on my reputation in the coaching  fraternity, not based on my win-loss record," he said.  </P> <P> Ouch: The nature of Village Christian's lopsided loss to Montclair Prep caused  some brief confusion among Southern Section officials in the press box.  </P> <P> The scoreboard at Blair Field in Long Beach could not handle double-digit  totals in errors. Village Christian committed 10 miscues, the last of which was  made in the seventh inning. The scoreboard was first rolled over to 1, then  back to 9.  </P> <P> Add playoffs: San Fernando Coach Steve Marden was thrust into a difficult  situation in a May 23 City 4-A quarterfinal win over Kennedy.  </P> <P> With starter Canto Franco barely clinging to a 4-3 lead and two baserunners on  in the fourth, Marden had to call in ace John Najar to thwart Kennedy for the  final 3 1/3 innings. Najar did, of course, and the Tigers advanced to the  semifinal round with a 7-3 win.  </P> <P> But Marden's hand was tipped after that. He had planned to start Najar, his  best, against El Camino Real in the semifinal. But Najar had thrown earlier and  longer than anticipated, leaving the coach with a decision: Should he start  Najar in the hope that he can go the distance, risking the loss of Najar's big  bat if he must be removed? Or should he start Franco and hope he can hold the  fort for a few innings before going to Najar?  </P> <P> To Marden, there was no choice.  </P> <P> "You have to get by Kennedy on Wednesday or else you're reading about somebody  else in Friday's paper," Marden said. "When we (used both pitchers), we knew we  had to go to a combination against El Camino. And the only combination we can  use is start Franco, with Najar DH-ing for him. If we go the reverse and Johnny  can't go the whole way, then we lose Najar's bat."  </P> <P> In the ensuing 3-1 loss to El Camino Real, Najar was almost untouchable,  allowing no hits while striking out five in four innings of relief. Franco, who  started, yielded all three runs.  </P> <P> "We were just hoping Franco could go the distance on Wednesday (against  Kennedy)," Marden said. "But he didn't. So if we rest Najar on Wednesday, then  he might be resting for the whole year. Maybe then we would have been reading  about ECR-Kennedy in the semifinals."  </P></p>

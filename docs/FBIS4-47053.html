			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin: "Order of Issuing Export Licenses </F> Approved. But Will Quotas Be Preserved?"]    [Text] Regulation of export is currently centered  around manipulations of quotas. Their future fate may turn out  to be rather varied: Ranging from their significant  restructuring for the purpose of reduction to their use as  insurance funds in attracting foreign investments. While  coordination work goes on in the higher offices, in practical  activity exporters will be guided by the MFER [Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations] instruction on the order of issuing  export licenses in 1994, which has passed registry in the  Ministry of Justice and was officially disseminated  yesterday.    Export quotas and licenses--if not twins, are certainly  blood  relatives. First, quotas are born within the Ministry of  Economics. There are four types of these: State quotas, which  the MFER strives to distribute through its tendering committee;  enterprise quotas, which the latter receive through the retained  sectoral departments; regional quotas, which are managed by the  local administrations; and auction quotas, which the MFER puts  up for bidding. The most troublesome, naturally, is to obtain  one quota or another. Then the exporter, who files the  application in accordance with the MFER instruction, receives a  license from the ministry's local authorized agencies. Turning  the quota into a license is in essence a purely technical act.  However, the ratified instruction, due to the laws of the genre,  certainly does not make it any easier. The objective basis is to  tighten the requirements of currency control. Now the MFER  authorized agency, before issuing a license, must be assured of  guarantees of returnability of the currency revenues in  accordance with the joint version of the system of currency  control developed by the Central Bank and the GTK [RF State  Tariff Committee] (instruction on the order of implementing  currency control dated 12 October 1993). And this automatically  means that the possibilities for dragging out the issuance of  licenses are expanded. It is true, this favorite game of the  bureaucrats may become senseless in connection with the rather  probable significant reduction in the family of quotas.    According to many indicators (among them the direct  announcements of Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin,  Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, acting  Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin, and (less importantly) the  clear desire of the governmental structures to distribute the  annual volume of export licenses as soon as possible), the  current system of quota setting and licensing may not even make  it to the end of the year. A significant elimination of quotas  in export is expected (it is true, the quotas on oil, diesel  fuel, aluminum, copper, nickel, and perhaps other nonferrous  metals will surely remain). In this case, the government admits  that raw material will continue to remain the basis of Russia's  exports in the future, and will try to untie the hands of its  exporters.    Russia's exports in January-April of 1994 increased by  8.7 percent over last year. Moreover, exports of oil (in  physical volume) increased by 8.5 percent, of oil products  (primarily diesel fuel)--by 22.5 percent, and of natural gas--by  14.4 percent. Even in such a traditionally industrial region of  Russia as Sverdlovsk Oblast the relative share of exports of raw  materials increased from 57 percent in 1992 to 83.6 percent in  1993. The machine-building areas export only 3.4 percent of  their products.    The elimination of state quotas raises questions. On one  hand, the purpose of quotas is to ensure Russia's state  obligations. State quotas are retained in this, synonymously  reduced, form: Obligations must be fulfilled, especially since  the State Duma firmly intends to significantly cut Russia's  credit limits to foreign countries. On the other hand, the draft  budget provides for income from state export in the volume of  $3.3 billion. Where will this money come from if state quotas  are eliminated? The consent of the Ministry of Finance to remove  state quotas on exports, and this means also on budget currency  losses, may mean only one thing: We should expect elimination of  all tariff and currency benefits to exporters and importers  (primarily oil and gas producers, which will surely evoke the  opposition of the RF Ministry of Fuel and Energy). Other  exporters, however, may evidently hope for a reduction in export  tariff rates. If benefits disappear, the volume of revenues from  customs duties may even in this case cover the budget currency  losses.

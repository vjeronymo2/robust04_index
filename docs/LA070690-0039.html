			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> STINGLESS WASP JOINS WHITEFLY WAR  </P> <P> Agricultural crews are releasing tiny stingless wasps in Southern California  this week as a weapon against the ash whitefly parasite, the state Department  of Food and Agriculture said.  </P> <P> Pesticides are ineffective and the fly has no known natural enemy in  California. The speck-sized wasp is the first biological weapon to be used  against the ash whitefly in California, where it was first detected in Los  Angeles County in August, 1988. This week's releases are in Los Angeles,  Orange, Riverside, San Diego, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, where the  infestations are most intense.  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US flood damage prompts sharp cut in world grain forecast FLOOD DAMAGE to US crops is cited by the International Wheat Council as the main reason for a sharp cut in its estimate of world coarse grains production in 1993-94. In the latest issue of its monthly Grain Market Report the council puts output in the coming year at 811m tonnes, compared with the 829m tonnes it forecast in its June report and actual production of 859m tonnes in 1992-93. And it warns that 'the figure could be subject to further sizeable revision pending assessment of crop damage caused by flooding in the US mid-west. However, the report raises the 1993-94 wheat estimate from last month's 560m tonnes to 562m tonnes, which would be unchanged on last season and exceeded only by the 1990 record of 592m tonnes. The increase is attributed to the expectation of a larger Russian harvest. The report also gives forecasts of world carryover grain stocks, indicating that while wheat stocks are projected to rise by 5m tonnes to 134m tonnes during 1993-94, the coarse grains carryover, which rose by 32m tonnes last season, is likely on present indications to fall back by 25m tonnes to 126m tonnes. The IWC cautions, however, that stocks assessments, which are given 'for the sake of completeness', can be 'liable to misinterpretation'. Officially published national totals are rarely complete and commonly include only officially-held stocks, it notes. And for producing areas such as China and the former Soviet Union stock changes have to be inferred from production and consumption figures - 'themselves only broad estimates'. Another problem is that differing year-ends mean that actual availability never falls as low as the aggregated carryover figure. The council also notes that the trend towards minimising carryover stocks, which are costly to store, through production policies like acreage set-asides is further distorting the position. 'Land set aside or fallowed in the major exporters can be seen as constituting another form of reserve,' it says, 'albeit one which cannot be drawn on quite so readily as physical stocks.'</p>

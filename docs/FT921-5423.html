			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2% as rate cut hopes fade Tokyo THE NIKKEI average fell 2 per cent yesterday as expectations of an interest rate cut diminished in the face of a weaker yen and higher bond yields, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed down 436.11 at the day's low of 21,051.71. The index gained briefly in the morning on continued strength in bio-technology stocks, hitting the day's high of 21,529.61. However, profit-taking by dealers and arbitrage unwinding pushed it lower again. Volume rose to 240m shares from 200m as investors sold the auto, electronics and drug sectors. Declines outnumbered advances by 742 to 207 with 179 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 18.64 to 1,542.43 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.19 to 1173.93. The fall in drug stocks, which have been actively traded during the past week, depressed sentiment. Some traders noted a shift in interest to environmental protection stocks. Japan Storage Battery, which produces batteries for electric cars, rose Y30 to Y1,100 while Ebara, the industrial pump-maker known for its sewage technology, added Y10 to Y1,550. Sumitomo Chemical, the most active issue of the day, rose Y28 to Y474 on heavy buying by a UK brokerage house. Speculation that the company's affiliate would team up with a British drug maker prompted some investors to pursue the stock. Aids-related issues, which had led the recent rally, fell on profit-taking. Mochida Pharmaceutical fell Y90 to Y3,680 and Nippon Mining retreated Y9 to Y475. A total of 73 issues hit new lows since the beginning of last year. Concerns over slowing corporate earnings depressed Hitachi which declined Y13 to Y822 and Nissan Motor, down Y26 to Y610. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 243 to 22,906.06 in volume of 54.3m shares. The OSE announced yesterday that it will terminate trading in its 'Stock Futures 50', a futures contract based on 50 stocks listed on the OSE, from March 12. The contract, launched in 1987, was the first futures contract to be listed on a Japanese stock exchange. Although daily volume rose above 5,000 contracts soon after its launch, investors abandoned the contract after the listing of the Nikkei 225 futures in 1988. Trading in Stock Futures 50 has since fallen to just one trade per day. Roundup THE Pacific Rim ended lower, depressed by the fall in Tokyo, but Indian share prices soared through a third successive record breaking day, boosted by Saturday's budget. BOMBAY's BSE Index leapt another 139.53, or 4.2 per cent, to a new closing peak of 3,472.78. The index has risen by 22 per cent cent since the budget, and some 80 per cent since the beginning of the year. Brokers said that at least 80 private mutual funds are awaiting approval to launch, hoping to bring about Rs160bn into the stock market, and that state-owned investment institutions and mutual funds, which used to offload stocks to stabilise the market, have stopped selling. HONG KONG ended lower in quiet trading as investors took profits following the market's recent record-breaking rally. The Hang Seng index lost 41.06 to 4,911.13. Hutchison fell 10 cents to HKDollars 16 on talk that it plans to make a rights issue. SEOUL fell following the suspension of trading in Sammi Steel shares after rumours, later denied, that the company had sought court protection from creditors. The composite index fell 4.73 to 615.92 in turnover of Won326.26bn. TAIWAN was pulled lower in late selling and the weighted index closed down 87.73 at 5,056.64 in turnover of TDollars 33bn. MANILA fell as investors remained nervous ahead of May's presidential election. The composite index closed down 14.37 at 1,157.46 in turnover of 388m pesos. BANGKOK rose on heavy buying of Bangkok Bank in the last hour of trading. The SET index ended 9.42 up at 788.52 on turnover of Bt5.52bn. Bangkok Bank rose Bt28 to Bt660.</p>

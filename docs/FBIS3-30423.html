			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B. Gulan: "We Will Open the Roads, Providing </F> Certain Concessions Are Made"]    [Text] At the start of the normalization of relations  between Yugoslavia and Croatia, the possibility arises of  initiating the process of dealing with the Krajina-Croat  problems that need to be solved. Namely, Croatia and the  republic of Serbian Krajina have things to discuss, but only  peacefully and with mutual respect. The opening of a Croat  office in Belgrade and a Yugoslav one in Zagreb can only help  and speed things up, says Slobodan Jarcevic, interior minister  in the government of the republic of Serbian Krajina.    I believe that the republic of Serbian Krajina was not  discussed when the agreement between the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia was signed. Perhaps  Croatia is hoping that Yugoslavia will help it to reintegrate  the republic of Serbian Krajina into the Croatian borders as  defined by AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of  Yugoslavia], but that is just an illusion. This is the fifth  year that the republic of Serbian Krajina has not been a part of  Croatia, and that must be accepted. Relations between the  republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia will depend solely on  Croatia's readiness to recognize our state, stressed Slobodan  Jarcevic.    The agreement between Yugoslavia and Croatia pertains only  to  those areas that are under Croatian control and that are not  controversial. The peace process means the end of combat  activity on the borders of the republic of Serbian Krajina and  Croatia. There can be no discussion abut the republic of Serbian  Krajina's territories without the legitimate representatives of  the republic of Serbian Krajina, says Jarcevic. Croatia and the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are two sovereign states and, as  such, they can sign agreements. The republic of Serbian Krajina  never conditioned Yugoslavia's position toward Croatia.  However, a similar agreement between the republic of Serbian  Krajina and Croatia cannot be expected, because this would mean  that Croatia has recognized the republic of Serbian Krajina.  And it will most certainly not be the one to do so first. On  the contrary. At the moment, no one wishes to sign a similar  agreement with us, because both the Croatian and Muslim sides in  Bosnia -- with which we share borders -- are adhering to the  conclusions of the international community according to which  our right to statehood has not been recognized.    One of the important elements of the Yugoslav-Croatian  agreement is certainly the anticipated opening of roads, that  is, the Belgrade-Zagreb highway, a part of which runs through  the republic of Serbian Krajina's territory. According to  Slobodan Jarcevic, it will be possible to open the highway if  Croatia is willing to make certain concessions to the republic  of Serbian Krajina.    We primarily have in mind the transit route to Hungary  through Western Slavonia. All passengers travelling through the  republic of Serbian Krajina will be subject to our laws. We  shall have border crossings like any other state. For allowing  the Croatian railroad to run through Knin, we shall demand to be  allowed to use of one of the ports on the Croatian coast. Or,  for example, we can solve the problem of supplying Zadar with  water from the Zrmanja River, but in return, the Croat side has  to enable the production of electric power at the Obrovac  hydro-electric power plant, says Jarcevic.    Even before the war, some vital parts of the generator were  dismantled and taken to Karlovac. The Krajina authorities  understand the Croats' problems in trying to establish a traffic  route connecting the north and the south, but we will demand a  port in return for allowing the passage of trains from Zagreb to  Split. Similar standards will be applied in the case of the  highway, the oil pipeline, and telecommunications. We  understand them, but we are also protecting our interests, which  are unavoidable in a state whose existence has entered its fifth  calendar year, stressed Slobodan Jarcevic.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich at 1992 high as Milan sinks to new low ZURICH closed at a new high for the year, while Milan hit a 1992 low, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT, anticipating an early end to the public sector strikes, recorded its first gains in the DAX since April 22. The index advanced 4.35 to 1,732.64 although the FAZ index was 1.29 lower at 698.00. Turnover rose to DM4.3bn from DM3.8bn. Retailers were stronger on hopes that a resolution to the strike would mean a return to normal levels of consumer spending. Estimates have suggested that sales have fallen by between 20-50 per cent over the last two weeks. Asko rose DM13 to DM821, Karstadt gained DM11.50 or 1.9 per cent to DM620 and Kaufhof was DM9 firmer at DM495. Escada, the fashion house, saw the sharpest fall of the day, losing DM81 or 10 per cent to DM430 after forecasting lower 1992 profits. Schering fell DM5.80 to DM813.70 after reporting a 2 per cent fall in first quarter profits, due to weaker earnings at its pesticide division. Henkel shed DM1.50 to DM613 in spite of forecasting a rise in turnover this year. Lufthansa fell another DM1 to DM146.50, as the strike shut down Frankfurt. Volkswagen gained DM1.70 to DM380.50 ahead of today's annual report and Degussa closed at a year's high, up DM9.30 at DM356.50. PARIS was boosted by Wall Street's overnight record close and hopes of lower interest rates following the cut in the UK. The CAC-40 index closed up 5.31 at 2,046.93 but turnover was modest at FFr2.4bn ahead of the holiday on Friday. Eurotunnel added 70 centimes or 1.8 per cent to FFr39.40 with 1.1m shares traded on expectations that it would fill the vacancy in the CAC-40 index following the merger of Hachette and Matra. The packaging companies CMB and Pechiney International are also contenders for inclusion in the index. Pechiney International added FFr4.20 or 2 per cent to FFr211.70, while CMB rose FFr3.50 or 1.9 per cent to FFr188.80. Hachette and Matra could fall when they resume trading today, on disappointment at the lack of details on the exchange of existing shares into shares of the future Matra-Hachette SA. ZURICH advanced to a new high for the year, with Roche taking the limelight. The SMI index gained 12.8 to 1,920.5, but off an intra-day high of 1,926.4. Roche, which reported a 26 per cent rise in first quarter group sales, saw its certificates gain SFr50 to SFr3,300 while its bearers shed SFr70 to SFr4,380. The group said it intends to issue American Depositary Receipts for its certificates. Swissair bearers advanced SFr8 to SFr750 after reporting a 5 per cent increase in first quarter earnings, while Baloise certificates advanced SFr165 to SFr2,120 after Monday's announcement that it was to swap certificates for shares. Its registered shares fell SFr90 to SFr2,200. MILAN closed at a new 1992 low as hopes for a technical correction came to nothing. The Comit index fell 4.03 to 492.18 in turnover estimated at near Tuesday's L129bn. Analysts said that while a temporary recovery was still likely, the outlook for the market was far from encouraging. The increased political and economic risks had not yet been discounted, and there were also fears that the market would sink under the weight of new paper if the state holding company, Iri, continued to sell off stakes in state-controlled companies. Generali dropped L360 to L29,140 ahead of its 1991 results. After the close, the insurer reported a rise of 8.1 per cent in its parent net profit to L381bn, which appeared slightly better than expectations. But analysts were disappointed that Generali had again decided to pay part of the dividend with Alleanza savings shares. Stet recovered L28 to L1,927 after its recent slump while Italcementi showed signs of stabilising, closing L101 lower at L14,822. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index closed 0.6 lower at 129.3. DSM shed 50 cents to Fl 113.80 in spite of its first quarter profits falling in line with market expectations. Akzo, which reported strong first quarter growth last week, gained Fl 1.90 to Fl 161.90. Nedlloyd advanced Fl 1.90 to Fl 58.20 on a buy note from County NatWest, while Philips, which reports first quarter results today, weakened 40 cents to Fl 38.60. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index added 8.2 to 993.7 in turnover of SKr746m after SKr549m. Procordia B-restricted shares closed SKr3 higher at SKr196 and Volvo's B-restricted climbed SKr2 to SKr412, after last night's announcement that Procordia had called off its bid to take over the vehicle group. MADRID was stronger in moderate turnover of some Pta11bn. The general index rose 0.12 to 249.17. Tubacex gained Pta39 or 14.6 per cent to Pta305 on news that Paribas, the French bank, was to take a stake in the steel manufacturer. OSLO gained ground on renewed hopes of economic recovery. The all-share index closed up 5.64 at 455.12 in turnover of NKr708m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm    2 pm    3 pm     close 1177.89  1177.61 1177.42  1177.80  1178.49 1178.25 1178.64  1178.23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1179.15    Day's Low  1176.72  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 1     Apr 30   Apr 29    Apr 28    Apr 27 1175.00   1174.96  1174.59   1169.61   1169.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

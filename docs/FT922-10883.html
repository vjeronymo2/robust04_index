			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Francis Bacon: Obituary FRANCIS BACON, who died yesterday at the age of 82, remained to the last what he had been throughout his long and active career, never so much the enfant as the vieux terrible of contemporary British art. As uncompromising and unabashed in his private life as he was in his work - which to him was ever a matter of the utmost seriousness - there was nothing of the Grand Old Man about him. Yet he was a towering figure in his creative reputation, which was matched only by that of the somewhat older and oddly complementary figure of Henry Moore: both profoundly humane in their preoccupations, but the one dark, the other light; serene optimism against a bleaker pessimism. The difference was that Bacon was to find himself almost alone - the only British painter in his time to be accepted, at home and abroad, as standing by right in the first rank with his contemporaries in the world at large. It is a paradox that he should have achieved such standing with work which, even as it was being produced, was seen to be at odds with the trend of the contemporary avant-garde: surreal expressionism, darkly romantic, above all, figurative, in the time of formalist abstraction. He was accorded two full-scale retrospectives at the Tate. At the first, in 1962, he stood alone: sui generis. By the time of the second show, in 1985. the world had come round to him again. If, by then, the critic might enter certain reservations concerning his later work on its own terms, seen in the context of figurative expressionism revived - Baselitz, Clemente, Schnabel - clearly he remained a singular and towering figure. But that first retrospective in 1962 was the more significant; it came after a career of barely 18 years as a painter. From the distance of the second show it could be seen to mark a watershed in that career, celebrating the substantive and astonishing achievement which would be enough to sustain his reputation undiminished. Francis Bacon was born in Dublin in October 1909, of English parents. He submitted himself to no formal training as an artist, and as a young man practised for a time as an interior decorator and designer. He continued to paint, even to exhibit, through the 1930s, but he destroyed most of this early work; it was not until 1944 that he again began to paint in earnest. The mature achievement was almost Byronic in its instantaneity. Two magisterial works of this first period, a sinister lurking 'figure in a landscape' (1945), and the triptych, 'three studies for figures at the base of a crucifixion' (1944), have rightly been in the Tate these past 40 years. The next dozen years or so saw the production of the screaming Popes, the dogs, baboons and chimpanzees, the early portraits, the figures after Muybridge and, at last, the extended sequence of portraits of Van Gogh on the road to Tarascon. By 1962 the full range of his imagery was established and thoroughly explored, in particular the compositional device of the figure encapsulated by an open, unspecific structure. In the years following, Bacon's interest settled principally on the figure. The scale was amplified, the image subject to all manner of formal variations, but in essence nothing further was introduced. And as the imagery settled into a certain predictability, so the old shock and impact lessened. Attention fell more readily on the surface, and on the speed and subtle dexterity of Bacon's handling of his material. It was what he had said all along: what interested him was not the image for itself, not the message nor the content as such, but only the painting as painting - getting it right, making it real. The problem with Francis Bacon and his work was never of Bacon's making; rather it was always the viewer's. Arrested by the image, viewers found it hard to move beyond it into the work itself. Perhaps it still seems strange to speak of the physical beauty of Bacon's work, but with time it becomes easier.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP HINTS IT MAY LAUNCH PROXY FIGHT FOR PIC 'N' SAVE  </P> <P> An investment group including a former T. Boone Pickens Jr. associate and an  experienced Southern California retailing executive said Wednesday that it  expects to launch a takeover effort for the Pic 'N' Save close-out retail  chain.  </P> <P> The investment group, known as Girard Partners, disclosed in a filing with the  Securities and Exchange Commission that it has acquired 6.6% of the  Dominguez-based chain's stock for $25 million.  </P> <P> Girard Partners is led by David H. Batchelder, who founded a La Jolla  investment firm in 1988 after serving for 10 years as the chief deal maker for  Pickens, the Texas corporate raider. Another key member of the group is Robert  J. McNulty, president and chief executive of the HQ Office Supplies Warehouse  retail chain and a founder of the Home Club chain.  </P> <P> Wednesday's disclosure follows a 24% climb in the price of Pic 'N' Save's stock  last week on rumors of a possible takeover bid. In over-the-counter trading  Wednesday, the stock was up 50 cents to close at $13.50 before Girard Partners  revealed its plans to the SEC.  </P> <P> Analysts had been puzzled about why a takeover artist would want Pic 'N' Save.  The company, analysts said, faces tough competition from other discounters, has  little real estate and owns few, if any, other valuable assets.  </P> <P> But the revelation that McNulty is part of the group pursuing Pic 'N' Save  appears to signal that the investors have an overhaul in mind for the chain,  said Sarah Stack, an analyst with the investment firm Bateman Eichler, Hill  Richards in Los Angeles. She called McNulty an innovative businessman who has  pioneered new warehouse retailing concepts.  </P> <P> "There'll be some changes made if these people are successful," Stack said.  </P> <P> Stack said Girard Partners is more likely to pursue Pic 'N' Save with a proxy  fight rather than with an outright bid for the company. She noted that the  investors indicated that they still are trying to line up financing for an  acquisition and that they did not disclose what price they would pay for Pic  'N' Save.  </P> <P> In the SEC filing, Girard Partners said it is seeking consent from Pic 'N'  Save's management to reorganize the board so that it will be dominated by the  investment group. Girard proposed a five-member board, consisting of  Batchelder, McNulty and supply-side economist and consultant Arthur B. Laffer,  along with Pic 'N' Save President Lewis B. Merrifield III and the company's  former chairman, Arthur Frankel.  </P> <P> The SEC document said that, if installed, the new board members would seek to  sell most or all of Pic 'N' Save to Girard Partners or another bidder. Girard  Partners said it has invested in Pic 'N' Save because it believes that the  current price of its shares "does not adequately reflect the value of the  underlying businesses and assets of the company or the price that could be  obtained" if it were sold.  </P> <P> Representatives of Girard Partners could not be reached for comment. William M.  Jacobs Jr., Pic 'N' Save's senior vice president and chief financial officer,  said his company would have no comment until it studied the SEC filing.  </P> <P> Pic 'N' Save, a chain of 189 stores, has doubled in size during the past four  years. Its earnings have declined, however, because of stepped-up competition  and the cost of its expansion.  </P> <P> In 1989, profit fell 34% to $30.9 million on sales of $475.2 million. The  stores sell a wide variety of discontinued and surplus products.  </P></p>

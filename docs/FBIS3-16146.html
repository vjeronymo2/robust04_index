Vladimir Shumeyko Succeeds in Weapons Training at  Baltic Fleet Base"]    [Text] Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko hit  three half-length practice targets with short assault-rifle  bursts fired "from the shoulder," thus having attained an  officer's performance standard. Deputy Defense Minister  Konstantin Kobets has registered the result.    Leaving the firing range in the city of Baltiysk -- the main  base of the Baltic Fleet -- the speaker said that he would  oppose the Finance Ministry's attempts to slash the Armed  Forces' financing, because "servicemen have no benefits; on the  contrary, they receive less than their due."    Local servicemen claim that a recent statement by Polish  President Lech Walesa about an overconcentration of troops in  Kaliningrad Oblast does not square with reality. Governor Yuriy  Matochkin has told SEGODNYA that "around 10 percent of the  oblast population have a direct relation to the Armed Forces,"  that is, around 90,000 people. According to the Baltic fleet  staff, there are slightly more than 25,000 men serving in the  fleet, although an average crew's strength is only 65 percent of  the standard level. The command insists that the personnel has  shrunk drastically in the past few years, as has the number of  ships.    Vladimir Yegorov, the fleet's commander-in-chief, says that  the fleet includes only a few submarines, which are currently  being withdrawn from Latvia's Liepaja. Only two of them are  operational, and none of them is nuclear, the commander said.  "There have never been any nuclear arms in Baltiysk," a press  center staffer said.    Officials at the Baltic Fleet staff say the last force to  become part of the fleet was a missile boat squadron pulled out  from Poland last year. Lieutenant General Anatoliy Pimenov,  commander of the 11th Guards Army, which is deployed in the  oblast, says that the last time his army was expanded was three  years ago, when a motor rifle division withdrawn from  Czechoslovakia was attached to it. Afterward, no troops have  been redeployed to Russia's Baltic enclave, the servicemen say,  while reports on the concentration of the military force have  been prompted by foreign observers' mistaking units that pass  the oblast on their way from East Europe for new troops.    It is not yet clear, however, how the upcoming merger of the  region's two military bases -- in Baltiysk and St. Petersburg --  under a single command may affect the enclave's military might.  Observers do not rule out that troops may be reallocated between  the bases, and then new submarines may emerge in Baltiysk.    Oblast Administration chief Yuriy Matochkin, like a number  of  the Baltic Fleet's top officers, believes that "further  reductions in the fleet are inevitable. And considerable ones  at that -- up to 40 percent." Commander-in-Chief Vladimir  Yegorov states firmly, however: "In our view, it cannot be any  smaller. And the General Staff agrees."</p>

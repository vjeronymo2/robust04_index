Zhirinovskiy reportedly  met a certain Werner Girke, who was responsible for managing the  enormous foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany  [SED] in the former German Democratic Republic [GDR].    According to Bonn security circles, Zhirinovskiy wanted to  "tap" the enormous Stasi funds that were embezzled to Austria  via cover companies. Zhirinovskiy, who made his career in the  surroundings of the KGB, is also believed to be the "manager" of  an underground network of former KGB enterprises abroad, as NEUE  KRONEN-ZEITUNG reported recently.    After the collapse of communism, the security apparatuses of  the USSR, the GDR, and other states set up their own businesses  using these huge assets. The profits of the cover companies are  also being used for political purposes -- Zhirinovskiy's  assumption of power, for example. Zhirinovskiy had enormous  sums of money at his disposal during the election campaign, and  now he even wants to buy a majority of votes in the new  parliament!    The coup with the Berlin "businessman" Girke (nicknamed  "Account-number Girke"), agreed in Austria, was to be finalized  in Berlin. This is why the Russian applied for another visa for  Germany, which, however, he was denied.    On the orders of the Trust Agency and the "Commission for  the  Search of SED Assets," the Berlin police searched Werner Girke's  offices yesterday. During the raid, numerous documents were  seized. Girke is missing. A trustee was installed at his  company.</p>

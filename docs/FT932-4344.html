			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Walesa bid to avert pay strike PRESIDENT Lech Walesa will meet Solidarity leaders today to discuss pay demands over which the trade union is threatening to call a general strike, Reuter reports. According to Mr Marian Krzaklewski, Solidarity chairman, the talks in Warsaw will cover union demands for pay rises in the public sector and changes in economic policy. 'I do not expect that after these talks everything will change in Poland, but we would be satisfied if we got a positive response to some of our demands,' he said. Solidarity helped bring down Poland's government last month by calling a parliamentary confidence vote after Ms Hanna Suchocka, the prime minister, refused their pay demands. The union repeated threats to call a nationwide strike if its demands were not met after Mr Walesa dissolved parliament and asked Ms Suchocka to stay on until elections on September 19.</p>

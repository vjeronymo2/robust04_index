			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: An additional burden on those who save, but with no commensurate addition to their state pension (1) Sir, Anyone concerned for the economic future of the nation in the light of a possible Labour victory should ponder carefully the thoughts of Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow treasury minister, as enunciated in your Personal Finance Supplement ('A real top rate of 59 per cent', January 24-25). Savers, it seems, must suffer the additional burden of national insurance contributions along with so-called high earners since, says Mrs Beckett, the money they have invested may or may not have been worked for. In other words, if you choose to defer spending by saving, and create a nest egg for your retirement, that - in the eyes of the ingenuous Mrs Beckett - is tough, and another convenient tax source. There are others now whose needs are greater than yours (or, more realistically, with greater voting power). Perhaps we might be told whether this diktat is to apply to National Savings, which, as a vehicle for harbouring investment, is as indifferent as any other to the means by which it was accrued. The truth is, that despite the camouflage of the red rose, nothing has changed in the political dictum of the Labour party, which remains as always 'from each according to his income, to each according to his vote'. Paul Baker, Knelle Lodge, 37 Robin Hill Drive, Camberley, Surrey GU15 1EG</p>

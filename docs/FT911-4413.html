			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Manville in asbestos trust charge MANVILLE, the Denver-based industrial products group, has begun setting aside a portion of its profits to settle thousands of claims by victims of its previous involvement in the asbestos business. Manville's first-quarter earnings include an Dollars 8.1m 'profit- sharing' charge earmarked for the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, one of two agencies formed to handle the asbestos poisoning claims. One of the conditions for Manville's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1988 was a commitment to set aside 20 per cent of earnings for the personal injury trust. The payments will begin in 1992, but are based on the previous year's earnings. The other trust deals with property damage claims. Despite the profit - sharing charge, Manville, whose business is now centred on paper and packaging products, building materials, industrial fibre glass and minerals, lifted net income to Dollars 35m, or 26 cents a share, in the first quarter, from Dollars 24.9m, or 18 cents, a year earlier. The improvement was entirely due, however, to receipt of about Dollars 40m in settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit. Net sales slipped to Dollars 495.7m from Dollars 518m, and operating income was down to Dollars 41.6m from Dollars 65.5m. The building products business was especially hard hit. The Manville personal injury trust was set up in 1988 with about Dollars 2.5bn in assets. However it ran out of cash early last year after settling claims more quickly than expected and finding itself deluged with applications for relief from about 170,000 victims. The trust's immediate problems were relieved in November with a refinancing agreement involving the trust converting Manville preferred shares into common stock, thereby entitling it to special dividends. A new compensation system means that the most seriously ill asbestos victims now have priority in the settlement of their claims. A ceiling has also been placed on fees for claimants' lawyers.</p>

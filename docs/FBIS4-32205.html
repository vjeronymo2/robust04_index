			<p>BFN     [Text] The Vatra Romaneasca Union [UVR] has faxed us a  message containing a number of stipulations they propose for  inclusion in the Draft Education Law.    Thus, they propose that secondary education in the Romanian  language should be organized and operate in every village, town,  and municipality of the country. Entrance examinations, as well  as all graduation examinations of every kind of educational  institutions should be held solely in Romanian, while ethnic  minorities should be granted, in the domain of education, the  same rights as the Romanian ethnic minority is granted in  Hungary, and the same rights as ethnic minorities are granted in  Western democracies, that is, rights as stipulated by the  relevant international regulations.    These proposals were worked out during a meeting of the UVR  National Steering Committee, which was held on 18 June in the  town of Lugoj, says the message faxed to us by Zeno Opris,  chairman of the UVR.</p>

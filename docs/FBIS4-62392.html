			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "State Duma Denies the Army Its </F> `Subsistence Minimum'"]    [Text] The 1994 state budget was given its first reading  by the State Duma 11 May. The total budget expenditure,  revenues, and deficit were approved. The deficit stands at 36  percent of the budget. The Ministry of Defense request (backed  by the Russian Federation president) that 18 trillion rubles be  added to the defense budget failed to gain the requisite number  of votes. Nor was any attention paid to the desperate attempts  by the Duma Committee for Defense (chairman -- Sergey Yushenkov)  to convince deputies that the point at issue concerned not some  kind of excessive requirements but the elementary "subsistence  minimum" needed by the Armed Forces to maintain the country's  defense capability at the requisite level.    Acting Finance Minister Mr. Dubinin used essentially the  same  argument to parry all arguments in the Army's favor: Any  appropriation of additional sums for defense would increase the  budget deficit which, in turn, would lead to a new spiral of  inflation and higher prices, which would mean that everyone --  including the Army -- would end up as losers. As a matter of  fact, the selfsame way to curb inflation was also chosen by the  "Russia's Choice" faction and the Yabloko bloc.    Recognizing the critical danger of unleashing inflationary  processes with a budget deficit in excess of 40 percent,  representatives of several other factions suggested different  measures. For example, Sergey Glazyev (Democratic Party of  Russia faction), chairman of the State Duma Committee for  Economic Policy, questioned the need to spend such impressive  amounts on the maintenance of the state apparatus. Furthermore,  he assumes that the planned revenues from the privatization of  state property have been inexplicably reduced. According to  specialists, there are other ways making it possible to  painlessly increase the financial support for defense, science,  culture, and education. But the State Duma and the government  now perceive the Army as the main "defendant" when it comes to  anti-inflation security.    I would imagine that there is no need to explain to KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA readers -- whose knowledge of today's realities in the  Armed Forces is not based on speculative surveys -- the meaning  of the defense budget's reduction by a factor of 1.5 from the  original estimates. Essentially this means further decrepitude  of the Army's military-technical potential and curtailment of  the structural changes envisaged by the military reform (the  loudest shouts of "Where are the Army reforms?" come from those  who refuse to allocate money for these reforms).    It has to be bluntly said that the shorn defense budget will  deal a crushing blow on enterprises working on military orders.  We all know that there are quite a few such enterprises in the  country. Workers and engineers from the defense sector have  only just ended their protest actions outside Government House.  They were promised real assistance. But it appears that  hundreds of thousands of people are again being told to switch  to a "self-survival regime." Subsidies have also been cut for  the long-suffering conversion which actually degenerates into  convulsion at times, while scientific and technical work in the  military sphere is being frozen with consequences which are easy  to calculate. But is anyone today worried about tomorrow? As a  matter of fact, no specific evidence was adduced during the  debate to prove that the Army was asking for excessive funding.  On the other hand, there was no shortage of significant dark  hints.    Those who object to the 18 trillion speak of the military  department's inability to properly manage the funds appropriated  for defense, but it all boils down to accusations of "inflated  corps of generals." There are no counterarguments at the level  of professional and comprehensive analysis. Just emotions.  Meanwhile, the situation among the troops is verging on the  critical in many instances. Here is just one "sore spot." Much  has been said about the nuclear missile-carrying Northern Fleet.  Way back in August last year, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA wrote about the  lamentable situation in the fleet, which is bearing the full  brunt of the principle of "surplus financing." One can imagine  the impact of the "shorn" budget on the combat ranks of a fleet  which used to be one of the world's mightiest.    I will not even attempt to explain the stubbornness with  which some deputies and ministers are trying to literally finish  off both the country's defense industry and the Armed Forces  themselves. In the course of private conversations they display  absolute understanding of the problems currently facing the Army  and the military-industrial complex but, when it comes to  decisionmaking time, certain corporate considerations of  "big-time politics" seem to gain the upper hand. Then  everything becomes simple -- blame all the failures of economic  reform on the insatiable appetite of the "military monster."  After all, nobody suggested the idea of maintaining the  country's defense capability at exactly the level of the sum  contained in the government's budget. Let backstage passions  rage, let lobbyists tear each other's shirts off, but a simple  point must be obvious to all deputies: The Army (whether  reformed or unreformed) cannot be maintained on starvation  rations. It is impossible to rush into the nuclear magazine  with "shock therapy" mentality. Unfortunately, if we were to  judge by the results of the vote, at least 80 State Duma  deputies believe that this can be done.    "This is both a strategic and a political defeat," I was  told  by Aleksandr Piskunov, deputy chairman of the Committee for  Defense, after the sitting. "At best, the second reading will  add just 1-2 trillion to the defense budget, which will not  solve the problem."    Even though Aleksandr Aleksandrovich did not explain who had  been defeated, it is clear that it was neither the military  department nor the Army. A temporary gain at the expense of  Russia's defense might will hardly improve the country's ailing  economy, and the loss will not be long in coming: The Army, put  on financial starvation rations, will hardly be able to remain a  factor of stability in the state.</p>

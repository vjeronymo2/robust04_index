			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Armed Forces Spokeswoman Major Edith Vargas de  Marroquin said yesterday the Army would be willing to accept  formation of a peace commission if this decision is made during  the peace negotiations being held in Mexico. When asked if the  armed institution would accept a resolution they have openly  opposed and which has been demanded by several grassroots  sectors, Vargas de Morroquin said: "The Army's position is one  of respect for whatever the Peace Commission decides." The  military officer reiterated the Army does not fear the formation  of such a commission, but she reiterated the inconveniences of  establishing such a commission, which have been cited by the  armed institution. She said, however: "We will respect the  government's decision."  <H5>  Commission Exceeded Its Functions in El Salvador </H5>   Dr. Armando Calderon Sol, Salvadoran Nationalist Republican  Alliance (ARENA) presidential candidate, who is visiting  Guatemala, has commented on the Truth Commission's role in the  neighboring country. The commission has played a very important  role, but, unfortunately, it has overstepped its functions and,  for example, did not allow FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front] commanders to run for public posts in a  10-year period. This, he has said, has closed opportunities for  political participation. When asked if he recommends formation  of a similar commission in Guatemala, Calderon Sol said: "The  political situation here is very different to the Salvadoran  one. I cannot make any suggestions in this respect."</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (17): A sort of Soho in the galleries - The accent is on contemporary work. As a result, interesting international, as well as experimental, artists are featured Zurich's gallery scene is lively - as one might expect in a town that is visited by a lot of rich people - and fairly compact. The galleries tend to be less specialised than in other cities, most of them showing a wide range of contemporary work, from drawing, painting and sculpture to photography, printmaking and video. Some feature only Swiss artists, others have an international cast. A quarterly listing of exhibitions, called Kunst in Zurich, complete with maps showing the locations of galleries, is available at any of the galleries. The Zuri Tip pull-out section of the Tages Anzeiger newspaper every Friday provides up-to-date information. To get a taste of the scene, one might start with the Susi Brunner gallery at Spitalgasse 10 in Niederdorf. It specialises in naive and primitive painting, sculpture and furniture. Many of the exhibits, such as the strange, brightly painted papier mache giant animal forms and the small human forms with trays on their heads holding the visualised content of their thoughts will make you smile. The furniture includes chairs with legs of deer and arm-rests with cats' heads and tables and cupboards with birds' wings and angels' heads. Up Spitalgasse a few steps and left into Predigergasse you will find the very posh and rather cold Lelong Zurich gallery. It shows the top international painters and sculptors and is worth a visit just to enjoy the wonderful gallery space. Although the staff can be intimidating, it is a treat to browse through the catalogues of their artists. The October-November exhibition included a group show of Forg, Kirkeby, Klapheck, Lam, Lupertz, Miro, Nitsch, Penck, Rainer and Tapies. Other galleries that show interesting international artists include Galerie Esther Hufschmid, next door to Lelong, Ruth Alleman and Walcheturm at Stampfenbachplatz, Renee Ziegler in the Schauspielhaus across from the Kunsthaus, Helmhaus at Limmatquai 31 and Ursula Siegenthaler in Oberdorfstrasse 24. Sylvia Baviera in Zwinglistrasse 10 has a reputation for discovering new Swiss and German artists. A sort of Soho has developed in recent years in Hardturmstrasse where a clutch of old warehouses along the Limmat have been transformed into galleries. Many of them specialise in experimental art, the most adventurous being the Kunsthalle Zurich.</p>

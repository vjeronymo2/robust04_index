			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Move for broader auditing of results SENIOR ACCOUNTANTS are calling for companies' preliminary announcements, which contain basic information on full-year results, to be scrutinised by auditors. The move comes after questions over the reliance placed by the financial markets on figures which have not been verified by an external source. A paper submitted to the auditing committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales argues that all quoted companies' auditors should approve the preliminary announcements before they are released. The case is likely to be submitted in the next few weeks to the Stock Exchange, the Cadbury Committee on Corporate Governance and the Auditing Practices Board, which sets guidelines for auditors. Preliminary announcements, which are often issued several days or weeks before the audited annual reports and accounts, very often have a substantial effect on share prices. Publication of the report generally has far less effect on the market. The author of the report, Mr Graham Ward, vice-chairman of the committee and a partner with Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, said: 'There is something slightly anomalous when the primary document governing the communication of results doesn't have particularly stringent rules governing it.' The Stock Exchange said there was little evidence of companies' preliminary figures varying from those presented in the full accounts. The accounting treatment of depreciation requires an overhaul to remove inconsistencies, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday. It argues that any attempt to deal with depreciation by the Accounting Standards Board, which drafts new standards, must first address underlying conceptual problems. A discussion paper prepared by the financial reporting committee of the institute calls for clarification of the purpose and meaning of the balance sheet; the definition and recognition of elements within financial statements; and how these elements should be measured.

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC / DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> PASADENA AIDS BENEFIT: A GALA DISASTER WITH GOOD INTENTIONS  </P> <P> The major music and dance organizations of Los Angeles, like comparable  organizations everywhere, have been severely threatened by the AIDS crisis.  </P> <P> For some reason, however, our performing-arts institutions have done little to  help counteract that devastating threat. The Philharmonic, the Music Center  Opera, the Joffrey Ballet, all seem to have looked the other way, leaving  crucial fund-raising chores to the show-biz community.  </P> <P> Perhaps the myopic teams that manage our most glamorous music-makers and  dancers are preoccupied with the challenge of filling their own precarious  coffers. It is, they might rationalize, a matter of resident priorities. . . .  </P> <P> Under the circumstances, one wanted to applaud the so-called International Gala  of Opera and Ballet ventured Sunday night at Pasadena Civic Auditorium by a  committee called From the Heart. The beneficiary would be the AIDS Hospice  Foundation.  </P> <P> The intentions were lofty. The concert, alas, teetered on the brink of artistic  as well as financial disaster. Teetered is putting it kindly.  </P> <P> The event, produced by Alan Sievewright of London, was hastily assembled, oddly  conceived, badly publicized, strangely cast, shoddily executed. It promised far  more stars than it was able to deliver. It played to a heavily papered,  determinedly enthusiastic, hardly full house.  </P> <P> The program was dominated by would-bes and has-beens. An air of desperate  improvisation hovered about the pretentious proceedings.  </P> <P> An on-stage parade of awkward hosts, led by Sievewright and the actress Jane  Seymour, interpolated puff and self-congratulation as well as redundant  annotation. Only one speaker, the actress Morgan Fairchild, actually mentioned  AIDS.  </P> <P> It was sad. It was embarrassing.  </P> <P> Still, it wasn't a total loss. Elizabeth Connell, the British soprano who saved  a "Fidelio" in San Diego last year, sang Lady Macbeth's letter scene with  sufficient sweep and passion to compensate for some smudged coloratura and a  strained climax. Martina Arroyo, though past her prime at 54, sang arias from  "Aida" and "Forza" with stylish authority.  </P> <P> In matters terpsichorean, there was the passing distraction of a competent  ballerina on leave from the Bolshoi. Alla Khaniashvili-Artyushkina, who happens  to be spending the year in Southern California, knows the Petipa tradition,  knows how to sell the fouette marathon of the Black Swan, knows how to minimize  the liability of a cumbersome caractere partner as the prince -- her husband,  Vitali Artyushkin.  </P> <P> Neither Artyushkin could do much with the vapid platitudes of the  Crassus-Aegina duet from "Spartacus." For that, however, one might blame the  choreographer, Yuri Grigorovich.  </P> <P> There was only one bona-fide superstar on the agenda: Maya Plisetskaya. Now 64,  she traveled all the way from Madrid to approximate her 5-minute signature  piece, "The Dying Swan," one more poetic time. The sinuous flutter of her  apparently boneless arms continues to astound.  </P> <P> Otherwise, this was one of those nights. Kathryn Grayson, erstwhile diva of the  Silver Screen (introduced as Kathleen Grayson), stumbled over her introduction  of a nondescript baritone named Damen Rhodes. A replacement for one Dean  Peterson who was to have replaced Gino Quilico, Rhodes struck unintentionally  funny Toreador poses on behalf of Bizet.  </P> <P> Sylvia Sass, the Hungarian soprano who enjoyed brief renown in the mid-1970s  before ruining a promising lyric instrument, came out of obscurity to yelp the  final scene of Richard Strauss' "Salome." Her most notable achievement was to  model a spangly bikini while ogling the severed head of John the Baptist.  </P> <P> The "Salome" episode, not incidentally, was subjected to amateurish low-camp  staging. It came complete with a minimally involved Herod and Herodias, an  incipiently headless Prophet, and a big, attentive, silent chorus of beefcake  extras.  </P> <P> Although this was awful, worse was to come. The second half of the program  opened with the first five minutes of the second act of Wagner's "Die Walkure."  None less than David Hockney provided the scenery: bizarre, candy-striped  mountains painted on flappy, ill-lit curtains.  </P> <P> Louis Lebherz (who later returned to cackle Mephisto's serenade) blustered  Wotan's invocation. A local soprano named Veronica Diamond, replacing Marita  Napier who was to have replaced Rita Hunter, reduced Brunnhilde's battle cry to  shrill caricature.  </P> <P> When the formal part of the program drew to a merciful close -- just when the  cognoscenti thought Plisetskaya's terminal fowl was about to die a second time  -- the hosts cut off the ovation and returned for some clumsy valedictory  speeches. These were followed by the ultimate anticlimax: a mass curtain call,  adorned with balloons and accompanied, for reasons unfathomable, by "The Stars  and Stripes Forever."  </P> <P> Frank Fetta and the Pasadena Symphony had begun the festivities with a listless  performance of the "Aida" overture that Verdi discarded. They ended the evening  with misplaced Sousa pomp under dubious circumstances.  </P> <P> Throughout the "gala," the orchestra sounded under-rehearsed, and the notorious  acoustics of the Civic Auditorium muffled just about everything and everyone.  Sometimes one can be grateful for muffling.  </P></p>

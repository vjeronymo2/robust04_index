			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Telegraph ahead to Pounds 30m THE TELEGRAPH group yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 30.3m for the nine months to September 30, up from Pounds 27.5m previously. Revenues increased by Pounds 15m to Pounds 176.2m despite the recession in advertising. Operating profits rose to Pounds 27.9m (22.5m). Mr Joe Cooke, managing director, said every quarter this year had seen an increase in both turnover and profits. 'We think this is a very good performance in the economic context,' he said. The share price edged up 3p before falling back to finish at 314p, up 1p on the day. It has still not reached July's flotation price of 325p - on the first day of trading the price fell to 283p and has been gradually climbing back. Earnings per share fell from 16.5p to 15.7p.</p>

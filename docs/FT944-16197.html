			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Observer: Cola wars Punctilious lot, Germans. German troops returned earlier this year from service with the UN forces in Somalia, not covered in glory but cola. A German squaddie allegedly squirted a Somali in the face with Coca-Cola and yesterday Hans-Dieter Wichter, defence ministry spokesman, read a five-minute statement to the Bonn press, detailing this and other charges. It seems a captured Somali refused to accept the water he was offered and demanded Coca-Cola. Thereupon the water was poured on to the floor in front of his eyes. The state prosecutor is hard at work.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Management: Experience counts as trainees go back to basics  -Pioneering approach to gaining National Vocational Qualifications Until he was made redundant last November, John fitted radios into Jaguar cars at one of the luxury carmaker's Coventry plants. Now he is back at Jaguar again - this time as a trainee. John, 45, is one of more than 30 engineering trainees on the Jaguar project, a joint venture between the carmaker, Coventry and Warwickshire Tec and the local chamber of commerce. The idea came up at the end of last year after falling sales had forced Jaguar to make one-third of its 12,000 workforce redundant and suspend its annual intake of trainees. That left the company's training workshops empty - and expensive machinery gathering dust awaiting an economic upturn. 'We were committed to the training centre and wanted to keep the facilities open and operating,' says Mike Kinski, personnel director. The local Tec suggested a training partnership to use the empty space, and with training provided by the Coventry Chamber of Commerce, the Jaguar project officially opened at the end of April. It is running two courses, leading to National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) in business administration and engineering manufacturing. To recruit trainees, the company wrote to 1,400 of the workers laid off at the end of last year, telling them about the training facilities and the chance to study for NVQs. It says that 193 responded, of whom 73 opted for the courses after initial counselling. There are currently 20 on the business administration course and 34 on the engineering course. Trainees are also referred to the project by the local employment service, and local miners laid off by British Coal have signed up to learn engineering skills. John Fitzpatrick, training manager and also a former Jaguar employee, now runs the project for the chamber of commerce. He says that at first it was difficult to get trainees on to the engineering course. 'Some of them have been made redundant three or four times - they're getting a bit cynical.' In the computer room, John is finding the word processing program very different from his previous experience fitting car radios. 'At first I wondered what I was doing here. It was so different and seemed really hard. But now I'm starting to get used to it.' Although he admits to feeling confused at present, he would like to 'get into something using computers'. In one of the engineering workshops, Bernard, 50, is learning how to program machine tools using a computer. A skilled engineer, he was made redundant from a local company at the end of last year. Before starting the course in April, he had applied for 40 jobs - only to be told he was too old. 'I heard about this from a friend who has done it. I know I'm not too old. I hope with this experience to be able to get into engineering planning work.' Fitzpatrick is adamant that the training is not billed as an automatic route to a job. 'We make it quite clear from the start that we can't guarantee a job,' he says. 'The whole point is equipping the trainees with skills and knowledge to make them more marketable.' Part of the project is pioneering a new approach to gaining NVQs, specifically targeted at older, experienced workers. Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) aims to get away from traditional paper qualifications and use candidates' previous experience to prove their competence. The Engineering Training Authority (EnTra) has just launched a national system of APL for the engineering manufacturing industry and is confident that APL gives employers and employees the means of assessing experience. 'The whole system of training is moving from being process-based to output-based - one that recognises standards achieved, not courses completed,' says EnTra regional manager Ron Law. Using APL, candidates submit a portfolio of their competence, based on course certificates, employers' letters or historical records, to qualified assessors. Depending on the result, they are awarded either the relevant NVQ or units towards it, or recommended for further training. The notion of APL seems to be receiving a cautious welcome in the engineering industry, although there is concern that its emphasis on individual assessment and tuition may prove too demanding for many employers or colleges to provide. Peter Swindlehurst of the Engineering Council says: 'It is a viable approach, although it's much more easily done when you have a number of people from one major source going through it together. Individual institutions might find it very difficult to provide the bespoke training people need.' The various levels of competence for the engineering APL are contained in four thick blue manuals in John Fitzpatrick's office. He concedes that the system can seem complicated, but adds: 'Once people understand what APL means they will take it seriously. It gets rid of the problem for employers of taking on someone who says they can do the job - then finding they can't' EnTra is currently testing APL with 16 Tecs around the country. It is confident that once the pilot projects have 'ironed out the glitches', the guidelines for engineering, to be issued early next year, will provide a workable approach to training for the industry. But what is in it for employees? They may have their skills documented and be able to complete NVQs more quickly, but unless the APL approach is recognised - and adopted - across the industry, going through the process is unlikely to win them better jobs - or, indeed, any job. Jaguar, however, reports waiting lists for its courses. According to official figures, Coventry's unemployment rate is currently around 11.2 per cent. It remains to be seen whether accrediting redundant workers' skills can really help them get another job - or whether it is just raising false hopes.</p>

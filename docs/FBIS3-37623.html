			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We are broadcasting an appeal by the Council of  Ministers of Abkhazia:    Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev,  the State Duma of the Russian Federation:    Highly esteemed sirs, you are well aware of Abkhazia's  tragedy. Despite many agreements, from Sochi to Geneva,  perfidiously violated by the Gudauta side, savage bloody orgies  conducted by bandit units comprised of or hired by Abkhaz  separatists, the so-called Confederation of the Caucasian  Mountain Peoples and Cossacks still continue. With the excuse  of fighting partisan forces, they are brutally exterminating the  Georgian population in Gali Rayon. Dozens of villages and  hundreds of houses have been burned down. Escaping from the  persecutors, over 3,000 people have fled to the mountains. Of  these, several hundred people froze and died from the cold and  hunger. Mass killings that are being carried out with  particular cruelty are accompanied by rape, dismemberment,  burning, and so on.    The situation in the whole of Georgia is so tense that  processes may become unmanageable and irreversible. At present,  300,000 desperate refugees are able to take extreme and  undesirable actions at any time and even to arm and go en masse  to their homeland, Abkhazia [words indistinct].    Therefore, if urgent and decisive measures are not taken on  the basis of the Russian-Georgian agreements, as well as the  United Nations' fundamental documents, tragedy will be  unavoidable and it may be followed by a new, more large-scale  and bloody Caucasian war, which may also involve Russia.    Someone must eventually bring an end to these bloody orgies  by the extremely impertinent representatives of the separatists  and Russian reactionary forces and their henchmen. Leaders of  far and near abroad, and Russian leaders and members of  parliament in particular, must know that having usurped a group  of Abkhaz separatists in the autonomous Republic of Abkhazia,  succeeded in provoking a war after thorough and long  preparation. The dictatorship of Ardzinba's fascist clique is  by no means the same as the Abkhaz people and, moreover, the  whole multinational population of Abkhazia.    The world community has given an unequivocal assessment of  the separatists' activities, regarding them as genocide, ethnic  cleansing, and a crime against humanity. All these barbaric  actions are happening while the world civilization is  flourishing and ideas of humanity, democracy, and human rights  are expanding in advanced states.    Highly esteemed sirs, the arrival in Georgia of an honorable  delegation from the Russian Federation led by Boris Yeltsin and  the signing of the historic treaty have engendered high hopes in  the hearts of the whole multinational population of Georgia,  especially the refugees exiled from their homes in Abkhazia who  are suffering extreme hardship.    The Council of Ministers of Abkhazia appeals to you,  esteemed  sirs, to take decisive and radical measures for an urgent  peaceful settlement of the conflict between the Abkhazians and  the Georgians at last, and have the genocide and ethnic  cleansing by the Georgian population of Abkhazia stopped, as  well as to remove the threat to the very existence of the Abkhaz  nation whose genetic stock is on the brink of extinction.    [Signed] The Council of Ministers of Abkhazia, Tbilisi</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Arts: Beckett plays with master and slave - Theatre To see Beckett's first two plays in quick succession, as one currently can in London, is an engrossing and startling experience. One is startled, anew, by the dramatic brilliance and depth of both Waiting for Godot (1949) and Endgame (1956), but startled too by realising that the former, for all its power as myth (the title has practically entered the language) and language, is in some sense a rough draft for the latter. Endgame, which the Fair Play Theatre Company is staging at Battersea Arts Centre's Studio 1 (until March 13, then for five days at the Sheffield Crucible) - astonishingly, it is the play's first London appearance in a decade - repeats the themes and stratagems of Godot, but in a finer tone. The master and slave relationship of Pozzo and Lucky, which arguably lends the main dramatic and poetic interest to Godot, but only, as it were, in the manner of a star turn, is enlarged to occupy the entire dramatic space of Endgame. Pozzo, inexplicably blinded by the second half of Godot, is continued as the sightless, anguished, orotund egomaniac, Hamm; and Lucky - mute in Godot, save for his famous single outburst of 'thinking' - has become the more talkative, though grimly laconic, Clov (who does, at one point, pace about 'having an idea'). The Godot-expecting tramps Vladimir and Estragon are downgraded in Endgame to Hamm's legless, dustbinned 'accursed progenitors', Nagg and Nell, who too have spent happy days in the French countryside, or think they have. The small boy appearing like a perplexed angel at the end of each Godot act, does not need to take corporeal form at the end of Endgame: he is merely, movingly, postulated. In each play there are knockabout routines (with trousers) and gags at the expense of the audience and the theatrical illusion: but Endgame's long-ringing alarm clock has a power beyond the vaudevillian. Each play is consumed with passionate meditation on time and human futility - but in Endgame the yield of tragic poetry seems to me even greater than in Godot, just as its construction is all the more lethally taut (a single act of under 90 minutes). But perhaps I only feel this way because Endgame received a performance so roundly superior to that of Godot as staged by Efendi Productions at the Hammersmith Lyric Studio. The idea behind director Lisa Forrell's interpretation is that Godot is being awaited somewhere in the Levant; so we get the sounds of sultry pipes, surging sea and desert wind; we get hieroglyphics on the low stone wall and a big Mediterranean moon; but we also get incongruous reminiscences of the Pyrenees and Macon Country. If we get 50 per cent of Beckett's text, I should be surprised. Nadim Sawalha's Vladimir makes up more than he ever says right, and when it is right it is intolerably prosaic. His speech near the end ('Astride of a grave and a difficult birth') - which, like so many passages in these two prose plays, achieves the intensity of great verse - has as much moment as it would if he were counting out money. Kevork Malikyan's Estragon was better; Bruce Purchase's big and big-bellied Pozzo was enjoyable for its impossibly elongated posh vowels; and Ben Daniels's Lucky was a convincing study in frenzy, sweat, and mucus. Even in his chattering tirade, writhing and spluttering took firm precedence over the words themselves: it was not a G &amp; S patter-song approach; and altogether the production expressed a fear of the verbal. But Beckett plays, owing their coherence ultimately to poetry, can only properly work through verbal precision and a careful rhythm of pauses. 'Rather difficult and elliptic,' Beckett wrote to Alan Schneider of Endgame, 'mostly depending on the power of the text to claw.' Drama and even pure gesture come alive once that has been well understood, as it so gratifyingly has been at Battersea. Scarcely a comma is out of place in Alasdair Middleton's wise and stirring production, with Brian Matthew and his wife Pamela Wickington a sharply observed Nagg and Nell; Peter Bourke a stooped, shuffling Clov, clad in woollen vest and ineffectual braces, intoned with a London taxi-driver's weary reasonableness that makes the tragicomedy all the more surprising and potent; and above all, John Quentin's magnificent, unforgettable, hardly to be bettered Hamm. He is Shelley's 'old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king', enthroned on his armchair in dressing gown, toque, thick red socks and goggles with blooded handkerchief over his face ('Old stancher] You remain]'): thus in situ at the start and even after the final applause. His fleet changes of facial expression, perfect vocal pacing and hammy, slightly Gielgud-flavoured vowels produced an effect by turns hilarious, starkly poetic, and heartrending. His intermittent howls smacked of King Lear - to whose tragedy Endgame is a worthy pendant.</p>

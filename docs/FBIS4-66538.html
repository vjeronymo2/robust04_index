			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 4--The recent episode of the  Pakistan High Commissioner, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, not being allowed  to go to Calcutta because of insufficient notice to the  authorities has brought to light the treatment of Indian and  Pakistani diplomats in each other's capital and the need to  remove the current restrictions altogether both here and in  Islamabad.    The restrictive regime was first introduced by Pakistan when  it prescribed a seven-day notice by the Indian High Commissioner  in Islamabad for going out of the city. The then envoy there,  Mr. S.K. Singh, was the first to feel the pinch of the  restraint--when he wanted to go to Peshawar to see the ailing  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (regarded in India as one of the  architects of Independence). Two years later, New Delhi slapped  similar restrictions on a reciprocal basis. In practice, there  have been instances of the two Governments waiving the  requirement, but the restriction remained--and was intended to  apply to various categories of diplomats (and, perhaps, their  spouses also).    Recently, Mr. Khokhar sought permission to go to Calcutta  but  it was turned down on the ground that he had [not] given five  days' notice. The authorities in the Home Ministry, responsible  for processing such cases, could have taken a lenient view--as  they had done in the case of Mrs. Khokhar earlier. They,  however, stuck to the norms of reciprocity.    Such cases are bound to arise as long as the restrictive  regime is in place. Why should there be curbs on Indians in  Islamabad or Pakistanis in New Delhi, when the rest of the  diplomatic corps in the two capitals is free to move about in  the entire length and breadth of their host countries after a  simple intimation? These curbs are not the only irritants, there  being frequent complaints of shadowing by the minions of  security agencies.    It was to rectify this situation that, in August 1992, the  foreign secretaries of the two countries, Mr. J.N. Dixit and Mr.  Shahryar Khan, agreed on a code of conduct, laying down do's and  don'ts for the treatment of one country's diplomats in the  other's capital.    The immediate provocation was provided by an unpleasant  episode in Islamabad where a senior Indian diplomat was beaten  up by the intelligence personnel. The code committed the two  sides to avoiding "intrusive surveillance" and other forms of  harassment of diplomats. It enjoined upon the concerned agencies  to spare the families of the diplomatic and consular personnel.  It sought to ensure the safety of the staff and their families  and respect for the rights of the diplomats to receive guests.  The two sides reaffirmed their faith in the Vienna Conventions  of 1961 and 1963, committing themselves to respecting the  dignity of the diplomatic personnel and inviolability of  official vehicles.    The code was expected to create a new climate and make  unsavoury cases things of the past. It was not destined to be  that way. Not long after, Pakistan drastically pruned the staff  of the Indian consulate in Karachi, as the press campaign  referred to it as a nest of espionage. New Delhi paid Islamabad  back in kind.    Indo-Pakistan ties are far from normal but their missions  could be used as vehicles for bringing about improvements. If  the diplomatic channels get clogged, efforts at other levels to  establish reasonably smooth working relationship would be doomed  to failure.</p>

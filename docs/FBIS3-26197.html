			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong's latest airport financing package "has  directly addressed" concerns raised by China between June and  August last year, according to sources close to the Chinese  State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.    "The fourth package has comprehensively responded to our  proposal," the source said.    Beijing still needed time to fully assess the implications  of  the new offer and it was unlikely the Sino-British Joint Liaison  Group Airport Committee would resume talks in the next week or  two.    Confirming that China had already received the new offer,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said the Chinese side was  "studying it earnestly".    He reiterated that the issue of a new airport for Hong Kong  should be settled in accordance with the Memorandum of  Understanding and the British side should also demonstrate  sincerity.    The Executive Council on Tuesday endorsed the new financing  package that would see more than $60 billion [Hong Kong dollars]  pumped into the Provisional Airport Authority and Mass Transit  Railway Corporation to fund the airport and railway projects.    The new funding level would reduce the debts borne by the  two  corporations to about $20 billion.    The offer is a major concession from Britain, in that it has  substantially increased the equity injection by $15 billion from  the $45 billion ceiling proposed in the third financing plan  last June.    According to the source, China has made a package of  counter-proposals on the level of debts, government equity, the  sale of land and the cost control mechanism between June and  August.    These proposals call for lower debt, higher government  funding and independent cost monitoring.    The source said that it was very unlikely that China would  reach any conclusion on the fourth package in the next week or  two.    "The whole financial arrangement is and has to be a package.  We need time."    Sources said China had already made clear to the British  side  in June that it would agree to granting the lease of the 62  hectares of land before 1997.    He also denied suggestions that China was firmly opposed to  separating the sale of 62 hectares of land from the 50-hectare  ceiling for land sale, stipulated under the Joint Declaration.    "As a matter of fact, the total amount of land granted each  year, since 1984, had exceeded the 50-hectare ceiling," the  source said.    The source, however, remained cautious over whether China  would agree to the latest British proposal.    "We can't say the problems have all been settled . . . but  what I can only say is that the present proposal is a direct  reply to our suggestions."    China demanded the formation of an independent committee to  monitor the costing of the project.    But Britain disagreed and suggested that the function of the  airport consultative committee be strengthened to keep a closer  watch on the building cost.    The source refused to say whether Britain had acceded to the  Chinese demand for an independent cost monitoring body as part  of the latest offer.    He added: "At least, they should spell out specifically ways  to strengthen the role of the consultative committee."    Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang said yesterday that  she believed the new financing proposal addressed concerns  raised by the Chinese side.    "We believe that this proposal fully meets the concerns that  the Chinese have expressed to us so far," Mrs Chan said.    However, she refused to disclose details.    "I do not think that it would assist us in getting early  agreement from the Chinese on financing arrangements if I chose  to discuss the details now," she said.    "We would very much wish the Chinese respond with an early  meeting of the Airport Committee at which we can sensibly  discuss these proposals."    But she added that the 62 hectares of land along the airport  railway should be counted on top of the annual 50-hectare quota.    "We very much hope China can confirm the land along the rail  link will be separately counted on the top of the annual quota,"  she said.</p>

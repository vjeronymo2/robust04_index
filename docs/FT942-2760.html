			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Clinical trials encourage British Bio British Biotechnology has had further promising results from clinical trials of its cancer drug Batimastat. The last published results, in March, provided the basis for a Pounds 90m cash raising exercise by the company. The number of patients taking Batimastat has increased from 15 to 24. Some are showing a fall in the amount of a substance in their blood called CA 125, a widely used indicator for the progression of ovarian cancer. The fall indicates that the disease is retreating. Analysts at James Capel, the stockbroker, have estimated the potential market for Batimastat at up to Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn). If clinical trials go well, the drug should be launched in 1997. British Biotechnology also said that it had begun work on an oral cancer drug that works with a similar mechanism to Batimastat, which must be injected. It also said it was creating a subsidiary to research into treatments for multiple sclerosis.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / People: Ghali moves on at BankAmerica There was a time during the international banking boom of the 1970s when Bank of America seemed to use London as a testbed for its future leaders. Al Rice, the first banker to head the the bank's London-based Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) division went on to be a vice-chairman and his successor, Sam Armacost, became chief executive. However, the upheavals at Bank of America and the changes in international banking have had a knock-on effect on the importance of London in the bank's affairs. More recently, Bank of America's top man in Europe has tended to move on to other things outside the group when his term expired, rather than return to San Francisco. Paul Verburgt, a Dutchman who took over from Mont McMillen, left in 1986, and his successor, William Young, subsequently retired from the bank and went off to Cambridge to read modern history. Now Riad Ghali, a 48-year-old Egyptian, is leaving next month in order to 'have time for his personal and business pursuits in Europe'. Ghali, who has been doing the job for three years, is handing over to Rob Morrow, 44, who has been responsible for managing the EMEA group's wholesale banking relationships, commercial banking and financial institutions activities since August 1993. Like Ghali, Morrow is one of several top executives with the same Wells Fargo pedigree as Richard Rosenberg, chairman of BankAmerica, and chief financial officer Lewis Coleman, tipped as Rosenberg's heir apparent. Coleman spent ten years with Wells Fargo before joining Merrill Lynch in 1982 as executive director of its private resources operation in San Francisco. In 1990 he joined Bank of America as managing director of mergers and acquisitions in its capital markets division. He became executive vice president and manager of its US division corporate banking group a year later.</p>

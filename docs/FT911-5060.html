			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Slide in truck sales is worst since 1945 COMMERCIAL vehicle manufacturers and importers say they are experiencing the worst UK sales collapse since the Second World War. There is a growing consensus that in spite of falling interest rates there is little prospect of a significant upturn before 1992, particularly in the worst affected sector of heavy trucks. Statistics released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that March offered no relief, with overall commercial vehicle sales down 29.14 per cent, to 22,706 from 32,043, compared with the same month a year ago, and sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes down 35.4 per cent. More alarming yet for truck makers is that the nearly 38 per cent drop in truck sales over the first quarter of this year compared with the same period of 1990 follows a 25 per cent fall in the 1990 quarter compared with the same period of 1989. That means that sales are only half the level of two years ago. Mr Peter Foden, chairman of Cheshire-based truck maker ERF, commented: 'Heaven only knows how some manufacturers are surviving.' ERF itself barely survived the previous truck market downturn of the early 1980s, when sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes fell to 44,000 from a high of nearly 80,000. Although sales in the sector are running at an even lower annualised rate - 36,000 - ERF and the UK's other independent truck maker, AWD, have so far been able to avoid further retrenchment because of orders for several thousand trucks from the Zimbabwe government. The latest SMMT statistics provide a sombre background for the launch of the EuroCargo, the first important heavy truck to be announced by Fiat's Iveco commercial vehicles subsidiary and Iveco Ford, a UK-based joint venture company with Ford. Speaking at Eurocargo's launch in Brescia, Italy, this week Mr Gioancarlo Boschetti, Iveco's chief executive, warned that the UK downturn - 'the traditional indicator of a crisis' - is starting to affect all other leading European markets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JAN-MAR 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume    Volume      Share (%)   Share (%)                             (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Mar 91  Jan-Mar 90  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*               60,051    -32.78       100.00      100.00 Imports                     21,699    -37.45        36.13       38.83  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                       18,864    -38.42       100.00      100.00 Imports                      3,791    -50.45        20.10       24.98 Ford                         7,131    -26.04        37.80       31.48 GM (Bedford)                 5,801    -39.41        30.75       31.25 Rover Group                  2,400    -52.21        12.72       16.39 Peugeot (incl.

Balyura, chairman of its Trade  Union Committee, made an appeal to the editor's office of FLAG  RODINY. The text of a document containing an appeal by the  plant's blue and white collar workers to the Black Sea Fleet  Military Council was forwarded by him for publication. It states  in particular:    It is with pain in our hearts that we appeal to you, as the  element of collective leadership of the Black Sea Fleet, to help  one of the oldest labor collectives of the Black Sea Fleet to  survive and to preserve this unique plant carrying out  comprehensive repairs on warships and vessels.    An extremely serious, critical situation has evolved at the  plant; specialists are being forced to work in an atmosphere of  constant political and financial pressure.    One of the main causes of the present situation is the  absence of any progress in the 2-year negotiations on problems  of the Black Sea Fleet, including on the status of ship repair  plants. All of this has of course affected our productive and  economic life.    The plant's work has not been financed since 1993. The  amount  the fleet owes for work done now exceeds 5 billion karbovantsy.  Promises of the command to pay its debts, and equally so the  promises of the financial services of the Russian Navy regarding  replenishment of the plant's working capital are not being kept.  The enterprise's administration is unable to pay wages to the  labor collective. Blue and white collar workers are no longer  able to feed their families, while some are simply starving.    Being a cost-accounting enterprise, the plant is forced to  provide for its productive activity and for social protection of  the collective at the expense of wages, and in order to survive,  it is forced to accept vessels for repair from all  organizations, from commercial to private, which are doing  everything they can to get the plant to work for them. Moreover  they have everything--licenses, financing, materials, deliveries.    It should be kept in mind here that if this tendency  continues to increase, this naval plant will lose its identity  and its qualifications.    The impression is created that it is to someone's advantage  to destroy the plant, to destroy the structure of the fleet, and  consequently its fighting capability. Everyone knows, after all,  that respecializing the plant would mean losing a unique ship  repair base, and losing qualified personnel that it has taken  years to accumulate in ship repair.    The critical financial situation also requires immediate  adoption of a decision by the Military Council to pay the debt  to the plant in full and to determine a procedure for financing  ship repair. We see one solution here--providing financing  through central financial bodies of the Russian Ministry of  Defense.    In behalf of our Black Sea Fleet we appeal to the Military  Council to take all steps to save this oldest ship building  enterprise, to immediately restore financing to programs in  place, and to solve the problems of material and technical  support.    The plant collective awaits decisive actions that meet the  requirements of the current situation.</p>

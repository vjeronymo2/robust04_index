			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR $178 MILLION TO NEA CALLED 'OVERWHELMING';  </P> <P> ARTS: THE CHAIRMAN OF A HOUSE PANEL EXPECTS THE PROGRAM TO SURVIVE A NEW ROUND  OF ATTACKS.  </P> <P> The chairman of the House subcommittee dealing with the $178-million funding of  the embattled National Endowment for the Arts said Wednesday he believes that  "overwhelming" support will ensure continuation of the program despite a new  volley of attacks from congressional colleagues.  </P> <P> Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), after hearing a dozen congressional witnesses  testify before his Education and Labor subcommittee on postsecondary education,  told reporters he feared that the NEA was in jeopardy last year because of  public furor over its sponsorship of assertedly pornographic and blasphemous  art works.  </P> <P> "But we are now finding, both inside and outside Congress, overwhelming support  for reauthorization," he said. "The only question is whether there should be  restrictions on the money."  </P> <P> Williams said he opposes any censorship powers for the endowment, but the  majority of witnesses called for a ban on tax dollars for projects that are  obscene or attack religion. Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) and Mel Hancock  (R-Mo.) demanded outright abolition of the NEA, and others asked for  restrictions to bar support of exhibits such as the Robert Mapplethorpe  photographs that sparked public outcry last year. But Reps. Rosemary Oakar  (D-Ohio), Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) and Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.), a  silversmith who claimed to be one of the few artists in the House, warned  against congressional attempts to impose censorship.  </P> <P> Oakar deplored "all this negative stuff which I think is somewhat sick" aimed  at about 20 of 302,000 grants. She praised President Bush for increasing the  requested amount this year and for his opposition to censorship language.  </P> <P> "We have stayed out of it, and we ought to keep staying out of it," she said of  proposals for congressional restrictions on the NEA.  </P> <P> Members of the subcomittee accused opponents of unfairly branding endowment  backers as supporters of pornography.  </P> <P> "I haven't done that, but I can't say that those who do are illogical,"  Rohrabacher replied in an exchange with Rep. Paul B. Henry (R-Mich.), the only  Republican member of the subcommittee supporting unrestricted NEA funds.  </P> <P> Williams said he hoped this would be the final hearing on reauthorization of  the NEA's budget and that he would have a bill ready to go to the House floor  by "late spring." Earlier, representatives of artists' groups announced the  formation of the National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, decrying controls  on the government arts program. At a breakfast news conference, they said they  would work to defeat Rohrabacher and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), leader of  Senate efforts to block funds for allegedly obscene or blasphemous works of  art. "Mr. Rohrabacher next year will be going back to his surfboard," predicted  Jeffrey Chester, Los Angeles representative of the National Alliance of Media  Art Centers.  </P> <P> Charlotte R. Murphy of Washington, executive director of the National Assn. of  Artists' Organizations, said Helms and other conservatives "have made this a  campaign issue and we'll be prepared to respond. We have support in every  congressional district."  </P></p>

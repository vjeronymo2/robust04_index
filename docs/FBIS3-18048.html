			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- According to calculations by the  German Economic Research Institute (DIW), economic developments  in western Germany have slowed down significantly during the  last six months of the 1993/94 winter. Seasonally adjusted,  production figures for November and December are the lowest  figures "of production in the manufacturing industry recorded  for two consecutive months during this recession," the recent  weekly report of the Berlin Institute states.    According to DIW calculations, the real GDP in the last  three-months period was 1.5 percent below last years' lowest  value: "If the stagnation were to prevail at this level  throughout 1994, the annual result for 1994 would be exactly 0.5  percent below that of 1993." Yet stagnation is not likely, but  rather a setback in the first quarter, the report says.    As far as orders are concerned, the situation generally  improved at the end of the year. However, expanded orders,  which are the result of strong foreign demand, do not compensate  for weak domestic demand. Domestic orders, which had comprised  more than two-thirds of the total volume and are of considerably  greater importance, have decreased. As far as the drop in  private consumption is concerned there is no compensation either  from the side of investment, the report states.</p>

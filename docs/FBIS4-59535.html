			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram, Ibrahim Humaydi, and Ashraf </F> al-Faqiyy: "Sanaa Announces Capture of al-Dali'; Aden Announces  Recapture of Zanjibar"]    [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden, Damascus, Cairo -- Yemen witnessed  fierce fighting between its two armies yesterday. Sanaa  announced yesterday that its forces have moved into the  strategic city of al-Dali', while Aden stressed that its forces  have recaptured Zanjibar, capital of Abyan Governorate, from the  northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade.    Aden denied that northern forces have seized al-Dali', a  stronghold for a large number of southern army commanders.  However, neutral sources have told AL-HAYAH that it seems that  northerners have made advances in al-Dali', and that fierce  fighting is taking place in the directorate. With regard to  Zanjibar, the sources say they can confirm Aden's information in  this connection.    Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad has issued a strongly  worded statement in Damascus, stressing his "willingness to  return to Yemen to mediate between the Yemeni leadership parties  in order to safeguard unity." He denied the existence of any  link between him and "the political bases agreed between the two  partners (the Socialist Party and the General People's  Congress)." [passage omitted]    Responding to accusations leveled at him, he said: "I am not  a party to the disputes tearing Yemen apart. My full support is  for Yemen, its unity, and national unity." He added: "I am  proud of my supporters wherever they are. They will serve  nothing except the issue of unity, for the sake of which they  have made sacrifices. And they will struggle to safeguard it."    He said that what is happening in Yemen does not help the  two  sides to engage in calm negotiations. "However, it is not the  end of the road yet for the negotiations, an understanding, and  national reconciliation, despite the ferocity of the fighting  there." He pointed out that he has done "a great deal and I am  still willing to play a constructive role between the two  parties to the conflict in order to secure a solution that  safeguards the Yemenis' unity, spares them the calamities of war  and destruction, and spares Yemeni blood."

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mixed trend in Recs South Wales Electricity was the biggest casualty in a mixed electricity sector after the group said it had ended its share buy back programme ahead of its 'closed period' which starts on October 7. Companies and their directors are not allowed to trade in their own shares for two months prior to reporting figures; Swalec is scheduled to announce interims on October 7. Yesterday Swalec bought in 1.4m shares at 786p bringing its total purchases up to its intended level, 7 per cent, ahead of the closed period. Swalec has shareholder authority to buy up to 10 per cent of its own stock. At the close of trading Swalec shares were 26 lower at 763p, their lowest level since mid-August. Swalec embarked on its buy-back programme on September 6. Southern Electricity, on the other hand, was the best performer in the sector, the shares climbing 11 to 724p after a buy recommendation from NatWest Securities. NatWest's utilities team described Southern as 'way ahead of the pack' on its cost cutting ability. NatWest said that it believed Southern to be committed to share-buy backs and to full demerger of the National Grid, with Grid demerger enhancing the prospective dividend by 2.5 per cent and buy-backs by almost 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Trade News: US blocks attempts for better access, says Lufthansa chief MR Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chief executive, yesterday accused the US government of blocking attempts to allow it and other European carriers more access to US destinations. Lufthansa has long sought better operating conditions for European airlines in the US. It is limited to 10 cities in the US, while US airlines have wide access to airports in Germany and the rest of Europe. 'The Americans are blocking us totally. They are not willing to budge towards compromise,' Mr Weber said. 'Equal competition between the US and European countries is simply not a subject for them.' Germany and the US have been holding talks on the bilateral aviation accord which, Lufthansa claims, favours US carriers and does not let Lufthansa compete equally. The north Atlantic accounts for some 30 per cent of Lufthansa's traffic but, like other airlines, it loses money on the route. Mr Weber, who repeated his determination to restore profits - last year's losses totalled DM400m (Pounds 137m) - called the present state of the US-German air talks 'more than disappointing'. Noting the next meeting would be in June, he said: 'I am pessimistic.' He claimed 'new so-called liberalisation concepts' were being produced in the US which would help US airlines and put more disadvantages Lufthansa's way. Progress in the US would only be possible with strong political pressure, he added. A US transportation department official said yesterday the two governments had agreed to renegotiate 'because the US is interested in a liberalised agreement and more opportunity for US carriers in Germany'.</p>

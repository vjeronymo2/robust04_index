			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (3): Pressures rise for a rethink as returns fail to satisfy - Investors' viewpoint INVESTORS in venture capital have put increasing pressure on fund managers over the past few years to deliver better value for money. The pension funds, insurance companies and 'gatekeepers' have sought performance 'hurdles' before the managers take their profit and a lowering of management fees. In many instances the venture capitalists have responded to these requests while the industry has also begun working on a system of valuation and performance measures. But, if the venture capitalists thought that this would be enough to satisfy their critics they may be sadly disappointed. There is every sign that investors are still not happy with the returns on their money. They are pushing for an even more fundamental rethink of the way the industry is structured. It will take more than the ending of the UK recession to persuade the institutions to devote more funds to venture capital. 'What has changed is the way we look at venture capital funds,' says Mrs Carol Ames, director of Eagle Star Investment Managers. 'The high fees of the US venture capital industry were transferred to the UK without taking account of the fact that the US has a larger economy, a bigger venture capital market and more of a focus on start-ups.' The generous management fees - typically 2 to 2 1/2 per cent of funds invested - meant there was less of an incentive for UK venture managers to maximise the value of their investments and earn their 20 per cent share of profits or 'carry' by selling or floating their portfolio companies, comments Mrs Ames. At the same time, as funds grew larger, the management fees came to represent substantial sums of money. Investors have put on pressure for management fees to taper off as the funds get larger. Above Pounds 200m managers might only earn 1-1 1/4 to 1-1 1/2 per cent in fees. 'There is less ignorance now about economies of scale,' says Mr Jonny Maxwell, in charge of unquoted investments at Standard Life Assurance. Institutions were sometimes so naive in the early days of venture capital that they are now reluctant to re-examine the terms of those early deals because of the embarrassment it would cause. 'Deals were done on a hand shake,' recalls Mr Maxwell. 'It amounted to saying: 'We will send you vast amounts of money for a big fee and you will do your best to get a venture capital return.'' Investors have now become more sophisticated in structuring deals, as is evidenced by the innovative arrangements being proposed by certain funds. Baronsmead will allow investors to withdraw their funds at short notice and have a say in the companies in which it invests, while Legal &amp; General Ventures has announced plans for a series of rolling funds which return uninvested amounts to the institutions at the end of the year. MANY investors are unhappy with the traditional 10-year partnerships which have become the norm in the UK. They tie up the investors' money for a long period and give the institution little opportunity to influence investment policy or withdraw if things go wrong. The investor has no guarantee that the managers he backs in year one will still be there 10 or even five years later. 'Institutions want to be able to change their asset allocation more easily so they can time their own cash flows,' says Mrs Ames. 'They want a structure which allows them to commit their funds for less than 10 years and would like a choice of investments too.' But opinion is divided over the question of 10-year funds. There are some signs of a shift away from the partnership structure towards venture capital companies which would have an unlimited life. This might have the virtue of freeing the venture capitalists from the unnatural constraints of a 10-year deadline but, in the view of some investors, would remove any pressure on the fund managers to realise their investments. 'The 10-year deadline does impose a discipline otherwise managers would just sit on their investments drawing their fees,' comments Mr Rhoddy Swire, managing director of Pantheon Holdings, which invests in venture funds for its institutional clients. The institutions are not only determined that future investments should be made on a more equitable basis. They are keen for existing investments to be more accurately valued. To this end the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) introduced a set of valuation guidelines at the beginning of 1991. Welcome though the guidelines were they have not dispelled the unease of investors and have recently been revised to make them more effective. 'A rule is only as good as its implementation,' says Mr Swire, who is concerned that venture capitalists might be distracted from their main business by the need to devote time to the issue of valuations. 'I would rather people stuck precisely to what they say is the basis of their valuations,' he says. He does not accept at face a value claims that a fund conforms to the BVCA guidelines. Mrs Ames shares this scepticism. 'People sometimes claim they meet the guidelines when they don't and they always have good reasons for not meeting the rules,' she says. 'The guidelines need to be more precise and there needs to be some enforcement. I think the venture industry is becoming aware of this and it will slowly get better.' At the moment though, when fund-raising is so difficult and venture capitalists are under extreme pressure to make their investment returns look good, absolute honesty can penalise a fund when others are less scrupulous. A frequent complaint which the venture capital industry makes against the institutions is that they seek to impose short-term performance measures on an industry which is long-term in its investments. 'Your returns drop after you have made heavy investments,' says Mr Robin Hall, managing director of CINVen, which manages funds for the pension funds of British Coal, British Rail and Barclays Bank. 'It is either feast or famine.' Enlightened investors are ready to acknowledge the constraints under which venture fund managers have to work. But it looks as though it will be some time before the industry has regained investors' confidence sufficiently to justify them committing substantial new funds to the sector.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Previti's Assurances on Defense </F> Policy"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 13 -- Italy's new defense minister,  Cesare Previti, the day after the government was sworn in, sent  messages containing assurances to the secretaries of NATO and  the WEU [Western European Union], as well as to the U.S.  secretary of defense, to the effect that Italian policies of  defense and security would keep to the firm traditional  guidelines followed by previous Rome governments, the ministry  information office reported this evening.    In his message, Previti said that Italy was firmly anchored  to the Atlantic Alliance and deeply committed both to close  relations with the United States and to the building of a  credible European security identity.    The defense minister also emphasized the serious tensions  that exist within an international framework and to which Italy,  because of its geographical position, is particularly exposed.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: FT election share index ------------------------------------------------------------ Labour win/Conservative defeat stocks ..... 98.71 (-0.03) Conservative win/Labour defeat stocks ..... 97.25 (-0.14) FTSE ...................................... 97.95 (-0.21)  ------------------------------------------------------------ THE 10 shares in the 'Labour gainers' portion of the index continued to outperform the 10 'Conservative gainers' yesterday. The effect was muted, however, and both sections did slightly better than the main indicator of big companies' performance, the FT-SE 100 index. Shares chosen are based on analysts' predictions of sectors that will gain or suffer from a change of government. The base of 100 reflects closing prices on the day the election was announced, March 11.</p>

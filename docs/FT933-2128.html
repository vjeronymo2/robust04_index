			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Canadian plan for satellites A GROUP of Canadian investors plans to revitalise the far-northern grain port of Churchill, Manitoba, by building the world's first privately owned satellite launch centre there. Akjuit Aerospace said it already had funds to complete preliminary engineering studies for the CDollars 250m (Pounds 126m) project, which involves refurbishing and expanding a disused rocket range. Churchill is on the western shore of Hudson Bay and best known for polar bears and Beluga whales. The 'spaceport' is predicated on a surge in demand for small telecommunications satellites in polar orbits a few hundred miles above the earth. Ms Siobhan Mullen, Akjuit president, declined to name potential customers.</p>

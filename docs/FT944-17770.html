			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Finelist advances to Pounds 2.45m Finelist, the car parts distributor, beat its flotation forecast with a leap in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.01m to Pounds 2.45m in the year to June 30. The shares firmed 1p to 146p yesterday, against a 130p flotation price in February. Mr Chris Swan, chairman and chief executive, said the pre-tax figure was Pounds 150,000 ahead of forecast. Turnover was up 50 per cent to Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 16.1m) and operating margins rose from 7.5 to 10.6 per cent. Mr Swan ascribed this advance to volume growth, price increases, reductions in branch costs and overheads, and some benefit from acquisitions. The group added nine more sites, with four opening since the float. Since the period-end, Finelist, which trades principally under the Autela name, has bought Edmunds Walker and its Walter Moss/Berite subsidiary for up to Pounds 20m, funded in part by a 1-for-2 rights issue at 120p to raise Pounds 12m. EW, which has been loss-making, brings with it 89 sites and sales of Pounds 64m. WMB, which is to be integrated into the Autela chain, brings 10 sites and sales of Pounds 4m. Mr Swan said that, like Finelist which left the own-label parts market two years ago, EW sold only branded parts. It is strong in commercial vehicle and engine parts. The combined group now has 177 outlets, of which 23 are franchises. Mr Swan said he wanted the group to have about 250 outlets within the next three years. In the present year trading in the original group was in line with budget, the company said, while the first six weeks from EW was well ahead. Interest payable fell to Pounds 98,000 (Pounds 191,000). At the end of August, the group had net assets of Pounds 15.5m, a Pounds 10m term loan (to help pay for EW), and cash of Pounds 5.5m. This gives gearing of about 32 per cent. Earnings jumped to 8.2p (3p) per share and the proposed single final dividend is 1.5p, as forecast.</p>

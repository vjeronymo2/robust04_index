			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Bohumil Gerinca, director of the </F> Defense and Security Department of the Slovak Government Office,  by Peter Sporer; place and date not given: Armex Is Not an  Alternative to Omnipol in Slovakia"]    [Text] [Sporer] In Slovakia, the selling of arms is often  talked and written about only in hints. How is this fact  perceived by a man who should have, by virtue of his top  position in the government commission for granting licenses for  the export and import of arms, a sufficient overview of this  matter?    [Gerinca] Every dealer tries to find a buyer, and, when he  finds one, he tries to keep his name a secret because there are  many possible ways in which to disrupt a potential deal. The  producer or the seller, not to mention the buyer, therefore  prefers not to talk about it. I believe that so far it has been  a good thing for Slovakia, too, that less was said and more was  done in this respect.    [Sporer] Done? But if we take into account the small amount  of spare parts manufactured in our arms factories (about 5  percent of the original volume of production before conversion)  that the factory managers are declaring, then not even the  "doing" could not have involved sales on a large scale.    [Gerinca] I agree. And, besides those, only surplus  equipment  from the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak Republic [SR] was  being sold, and that is basically coming slowly to an end--in  view of the time limits set by international agreements.    [Sporer] The heavy weapons manufactured in Slovakia were  sold  by the state through Omnipol. Omnipol was represented and still  is represented mainly by people who today live in the Czech  Republic--dealers with contacts in specific countries and with  specific customers. It is logical, therefore, that if, for  example, an Arab or some other client used to arrange deals over  dinner with a man from Omnipol, he will not turn today to the  prime minister or the manager of an arms factory if he wants to  place an order but again to the person with whom he used to  deal. Is the loss of Omnipol a big loss?    [Gerinca] Not just a loss but also it literally constitutes  harm to Slovakia's interests. These people, after all, are still  working for those who pay them, and their priority is to close  deals that benefit their organization, that benefit Omnipol.  They sell arms manufactured in the Czech Republic, but they also  try, naturally, to sell those from other countries--business is  business--to make the maximum profit for Omnipol, even at the  cost to our producers. We try to prevent it by creating our own  system. In Slovakia, only a Slovak firm or basically a legal  entity can trade in weapons commodities.    [Sporer] But can Omnipol participate in the sales in the  role  of a middleman?    [Gerinca] It must have a middleman from our companies who  will buy on its behalf. And then Omnipol would proceed with the  sale.    [Sporer] The ideal thing would probably be to get people  from  Omnipol to work for a similar firm in Slovakia, wouldn't it?    [Gerinca] Omnipol is an established organization. People who  work there have a certain security. Slovakia does not have a  similar organization established on world markets. In certain  ways, our merchants who made a name of sorts for themselves in  business tried to get those people for themselves. But offering  something that might be successful in the future was not enough  compared to a certain thing.    [Sporer] From this standpoint, how do you rate the activity  of the former minister of general engineering and, before that,  director of the VHJ ZTS [Economic Production Unit Heavy  Machinery Enterprises], Mr. Luhovy?    [Gerinca] As far as I know, Mr. Luhovy is doing business in  retirment. He wants to help Slovakia, and he lives in Slovkia.    [Sporer] Was he rejected?    [Gerinca] No. Of course, the question remains how such help  can be utilized. I do not know what Mr. Luhovy is doing today. I  am not in contact with him.    [Sporer] As an alternative to Omnipol, the company Armex was  created in Slovakia almost seven months ago, with the honorary  deputy chairman of the SNS [Slovak National Party], Vitazoslav  Moric, named by the government to be its manager. But so far it  has not been issued a license by your commission....    [Gerinca] It is difficult to comment on it because Armex so  far has not applied for any license. Obviously it has a reason.    [Sporer] A reason?    [Gerinca] In the case of Armex, the state retained  100-percent participation in its business dealings. The idea was  to create an organization composed of representatives of five  ministries, whose task would be to assume responsibility for  trade matters and, as far as possible, a certain coordination of  these activities. The start of its activities was tied to the  start of production in the arms factories. However, not even the  basic prerequisites were present--I have in mind, among other  things, the question of experience and initiative in the work of  the people involved--and, as a result, the organization is not  functioning. It was probably unrealistic to expect anything else  from state officials who were delegated to take on this duty.    [Sporer] Is it within the authority of the government to  make  personnel changes in Armex?    [Gerinca] Of course. The government created Armex, it named  its general manager, and it can even dissolve it.    [Sporer] How many companies in Slovakia are trading in arms?    [Gerinca] It is difficult to give a specific answer because  there is the matter of getting permission to sell. This is  granted by the SR Ministry of Interior. When someone is granted  this permission to sell and buy arms commodities, it can ask the  government licensing commission to issue a license for these  activities. But there are also private dealers who sell weapons  only on SR territory, merely on the basis of a permit to carry  on a trade--they do not have to have a license. But I emphasize  that those who want to export or import arms from abroad must  apply to our commission for a license. This possibility is  mostly used by firms that trade in short hunting rifles. But a  license can also be applied for by a company that generally  trades in other products but wants to do this as an additional  activity.    [Sporer] In the Martin and Dubnice arms factories, they are  saying that, after the conversion, the territories the Slovaks  left were taken over by the Poles, and the Russians have become  very active. In addition, the Czechs, too, by way of the RDP  Group, are actively trying to market their improved T-72 tank.  What chance does our heavy-machinery industry have of making a  comeback?    [Gerinca] It is true that the Poles, who did not go in for  conversion, filled the void. However, the Russians, who never  stopped developing tanks, already have the production of T-80  and T-90 tanks on the line. Moreoever, they own an excessive  amount of equipment. We have to admit that we actually never  developed new types of tanks, only tanks that were already  established and that could be, so to speak, "shown"--Herefore,  also the T-72 tanks. If we want to succeed, somebody will have  to invest in development.    [Sporer] "Somebody" who?    [Gerinca] The buyer who is interested in starting  production.  Abroad it is a matter of course that this role is assumed by the  army of the country that manufactures the arms. It rearms itself  and gradually also gets the opportunity to trade with other  countries. But the budget of our Army, no matter how high it may  appear in comparison with other departments, simply does not  provide the possibility of adding new equipment. Therefore, it  cannot help in starting up arms production, either. It is, of  course, another thing when a factory improves and produces, say,  a tank turret (Dubnica), for which it finds buyers among armies  equipped with T-72 tanks. It is up to the managers of arms  factories to calculate whether a similar trade would be  profitable for them.    [Sporer] There is talk about losses in the tens of billions  that the state suffered as a result of the conversion. Briefly,  how can arms factories cover this loss, in your opinion?    [Gerinca] Their managers know best about that, but it would  probably not be appropriate for me to merely reply that the  yearly turnover in high octane gasoline was about 20 billion  Czechoslovak korunas. A better example is provided by the people  from Martin. It is said that, when they manufactured and sold a  tank, they made as much as they would if they manufactured and  sold 40 tractors today.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Bonn to merge railways THE German government is to go ahead with reforms to transform its debt-laden, loss-making railways into competitive, commercial businesses, Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister, said yesterday. He was commissioned by the Bonn cabinet yesterday to produce a grand plan by midsummer for merging the west German Bundesbahn and the eastern Reichsbahn, and running them together as an Aktiengesellschaft (public limited company), to be called Deutsche Eisenbahn AG. The government, meanwhile, gave itself until the middle of next year to push through constitutional changes necessary to give up direct state administration of the networks. By freeing the rail system from direct state control, Mr Krause claimed, the expected burden on taxpayers of DM417bn (Pounds 145.2bn) by the end of the decade could be reduced to DM257bn. At present the Reichsbahn is losing about DM10bn a year and the Bundesbahn, with twice as much track, about DM7bn on turnover of DM20bn. Each has its own management, although Mr Heinz Durr, a supporter of a more business-like approach, is in overall charge. Mr Krause yesterday gave some hints that he might consider some of Mr Durr's more adventurous proposals, such as selling off land and privatising bus lines currently owned by the Bundesbahn. He suggested, for example, possible 'other uses' for railway property. The Bundesbahn, DM45bn in debt, owns or holds stakes in a wide range of businesses, including travel agencies, house-building concerns and financial services.</p>

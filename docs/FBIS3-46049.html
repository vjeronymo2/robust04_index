Provincial party  Secretary and Governor Jia Qinglin requested that leaders of  party committees and governments, as well as the relevant  departments, visit enterprises and their employees' family  members having difficulties, to deliver the warmth of the party  and government. They should show concern for enterprises which  have difficulties and their staff members' lives and regard this  as their political task.    The Jinjiang shipping company, the Fuzhou canned food  factory, the Fuzhou livestock farm, and the Fuzhou fireproof  materials factory, which are all having difficulties, reported  to the provincial leaders on their situations. After listening  to their reports, Jia Qinglin made an important speech.    He said: This year is an important year for our province to  [words indistinct]. There are factors causing difficulties  currently arising in businesses. Leaders, the departments in  charge of enterprises, and the enterprises themselves should  actively seek ways to resolve their difficulties. In light of  their special features and strong points, they should engage in  diversified operations and explore tertiary industries.    He added: Using land superiority and foreign capital for  transformation is a good method to free enterprises from their  difficulties. Leaders of governments and departments at all  levels should also seek ways and opportunities to resolve these  enterprises' problems and should improve the social insurance  system so as to create good external conditions for these  enterprises to eliminate their difficulties. Particular  attention should now be paid to making good arrangements for  staff members' lives so that they can spend the Spring Festival  happily.</p>

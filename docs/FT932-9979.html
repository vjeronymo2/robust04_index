			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Eurocommercial paper market shows decline THE Eurocommercial paper market, once one of the fastest growing sectors of the international capital markets, went into reverse early last year, according to figures published yesterday. The decline has been caused in part by a switch by corporate treasurers to longer-term borrowing, taking advantage of low long-term interest rates, and in part by a fall-off in the credit quality of issuers of short-term paper. Overcapacity in the Eurocommercial paper (ECP) market has already led to the departure of several banks in the past four years, among them Merrill Lynch, Warburg and Salomon. Continuing shrinkage is expected to lead to further withdrawals from a market which still has around 10 active dealers. Figures from the Bank for International Settlements, published today, show that a net Dollars 7.4bn of ECP was repaid in the last nine months of 1992, cutting the amount of outstanding paper in the market by almost 10 per cent. These repayments reversed a Dollars 7.7bn increase in the size of the market in the first quarter of that year. The fall-off was prompted in part by a switch by borrowers further down the yield curve, and in part by a downgrading in the credit ratings of a number of issuers of short-term paper. The downgradings of Italy and of Scandinavian banks last year had a particular effect on the market, said Mr John Ford, head of ECP at Citibank. A ruling in France in March this year that Sicavs (money market funds) should hold no more than 10 per cent of their assets in Europaper and other unregulated investments has also stunted the demand for ECP from a group that had been among the most active investors in Europe, Mr Ford added. Competition from a number of domestic commercial paper markets also drew borrowers away from the international market, but last year's move by the German authorities to open up the D-Mark commercial paper market to foreign issuers helped stem the decline of short-term paper, according to the BIS.

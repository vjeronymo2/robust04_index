			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> PLAY BALL: Chicago native Richard Marx will get a thrill July 10, when he  returns to the Windy City to perform a special song at a special place. The pop  star will croon the National Anthem at Wrigley Field, home of baseball's 1990  All-Star Game. . . . And Peter Hook of New Order has a new band, Revenge, with  a new album, "One True Passion" and a spicy new single, "Pineapple Face," a  mocking tribute to deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega.  </P> <P> But you won't see the band's "Pineapple" video on MTV. The cable channel, which  happily runs heavy metal clips featuring half-nude women writhing in bondage  and submission poses, rejected "Pineapple" because it featured male band  members with chastity belts around their necks. (Isn't that what Billy Idol  wears in every video?)  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The United States has asked the ROK to open its  cattle market in addition to its beef market by applying an  import quota system and to allow local meat-processing firms to  sell imported beef by processing it as packaged beef.    In the two-day livestock negotiations with the ROK in  Washington on 19 January, the United States demanded that the  ROK ensure that apart from beef, a minimum volume of cattle, be  imported each year since the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade [GATT] schedule of concessions provide for zero percent  tariff for cattle and since the cattle market is to open from 1  July 1997. The United States also requested that the ROK ease  its government restrictions prohibiting the local  meet-processing firms from processing and selling beef imported  through the simultaneous buying and selling system (SBS) as  packaged beef.    The ROK side, however, is reported to have told the U.S.  side  that it is difficult for the ROK to set quotas on live cattle  and that for the time being, the ROK has to maintain  restrictions on the sale of packaged meat by meat-processing  firms that are members of consumer organizations. Participating  as senior delegates in the Washington negotiation were Yi  Yong-nae, agricultural attache of the ROK Embassy in the United  States from the ROK side and Jim Grueff, chief of the Uruguay  Round [Multilateral Trade Policy Affairs] section of the  Agricultural Department from the U.S. side.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Barristers lose battle on rights of audience THE BAR claimed victory last night in the first round of the battle over advocacy rights in the Crown Court, after Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, ruled out wider rights of audience for barristers employed by the Crown Prosecution Service in the immediate future. But Lord Mackay and the four senior judges designated under the 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act to decide on rights of audience made clear that they would keep the matter under review. Lord Mackay said he had asked the Bar Council to consider a time limit of December 1994 on its rule prohibiting employed barristers from appearing as advocates in the higher courts. He and the senior judges had decided they could not give permanent approval to the rule as it now stands. Lord Mackay said that once the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice had reported next year, discussions could take place between the interested parties on further amendments to the rule. Mr Peter Goldsmith QC, head of the Bar's legal services committee, said: 'The lord chancellor and the four designated judges have rejected the calls of the CPS for increased rights of audience now.' The Bar welcomed the importance they had attached to frequency of use of advocacy rights and the need for independence. Mr Goldsmith said: 'We object strongly to the idea of a monopoly state prosecutor. Advocates independent of the state who both defend and prosecute are necessary to uphold the integrity of the system.' The CPS and the Government Legal Service (GLS), however, placed a different interpretation on the lord chancellor's statement, calling it 'a significant step forward in the campaign for extended rights of audience for employed lawyers'. A statement issued on behalf of Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, and Sir James Nursaw, head of the GLS, said: 'We believe this will begin the process of removing the restrictions which prevent employed barristers appearing as advocates in the higher courts however well trained and experienced they are.' Their views were supported by the Law Society, which represents solicitors.</p>

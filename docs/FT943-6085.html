			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers hit shares in the blue chip sectors - Market Report The leading blue chip sectors abandoned an initial attempt to extend pre-Bank Holiday gains. Modest profit-taking, encouraged by easier bond prices and a slow start to the New York session, proved enough to take more than 15 points off the FT-SE 100-share Index. The broader market, however, remained firm, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index put on a further 6.8 at 3,813.8. London closed before the announcement that leading French banks were raising base rates. UK investors were said to be showing some caution ahead of tomorrow's meeting at the Bundesbank and US employment data due at the end of the week. Dealers believed that the odds are against any move in German interest rates this week but were disinclined to take risks. Trading books, which had been squared off on Friday in order to leave options open over a long weekend when US and continental European markets were operating, remained balanced. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,249.6 for a decline on the day of 15.5 points. The loss of the Footsie 3,250 mark was seen as unimportant in the context of last week's strong gains. Early trading took the Footsie index to 3,280 but weakness in stock index futures and government bonds took the heart out of equities before midsession. The final picture was uninspiring, with London lacking confidence as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 2 points as investors weighed the implications of a sharp setback in the July consumer confidence index compiled by the US Conference Board. Disappointment with the US figures focused attention on prospects for the more important US employment data due on Friday. Analysts expect a further rise in the jobs figure, indicating continued recovery in the US. Trading remained brisk, with Footsie-listed stocks representing the bulk (around 64 per cent) of the Seaq total of 550.3m shares changing hands. On Friday, retail, or genuine investment, business was worth Pounds 1.51bn, well up to the better levels of activity recorded as the market surged last week. Market fundamentals behind last week's advance were still in place, sterling showing a steadier trend and confidence in the outlook for dividends and earnings of British companies was still buoyant. However, some market analysts had reminded investors at the weekend that higher base rates in the UK were still likely before the end of the year. Pharmaceuticals stocks found encouragement in the Dollars 2.9bn purchase by SmithKline Beecham of Sterling Health from Eastman Kodak, which once again threw the spotlight on the reshaping of the global medical products industry. Lockheed Corporation's proposed Dollars 10bn merger with Martin Marietta also spurred expectations of increased stock market activity. Further takeover speculation surfaced in the food retailing sector, where J. Sainsbury responded to suggestions that an acquisition in France was under consideration. A scattering of similar special features helped give the market a more mixed picture at the close than the fall in the Footsie suggested. Building construction shares stood out against the general trend as two leading securities houses assessed prospects for recovery in the sector, which also brushed off fears that a rise in UK base rates might not be long delayed. But the profit-takers held sway in most of the consumer and financial areas which had performed so strongly in the previous week. UK market strategists believe that the list of US economic data and comment will keep markets subdued this week unless Wall Street resumes its powerful upward trend. UK investment funds are not expected to turn sellers in what has become a positive stock market.</p>

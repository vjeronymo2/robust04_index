			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AGENTS SCOUR WHITE HOUSE GUARD'S HOME;  </P> <P> FIGURE IN MALE PROSTITUTION RING LINKED TO LATE NIGHT TOURS  </P> <P> The Secret Service searched the home of one of its White House guards Thursday  night after he acknowledged he escorted a Washington businessman and his  associates on late-night tours of the executive mansion.  </P> <P> Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams today confirmed that the service, which  protects President Bush and other high-ranking officials, searched the home of  Reginald A. deGueldre, a uniformed White House guard. Adams declined to provide  details of the search.  </P> <P> "There's been no arrest, so we can't release any information involving our  investigation until that time," Adams said.  </P> <P> The Washington Times reported that deGueldre led businessman Craig J. Spence  and his friends on at least one late-night White House tour. The newspaper also  has linked Spence to a police investigation of a male prostitution ring  operating in the city.  </P> <P> The Washington Post, in today's editions, said five agents searched deGueldre's  Oakton home and took dozens of photographs.  </P> <P> In an interview with the newspaper, deGueldre said he had been asked by his  superiors and the U.S. Attorney's Office whether he had received gifts from or  did private security work for Spence.  </P> <P> He said he told officials that he received no gratuities from Spence and  performed no favors other than arranging and conducting late-night tours of the  White House during the Ronald Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> "Spence was just a friend of mine," he told the Post. "I took him and his  friends on the tours. He never gave me anything. I never worked for him."  </P> <P> The officer also confirmed that he was asked if he had any knowledge of the  prostitution ring.  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Power Corp cuts loss to IPounds 4.47m Lower exceptional costs enabled Power Corporation, the Irish property group, to cut its interim pre-tax loss from IPounds 75.2m to IPounds 4.47m (Pounds 4.24m). For the six months to September 30 there was a IPounds 1.4m exceptional charge for debt restructuring, against Pounds 72.7m costs relating to property revaluations and putting the Trocadero Group into administrative receivership. Total income, including rents from all properties, amounted to IPounds 7.13m, against IPounds 5.87m. Three months ago the company announced a IPounds 102.8m loss for the 1992-93 financial year, having taken a IPounds 97m exceptional charge on its Trocadero Centre and Island Site developments in London and property write-downs. Mr Robin Power, chairman, said that in the period under review operating expenses had been reduced substantially. No disposals were made in the six months' period from the group's IPounds 85m portfolio of properties held for resale. In the present half sales totalling IPounds 6.2m have been completed 'at satisfactory prices'. The sale of its main asset, the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, is now more likely to proceed as planned following the abandoning of plans by the Los Angeles Unified School District to purchase compulsorily the site. The refinancing of the San Francisco Centre has taken longer than planned, the company said, although Mr Power said 'substantial progress' has been made. Losses per share came out at 3.84p (64.68p).</p>

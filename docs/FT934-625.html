			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Profiting from new-found freedom  -Thai telecoms sector is poised for rapid growth Modesty does not come easily to those at the forefront of Thailand's fast-growing telecommunications sector. 'Normally, we grow at a rate of 60 per cent a year,' says Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, the former police colonel who heads the Shinawatra telecommunications, broadcasting and computer group now valued at more than Dollars 4bn, in answer to a question about the group's prospects.' That will continue in 1994 and 1995, but between 1995 and 1996 I think the growth will jump and probably reach 100 per cent.' After years of stifling control by the government and the armed forces, telecommunications networks in Thailand are starting to develop rapidly under the influence of young, private-sector companies that have won concessions to operate satellites and install millions of new telephone lines. Thaicom-1, Thailand's first satellite, was launched last week by Arianespace from French Guiana and will be operated by Shinawatra Satellite. The Shinawatra subsidiary - soon to become the fourth Shinawatra company listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) - will also operate a second satellite to be launched in August and possibly a third planned for 1996. At least six other communications companies are being floated on the Thai stock exchange to help finance the expansion of telephone and broadcasting systems. The first and biggest was TelecomAsia, the subsidiary of the multinational Charoen Pokphand group that is implementing a concession to install 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok; Nynex of the US holds 15 per cent of Telecom-Asia. Expansion of the telephone network is long overdue, and even the projects now being implemented to install an additional 3m lines nationwide are unlikely to meet pent-up demand. Samart Satcom, which makes satellite dishes, is expected to begin trading today. Next in line are United Communication Industry (Ucom), the mobile phone operator whose parent company is 25 per cent owned by Motorola of the US, and Loxley, whose affiliate Thai Telephone and Telecommunication has a concession to install and operate 1m telephone lines in the provinces. 'The telecoms sector used to account for 5 per cent of the Thai market,' says Mr David Gambrill, research manager with Peregrine Brokerage in Bangkok. 'By the middle of next year it will be 18 per cent.' Foreign fund managers are likely to have problems adjusting their portfolios to take account of the increasing weight of the telecommunications sector in the SET index. This is partly because only limited amounts of stock are available to foreigners; only 10 per cent of TelecomAsia, for example, is being sold to the public, and only half of that is allocated to foreign buyers. Price/earnings ratios for some of the newly-floated companies are also likely to be very high, especially in the early years of implementing concessions when costs are substantial and revenues low. Investors will watch closely to see how much value can be added to such companies by the use of new technology and by overseas expansion. TelecomAsia, for instance, plans to use the fibre-optic cables it is installing in Bangkok for cable television services as well as for telephone calls, while Mr Thaksin says he can squeeze more value out of his satellites by using digital compression technology to push as many as eight television channels on to one satellite transponder. Thai telecommunications companies rely heavily on foreign hardware suppliers, advisers and partners, and there are doubts about how well they can perform outside their home market, where they tend to benefit from their political connections. But that has not stopped them from seeking to expand beyond Thailand's borders. TelecomAsia, having already raised the money it needs for the 2m new lines in Bangkok, intends to use some of the proceeds of the public flotation for foreign expansion, including a satellite launch venture for China and the installation of new telephone lines in China and Vietnam. Shinawatra already has broadcasting and telecommunications contracts in Laos, Cambodia and the Philippines, and Mr Thaksin is also looking at China, Vietnam and Burma. Thailand alone should keep them busy enough. 'There are now half a dozen of these telecommunications companies coming to the market,' says Mr Paul Ngo, an investment analyst at H. G. Asia in Bangkok. 'It should be an exciting year in 1994.'</p>

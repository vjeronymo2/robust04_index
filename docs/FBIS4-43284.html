			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 15 (A.A.) -- The trial of 13  employees of the OZGUR GUNDEM newspaper, accused of being  members of the separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] organization began on Tuesday [14 June].    In the State Security Court here, those questioned included  editor in chief Gurbetelli Ersoz and director Ali Riza Halis,  who were under detention.    Ersoz said during his testimony that the trial was  politically motivated and did not have a reasonable base.  Reading his 16-page defense, he said that since the first day  it was published the newspaper was subjected to pressures.    All defendants denied the accusations made against them and  asked for their release.    The court decided to release the defendants.    The indictment against the defendants demands 22.5 years  each  for Ersoz, Halis, Cetin, Kisanak and Ozsokmenler and five years  for the others.</p>

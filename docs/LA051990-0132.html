			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHO WANTS 'IDEA' PLAYS  </P> <P> Mark Chalon Smith's play reviews continue to be as entertaining and insightful  as a train wreck. A case in point is Smith's review of "Love, Sex and the IRS,"  a play produced early this year by Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse (" 'Love , Sex  and the IRS' Makes For a Taxing Evening," Calendar, Jan. 24).  </P> <P> Smith savaged the play because it was devoid of "ideas" -- still more evidence  that Smith has no business whatsoever reviewing community theater. Any  community theater that served its audience a steady diet of Smith's cherished  "idea" plays would go belly-up in no time. As a longtime member of Anaheim's  community theater, the Ana Modjeska Players, I remember -- all too well -- the  last "idea" play we presented: "The Physicist" by Friedrich Duerrenmatt. I  believe the play averaged five customers per performance, counting walkouts.  </P> <P> Inasmuch as a major priority of community theater is to offer roles for novice  as well as experienced local thespians, there's not much chance of staging a  polished production of a serious, thought-provoking drama such as "Children of  a Lesser God," which requires precision acting to be effective. "Harmless"  comedies, as Smith calls them, provide a much better training ground for  fledgling actors while amusing audiences that don't expect Broadway-level  performances.  </P> <P> Mr. Smith, please don't try to single-handedly change the face of community  theater to suit your tastes. Community theater audiences want to be  entertained, not instructed. If they want provocative drama, they'll usually  pay a bit more and attend such theaters as South Coast Repertory, Alternative  Repertory Theatre, Way Off Broadway Playhouse and those of local colleges and  universities -- all of which do an excellent job of presenting "idea" plays.  </P> <P> By the way, it's a good thing for the masters such as Shakespeare and Moliere,  who occasionally wrote "harmless, non-idea" comedies, that Mark Chalon Smith  wasn't around to put them straight.  </P> <P> LEW RILEY, Yorba Linda  </P></p>

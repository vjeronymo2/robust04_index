			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FDP Bundestag Group Chairman Hermann Otto </F> Solms by Friedemann Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given:  "Fiscal Policy: FDP Seeking Row With Union"]    [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] The government coalition has not  managed to agree on a joint tax concept for the next few years.  It is not just the opposition that now suspects that taxes will  go up after the elections....    [Solms] If the FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany] forms  part of the government again, there will certainly be no tax  increases. The tax burden is too high already. That is why we  are going to make fiscal policy our central issue in the  election campaign. In contrast to the Christian Democratic  Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and the Social  Democratic Party [SDP], the FDP will make sure that the tax  burden on citizens is not increased, but lowered.    [Weckbach-Mara] But there are billions missing in the  budget, and the next tax increase, the solidarity surcharge, has  long been agreed....    [Solms] We will gradually abolish the solidarity surcharge,  in three years at the latest, and the federal budget will be  balanced through determined saving.    [Weckbach-Mara] Would you risk a row with the Union on the  issue of fiscal policy?    [Solms] We will make clear demands for a future coalition.  And we will not be deviated from that by the CDU/CSU's election  program. In the new laender, tax reliefs, such as the temporary  abolition of property and trade capital tax, must be maintained  after 1996. In addition, we demand that the value-added tax on  products from the new laender be lowered to facilitate their  launch on the markets. We will continue to promote savings with  building societies, and we will even double income ceilings,  especially for families with children. And we want to support  investible wage agreements in employment contracts.    [Weckbach-Mara] Are there any other potential problems with  the CDU/CSU?    [Solms] We insist on a consistent debureaucratization. This  means fewer authorities, fewer ministries, and  performance-linked salaries for civil servants instead of  automatic promotion. And we demand a reform of the educational  system. As a first step the duration of schooling up to the  final exams should be reduced to 12 years. University education  should be divided into two parts. First, there should be a  shorter, profession-oriented basic course of studies. And those  who want to go on after that would have to prove certain  achievements.    [Weckbach-Mara] This looks like comprehensive amendments to  laws, even constitutional amendments.    [Solms] Yes, we also want specific constitutional  amendments. One of the things we demand is for animal protection  to be included in the constitution. I even expect that we will  be able to get this aim adopted in the Bundestag and Bundesrat  before the Bundestag elections.</p>

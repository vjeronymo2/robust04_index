			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT RULING FAILS TO MELT DOUBLE RAINBOW'S RESOLVE  </P> <P> For five years now, pint-size Double Rainbow, a popular San Francisco ice cream  maker, has portrayed its legal bout with Haagen-Dazs as a classic David vs.  Goliath struggle.  </P> <P> Since 1985, Double Rainbow has been battling to get before a jury to plead its  case that Haagen-Dazs has hogged the lucrative market for ultra-rich ice creams  by preventing its smaller rival from getting into grocery store freezers.  </P> <P> Double Rainbow contends that Haagen-Dazs, a former Pillsbury unit now owned by  a British conglomerate, has violated antitrust laws by unfairly preventing  independent distributors from carrying competing brands. The practice, Double  Rainbow said, has thwarted its own efforts to launch a nationwide push.  </P> <P> But so far Double Rainbow has been getting licked in the courts. Last month, it  lost another key round when a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court  of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling that Haagen-Dazs could indeed demand  the loyalty of distributors.  </P> <P> Now the entrepreneurial "David" is using an unusual strategy -- aiming its  slingshot at the very justices whom it is trying to persuade to rehear the  case.  </P> <P> "An insult to the taste buds of America" is how Steven H. Fink, co-founder and  co-owner of Double Rainbow Gourmet Ice Creams, describes the justices'  determination that all ice creams are basically alike and that Haagen-Dazs,  with 2% of the $9.5-billion overall market, therefore does not have a monopoly.  Fink has argued that luxury ice creams, of which Haagen-Dazs is the clear  leader, form a market of their own apart from economy brands.  </P> <P> His lawyer went even further, impugning the justices' grasp of the law. In  documents filed last month, he said that they goofed in siding with Haagen-Dazs  because they were "confused by" and "ignored" legal precedents.  </P> <P> So how will this go over?  </P> <P> "They'll probably get mad at me," said John H. Boone, the attorney. If the  appeals court refuses to rehear the case, Boone said, he will take it to the  U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> For its part, Haagen-Dazs, based in Teaneck, N.J., maintains that Double  Rainbow simply has a weak case.  </P> <P> "They've cried wolf all along, but the facts just aren't there," said William  C. Miller, a Haagen-Dazs attorney in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The case, Fink said, demonstrates how tough life can be for the little guy in  America.  </P> <P> "Right now, it's not a battle of the best but of the most powerful," Fink said.  </P> <P> In his view, the controversy has forced him and his partner, Michael P. Sachar,  to scale back their dreams of a pot of gold.  </P> <P> The two men from Brooklyn -- who as childhood pals sold ice cream at Coney  Island and concocted their own in the Fink family kitchen -- opened their first  ice cream store on San Francisco's Castro Street in February, 1977, naming it  for the double rainbow that Fink had seen the day they signed the lease.  </P> <P> In the 200-square-foot store, they sold Haagen-Dazs ice cream.  </P> <P> As their second location was going up, they were visited one day by Doris  Mattus, daughter of Haagen-Dazs founder Reuben Mattus. According to Fink, she  demanded that they shut down the stores or become Haagen-Dazs franchisees.  </P> <P> When Fink and Sachar refused, Haagen-Dazs, at the time owned by Pillsbury,  threatened to stop shipping to them. (Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British food  and drink conglomerate, bought Haagen-Dazs along with the rest of Pillsbury in  late 1988.)  </P> <P> As Fink tells it, the Double Rainbow team sued to win a nine-month reprieve.  During that time, the two developed a luxury ice cream and sold it in their  stores.  </P> <P> Double Rainbow quickly became a favorite of Bay Area ice cream lovers and began  garnering a national reputation. In 1982, the company's vanilla took top honors  at the Great American Lick-Off in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> In a former burrito factory on South Van Ness, the company now makes 40 flavors  for 32 franchise stores (including six in Southern California) and three  company-owned stores. In addition, it sells to 150 restaurants.  </P> <P> But it's a different story when it comes to supermarket sales, where contenders  in the super-premium ice cream category have waged a heated battle for freezer  space.  </P> <P> Whereas Fink and Sachar once envisioned that their product would be available  in top chains across the land, today their eight prepackaged flavors are sold  only at Trader Joe's, Price Club and a few mom-and-pop places. In fact, Fink  said, grocery sales have shrunk to $200,000 from $1 million in 1987.  </P> <P> Here's why, he said. In February, 1985, Two Count Inc., a Haagen-Dazs  distributor based in Newark, Calif., agreed to distribute Double Rainbow.  Haagen-Dazs soon dropped Two Count, saying it demanded loyalty by its  independent distributors. After that, Fink said, other big distributors would  not touch Double Rainbow.  </P> <P> Fink, an intense, bearded man, figures that the distribution woes "stopped us  in our tracks." Current annual sales of $3.5 million, he said, are well shy of  the $40 million he estimates that the company could have done on a national  scale. (He estimates that Haagen-Dazs sales in the last five years have surged  to $275 million from $80 million.)  </P> <P> He noted that Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, a Vermont ice cream company, fought a  similar battle with Haagen-Dazs over distribution. That case was settled in  1984, after the firm waged a campaign against Pillsbury with the slogan,  "What's the Doughboy Afraid Of?"  </P> <P> The settlement allowed Ben &amp; Jerry's to use Haagen-Dazs distributors in two  Northeastern states long enough so that it could develop its own network.  </P> <P> In the last few years, Fink added, many small start-ups in the super-premium  ice cream business have failed or been bought by large companies with deep  pockets for promotion and litigation. Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft unit, for  example, owns Frusen Gladje.  </P> <P> Bob Walsh, Two Count's president and one of the founder's four sons, said the  loss of Haagen-Dazs, which represented 40% of the company's business, has taken  a severe toll on his company as well. Two Count has since rapidly expanded its  distribution in an effort to recoup the lost business, but profits have  suffered, he said.  </P> <P> Despite Fink's campaign, his comments reek of resignation.  </P> <P> "If I never win this lawsuit," he said, "I still make a great ice cream."  Double Rainbow may have to be content with just being "a successful local  company."  </P> <P> But with a hint of the old defiance that once prompted him to demonstrate  outside Pillsbury's Minneapolis headquarters in 20-below weather, he added: "I  never thought I'd (spend) five years trying to get in front of a jury. . . .  We're survivors. (But) I'm real scared for the small businessman in America."  </P></p>

Furthermore, tension has risen in Albania following  the arrest of businessmen from North Ipiros and four Albanian  customs officers. Our correspondent in Ioannina, Yeoryios  Kirousis has the following report:    [Kirousis] The situation in Kakavyia has become unbearable  today here as hundreds of trucks have piled up on both sides of  the Greek-Albania border. The Greek customs checkpoint  continues to allow passage to only five fuel-carrying trucks per  day, but problems are now being caused by Albanian customs,  which processes customs documents at an extremely slow pace. In  addition, many Greek tanker trucks have been confiscated and are  being held at the Albanian customs checkpoint. [passage omitted]</p>

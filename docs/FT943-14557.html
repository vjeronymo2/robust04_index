			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Go-ahead expected for Channel 5 The government will today announce what is in effect approval for a fifth conventionally transmitted television channel, after months of delay, Raymond Snoddy writes. A compromise plan designed to enable a new channel to be created while protecting the prospects for digital terrestrial television will be sent to the Independent Television Commission. The ITC will then decide whether to advertise the licence for Channel 5. A number of consortia are thought likely to bid. These include one combining media organisations MAI, Time Warner and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. The frequency offered by the government would allow the new channel to reach 63 per cent of the population - 53 per cent immediately and a further 10 per cent subject to international agreement on frequency allocations. It is believed the government plan rejects use of the frequency known as channel 28 in London - something that would have cut costs - because interference would be caused to other viewers. One problem posed by Channel 5 has been the cost of retuning video recorders.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Paris hosts 'Die Brucke' - William Packer reviews the German Expressionists THE manifold isms of art history, convenient as they undoubtedly are, are also deceptive to a fault. I remember the late Vera Russell, the formidable doyenne of London's art world, shaking me by the throat at a private view and, in reference to a protege of hers whom I had lately so described, hissing into my ear 'she is not Expressionist at all: Expressionists are German.' It is salutary sometimes to be reminded of what she meant by so narrow a view, and Figures du Moderne at the Musee d'Art Moderne offers just such a moment, in splendid and comprehensive fashion. Its subject is the work of the avant-garde of Dresden, Munich and Berlin between 1905 and 1914, clearly centred upon the two principle groups, Die Brucke (the Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (the Blue Rider), taken in turn, with the former rightly given the weightier emphasis. In 1905, in Dresden, the young artists of Die Brucke - Kirchner, Schmidt-Rotluff, Heckel and their friends - declared it their aim 'to attract all the revolutionary and surging elements - that is what the name signifies', with a social and political engagement that distinguished them at that time from their contemporaries (although a period of more pertinent expression would come with the First World War and its aftermath). What we find here is the earlier formal development through through radical technical adventure, and imagery that is anxious, psychological, sexual, urban, dislocated. Der Blaue Reiter, a looser grouping, came later, in Munich around 1911, apolitical and more painterly in its interests and, in the comparative serenity of its expression, ironically so much closer in spirit to the Fauves, the wild beasts of Paris of those few years before, than to the engages of Die Brucke. Here were Klee and Macke on their North African travels, Marc with his prismatic formalism and zoological romanticism, Kandinsky in uninhibited transition from landscape into abstraction, Jawlensky with his chromatic intensity, and each one the more impressive taken on his own. But as much is true of all of them, with the isolated and disturbed Ludwig Meidner the perfect model, whose apocalyptic landscapes and drunken cities of 1913 are extraordinary previsions of the devastation so soon to come. And yet how beautiful they now seem - which again may be said of Kirchner's streets and cabarets, Jawlensky's heads, Heckel's landscapes, Pechstein's nudes, Schmidt-Rotluff's trees, of Nolde, Klee, Kandinsky and the rest of them. How strange it is, that so much of the radical work of early modernism that we found so harsh and difficult even 20 years ago - cubism, futurism, fauvism etc. - now appears so substantial, assured, and beautifully done Yet the question remains as obscure as ever: what is Expressionism? Not, surely, the expression of ideas and emotions through the medium of imagery alone, but through the direct, intuitive application of the paint itself, perhaps, and its physical presence upon the canvas? Perhaps. Munch had had his first controversial show in Berlin in 1892. Van Gogh died in 1890. By 1905 Gauguin had long since gone to the South Seas, the Vienna Secession been and gone. Art was well-travelled, fin de siecle, and zeitgeist a general phenomenon. ***** Elsewhere, the enviable redevelopment of the Louvre continues, with excavations now deep into the foundations of the old Palace of the Tuileries. And to temper our impatience, a mere 39 new rooms have now been hung and opened in that part of the Louvre so long the preserve of the French Ministry of Finance. Thirty-nine galleries would double our Tate or National Gallery, and still our civil servants blockade the greater part of Somerset House. The enclosed Cour Carree, one of the great rediscovered public spaces of Europe, has been for some months now a short-cut from the Pont des Arts through to the Louvre and the Palais Royal. Now it is to be enjoyed as much from the inside, where the French painting of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries now fills each flank of the court. All of Watteau, Chardin, Boucher, Fragonard, Robert, David, Ingres, Gericault, Delacroix, Corot - and all to be savoured in peace, far from the tourist cacophony of the Grande Galerie. The Louvre takes more of our time than ever. Figures du Moderne: Expressionism in Germany 1905-1914. Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Ave. du President Wilson, Paris 16, until March 14</p>

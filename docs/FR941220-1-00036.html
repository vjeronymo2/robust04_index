			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Community Water Systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Bottled water. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PWSs would need to provide and deliver two liters of bottled water per person per day (unless the customer requests less), on request, to households with infants, new residents, or transients (visitors). The bottled water would have to have been monitored or certified to be in compliance with all EPA MCLs. PWSs would be allowed to deliver enough water for several weeks, or the entire time period, at once, and would not be required to provide daily delivery. Infants, up to one year old, would receive bottled water for a maximum of 20 weeks from the date of request. Since a mother may nurse her infant during the first year, it would be her decision as to when to begin giving the infant tap water. Each new resident (person moving to the high-sulfate community from another location) would receive bottled water for a maximum of six weeks. New residents with infants up to one year old would receive bottled water for their infant for 20 weeks. New residents with infants older than one year would receive bottled water for themselves and their infant for six weeks. Since new residents would be informed about the Alternative Water by the PWS at the time of starting water service to their residence, the six weeks would begin at that time. Travelers (guests visiting residents and hotel guests) would receive bottled water for the period requested, not to exceed six weeks. In resident households with infants, the public water system would only need to supply bottled water for the infant in the household. EPA is not proposing to require that bottled water be provided to resident pregnant women prior to childbirth, since there seems to be no transfer of sulfate through the placenta. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule would require PWSs supplying Alternative Water to determine an equitable way of recouping their expenses in providing that service without charging a premium to the recipients of the Alternative Water. EPA believes that an additional charge for Alternative Water (above and beyond what would normally be charged for the water if it had been delivered through the distribution system) would be a disincentive to a consumer's decision to request Alternative Water and receive protection from high levels of sulfate. Therefore, the proposed rule would prohibit PWSs from charging a premium. The Agency believes this is necessary in order to ``assure a supply of drinking water which dependably complies with'' the sulfate MCL (see SDWA Section 1401(1)(D)). Each utility would need to determine the best way to meet its operating expenses without imposing a premium on the subpopulation of customers that is receiving Alternative Water under the sulfate rule. For example, a PWS could charge the same unit cost for each liter of bottled water as it charges for centrally-distributed water. The number of liters of bottled water delivered to a household would simply be added to the number of liters of centrally-distributed water that appears on the meter, and the same unit cost would apply to the entire volume. EPA requests comment on whether it is appropriate to restrict the PWS's fee structure in this way. In particular, the Agency is interested in whether there are State or local ratemaking laws or other laws that bear on this issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two liters per day is the amount of water selected to be provided since that is the consumption level used by EPA in calculating risk estimates, and is the 85th percentile consumption level of water for the U.S. population. Infants are considered to consume one liter per day, but since they comprise a small portion of the target population, two liters per day for all members of the target population is retained for simplicity of implementation. Twenty weeks was chosen as the period for providing bottled water to infants since EPA staff scientists believe that this is a sufficiently lengthy period for infants to become gradually acclimated to high sulfate-containing water. Similarly, six weeks was chosen as the period for providing bottled water to new residents and travelers (guests) to allow gradual acclimation. Although two weeks is the period necessary to acclimate to high sulfate levels if a person is exposed continually to high-sulfate water, this rapid time frame would require the person to experience the adverse effect. In addition, new residents and travelers are likely to have many activities occupying their attention which may prevent them from accomplishing the acclimation in a shorter time period. EPA is requesting comment on these allotted time periods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice provided to customers by the PWS would advise that during the period when bottled water is provided, there should be mixing of bottled water with tap water to allow gradual acclimation of the digestive system to the high-sulfate water. If gradual introduction of tap water is not done, there could still be adverse health effects when use of bottled water ceases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PWS would be responsible for providing bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs on request to any household which has an infant or travelers (guests), and to any household with new residents who have moved to the community from outside the service area.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

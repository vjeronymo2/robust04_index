			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Yuriy Sizov and Gennadiy </F> Talalayev]    [Text] Tbilisi February 3 TASS -- The full-scale treaty of  friendship and cooperation signed by Russia and Georgia today,  which is seen as "most useful to Russia in its political aspect"  by Russian Presidential Council member Emil Paine, has met cool  reception in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia's autonomies  claiming greater independence.    Paine called their attitude "incorrect" from Russia's  viewpoint for two reasons: "It is wrong to stick to double  criteria in politics: if you support territorial integrity of  Russia, you must support territorial integrity of the  neighboring states -- there is no alternative," Paine said. "And  it is wrong to condition the signing of an inter-state treaty on  the settlement of internal conflicts. Problems of this kind  exist in many countries. It is difficult to imagine someone  order other countries not to have anything to do with Russia  until its federal authorities settle relations with the Chechen  Republic, for example".    As concerns benefits for Russia, Paine said Russia needs sea  ports badly. Georgia has several and can provide the  much-needed services to Russia.    Paine also pointed to the problem of Russian troops and  military bases on Georgian territory. "Georgia guarantees  required provisions for the Russian troops," he said. The two  countries's agreement on military strategic issues is of  significance for all Commonwealth member-countries.    The drawing of new borders could cost Russia tens of  billions  of roubles. Also important are the agreements with Georgia on  transit transportation of Russian goods by land and sea via  Georgia, Paine said.</p>

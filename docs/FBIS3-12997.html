			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "Five Comments on the </F> Situation"]    [Text]  <H5>  1. Is Only Their Blood Sacred? </H5>   A single individual committed a massacre, and an entire  country went down on its knees asking for forgiveness. One  person committed a horrendous crime, and each one of us feels  the blood on his hands. When it comes to pogroms, we -- the  experienced victims -- know all there is to know about them.  When the government asks for the forgiveness of the families,  the Palestinian nation, and the whole world, it really  represents every Israeli citizen. We, however, do not make do  with a stately, official apology and a willingness to compensate  the victims' families. Public figures -- the chief rabbi, the  president of the state, cabinet ministers, delegations, party  representatives -- extended their condolences in person. It  seems to me that this has gone as far as to be groveling.  Although only one person committed the act, and although the  situation could have been reversed, it is good that the  Israelis, as individuals and as a collective, feel the need to  apologize.    So what is bothering me? I am disturbed by the fact that in  the dozens of years in which Arabs have been slaughtering  innocent Jews -- the Shafrir children (1956), the children of  Avivim, the Munich athletes, the Coastal Road victims, the  worshipers at the Istanbul and Paris synagogues, the passengers  of planes and buses; all those innocent old men, women, and  children who were shot, stabbed, slaughtered, and blown up in  their homes, in market places, and while walking down a street  -- not a single Arab has asked for our forgiveness. How could  it be that through all those years there was not a single Arab  on the other side -- leader, professor, spiritual leader, Arab  "Peace Now" activist -- who expressed remorse for the murder of  innocent Jews? Is their blood more sacred than ours?  <H5>  2. Waiting for Slaughter </H5>   Our asking for forgiveness may be good for our conscience  and  our international image, but I doubt that it will in any way  change the Arabs' deep feeling of hatred for Jews.    What transpired in the Israeli Arab sector will be dwarfed  by  the events that will take place when the closures and curfews  imposed on the territories are lifted. Brace yourselves for  bloody riots and a series of acts of revenge. We live in a part  of the world where blood vengeance is the way to settle  accounts. We must be prepared for a series of attacks against  Jews. It is no accident that the authors of the Oslo agreement  walk around with ashen faces these days. Suddenly it has become  apparent that the conflict is twofold: political and religious.    While we are handling the political aspect of the conflict,  the abyss between the fanatics of both religions is widening.  Arab statesmen are willing to recognize the existence of  Israel. The problem is that the Muslim movements recognize  neither Israel nor the Arab statesmen who do. Perhaps a major  act of revenge -- something like a massacre in a synagogue --  will allow the resumption of the talks. Nevertheless, as long  as the Islamic movement on the other side and the religious  zealots on our side set the tone, peace will never come anywhere  near being a profitable enterprise.  <H5>  3. Is Yafo Burning? </H5>   The U.S. State Department travel advisory recommending that  U.S. citizens refrain from entering Nazareth and Yafo is  surprising and annoying. I suggest that the U.S. Administration  start showing concern for the wellbeing of Americans in  Washington D.C., New York, and Detroit -- the main centers of  violence in the United States -- before it fans the flames here  and kills our tourism season. Yafo is not burning yet, but what  took place among the Arab residents there is a time bomb. I  must admit that I did not know they hate us that much there,  that so much hatred has accumulated there.    No one had expected the Israeli Arabs to be Zionists. It is  only natural that they stage demonstration in sympathy for their  brethren across the Green Line. But the fact that they smashed  windows of Jewish shops, overturned and burned cars, threw rocks  at the police, hoisted Palestinian flags, and chanted PLO  slogans and songs of revenge against Jews -- and not just one  day, but for four consecutive days -- calls for the following  question: Do these Israeli citizens regard themselves part of  the future Palestinian entity? One could even consider  exchanging populations: bring in the settlers, and allow the  Israeli Arabs join their brothers in the territories. After  all, the idea of driving to Yafo for a seafood dinner only to  find that your car has been gutted is not very appealing in the  long run. It is enough that we are on the verge of a state-wide  civil war; we do not need war between residents of central  Israel in the heart of Tel Aviv.   <H5>    4. And Now, a Defense Minister </H5>   Yitzhaq Rabin -- prime minister, health minister, religious  affairs minister, and interior minister -- is yet to regret that  he also held on to the defense portfolio. The commission of  inquiry, headed by Me'ir Shamgar, will most probably work along  the lines of the letter of appointment it was issued. Coming  from a security background of 20 years of Army service, Shamgar  will most probably stay within the restricted limits he was  given. He may stop at the sentry, the major, or the brigade  commander. Such commissions of inquiry, however, have a  vitality of their own, even after they end their work and  disband. Such commissions may stop at a certain point, but the  conclusions they reach keep growing branches and treetops. The  Agranat Commission [which investigated the Yom Kippur War]  stopped with the chief of staff, but after the commission broke  up, the public ruled that the defense minister and the prime  minister were to blame.    Even if the current commission does not go as far as the  defense minister, we will not be surprised if he finds himself  in the shadow of his ministerial responsibility. Also, the  stages of the arrangement with the Palestinians will be very  complex because of the security arrangements, and so closely  linked with clashes with the Jewish settlers and Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement], that we will not only need a full-time  prime minister; we will also need a full-time defense minister.  Rabin had better part with the role he loves so much, and  appoint a defense minister at this time to cut the link between  the moves called for now and the Shamgar commission conclusions.  <H5>  5. Home Alone </H5>   Stopping the talks was an idiotic move by Yasir 'Arafat.  Perhaps he wants to calm spirits in the territories, and  perhaps he is waiting for a "counter massacre" which will allow  him to return to the talks on a seemingly equal basis. Luckily  for him, Rabin believes that when terror acts take place, the  dialogue process must be accelerated because if we stop the  talks after every painful attack, we will get nowhere.    I hope 'Arafat is not serious in his demand that the  Document  of Principles be reopened; or in his call for an international  force to be stationed in the territories; or in his demand that  we agree to begin discussing the uprooting of the settlements  and disarming the settlers as a precondition for his returning  to the talks. Rabin does not accept any of the changes -- not  because he does not want to, but because he cannot do this with  the minority-based government he is heading.    'Arafat is also wrong in expecting a deeper U.S. involvement  in the political process. The days of the Nixon-Kissinger,  Carter-Vance, Reagan-Shultz, Bush-Baker point-by-point  involvement are gone. Clinton only cares for the United States  and so far, the administration has shown no desire to step in  with both its feet into our swamp. There seems to be no strong  secretary of state in sight who could push us to deal with our  affairs. 'Arafat has no alternative: He and Rabin were left  home alone.</p>

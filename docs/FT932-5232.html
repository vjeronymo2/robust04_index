			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Italy's plans for Dollars 1.5bn issue inspire FRN sector THE Republic of Italy provided the main talking point of the Eurobond market yesterday as news emerged of its plans to launch a Dollars 1.5bn floating-rate note, possibly next week. Italy issued Dollars 500m of five-year bonds and Dollars 300m of 10-year bonds last month, representing its first sortie in the Eurodollar bond sector since its credit rating was downgraded. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, downgraded the rating on Italy's sovereign long-term foreign debt from AA plus to AA in March. The floating-rate note is expected to have a five-year maturity, and the deal will be managed by Morgan Stanley, with Kidder Peabody, Merrill Lynch and J. P. Morgan as joint leads. Dealers noted plenty of activity in the floating-rate note area yesterday. The People's Construction Bank of China launched a total of Dollars 120m of FRNs, consisting of Dollars 50m of five-year notes with a coupon of six-month Libor plus 50 basis points, and Dollars 70m of seven-year notes carrying a coupon of Libor plus 60 basis points. The notes are expected to be sold mainly to investors in the Asia-Pacific region, where the deal was heavily marketed, although some syndicate desks claimed the deal was hard to place. Nafinsa, the Mexican government-owned development bank, issued a Dollars 100m collared floating-rate note. Samuel Montagu, lead manager, said the deal was the first collared FRN to be issued by an LDC borrower, and the floor and the cap were set relatively high. The Eurobond market has seen a steady stream of collared FRNs since last summer, floors set mainly in the range of 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent, and caps in the range of 7.5 per cent to 8 per cent. Nafinsa's bond has a coupon of six-month Libor plus 25 basis points, and has set a minimum coupon of 6 5/8 per cent and a maximum of 10 per cent. The lead manager said the deal was being aimed at two main investor groups - the traditional LDC investors and collared note investors. Dealers said investors were attracted by the higher floor and cap, and noted strong demand from Swiss investors. The World Bank launched an additional Pounds 150m tranche of its Pounds 200m bond issue due December 1998. It was rumoured that the deal was swapped into floating-rate D-Mark to provide the World Bank with funding at 35 basis points below Libor. 'This is the best borrower in the world, so it is not surprising they can get very aggressive funding,' said one syndicate head. The existing tranche was trading at 10 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998, and the new tranche was launched at 14 basis points above the gilt. The yield spread tightened to 12 basis points later in the day. The Republic of Portugal's DM1.5bn, 10-year issue was priced yesterday to yield 28 basis points over the relevant bund, and traded up from its reoffer price of 99.80 to 99.90/99.95 by late afternoon.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "China Builds Up an Industry To Break Ships </F> Apart"]    [Text] Everyone might know that breaking a ship apart is  much easier than building one, but few realize how much money is  to be made in this trade.    Chinese businesses seem to understand the details of the  multi-billion-yuan trade better than most others.    After investing nearly 240 million yuan ($27.5 million),  China leads the world in the business of dismantling ships,  controlling half the market. Nevertheless, its industry sees  plenty of room for growth.    In fact, the China National Ship-Breaking Corp is joining  hands with other Chinese firms to build the country's largest  ship-breaking centre, in Zhoushan in Zhejiang Province.    Also signing an agreement last month to become partners in  the new China Jingtong Ship-Breaking and Washing Co Ltd are  Zhoushan Ship-Building Industrial Corp and Zhejiang  Ship-Breaking Corp.    First-stage construction will enable the complex to  dismantle  old ships for scrap metal and valuable machinery, especially  communications and navigation equipment. Work is expected to be  completed in a year and a half.    After that, China Jingtong will be capable of taking apart  retired ships with more than 2 million dead-weight tons combined  each year. It will also be equipped to clear greasy dirt from  ships' cargo holds and recycle more than 500,000 tons of oily  water annually.    Government officials say the centrally controlled Zhoushan  centre will dominate the domestic ship-breaking industry, which  now comprises more than 200 enterprises.    Since the early 1980s, China has bought more than 10 million  dead-weight tons of old ships from abroad for dismantling and  salvaging.    Chinese salvagers believe foreign ship owners will continue  to sell old vessels for scrap because keeping them operable is  expensive, especially during a recession like the one currently  gripping the shipping business.    Analysts say ship breaking is closely linked to the fortunes  of the world's shipping industry: Sluggish shipping means  hectic business for salvagers.    The central government is enthusiastic about boosting the  industry, official sources said. This way, they say, the  country gets scrap steel rather than having to rely on imports,  and foreign-exchange costs are cut by as much as a third.    But, they added, Chinese workers are not trained well enough  in the business of dismantling ships. Experts estimate that if  a ship of 10,000 dead-weight tons is taken apart scientifically,  an additional 600 tons of metal can be salvaged and 30 days'  work saved.    Shipping companies and factories that build and repair ships  should educate workers so that machinery and equipment that is  still usable is not wasted. These machines and equipment should  be examined by experts and assigned quality certificates so they  can be sold off.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRITY DEATHS: DAVIS, HENSON AND JILL IRELAND  </P> <P> It's hard to believe that the "Candy Man" and the "Muppet Man" are no longer  with us.  </P> <P> So much talent. So much creativity. So much energy. So much love of life. Sammy  Davis Jr. and Jim Henson will indeed be missed.  </P> <P> Sammy and Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog are as much American institutions as  baseball and cherry pie. Sammy's broad smile and dynamic style and Kermit's  soft-spoken charm have made a lasting impression on me.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

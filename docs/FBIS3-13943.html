			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih by Khayrallah </F> Khayrallah "yesterday"; place not given]    [Text] [Khayrallah] You accuse Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  leaders of deciding on separation. Who do you believe has taken  this decision?    [Salih] Those who have decided on separation are known.  They are the elements of apostasy and separation in the YSP.  It is they who fabricated the crisis, escalated its regrettable  complications, and took numerous separatist measures, including  the circumvention of the results of the 27 April 1993 elections,  the mobilization of citizens in southern and eastern  governorates against unity, the rebellion against constitutional  legitimacy and nonrecognition of constitutional institutions,  mobilization of military units and their withdrawal from the  political borders of the Republic of Yemen to the former  partition border areas, and the fomenting of sedition and  stirring up of sectarian, territorial, and tribal tendencies  with a view to fomenting a sedition in society and pushing the  Yemeni people into the furnaces of infighting.    [Khayrallah] Do you believe that separation is a reality?    [Salih] Regrettably the forces of apostasy and separation in  the YSP have through their partitionist practices imposed the  reality of undeclared separation in some southern and eastern  governorates. It is obviously a reality which the Yemenis will  never recognize. They will resist it with all their strength to  safeguard unity. The sons of our people, especially in the  southern and eastern governorates, have suffered a great deal  from the calamities of partition. They vigorously refuse to  return the Yemeni homeland to the situation that existed before  the 22 May 1990. Because they understand the meaning of the  return of the totalitarian regime's domination of people's life.  Unity rescued them from a horrific nightmare and is an umbrella  of security for the Yemeni people. Our people will not allow  anyone or any party to claim guardianship over them and their  unity.    The Yemeni people will defend and safeguard unity, whatever  the price and the sacrifices. Separatists will gain nothing,  nor will they achieve their narrow and selfish aims. The Yemeni  people are now grown up. The sons of our Yemeni people in what  used to be known as the south of the homeland moved out of the  horrific prison and the iron fence imposed on them by the YSP  over 25 years of totalitarian rule. No one in Yemen will ever  accept a return to that prison at all.    [Khayrallah] What is the fate of the Pledge and Accord  Document?    [Salih] The Pledge and Accord Document signed in Amman on 10  Ramadan [20 February] is binding on everyone, ends the crisis,  and imposes implementation. The Yemeni people will not accept  its circumvention by any party.    The YSP leadership was supposed to return to Sanaa after the  signing to merge the constitutional and executive institutions  and form a coalition government headed by Haydar al-'Attas from  the General People's Congress, the YSP, and the Yemeni Reform  Grouping, in order to carry out its duties and put the document  into practice. But regrettably, some separatist forces in the  YSP are seeking to circumvent the document because it affects  their narrow interests.    [Khayrallah] Do you believe that some people are financing  the separation?    [Salih] It is difficult to answer that question, for  numerous reasons. However, it can be answered by another  question: Where does the YSP get all that money to spend on  purchasing and stockpiling arms in the former partition areas?  How does it finance the armed militias and spending on the new  military formations it is setting up outside the constitutional  institutions?    Where do some of these separatist elements get the huge  amount of cash from which they spend generously on buying  people's consciences, kindling conflicts in society, and  financing subversive operations in the homeland, especially in  the northern governorates, to disrupt the security of the  companies operating in the oilfield and kidnap foreigners to  give the impression that there is no stability in northern  governorates. We have sufficient evidence to prove that. Of  course the YSP does not get these huge sums of money from the  state treasury, so where does it get the money? Anyhow, our  people know very well the sources of the YSP's finances. They  are clear and exposed.    [Khayrallah] In your view, what are the real causes of the  crisis?    [Salih] In brief: First, the crisis actually began on 12  Dhu al-Hijjah 1411 Hegira, corresponding to 24 June 1991.    Second, there is the YSP leaders' nonrecognition of the  results of the 27 April elections and the attempt to get around  them by fabricating and escalating the crisis.    THird, there is the YSP's acceptance of constitutional  reforms and then rejection of them because of its secretary  general's disapproval.    Fourth, there is the discovery of oil in some southern and  eastern governorates, which whetted some people's appetites and  ambitions. Some people thought that they could sacrifice the  gigantic project represented in the united state for a dwarf  project represented in a petty oil state that fulfills personal  and selfish wishes.    This is why the crisis was fabricated without taking account  of the potential harm to the interests of the homeland and the  people amd the potential serious threats to the march of unity  and democracy.    [Khayrallah] At the beginning you maintained that there was  no crisis, so what has changed to make you talk about a crisis?    [Salih] Indeed at the beginning of the crisis we tried to  play down and contain the effects of the crisis and see it as  merely contradictions and differing views that could be resolved  through dialogue and reason. At the beginning it was indeed  minor and lay primarily in the brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid's  seclusion after his return to Aden from a hospitalization trip  abroad on 19 August 1993. We had though that through dialogue,  understanding, and mediation we would be able to persuade him to  return to Sanaa to carry out his duties, as happened in the  past. But it seems that what happened was deeper, more serious,  and had been planned for some time to produce a crisis in the  manner we are experiencing now and to push the country to the  situation it is now in, in addition to the threats posed to  unity and democracy in our country as a result.</p>

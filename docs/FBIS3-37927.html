			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told a  meeting of veterans and servicemen in Moscow Wednesday [23  February] that none of the former Soviet republics had a proper  army. He attributed this to shortage of skilled men and absence  of command structures or deployment systems. This is the reason  why Russia has undertaken to send troops on peacekeeping  missions to `hot spots' in the former USSR. "There are numerous  Russians residing in conflict areas and we must protect their  interests," the minister said.    He said that the reform of the Russian armed forces had run  into problems in terms of the financing and construction of  homes for servicemen. He hoped nevertheless, that the compact  and mobile forces that are required by the new military doctrine  would be set up.</p>

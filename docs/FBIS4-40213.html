			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS 10/6/1994 -- Today, the  presidential spokesman made a statement saying that the recent  [8 June] declarations by the president and government of the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic are biased presentations of  the reality, states a presidential press service communique.  Previously, the Dniester officials denounced Chisinau for  jeopardizing the negotiations with Tiraspol. According to the  spokesman, on 28 April, soon after the joint [Moldovan-Dniester]  declaration, the Moldovan president formed a group of experts to  design the draft law on a special juridical status for the  Dniester region. The Dniester party did not create a similar  group, as was agreed. An agreement stipulating the reparations  of the two bridges across the Dniester was signed. Following  this agreement, the Ministry of Transportation three weeks ago  signed a contract with an Odessa company to repair the bridges.  The Dniester party does not carry out its obligations, said the  spokesman. He also said that a branch of the Moldovan National  Bank was opened in Tiraspol and that Dniester companies are  opening accounts in lei at the authorized banks. According to  an agreement signed by the State Administration of Civil  Aviation and the parallel Tiraspol department, actions are  undertaken to satisfy the passengers. President Snegur is  permanently informed of the undertakings and told the experts'  group head, Nicolae Osmochescu, to inform Richard Samuel, head  of the CSCE permanent mission to Moldova, and Vladlen Vasev,  representative of Russian president. The presidential spokesman  stated that "Mircea Snegur appreciates at its real value the  document signed on 28 April and expresses once more his hope  that the Dniester party will prefer to act and not merely talk  in order to establish the peace and understanding unanimously  longed for by the people of entire Moldova."</p>

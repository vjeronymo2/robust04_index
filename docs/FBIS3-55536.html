			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- The parliamentary group of  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia held its first meeting on  Monday [10 January].    Journalists displayed great interest in this event, since  all  other top party functionaries, apart from LDPR leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, as well as newly elected legislators are, in  fact, unknown to the public at large.    However, despite Zhirinovskiy's assurances of his commitment  to "openness and freedom of speech", journalists were barred  from the business part of the meeting. They could only listen  to a 30-minute speech by the party leader.    Zhirinovskiy said that the parliamentary group will consist  of 64 legislators, 59 of whom were elected on the party list and  five from one-seat constituencies. According to the LDPR  leader, the group consists of representatives from "all  professions, trades and social sections".    "The party's position is reconciliation," he said. "The LDPR  is ready to cooperate with all but will not join blocs or  agreements with anybody." According to Zhirinovskiy, there are  "many good lawmakers" among communists and agrarian deputies,  but they are beset with "negative historic past".    As for democratic blocs, Zhirinovskiy said that "there are  people who treat us well".    Although the LDPR supports the new constitution in every  way,  regarding it "good for 90 per cent", the party plans to strive  for creating "a strong parliament along with the strong  president", the LDPR leader noted.    Zhirinovskiy underlined that the LDPR group will lend  strength to parliament.</p>

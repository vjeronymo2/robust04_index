			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESPONSE TO 2 MURDERS  </P> <P> There is something insidiously abnormal in the comparisons of two "death  articles" recounted on the front page of the Metro Section (July 14). Within  the span of 48 hours, two separate guns barked and two separate people died. It  goes without saying that the heinous and wanton murder of Andre Coffyn quickly  joined the annals of burgeoning monstrosities. Likewise, gunning down Walter  Dale Stewart Jr. the day before his 18th birthday was even more than the  helplessness from his mother's utterance of "sad."  </P> <P> But there the similarity between Coffyn and Stewart ends.  </P> <P> It is not that one dead man was black, and the other was white; or that one was  from Europe and the other from America. It is not that one had already built  his material success while the other had just that day been accepted into a  computer job placement program.  </P> <P> Instead, it is that now -- like it or not -- we almost automatically and in a  take-it-for-granted manner, grade the value of a life. One's death is the type,  in the words of Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, that "sends a shiver  down the collective spine." The other merely forces a grieving father to stare  blankly beyond the back-yard fence. One is of the death of a suave Frenchman;  the other is simply "1 of 4 victims to die in the violence on Los Angeles  streets."  </P> <P> One is shot by a robber in his Westside restaurant while sitting with a group  of diners; the other is shot for no particular reason, alone. One man's death  sparks patrols and demands an instant reward for the killer; the other is  relegated to the statistics of gang war and drive-by incidents. One deals with  Yaroslavsky's issue of "the confidence a community feels." The other, sadly  enough, deals with the confidence a community should feel.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE R. GORDON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

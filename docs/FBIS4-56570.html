			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] The fundamental working recommendations made by the  Cuban Parliament to the Cuban Government will demand of the  people significant sacrifices and a necessary belt-tightening  once these become law. The recently concluded special session  of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]  outlined the policy to be followed by the executive branch in  overcoming the serious budget deficit, which amounts to 4.2  billion pesos, and the excessive money supply, which is on the  order of 11.6 billion pesos. Among the suggestions made by the  Cuban deputies are: selective raising of tariffs on nonessential  products, elimination of certain [word indistinct],  establishment of a tax system, reduction of subsidies for  certain products, granting of subsidies to low income earners,  and reduction in state allocations for unprofitable businesses,  a measure already being implemented.    Cuba has been able to face the consequences of previous  stages of the current crisis because even though the U.S.  economic blockade existed, its effects were attenuated by the  advantageous relations with Europe's former socialist countries.  For many years, Cubans enjoyed the benefits of a just and equal  distribution of health care, medical attention, and social  security. Also, there has been equal distribution and subsidy  of rationed products offered at extremely low prices. Access to  some public services has continued to be free. With the  disappearance of the former socialist bloc, the entire weight of  the U.S. economic blockade has been felt. If we add to this the  fact that credit is nonexistent and that this is an  underdeveloped nation, we must conclude that Cuba now finds  itself in a very adverse position which does not permit  resorting to yesterday's solutions.    The Parliament recommended to the government fundamental  guidelines for adopting in coming weeks and months a series of  realistic measures consonant with the current situation.  Perhaps after a reasonable period, preliminary reports will  show positive results. Cubans understand the need for adopting  this strategy, although not all of them are capable of  specifically adapting to the stringency of some of the measures  -- hence the importance of a process of popular discussions in  the country that will seek consensus. Only at the end of the  discussions, sponsored by the unions, did Parliament reach  conclusions on recommendations to the government.    It was seen that premeditated solutions are difficult and do  not have unanimous support. But solutions will never be  proposed behind the people's back. Cubans with low incomes will  not be neglected. At the same time, the 11 million inhabitants  of the island will continue to enjoy the principal social  achievements, such as education, health, and social security  [words indistinct].</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Union Pacific in surprise new offer for Santa Fe The takeover battle for Santa Fe Pacific, one of the biggest US railway companies, yesterday took a new turn after Union Pacific, the hostile bidder, produced a surprise tactic in an attempt to outmanoeuvre Burlington Northern, the friendly suitor. Union Pacific put forward a new offer worth Dollars 3.3bn in cash and shares, substantially less than its last offer of Dollars 3.8bn. However, it said shareholders would get the cash and shares immediately instead of having to wait a year or more while the Federal regulatory authorities considered the deal. The proposal could prove tempting to Santa Fe's shareholders because Burlington Northern's all-share offer is worth less - Dollars 3.2bn - and would have to await regulatory approval. Santa Fe, which had rejected Union Pacific's two previous offers, yesterday said it was studying the latest proposal. The bids will be put to a shareholder vote on November 18. Until now, Union Pacific's bid for Santa Fe, although worth more than Burlington Northern's, had looked less likely to succeed because it ran the risk of being ruled out on anti-trust grounds by the regulatory authorities. Large parts of the Union Pacific and Santa Fe rail networks overlap. Under the new proposal, announced late on Tuesday, Union Pacific is offering Dollars 17.50 for each Santa Fe share, Dollars 10 in cash and the remainder in Union Pacific stock. If Santa Fe shareholders accept, Union Pacific will set up an independent voting trust to hold Santa Fe's stock while the regulatory authorities consider the deal. Santa Fe shares shot up Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 16 1/8 yesterday, a rise of over 9 per cent. Union Pacific shares dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 47 1/2 , while Burlington Northern were unchanged at Dollars 49 3/8.</p>

Jaime Serra  Puche, Mexican secretary of commerce and industrial development,  U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, and Roy MacLaren,  Canadian international trade minister, arrived at the  presidential residence shortly after 1330. Serra, Kantor, and  MacLaren held a private meeting earlier this morning to set in  motion the Free Trade Labor Commission, which is based in  Mexico, the Free Trade Agreement Commission on Labor Affairs  based in the United States, and the Environmental Commission  based in Canada.    The commerce ministers' meeting with President Salinas was  also behind closed doors, and, as we all know, following this  meeting they went over to the Secofin [Commerce and Industrial  Development Secretariat] building to hold a joint news  conference.</p>

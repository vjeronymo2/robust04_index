			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Redland The Budget changes to ACT were too little, too late for Redland. If the company could forget about tax it would have a reasonable story to tell. This year's profits will see the full benefit from devaluation. Germany is holding up well so far. There is tentative recovery in the UK. Whatever else happens in France, there is at least the promise of efficiency gains from rationalising Steetley's aggregates business there. Disposals already in the bag should help cash-flow, offsetting the lower income on Redland's reduced level of sterling deposits. Sadly all this pales into insignificance compared with the tax problem. Steetley's greatest benefit to Redland to date has probably been the Pounds 20m tax saving it brought last year. But that leaves only Pounds 10m of surplus ACT left. The tax charge will rise inexorably over the next couple of years, leaving Redland struggling to cover its dividend. After issuing so many shares to pay for Steetley, it cannot get round this with a BAT-style scrip issue. Nor, for the same reason, can it cut its dividend, although it is arguably paying for over-distribution. Redland thus looks stuck with a period of flat earnings and a dividend which would be vulnerable if building materials did get caught up in the German recession. A yield of 6.7 per cent (on the post-Budget basis) looks inadequate. With hindsight, peak dividend cover of 2.5 times was too low, but Redland will take years of restraint to return even to that level. Competitors like RMC will increase their payouts more rapidly.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / The Middle East: Self-rule timetable THE plan for Palestinian self-rule foresees a permanent accord based on Israeli withdrawal from occupied lands, according to versions of the draft text, AP reports. An elected Palestinian council would govern Jericho and Gaza for a transitional period of no more than five years. The council will have some legislative powers, and would be elected within nine months after the agreement takes effect. A permanent accord would follow. Within two months of the agreement becoming effective the two sides will sign a deal on withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated Palestinian areas in Gaza and Jericho, to be completed within four months. Talks on the permanent status of the territories are to start no later than the beginning of the third year of the interim period.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MERCK, DU PONT TO WORK TOGETHER  </P> <P> Merck &amp; Co., the nation's leading drug company, and E. I du Pont de Nemours  Co. said today that they are joining forces to develop a new class of heart  disease medicine under a research and marketing pact.  </P> <P> As part of the collaboration, Merck will turn over to Wilmington, Del.-based Du  Pont the rights to sell two of its drugs in exchange for a percentage of the  proceeds.  </P> <P> In an unusual arrangement, Merck said it is allowing Du Pont to market Sinemet,  a major treatment for Parkinson's disease, and Vaseretic, a hypertension drug,  in order to focus on marketing other products.  </P> <P> Sinemet accounted for $100 million of Merck's $5.94 billion in sales last year.  Spokesman John Doorley said Vaseretic's revenues were less, but he did not know  the precise figure.  </P> <P> The other half of the collaboration gives Du Pont, a chemical, energy and  specialty products giant, access to Merck's highly proficient research staff  and expertise at bringing products to market in developing a new class of heart  disease medicine.  </P> <P> The class, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, was developed by Du Pont, a  leader in the area. Angiotensin II, or AII, is a major hormone and factor in  high blood pressure.  </P></p>

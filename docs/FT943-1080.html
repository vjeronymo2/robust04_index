			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P downgrades Daimler Benz Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has downgraded its long-term debt ratings on Daimler Benz and related entities to AA - from AA, and has changed the outlook to stable from negative. Some Dollars 5.2bn of debt is affected. According to S&amp;P, 'the rating action reflects increasingly difficult industry fundamentals within the European automotive industry and the continued weakness within developed world aerospace markets'. Daimler's two main units are Mercedes-Benz, the motor vehicle manufacturer, and Dasa, the aerospace group. Daimler Benz did not seem overly worried by the move. A spokesman told Reuters news agency that 'debt rated AA - has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal, and differs from the highest rated debt only to a small degree'. Despite a 6.8 per cent increase in European new car registrations during the first six months of 1994, S&amp;P said it expects long-term demand to slow as European markets approach saturation. At the same time, increasing economic unification suggests that automotive market conditions will be subject to more cyclical fluctuations while competition among players is intensifying as a result of the elimination of trade barriers, the agency stated. Conditions within global aerospace markets also remain weak, S&amp;P said. However, while long-range conditions in Daimler Benz's core automotive and aerospace markets will remain challenging, S&amp;P said, it assumes group operating profitability will improve over the next two to three years in line with European economic recovery and as a result of recent product launches and the group's rationalisation and restructuring programmes. Some analysts felt the rating came at an odd time. 'It seems rather late in the day to be downgrading Daimler, seeing as it appears to have weathered the storm and is on the mend,' said Mr Roderick Hinkel, German strategist at Paribas Capital Markets. Daimler Benz reported operating profits of DM926m (Dollars 600m) for the first half of this year compared with a loss of DM2.4bn in the same period a year ago. The company's chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter, recently predicted that 'almost all' operations should have returned to profit by 1995. S&amp;P also noted that Daimler Benz is seeking to enhance its competitiveness through the renewal and expansion of product offerings at Mercedes-Benz and improvements in operating efficiency across the entire group.</p>

Twenty people's deputies who had expressed  their proposals with regard to the three blocks of basic  problems, took part in discussing the agenda. Parliamentary  chairman Ivan Plyushch included the issue of the economy and the  budget, the fight against corruption and abuse, the payment of  pensions, and raising salaries for workers in education whose  representatives picketed the Supreme Council this morning, in  the first block.    The second block consists of issues connected to the  elections in the Crimean Republic. Three hundred and four  deputies voted to submit the additions to point 7-2 of article  114-5 of Ukraine's constitution, according to which the  president of Ukraine would be given the right to repeal "acts of  the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, ministerial acts, and acts  of other central bodies of Ukraine's state executive power as  well as acts of the central bodies of power of the Republic of  Crimea in the event of their incompatibility with the  constitution and laws of Ukraine and decrees of Ukraine's  president."    From the third block of issues, concerning nuclear  disarmament, parliamentary standing commissions on foreign  affairs, defense, and security, and on legislation and legality  are to prepare, by 25 January, a resolution on the compatibility  of the trilateral statement by the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S.  presidents with the earlier adopted parliamentary resolution on  the ratification of the START I Treaty.    The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ukraine's security  service have been charged with preparing information on the  course of the investigation into the affair of the attack on the  Rukh secretariat and the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn,  Rukh's head of secretariat.    A report of the special deputies' commission concerning the  activity of the leadership of the "Blasko-Black Sea Fleet  concern" will be heard on 26 January    A Supreme Council resolution on the renewal of direct radio  broadcasts of plenary sittings and presentations in the form of  reports on TV, was adopted.    Deputies heard a report from Ukraine's first deputy minister  of the economy, Valentyn Popov, on the plan of the economic and  social development for 1994. The speaker gave several indices  that characterized the state of the economy: national income  fell by 15 percent compared to 1992; social labor productivity  fell by 13 percent; the decline of industrial production is 7.4  percent of last year's level and it took place in more than half  of industrial enterprises. Last year 16 percent fewer consumer  goods were manufactured, including foodstuffs (9.4 percent  fewer) and emission amounted to 12.3 trillion karbovantsi.  Among the plan's basic directions are structural changes in the  economy on the basis of state priorities, the attraction of  investments from all kinds of sources, and the creation, on the  basis of state ownership, of economic subjects that are fully  responsible for the consequences of their activity. The Cabinet  of Ministers is counting on an increase in the rate of the  karbovanets to 16,000 karbovantsi to the U.S. dollar,  maintaining prices for coal throughout the year at the level of  the first quarter of 1994 and an increase in the population's  money incomes by 5.1 times at a price of 4.45 times. In the  words of Valentyn Popov, these indices could be achieved by  conducting a tough credit policy, introducing more flexible  mechanisms of regulating the consumer fund, developing the  process of clearing up enterprises' finances [sanatsiya  pidpryyemstv], privatizing small and medium size enterprises,  incorporation [korporatyzatsiya] of large enterprises, and  increasing control over prices at all levels.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet confirms Spanish talks GRAND METROPOLITAN, the UK-based food and drinks group, confirmed yesterday that its drinks division is in talks with Gonzalez Byass of Spain. Confirmation that International Distillers &amp; Vintners is in serious discussions with the Spanish group follows speculation in the Spanish press about a possible link. GrandMet said the discussions could lead to international distribution agreements and IDV taking a stake in the Spanish company. Gonzalez Byass is one of the few remaining Spanish family controlled drinks companies with international brands. It owns Soberano, the leading Spanish brandy in the domestic market and Tio Pepe, the fino sherry. It is understood to be interested in developing links with a larger partner in order to facilitate international marketing of its brands. GrandMet for its part is interested in expanding its stable of brands. See Lex</p>

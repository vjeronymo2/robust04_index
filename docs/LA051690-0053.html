			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PRISONERS' WORK PROGRAM MAY GROW  </P> <P> Ventura County Jail inmates performed an estimated $2 million worth of work  last year. On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors launched a program that could  triple that production, putting even more prisoners to work in jail kitchens,  laundries and vegetable gardens.  </P> <P> The county already leads the state in the percentage of inmates involved in  formal work programs, said Sheriff's Cmdr. Donald R. Lanquist. Some of the  cattle raised by inmates wind up on the jail menu.  </P> <P> As payment, the 400 of the county's 1,400 prisoners involved in the program are  able to reduce their sentences by one day for every six days worked.  </P> <P> To expand the program, the supervisors ordered the Sheriff's Department to form  a Jail Industries Task Force made up of representatives of business, labor and  law-enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> "I'm confident we will expand the program. But at this point I can't say how  large an expansion it will be," Lanquist said after the supervisors' meeting.  </P> <P> "We have to be careful not to take jobs away from taxpayers. On the other hand,  we feel the working inmate serves both himself and the taxpayer."  </P> <P> Supervisors' Chairwoman Madge L. Schaefer supported the approach, declaring:  "We've got 1,000 prisoners in that jail having three squares a day and watching  TV all day. Let's get them off their bunks."  </P> <P> Supervisor Maggie E. Erickson pointed out that Rod Miller, a specialist in  inmate work programs who studied the county's program, found that the county  uses nearly 650,000 hours of inmate labor annually. That could be increased as  much as 1.3 million hours, according to Miller. JACK SEARLES  </P></p>

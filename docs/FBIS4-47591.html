Bronovets, G.A. Sverchkova, Belarussian </F> Advanced Physicians Training Institute; UDC  615.243.4-02:612.321:616.33-002.44]    [Abstract] Increasing uses of dalargin--an opioid peptide  and synthetic counterpart of Leu-enkephalin--for treatment of  stomach and duodenum disorders and a lack of studies of  dalargin's effect on the acidogenic function of the stomach in  stomach and duodenum ulcer patients prompted an examination of  54 such patients (40 men and 14 women) with stomach (11) and  duodenum (43) ulcer. The largest group was made by 18-39 year  old (31 patients). All patients were divided into two groups: in  the first (8 patients), 0.5 mg of dalargin was administered  intravenously and in the second, 1 mg was administered to 46  patients; the acidogenic function was examined by pH-metry. An  analysis shows that no significant changes occurred in the first  group after a single dalargin injection or after a two-week  treatment course. In the second group, dalargin injection  inhibited the acidogenic function some 3-4 min later in duodenum  ulcer patients; this function remained inhibited for 30-40 min.  In the case of a treatment course, dalargin stimulates the  alkalizing function of the antral stomach section and, to a  lesser extent, suppresses the acidogenic function of the stomach  body and fundus.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners note that Solvay do Brasil owns 99.8 percent of CBCC. Petitioners contend that if the Department uses the COP/CV information submitted by CBCC, it should base its calculation of interest expense upon the borrowing experience associated with the consolidated group of companies. Petitioners contend that the Department should use the financial expenses reported on Solvay do Brasil's financial statements to perform this calculation. Finally, petitioners assert that the Department should apply this allocation to the replacement cost of manufacture (COM) to properly account for Brazilian hyperinflation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CBCC argues that calculation of interest expense on a consolidated basis would be improper. CBCC contends that the December 20, 1993, verification report concludes that CBCC made interest-free loans to Solvay do Brasil. CBCC contends that it charged Solvay do Brasil the minimum Brazilian statutory requirement for the monetary correction. CBCC also argues that the Department found no evidence of loans from Solvay do Brasil to CBCC at verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with petitioners that CBCC's interest expense should be calculated on a consolidated basis. Since the cost of capital is fungible, we believe that calculating interest expense based on consolidated statements is the most appropriate methodology (see,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Small Business Telephones from Korea,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 54 FR 53141, 53149 (December 27, 1989),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 55 FR 31414, 31418&hyph;31419 (August 2, 1990), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, et al.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 54 FR 18992, 19074 (May 3, 1989)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to extinguish its outstanding debt, CBCC issued new shares of capital stock to its parent company. Also, we established at verification that Solvay do Brasil owns 99.8 percent of CBCC. Based on these facts, it is evident that the shift in debt is due to the parent company's control over the subsidiary. Accordingly, the degree of relationship influenced the structure of debt for the entire company. Therefore, consistent with our normal practice, we revised CBCC's submitted interest expenses based on the consolidated financial statements of Solvay do Brasil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During verification, CBCC company officials did not provide the source documents for Solvay's financial income and expenses. Therefore, we have used BIA to determine CBCC's financial expenses. As BIA, we used information from Solvay do Brasil's financial statements. This percentage was then applied to each month's COM to ensure that CBCC's COP data fully reflected interest expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners contend that the Department's December 20, 1993, COP verification report suggested allocating interest expenses to CBCC's COP based on the sum of the financial expenses reflected in CBCC's and Solvay do Brasil's 1991 and 1992 financial statements. Petitioners note that if the Department took that approach, it would determine interest expenses as a percentage of the sum of both companies' cost of goods sold (COGS), adjusted for intercompany interest transactions. Petitioners further contend that CBCC's financial statements reflect only net interest expenses, and that use of the allocation that the Department proposed in its December 20, 1993, verification report would give CBCC credit for all of its interest income, whether short-term or not. Petitioners argue that CBCC submitted no information regarding short-term interest income, making it impossible for the Department to make any adjustment for intercompany interest transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with petitioners that CBCC did not provide information documenting the company's short-term interest income. As previously discussed in our response to Comment 2, we have relied upon BIA in our calculation of CBCC's interest expense. As BIA, we used the financial expense information from Solvay do Brasil's financial statements. We then applied this percentage to each month's COM for purposes of our COP/CV calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners assert that CBCC purchased electricity at a discount when the electricity is used to restart idled machinery. Petitioners note that, prior to March 1992, CBCC averaged the cost of electricity obtained from its own production and from three separate pricing plans. Petitioners note that, after March 1992, CBCC stopped averaging electricity costs, and used the discounted electricity associated with the running of idled machines. Petitioners contend that the Department should use CBCC's average electricity costs in the COP/CV calculations rather than the discounted electricity costs associated with the restarting of idled machinery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CBCC contends that the antidumping law contemplates that producers will base pricing decisions on currently available COP information. CBCC contends that the Department verified that the furnace was idle prior to the acquisition of the discounted energy, and that the discounted energy was only used on the restarted furnace. CBCC argues that it applied the discounted energy to silicon metal so as to minimize the COP of silicon metal consistent with the Department's COP methodology. CBCC suggests that averaging its electricity costs would result in rejection of its cost data simply because the cost is not high enough.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

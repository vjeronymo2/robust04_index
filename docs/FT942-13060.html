			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Mobile phone network gets the Orange light: Hutchison Microtel is back Hutchison Microtel makes its second attempt to carve out a share of the UK mobile telephone market this week. Tomorrow it launches Orange, a personal communications network, promising a broad range of services made possible by digital - computer-based - transmission. The launch comes just six months after the company wrote off Pounds 100m by ending its low-cost Rabbit mobile service. Orange will be Britain's fourth mobile phone network after Vodafone, the largest, and Cellnet - both of which use analogue transmission - and Mercury One-2-One, which pioneered digital transmission in the UK but is still limited essentially to the London area. It plans to extend to the 30 largest conurbations by 1996. Hutchison Telecom, owned 65 per cent by Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa, 30 per cent by British Aerospace and 5 per cent by Barclays Bank, will target the million or so small and medium-sized businesses which do not yet use mobile phones. Orange has become the largest single investment in telecommunications for the Hong Kong group. Mr Hans Snook, group managing director for Hutchison Telecom (UK) said investment to the end of this year, when the service should reach 70 per cent of the UK population, would be Pounds 450m. Some 900 base stations, filing-cabinet-sized pieces of equipment to receive and transmit calls, were in place and a further 550 sites had been bought. He said the peak funding requirement, including all capital expenditure, operating expenditure and operational losses would be about Pounds 700m. Break-even is planned for 1997. Much will depend on the tariff structure, to be announced tomorrow. Mercury One-2-One is widely credited with creating the breakthrough in mobile telephony for domestic users by offering free local calls in the evenings and at weekends, but Mr Snook says Orange will not follow suit. 'I do not see One-2-One as a competitor,' he said. 'It is still a regional operator. It is going to grow but it takes an average of 15 months to acquire, equip and commission a base station site. When I look at where we are now and where I understand One-2-One is, they are about 18 months behind. Our biggest competitor is Vodafone followed by Cellnet.' Mr Snook said his chief aim was to broaden the market: 'If there are still four operators in the market by 2000, I would be happy with a 25 per cent share.' He thought the market for domestic use would not grow substantially until the end of 1995 or 1996. Orange handsets double as radio pagers and have screens which can display messages. Each handset can support two telephone lines distinguished by different ringing tones. Their batteries support more than an hour's continuous conversation.</p>

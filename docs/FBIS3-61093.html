			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Abdwali Qaraghululy: "Marriage and Weddings"] </F>   [Text] It is well known that, since the past year of the  monkey, there has been considerable discussion on the occasion  of the marriage ceremonies taking place everywhere, about  religious marriage, weddings, mixed marriage, and religious  training.    Articles such as "Regular Religious Propaganda", "How Can We  Be Muslims if We Neither Know nor Practice the 40 Duties of a  Muslim?", and "Wedding Night" have been published in the press,  and there has been news on television and radio on the  construction of mosques, appearances before Muslim judges, and  the like. A Kazakh translation of the teachings of the Koran has  appeared in the national weekly SHALQAR, and materials have been  provided about the Sharyat, fasting, and prayer. Last September  SHALQAR familiarized its readers with teachings suggested by the  ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the theme of "the  Prophet Muhammad."    From what has been said, we see that we are carrying out the  foundations of religious measures. However, it is clear that  these things will not satisfy the masses of the people, which  have had their ties with religion severed for 70 years, and  which have remained uninformed. In this connection there are not  a few suggestions and public needs. We hope that they will, in  any case, gain the attention of the appropriate religious  authorities and the information media.    We will touch, to the best of our abilities, on only one of  these questions, the marriage question, and share our thoughts.    On Marriage and Setting Up a Household    Marriage is the custom whereby men and women, having become  husband and wife, live jointly in one household. It is clear to  all that marriage is no "art" created by the mind but something  natural. If there were no marvelous manifestations of  developments of this sort, the continuation of the generations  would fail and human posterity would not have grown and  prospered as it has at present. In simple words we can all  understand, the vital meaning and valued characteristics of  marriage for the life of society in general are an expression of  this. However, this is not to say that marriage of men and women  is an outstanding condition for life, one that is completely  unequaled.    Long betrothals and the dispatching of girls for marriage  and  the marrying off of sons have enjoyed particular importance in  the life of our people. Parents have been overjoyed that "my son  has established a nest, my daughter has found a home," "the two  of them have become a couple," "my family has expanded," and  have thanked God. Thus a line has been forged to two young  people, who have become man and wife and will be happy the rest  of their lives. This day is one of the happiest days for them;  one that they should never forget. According to the customs of a  life that has been established by our ancestors and approved by  religion, a mullah carries out the marriage ceremony at  weddings. He provides the blessed marriage water for the bride  and groom to drink. He reminds the couple of the fact that they  are taking the first steps on the threshold of a greater life.  He gives them advice on how to establish a proper life and makes  known his good wishes.    On Mixed Marriage    Mixed marriage is a fact of life that has existed since  ancient times and continues to exist. Even if there is no  special written literature about this, we read about it in  historical documents, in travel accounts, in histories, and  stories. It takes place under various circumstances. It is a  major topic in and of itself.    However, it is well known that our broad-minded and  hospitable people experienced grief during the last three  centuries while in the fetters of the white Tsarist and red  imperialism, that Kazakhstan has changed from being a nation  into a unique multiethnic republic. People of foreign  nationalities with different languages and different religions  have flowed in, spread out, taken over the administrative organs  and the leading economic and cultural sectors, and strengthened  the intermixing going on in daily life. Thus the necessary  precondition for an increase in the number of mixed marriages  arose.    All in all, in social life there are distinct forms of  marriage and characteristics peculiar to each. To separate them  out, it would be suitable to divide marriages into three groups.  Let us do so.    Group One    In marriages whereby the sons and daughters of Turkic  brothers such as Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Uighyr, Tatar, and  Bashqurt, which have related languages and the same religion,  join with one another, there are absolutely no conflicts from an  ethnic or a religious standpoint. We must always approve and  support this kind of marriage.    Group Two    Until the Soviet era only a few men were married to women of  other nationalities, religion, and language among the Kazakhs.  However, women who in this way went off to get married had to  make known their willingness by special agreement to accept the  Muslim religion, learn the Kazakh language, and utilize Kazakh  customs and traditions in their daily life, and only when they  had given consent would the mullah marry them and they would  become man and wife legally.    Let me give several examples to prove what I am saying. The  story of how a Russian girl Mariya Yegorovna Rykina (1887-1950)  fell in love with a young Kazakh man named Duysen and went off  to marry him is known to the entire Kazakh people. One out of  every two knows the song "Dudaray" she produced and dedicated to  Duysen. It is performed at feasts, on stage, and heard on  television and radio. The famous aqyn Qalizhan Bekkhozhin has  written a poem "Mariyam Zaghorqyzy" and there is an opera called  "Dudaray."    Mariya, who accepted without hesitation the requests and  suggestions of Duysen, even though she was, in her words, "by  nature Russian," became a Muslim; wore a kimeshek just like a  Kazakh woman; spoke Kazakh her whole life; and had to become  Kazakh by choice. We take this as a suitable example for  praising mixed marriages.    The wife of Akhmet Baytursynuly, the beloved figure of the  Kazakh people, great scientist, famous aqyn and great social  activist was from the Russian nationality and was even years  younger than him. When she was married in the mosque, she called  herself Badrisafa Mukhamed-Sadyqqyzy in the Muslim manner.  According to what Akhmet's daughter Sholpan said, she knew  Kazakh very well, wore a white embroidered scarf on her head,  wore long fluttering skirts, and never mentioned the name of her  husband, calling him "tore." The two lived a good life together,  bore the difficulties together, and together reaped the fruits  of their fate.    We should notice the following lines (author Gharifolla  Qabdolqayyruly) of a picture called "Akhmet's [junior] Wife"  published in the paper ANA TILI (No 26, 1991). One of the  village elders accompanying Akhmet and Badrisafa on a trip to  the Torghay is supposed to have said: "How can you be Kazakh? If  you were Kazakh, how could you marry a heathen?" Without  hesitation Akhmet argued:    I was pleased that Aleksandra Ivanova over there adapted her  fate to mine. If one Kazakh converts one heathen to Islam, it  resounds to the honor of 10.    If this image seems worthy of joking about, it expresses the  very truth. Let us draw the conclusion from this that if people  of two nationalities love each other completely and truly, and,  if they know how to keep their marriage strong, it is altogether  possible that mixed marriages may be a good thing.    Another example. On the eve of the 1917 October Revolution,  a  Kazakh village intellectual named Yermek Qulyshuly, who had  learned in the old way in Aktobe Oblast, married a Russian woman  named Mariya. She received the Islamic religion in a Tatar  mosque, fulfilled the promises she gave there, learned the  Kazakh language very well in only a year, and, dressing like a  village woman, gave a Muslim blessing before eating and cooking  food. During the next year at the beginning, middle, and end of  the month of fasting, she kept her fast for three days, called  herself "Kazakh" in the village council registry, and became a  regular Kazakh woman, an honest, open-minded lady.    To summarize, such were the special characteristics of mixed  marriages which took place before the Soviet era and which we  have heard about from the mouths of the people and seen in  detail with our own eyes. We must give such marriages the  appropriate approval. Such marriages conform to our national  goals and interests and cause no harm to our language, our  religion, and our way of life. Today's young people should learn  from them.    Group Three    The harmfulness of this came into being after the October  Revolution, year of the snake. We do not think that everything  about it was poison. We are against the continual droning to the  effect that "the Kazakh people live on the broad steppe, that  Kazakh women and men have equality." One may be a little  disturbed by what I say, but we have obtained nothing good from  this. Likewise, an ax has assaulted the roots of our religion.  We have been deprived of our status as Muslims. Mosques have  been closed. The Koran has been burned. Mullahs, qazhis, and  ishans have been persecuted. Muslim rituals such as marriage and  the circumcision of children have been prohibited. Use of our  mother tongue has contracted and the Russian language, praised  as "the language of joy," has taken the place of honor. In  addition there is the scourge of drink.    As a result of such a policy of exhaustion and destruction,  our spirits have begun to be destroyed, and ill-breeding,  vulgarity, and anarchy have gained ground in our life. Among our  stirred-up young people and empty-headed adults given to  deception, meeting girls on the dance floor, at bars, and quick  sex called "friendship" is becoming common. The "easily  seducible," who have "forgotten" shame in the heat of the  moment, have appeared. Since they know nothing about one  another, and are not discriminating, they marry in a hurry. Such  relations of husbands and wives cannot last. In most cases they  can only end in divorce.    Hitherto mixed marriages were few and far between among  Kazakhs, and, when they did take place, they were, as indicated  above, carried out by special agreement. Today, on the other  hand, the relations of husband and wife are regarded very  easily, and those marrying without thinking of the past, the  present, or the future number in the hundreds and thousands.    According to official information, 7.5 percent of all males  marrying in our republic marry women of other nationalities and  7.2 percent of women marry men of other nationalities. In fact,  the Russian language is spoken in most of these mixed marriages.  Such marriages are more common among Kazakhs than among our  kinsmen such as Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, or Turkmen. We cannot say that  this is a good sign. While their sons and daughters,  grandchildren, and great-grandchildren remain "Kazakh" on paper,  in most cases (especially when the mothers are Slavs) there is  no disputing the fact that they have changed their ethnic nature  and character. We cannot view this in an unconcerned manner. We  must support those who have fallen, extend a hand and aid those  who have become lost.    In conclusion, our independent Republic of Kazakhstan is a  young country. While the most fundamental duty of our people  today is to take the bridles of our republic in hand, strengthen  the foundations, and, while developing the economy and culture  as rapidly as possible, become rich and cultured, it is clear  that those who will carry on are today's younger generation. For  this reason, we must aim at making them citizens with lofty  social sensitivities, citizens who are well founded and who will  not reject the hallowed ways of their progenitors, citizens who  are hardy with pure Kazakh souls, and strive to educate them in  this spirit. The Islamic religion, with its humanitarian,  beneficial teaching, will save them from criminal acts. However,  we believe that the Islamic cultural centers, which have begun  with the construction of houses of religion, mosques, will add  their own contributions to this worthy goal and we hope that in  this way God will provide for us all.</p>

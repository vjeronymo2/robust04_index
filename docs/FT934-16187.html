			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swiss engineer buys Degussa operation OERLIKON Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and retailing conglomerate, said its acquisition of most of Leybold from the German chemicals group Degussa would strengthen its substantial position in vacuum technology related sectors. Terms of the purchase were not disclosed. Oerlikon's Balzers subsidiary, based in Liechtenstein, is a leading supplier of vacuum chambers and thin film coatings for various products from cutting tools to compact discs and the latest flat panel liquid crystal display screens. Leybold has been Balzers' main competitor in most of these fields. Together, they should account for about 16 per cent of world markets, with much higher shares in particular specialities. Oerlikon said it would maintain the Leybold brand name because of its strength in the market. The Leybold businesses being acquired have annual sales of about DM800m (Dollars 471m) but have been in loss. Balzers had sales of SFr468m (Dollars 312m) last year and recovered from a 1991 loss to make a SFr50m operating profit.</p>

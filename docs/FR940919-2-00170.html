			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. On June 30, 1994, the Company held assets of approximately $11.94 million, comprised of approximately $.27 million in cash and cash equivalents, $9.92 million in short-term investments, $1.23 million in loans and notes receivable, and $.52 million in other assets. The Company's common stock currently is traded sporadically in the over-the-counter market. The Company does not employ any full-time employees. The Company's administrative operations are handled by contract bookkeepers, accountants, and attorneys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Rule 3a&hyph;2 under the Act provides a one-year safe harbor to issuers that meet the definition of an investment company but intend to maintain that status only transiently. The Company relied on the safe harbor provided by this rule from December 30, 1988 until December 30, 1989. The expiration of the safe harbor period necessitated the filing of an application for exemption. In 1990, the Company was granted conditional relief from all provisions of the Act until December 30, 1990 (the ``1990 Order''). The SEC extended this exemptive relief by four subsequent orders, most recently until December 30, 1994. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Investment Company Act Release Nos. 17941 (Jan. 9, 1991) (notice) and 17989 (Feb. 7, 1991) (order); Investment Company Act Release Nos. 18430 (Dec. 5, 1991) (notice) and 18466 (Dec. 31, 1991) (order); Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19128 (Nov. 25, 1992) (notice) and 19175 (Dec. 22, 1992) (order); and Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19839 (Nov. 5, 1993) (notice) and 19916 (Dec. 1, 1993) (order) (together with the 1990 Order, the ``Prior Orders''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. As described in detail in the applications for the Prior Orders, during a portion of the period in which the requested exemption will be effective, it is possible that the Company will be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal bankruptcy courts. In this regard, the Company has formulated a plan of reorganization (the ``Reorganization Plan'') to be implemented under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code once the FDIC approves a settlement of the FDIC Claims. The Reorganization Plan would settle the outstanding claims against the Company and provide a structure for the possible acquisition of a new operating business or businesses. Because the bankruptcy court is charged with protecting the interests of the Company's creditors and equity interest holders, the Company believes that it is not necessary for it to comply with section 17(a) or section 17(d) with respect to transactions approved by the bankruptcy court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 3(a)(3) of the Act defines an investment company as an issuer engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owning investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuers' total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items). The Company acknowledges that, based on its current mix of assets, it may be deemed to be an investment company under section 3(a)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Company requests, pursuant to sections 6(c) and 6(e) of the Act, that the SEC issue an order exempting the Company from all provisions of the Act, subject to certain exceptions, until December 30, 1995. The requested order would extend the exemption granted by the Prior Orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In determining whether to grant exemptive relief for a transient investment company, the SEC considers such factors as: (a) Whether the failure of the company to become primarily engaged in a non-investment business or excepted business or liquidate within one year was due to factors beyond its control; (b) whether the company's officers and employees during that period tried, in good faith, to effect the company's investment of its assets in a non-investment business or excepted business or to cause the liquidation of the company; and (c) whether the company invested in securities solely to preserve the value of its assets. The Company asserts that it meets these criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

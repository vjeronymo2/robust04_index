			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- On Thursday, President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada spoke of the danger of  "narcoguerrilla" and powerful drug cartels like those of  Colombia developing in Bolivia if a general drug enforcement  policy is not quickly defined.    Sanchez de Lozada said this new policy, which he will  present  to Congress next August, must not be imposed from abroad. He  spoke to a local newspaper, alluding to the problems created in  Bolivia by U.S. pressure to radicalize drug enforcement and to  eradicate coca plantations in El Chapare, the largest cocaine  raw material producing zone in the world. The chief of state  said: "Trafficking is a very serious problem for all sectors of  society and it affects Bolivian relations with the rest of the  world."    The president said he was worried about the lack of a  consistent drug enforcement strategy. He stated that most of  the coca produced in El Chapare -- approximately 60,000 tonnes  per year -- ends up in drug production.    "Nobody chews coca in El Chapare; coca produced in Yungas  region is taken to El Chapare, and it all goes to produce drugs.  The atmosphere in the region favors the establishment of drug  cartels or narcoguerrillas," Sanchez de Lozada said.    Regarding the policy being prepared by his administration,  Sanchez de Lozada mentioned the creation of a National Drug  Enforcement Council presided by Foreign Minister Antonio  Aranibar and comprising Justice Minister Jorge Blattman,  Sustainable Development Minister Guillermo Justiniano, and  Minister of Government German Quiroga.    This council must find solutions in Bolivia and not  solutions  imposed from abroad, the president said, adding that this  reorganization includes defining a policy toward the United  States. "This is a far too important for them (the United  States) because after many years they have recognized the need  for shared responsibility. It is our obligation to generate a  proposal that will really solve this problem," Sanchez de Lozada  said.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOUGHER MONITORING VOWED AS NEW POLICE PANEL IS ESTABLISHED  </P> <P> Pledging a stronger and more independent monitoring of police misconduct, the  San Diego city manager's office announced Tuesday the creation of the Citizens'  Review Board on Police Practices.  </P> <P> The panel, which will be chaired by longtime civic activist Murray L. Galinson,  is being established under the guidelines approved by voters in November when  they passed Proposition G.  </P> <P> The 20-member board replaces the outgoing Civilian Advisory Panel on Police  Practices, which was created with the police chief's blessing and, during its  one-year existence, was sharply censured by critics who said it rubber-stamped  actions by the Police Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Communication  </P> <P> "We need to do everything we can to make sure the public is properly informed  about our work," Galinson said in explaining that the new board hopes to garner  the support of the community.  </P> <P> "Half of the problems in the past have been because of a lack of  communication."  </P> <P> However, the new board, when it becomes active July 1, will be primarily  different only in that the police chief has been removed from the process of  selecting its members.  </P> <P> And, like the outgoing board, the panel will be precluded from conducting any  independent review of police complaints and instead will analyze only how well  the police police themselves.  </P> <P> In addition, the new board will not release any data or reports on individual  cases and will not disclose how individual complaints are resolved.  </P> <P> But George Penn, assistant to the city manager, said eliminating the police  chief's involvement in itself makes the board stronger than its predecessor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rules to Be Announced  </P> <P> "That was the main issue with the people," he said. "The people said, 'You  can't have the fox guarding the chicken house,' and that's what Proposition G  cleared up. These are independent people the city manager has appointed."  </P> <P> Penn also said that new rules and regulations governing the board's functions  will be announced soon. They will show even more autonomy for the board, such  as the panel's authority to "look at" but not impose discipline for errant  officers.  </P> <P> Galinson said the board hopes to hold open forums to share some of the panel's  work with the public, as well as to receive suggestions on how it could be  improved.  </P> <P> It was a lack of public confidence that led to the downfall of the outgoing  board. In November, two separate review board proposals were presented to  voters: the Proposition G board and a second, tougher panel under Proposition  F. Both proposals received approval from a majority of voters.  </P> <P> A San Diego Superior Court judge has since ruled that only the Proposition G  board should be established, because G received a few more votes than F.  </P> <P> However, Betty Wheeler, legal director of the San Diego chapter of the American  Civil Liberties Union, said Tuesday that her organization will appeal the  ruling. She said the ACLU believes both boards should be created. Under  Proposition F, the board would have subpoena powers, gather evidence and hold  hearings on individual citizen compliants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not in Conflict'  </P> <P> "The two proposals, which both passed, are not in conflict," she said. "Both  can be implemented, and therefore both should be implemented."  </P> <P> Galinson, asked if his review board under Proposition G could work alongside a  stronger review board under Proposition F, said:  </P> <P> "If there were two, it could cause a lot of duplication in time and effort.  But, if that was the final determination, I certainly would have no problems  with it."  </P> <P> City Councilman Wes Pratt, who strongly supported Proposition F over G, said he  hopes Galinson's panel is at least stronger than the outgoing board.  </P> <P> "That previous body confirmed or agreed with the Police Department's position  on all of the cases it looked at," he said. "And the reality was that the city  was settling police-brutality cases and police officers were being fired.  </P> <P> "So there's some room for flexibility. It doesn't necessarily have to be a  carbon copy of the ineffective process we had before."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recent Shootings  </P> <P> Pratt and Wheeler also suggested that the new board immediately review two  recent police shootings in the 4900 block of Logan Avenue, in which one man was  shot six times and died and a 14-year-boy was wounded in the back of the head.  </P> <P> "Those are just the kinds of cases the review board should tackle," Pratt said.  </P> <P> Galinson made no commitment to have his board study those shootings. But he did  say "there would be no reason why" the board could not go back and study cases  after it is impaneled July 1.  </P> <P> The new board includes, among its 20 members, five blacks, four Latinos, one  Southeast Asian and one Filipino. There are six women on the board and one  member of the San Diego gay and lesbian community.  </P> <P> Galinson, president and chief executive officer of San Diego National Bank, has  also served as chairman of the San Diego Police-Community Relations Board.  </P> <P> Vice chairman of the board will be Arthur L. Ellis, an associate professor at  the School of Social Work at San Diego State University.  </P> <P> </P> <P> List of Members  </P> <P> The other members are:  </P> <P> The Rev. Robert C. Ard, pastor of Christ Church of San Diego; Dennis E. Borlek,  a financial consultant; the Rev. Ellis Casson, senior pastor of Bethel A. M. E.  Church; Rodolfo L. David, president of the South Bay Filipino-American  Community Assn.; William L. Dick, a retired Marine Corps colonel; Scott D.

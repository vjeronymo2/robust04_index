			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (21): The attractions are still strong - World investors are keen to secure a foothold in the EC WHATEVER the political and economic uncertainties currently enveloping the European Community, it remains the target for huge, inward flows of investment aimed at securing a foothold in the world's largest trading bloc. For while the debate over Europe's future has acquired new and broader dimensions, the EC remains primarily a partnership of trading nations offering those operating within it access to a marketplace of unparallelled potential. The scale of the market, the diversity of its customers, the prospect for continuing expansion and the promise of relative political and economic stability have combined as critical factors in helping to attract investment from around the globe. With fears receding that a protectionist Europe will emerge in the wake of the single market - unless final failure to agree the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade leads to global trade warfare - investors have continued to give high priority to raising their exposure to the European marketplace. In 1991, estimates suggest that total inward investment into the EC countries reached Dollars 65bn, with the US and Japan topping the league of big spenders. For the US, Europe has long been a main target for external investment, though the ever-present threat to its trading relationship with the community was forcefully underlined with its threat to impose penal tariffs on a range of EC products in the event of a Gatt breakdown. For Japan, the political crisis over the future of the Maastricht treaty has created considerable alarm. The country's cumulative interest in the EC already amounts to more than Dollars 55bn. Although that is less than half the level of investment it has in the US, the European market is potentially as large. Hopes for a balanced, mutually beneficial, political and trading relationship between the EC and Japan manifested themselves in the joint Hague declaration of 1991. But the continuing, huge trade imbalance in Japan's favour - Dollars 27bn in 1991 - and the obstacles to doing business in Japan itself ensure that tensions will continue. Japan's approach is further complicated by considerable variations in the strength of its bilateral relations with individual EC states. Some EC officials claim Japan still plays off member states against one another when it comes to inward investment decisions. The UK has apparently maintained its position as the single largest benefactor of the inflow of investment from Japan and from most other non-EC nations. Only the US beats the UK performance as a recipient of overseas funds. The UK continues to account for around one-third of all incoming EC investment. Its share reached a peak of nearly 40 per cent in 1990. Japan has almost twice as much investment in Britain as in other EC countries while the UK's share of US investment within the community amounts to more than the combined totals recorded by Germany, the Netherlands and France. The debate over whether Britain's attractions are a reflection of its innate weaknesses or strengths remains as lively as ever. While ministers portray its success as a ringing endorsement of its open, free market economy, without controls on currency movements or remittance of profits, critics paint a rather different picture. The counter-argument suggests that Britain offers investors a relatively cheap base for operations, offering high workplace skills and a labour market unencumbered by many of the obligations set down in employment laws in force elsewhere in Europe. Britain's isolation in refusing to sign the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty might well reinforce the image, although it may also serve to underline its attractions for some inward investors. France is the next most popular location for inward investment - accounting for something approaching 20 per cent of the total - with Belgium next on 14 per cent. The popularity of Germany as a target for inward funds is also rising, given the comparative strength of its economy and the potential for exploiting business opportunities in former east Germany. Contrary to some expectations, incoming investment in Europe is not overwhelmingly concentrated in high-tech businesses, but continues also at a high level in traditional manufacturing activities. The big question now, however, is whether the flow of corporate investment into Europe has peaked. Figures indicate that the process has, in the short-term at least, slowed down dramatically. The 1991 total for inward investment fell by Dollars 20bn on the previous year. The latest slow-down, almost certain to have been continued in 1992, is, in part, a reflection not only of the impact of recession in Europe but also of weak domestic conditions within the inward investing nations. In addition, many businesses will by now have made their principal investments within the European market and are not maintaining budgets at the same level. Nor does the recent disarray within EC member states over the next phases of European development - combined with the continuing threat that Denmark might yet provoke another crisis of confidence - provide the preferred backdrop for continuing inward investment. There is also the question of how the community can best exploit the continuing, inward flow of investment funds. The EC recognises the economic imbalances which already exist within its boundaries but progress at evening them out has been painfully slow. The Commission itself recently acknowledged that regional differences remained comparable with those which existed 20 years ago. The completion of the single market means that capital and labour will increasingly locate where the physical and economic environment is most attractive. In spite of a doubling of the structural funds, the resources for promoting regional development remain small. The volumes of investment required to help promote broadly-based economic development are enormous but there is scope for encouraging new, inward investment to help redress the existing imbalances. According to the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies at Newcastle University: 'EC regional policy needs to be reformulated in such a way as to ensure that the huge amount of investment flows towards the less favoured regions and avoids the currently wasteful practice of national and regional bodies spending vast amounts competing for inward investment.'  ---------------------------------------        SINGLE MARKET CHECKLIST  --------------------------------------- 1993    No border checks for goods as Jan 1:  the frontier-controlled VAT and         excise system is abolished,         together with 60m tax forms         --------------------------------         Government curbs on air fares         lifted         --------------------------------         Banks free to set up branches         anywhere in the Community         --------------------------------         Exchange controls ended, but         Greece given extension  --------------------------------------- Later:  Single market extended to six         Efta states in second half of         1993         --------------------------------         Passport checks for internal EC         flights should end in December,         but UK, Denmark and Ireland may         resist  --------------------------------------- 1994:   Higher education diplomas         recognised throughout EC         --------------------------------         Open competition for all public         authority contracts, including         utilities  --------------------------------------- 1996:   Stockbrokers get 'single         passport' to operate anywhere         in EC         --------------------------------         Banks able to deal on all EC         stock exchanges except in         Greece, Portugal and Spain  --------------------------------------- 1997:   Single VAT system applied to         traders and consumers, if         member-states agree to a         permanent change         --------------------------------         Airlines can fly any route         within EC  --------------------------------------- 1999:   Duty-free sales end on internal         flights and ferry crossings  --------------------------------------- 2000:   Free internal market in cars -         deadline for removing all         controls on Japanese imports  ---------------------------------------</p>

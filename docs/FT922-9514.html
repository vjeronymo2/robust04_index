			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Kravchuk reassures US over N-weapons treaty PRESIDENT Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine assured the US yesterday that his newly independent republic would implement the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) reducing long-range nuclear weapons. Speaking after talks with President George Bush at the White House, Mr Kravchuk denied reports in Moscow that all Ukraine's tactical - or short-range - nuclear weapons had been removed to Russia to be destroyed. But he promised they would be moved by the agreed July deadline. Mr Kravchuk said the US and Ukraine had worked out a protocol by which Ukraine, which inherited some of the Soviet Union's long-range missiles, would endorse Start. The US wants the former Soviet republics with nuclear weapons - Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan - to commit themselves to the treaty, signed by Washington and Moscow last year but not yet ratified by either side. The confusion over the withdrawal of tactical missiles follows months of shadow boxing between Moscow and Kiev over this and other military issues dividing the two most powerful members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Earlier this year Ukraine held up the transfer of tactical nuclear missiles, arguing that once in Russia it was not clear they would be dismantled. This objection was overcome by an agreement to do it under international supervision. The two republics have also been arguing over dividing the Black Sea naval fleet and control of the Crimean peninsula. The transfer of all tactical weapons would be widely welcomed in the west as a step towards ensuring a stable outcome for part of the vast nuclear arsenal inherited from the Soviet Union. The Crimean parliament yesterday took a big step back from a declaration of independence approved a day earlier and proclaimed the peninsula to be part of Ukraine.</p>

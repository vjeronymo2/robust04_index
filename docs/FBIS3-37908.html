He declared this in his  interview with Interfax in the Kremlin on Thursday.    He believes that a civil war "has been going on in Russia  for  a long time already," thousands of killed, millions of refugees,  more than 15 Mn people with incomes far below the subsistence  minimum are victims of this war.    In connection with this, Zyuganov pointed to the following  historical parallel -- after the civil war of 1917-1920,  national reconciliation in Russia took place only in 1941 when  "the people willy-nilly had to struggle for their survival."  Zyuganov believes that "today the situation is reminiscent of  this historical parallel."    Zyuganov pointed out that the president and government  should  express their point of view regarding the amnesty. "This is not  an issue about which only press secretaries can speak," he noted.    Zyuganov believes that liberation of the participants of the  August 1991 and October 1993 events "will not bring any sharp  destabilization into the nation's political life." "As a matter  of fact, such people as Lukyanov, Kryuchkov, that is, people who  enjoy a great political reputation, and are quite experienced,  have been freed and they are productively working in Russia's  favor," he said.    "We rule out the notion of "revenge" as a political term,"  noted Zyuganov. A State Duma deputy Aleksandr Nevzorov, a  prominent TV journalist, who was nearby, declared: "We have  granted amnesty not only to those who participated in the 1991  and 1993 events on both sides but by means of this act we have  granted amnesty to Yeltsin himself."</p>

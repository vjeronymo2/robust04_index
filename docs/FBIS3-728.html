			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the UNITA President's Office in Huambo </F> on 13 March]    [Text] 1. Our formidible party, the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which represents the  oppressed masses, is celebrating the 28th anniversary of its  creation. On this day we want to pay homage to all our heroes  who have fallen along the way.    On this day we would like to remember with special  tenderness  and profound grief the most illustrious figures in our struggle,  notably former UNITA Vice President Jeremias Chitunda, UNITA  Secretary General Mango Paulo Alicerces, and Engineer Elias  Salupeto Pena.    2. We would like to thank all who have supported our party  for helping resist the most brutal and irrational offensive by  the enemy, together with its foreign allies, in 1992 and 1993.    3. We want to congratulate all renewed resistance forces  that  have kept our glorious flag of the Black Cockerel flying, fanned  by the winds of hope of an Angola that will not surrender.    4. In the wake of intense consultations between the UNITA  Party leadership and the Lusaka-based negotiating team that came  to Huambo, UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi is only  expected to talk to the nation on 16 March.    5. After four hours of talks with Alioune Blondin Beye,  special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, in  the city of Huambo on 12 March, UNITA President Dr. Jonas  Malheiro Savimbi told his colleagues in the UNITA Political  Commission the following words with that particular conviction  he is renowned for, quote, peace and national reconciliation  will be achieved in Lusaka. UNITA has not fought for 28 years  just for the sake of securing some ministries. Our UNITA Party  will be defended against all moves aimed at its destruction.  Our opponent of today is not any stronger than our opponent of  yesterday, unquote.    [Dated] Huambo, 13 March 1994, the year of reflection on our  African identity    [Signed] General Altino Bongo Sapalalo Boque, coordinator  general of the UNITA President's Office</p>

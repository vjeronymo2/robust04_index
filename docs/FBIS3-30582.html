			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Maja Narbutt in Vilnius: "The Devil Is in the </F> Details"]    [Text] Poland and Lithuania have for a long time now been  jointly declaring their desire to sign a treaty. For many  months, in fact on the occasion of every official visit, it has  been stressed that a treaty will be signed before long. Smiling  politicians, posing for pictures together, claim that agreement  has already been reached and that only a few details need to be  discussed. However, as the wise French saying goes, the devil is  in the details. Most probably it was this devil who is to blame  for the fact that the treaty has not yet been signed.    Of course, during the talks in Vilnius between President  Walesa's envoy and [Lithuanian President] Algirdas Brazauskas,  details were not discussed because presidents or their envoys do  not usually discuss such matters. Therefore, whether this  treaty will really be signed will be decided in the fifth round  of formal negotiations.    The laconic statements of politicians on Thursday [3  February] seem to suggest, however, that a major step forward  has been made. Both sides probably agreed on a compromise--  Poland because it agreed that the evaluation of the past will be  included not in a separate declaration but in the treaty's  preamble, and Lithuania because it probably worded this  evaluation of the past in such a way as to make it acceptable  for us. The final statements concerning the evaluation of  history are very important, not only for moral but also for  pragmatic reasons. The evaluation of Polish-Lithuanian  relations during the 20 years after World War I affects the  present regulations concerning ownership issues of Poles living  in the Vilnius region.    It is still an open question whether a compromise reached by  politicians will be generally accepted--first of all in  Lithuania. Andrzej Zakrzewski is not entirely right when he  speaks about "political folklore" in the context of Lithuanian  accusations concerning the "Polish invasion of the Vilnius  region." Such terms are used not only by Lithuanian informal  groupings and organizations, such as the notoriously anti-Polish  Vilnija, but also by political elites. No matter what, we  cannot say that the parliamentary opposition headed by Vytautas  Landsbergis is political folklore. Therefore, it will not be  until another three weeks have passed that we will be able to  say whether a breakthrough has been achieved in relations  between Vilnius and Warsaw.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler in passionate attack against Lamont THE PERSONAL attack by Sir Norman Fowler, Tory chairman, on Mr Norman Lamont yesterday was passionate, finger-jabbing - and encouraged fears among Tory MPs that much of the party hierarchy is in a nervous panic. Sir Norman made no attempt to rise above the Westminster fray caused by the former chancellor's speech, or try to appeal for calm. It was 'frankly ludicrous,' he said. Rarely, if ever, have such vitriolic comments been made by one senior Conservative about another and it was noticeble that Sir Norman was not joined in his abuse by cabinet members. The prime minister's office said merely that Sir Norman was expressing his 'personal view'. One rightwing MP sympathetic to the plight of Mr Lamont said the party chairman's outburst had been 'appalling'. At the backbench 1922 committee meeting last night Sir Norman faced further criticism. Some Tory MPs said the best tactic would have been to be statesmanlike, refusing to be provoked but merely expressing regret and rebutting calming Mr Lamont's points. That was more the approach of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. 'If you sack your chancellor, you know there will be a price to pay,' said Mr Heseltine. 'It always was that way; it always will be.' Mr Howard said the former chancellor's intervention would prove a nine-day wonder. 'I very much regret that Norman Lamont made the speech,' he added. The consensus view among Conservative MPs remained that Mr Lamont had less political weight that Sir Geoffrey Howe, whose resignation speech precipitated Baroness Thatcher's downfall. But Sir Norman said Mr Lamont was a man 'thrashing around for culprits for his own position'. Speaking on GMTV, Sir Norman repeatedly jabbed his finger at the camera, his face flushing pink. 'It was a dud speech,' he said. 'It was a nasty speech. And I do not think many people are going to take much notice of Mr Lamont.' He said it was 'silly' of Mr Lamont to have suggested in his resignation speech that the government was living 36 hours at a time.</p>

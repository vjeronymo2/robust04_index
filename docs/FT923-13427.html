			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Observer: No truck with Napoleon For a bunch of people most prominent recently for their anarchic siege of their nation's infrastructure, it might seem uncharacteristic for the French truckers to be taking their grievances to court. The Federation Nationale des Transporteurs Routiers has asked the Conseil d'Etat, France's top legal authority, to overturn the tough new regulations that were at the heart of the dispute on the grounds that they came into effect after they had already expired. The new law, under which drivers can lose their licences after getting six penalty points, came into effect on July 1. But, having been voted through parliament three years ago, the points system was supposed to come into effect by January 1. Government officials claim that the imposition was postponed for six months because the paperwork was not ready, though some unkind souls have suggested that the delay might have been to avoid adding to the Socialists' unpopularity before the regional elections in March. But the government is standing firm. The word from transport ministry lawyers is that the new law stands, whatever mistakes the state might have made in applying it. For that, the truckers can thank Napoleonic law.</p>

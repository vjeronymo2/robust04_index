			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, February 19 (XINHUA) -- French Defense  Minister Francois Leotard inspected on Saturday [19 February]  the Foch Aircraft-Carrier in the Adriatic one day before the  NATO deadline for air strikes in Bosnia, local media reported.    Leotard expressed his confidence about the developments in  Sarajevo but said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  would not abandon its threat to bomb Serb-controlled weapons  around Sarajevo if they were not withdrawn or handed over to  U.N. control by midnight GMT Sunday.    He told the ship's crew that the uncompromising attitude  must  be maintained and NATO would not change its position until the  last moment.    But he added, "for the moment, things are going in a good  direction."    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also emphasized here  today the tough stand taken by the French Government, which was  the strongest advocate of military actions against Serb weapons  around Sarajevo along with the United States.    The aircraft aboard the carrier are for regular  reconnaissance flights above Bosnia, but the carrier has a more  general mission to help protect and evacuate the 6,000 French  U.N. peace-keeping troops deployed in the former Yugoslavia.    Meanwhile, French diplomats' families left Belgrade today.    A French military source said six Super Etendard aircraft  out  of a total of 18 would take part in the possible NATO attacks.    Leotard is expected to inspect another French squadron on  Sunday at the Italian base in Istrana, near Venice, before  meeting his U.S., British, Italian and Dutch counterparts in  Aviano, northeast Italy, to assess the situation.    After that, he will consult Sunday afternoon in Paris with  Juppe, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and President Francois  Mitterrand.</p>

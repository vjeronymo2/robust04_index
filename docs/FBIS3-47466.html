The two governments have scheduled at least two rounds of  framework negotiations at deputy ministerial level prior to the  summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  President Bill Clinton on February 11.    So far, neither Tokyo nor Washington has raised the  possibility of a ministerial meeting.    But Kantor told a news conference Wednesday that "there will  be probably discussions at the ministerial level" following the  deputies' meetings.    Meanwhile, Japanese officials reported progress on framework  talks on financial services held in Washington Wednesday.    A Japanese official who took part in the negotiations said  he  expects an interim report on financial services to be completed  by the time the first deputies' meeting takes place in  Washington on January 24.    The official warned, however, that conclusion of an interim  report does not mean that the two sides have settled their  differences on substantive issues, since the document contains  primarily a wish list of market access issues that both sides  want to be addressed.    According to the framework accord concluded last July, the  two countries have until July this year to complete negotiations  on financial services.</p>

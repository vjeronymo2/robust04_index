			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Convenient  communications and ample energy supplies have made East China's  Zhejiang Province one of the best choices for discriminating  foreign investors.    Thanks to its booming processing industry, which has enjoyed  priority in development, the province has jumped up during the  15-year reform drive to join the richest in the country.    But it found that further development was being hindered by  poor infrastructures, which had been neglected for a long time.    In the past five years, with a strategic shift to capital  construction, a great number of infrastructural projects have  been completed.    Last year, nearly four billion yuan was poured into the  field, 2.4 times as much as in the previous year and one-fifth  of the province's fixed asset investment.    In the sphere of posts and telecommunications, the province  has completed eight optic-fiber items and opened 13 new air mail  routes.    Telephones installed in cities can be connected with both  domestic lines and international lines. Portable phones and  pagers have even appeared in remote towns.    Transportation often has a great effect on investors'  decisions on where to invest their funds.    With dozens of projects having gone into operation in the  province, more than 70 of Zhejiang's airlines [as received] are  now carrying passengers to 20-odd cities at home and abroad,  such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo.    Cargoes pass through the province's 58 ports, which link the  province with over 50 countries and regions.    Apart from thermal power and hydropower, the province is set  to make full use of other energy sources like wind, tides and  nuclear power.    Qinshan nuclear power station, the first Chinese-designed  and  Chinese-built nuclear facility, is under construction in the  province's Haiyan County.    Infrastructural facilities in the province will see a great  improvement when a batch of projects on the drawing board are  realized.    They include a hydropower station invested with two billion  yuan, a freeway link-up with Shanghai and a railway from Jinhua  city to Wenzhou city within the province.    In addition, the local government has joined hands with  foreign partners to explore crude oil and natural gas in the  east sea off Zhejiang's coast.</p>

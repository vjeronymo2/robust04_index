Commenting on contacts between Iraq and the French companies  last Friday, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news  conference that he would like to have a list of companies from  other countries that have the same contacts with the Iraqi  Government--a reference to the U.S., British, and other Western  companies.    Minister of Oil Safa' Hadi Jawad emphasized in a statement,  published in AL-QADISIYAH last Saturday, that several major  international oil companies have shown a strong desire to sign  contracts with Iraq.    He said negotiations with French oil companies in Paris  resulted in agreements that will be implemented after the siege  is lifted.</p>

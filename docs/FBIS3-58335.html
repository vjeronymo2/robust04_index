			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "Sto": "Continue To Help Russian Germans"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 10 Jan -- Mr. Waffenschmidt (Christian  Democratic Union), the Federal Government's commissioner for  resettlers, has said that the work for the Russian Germans is a  great political and human task, which must also be continued in  the future. At the same time, however, the parliamentary state  secretary said that Russian promises regarding the step-by-step  reestablishment of the Russian Germans' Volga Republic have not  yet been fulfilled. Nevertheless, both the Russian Germans  under their new chairman, Jakob Maurer, as well as the Federal  Government stick to this goal.    On Monday, in Bonn, Waffenschmidt announced that there are  still about 2 million Russian Germans in the CIS states, most of  them in Russia. For legal, humanitarian, and political reasons,  German activities for this ethnic groups continues to be  necessary. The Federal Government's care goes equally to those  who want to stay in Russia and those who move to the FRG. How  many Russian Germans will stay in Russia and in the other CIS  states in the end cannot be predicted reliably at the moment.  This will depend essentially on further developments in Russia  and, in particular, on how the Russian Germans who live there  assess their prospects in life. Waffenschmidt expressed the  assumption that "a considerable German ethnic group will  probably always live in Russia." This ethnic group will be of  great importance for the German-Russian relationship.    The work for the Russian Germans in Russia is "accompanied  by  some difficulties." These difficulties are caused by the  quarrels between the Russian Germans and several interest  groups, the upheavals in Russia, with a difficult distribution  of powers, delays in the transfer of money in Germany because of  irritations about Russian authorities, and also the  disappointment of the Russian Germans about the current help  that their ethnic groups receive in the Russian Federation.  This was also the reason for the resignation of Heinrich Groth,  the most prominent spokesman of the Russian Germans, in December  1993. Waffenschmidt expressly stated that the direct personal  support by President Yeltsin for the formation of the "German  National Rayons" in western Siberia is a success.    Waffenschmidt was critical about the development of the  Volga  Republic. Here, the Russian promises have not been kept so far,  because sympathetic feelings for Russian Germans in the area  differ widely. However, the development in the focal area of  "Sovkhoz 23," the settlement measure of Stepnoye, and the church  center in Marx are exemplary.</p>

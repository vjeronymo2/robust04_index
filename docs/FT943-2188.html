			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Veba quickens pace on telecoms Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, aims to build its fledgling telecommunications subsidiary into an international operation with sales of DM8bn a year by 2003, according to Mr Ulrich Hartmann, group chairman. Further steps announced yesterday included the purchase of a 10 per cent stake in the Iridium satellite communications group and agreement on a joint venture with Deutsche Bahn, the German railway. The group is also close to concluding an agreement on selling a stake in its Vebacom telecoms subsidiary, set up in March this year, to an international partner, Mr Hartmann revealed in a speech in Dusseldorf last night. The group aimed to invest DM6bn by 2003, building up telecommunications into a business with a 10 per cent share of the German market, and creating 10,000 new jobs in the process. In a flurry of developments, Veba announced it was to invest Dollars 140m in a 10 per cent stake in Iridium, and signed an agreement in principle with Deutsche Bahn, which will give it access to the signalling and track network. Iridium, whose other key shareholders include Raytheon, Lockheed and Sprint of the US, plans to launch a network of 66 low-orbiting satellites in 1996 which will provide global wireless communications services. Veba's stake will give it exclusive rights to run the service in northern and western Europe. Mr Hartmann said the aim was to offer new-generation mobile telephone services from 1998, allowing users to call worldwide using the same handset and number. The service to the remainder of the continent will be run by Stet, the Italian group. According to Mr Hartmann, Vebacom had applied for a licence from the post ministry to run a ground-based network in co-operation with Deutsche Bahn, based in Leipzig, to supply a limited customer base with high-performance services. The group's telecommunications business, based on the internal network of its Preussen Elektra power generation and distribution division, is in the early stages of development, but growing quickly. Vebacom already holds a 28.25 per cent stake in E-Plus, Germany's latest portable telecommunications network, and has recently forged links with private concerns in France and Switzerland. Mr Hartmann said he expected Vebacom to start showing profits by 1999. While the link with Deutsche Bahn appeared to be a pre-emptive strike against other German corporations developing telecommunications divisions, and could face strong political and industrial opposition, the revelation of negotiations with several potential partners, signalled a major step forward. Mr Hartmann said he expected to reach agreement with a suitable partner before the end of the year. 'I would not go into the business without a strategic partnership,' he said.</p>

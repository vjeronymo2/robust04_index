			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Filofax have been remarkably consistent in buying stock and chief executive Robin Field is the most recent, acquiring 13,500 shares at 203p. This concentrated level of purchasing started at the beginning of May 1992 when the shares were 31p. Timothy Barker, the vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, has sold 13,000 shares at 520p following the company's announcement of interim results on August 8. He still holds more than 19,000. Dealings by board members at Forward Technology, the audio and video cassette company, give a mixed impression. Early in the week, Paul Jeffries, one of the executive directors, bought 60,000 shares at 60p, increasing his holding by more than 10 per cent. Just two days later, the company announced that Gordon Allen, the non-executive president, had sold 750,000 at 23p, even though they were trading around the 49p mark. The reason was that 500,000 shares were bought from him because of a call option, while the others were sold at a discount. Sanderson Electronics, a company in the support services sector, supplies computer software and hardware. Chairman Paul Thompson has sold 3m shares, worth more than Pounds 2.5m - the largest transaction of the week. But he still holds more than 27 per cent of the company.

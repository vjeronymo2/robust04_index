			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Freedom's radio days are not yet over We will never know whether the entire explanation for the collapse of communism lies in its own internal grotesqueries, or whether some assistance, or at least a gentle nudge, was given by broadcasts from the west. Was it the food and consumer goods shortages alone, or were the words transmitted across the iron curtain by the BBC World Service, the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty really effective? There can be no precise answer, but most people believe that the wireless facilitated the liberation of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Britain's Mr David Howell, once energy and then transport secretary under Mrs Thatcher and latterly chairman of the parliamentary select committee on foreign affairs, argued some years ago that the spread of world communications would do irreparable damage to totalitarian regimes. In this he predated Mr Francis Fukuyama, whose celebrated book, The End of History and the Last Man, suggests that the ideological struggle has come to an end - that, as the author would put it, liberal democracy remains the only coherent political aspiration that spans different regions and cultures across the globe. On a bad day, if you have your guard down, it is not difficult to persuade yourself to fall for this hokum. One speaker at the recent conference of the International Press Institute described how Japanese technicians are working on 'down-sizing' satellite TV receiver dishes. They are currently around 600mm wide, so you must nail them to an outside wall. The Japanese aim is a diameter of 50mm by the end of the century. Then tiny clandestine TVs could enhance the further spread of western ideas; eventually everyone would live in a pluralist democracy and shop at a Safeway. It is a comfortable materialistic fantasy, but the truth is that proponents of liberal democracy can never rest. The battle is not over. I was reminded of this in Budapest last week. The Hungarian prime minister, Dr Jozsef Antall, had attempted to sack the heads of the state radio and television administrations. The state president, an unassuming intellectual called Arpad Goncz, refused to sign the dismissal documents. Mr John Major met both of them yesterday; the hope must be that if the subject came up he reinforced the view of the president that democracy would be jeopardised by the dismissals. What Hungary needed, we were told by Mr Goncz when I was there, was 'BBC standards'. Anecdotes of this kind are capped dozens of times over in two volumes published by Broadside Books, London, yesterday to mark the 60th anniversary of the BBC World Service. The first, A World in Your Ear, by John Tusa, managing director of the World Service, is a happy collection of letters, essays and diary extracts; the second, A Skyful of Freedom, by Andrew Walker, is an illustrated popular history. Both are inevitably flavoured with corporate self-congratulation, but this is excusable. The World Service has much to congratulate itself about. As one example, Mr Tusa reprints a letter from Romanian Moldavia, received in February 1990: 'I have persistently listened to your broadcasts, many times hidden under a blanket in my monastic cell . . . I am convinced you made an important contribution to what we Romanians are experiencing today.' Another, recalled by Mr Walker, is the tale of how news from Mr Boris Yeltsin's revolutionary 'white house' during the attempted coup of 1991 was relayed through the BBC Moscow office. Listening in during his confinement was Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. The BBC's reports, he said afterwards, had been the most reliable; to his way of thinking they had confirmed that the whole action was doomed to failure. The BBC's reputation for objectivity has been hard-earned. Its power derives from its refusal to propagandise. There is no need to be carried away by this. I broadcast regularly on the overseas service during the 1960s and, while I was never censored or instructed, the producers were often ready with a 'could you perhaps put that another way?' - always, of course, in the interest of balance. Bush House, headquarters of the service, is not inhabited by saints or political eunuchs. The more hard-edged American services lack the BBC's brand name, but they have been powerful in their own way. The Voice of America is forever condemned to be regarded as a weapon of the Cold War. It was founded in 1942, as a counter to Nazi propaganda; it turned to its anti-red crusade later, as an arm of the US Information Agency. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty began as CIA operations, but for many years they have tried to win reputations for presenting the truth. Their journalists are certainly less politically tainted than some of those who work on Britain's popular papers. Like the BBC, Radio Liberty had its own correspondents inside Mr Yeltsin's white house; its broadcasts in 12 Soviet languages were used by Mr Yeltsin as a means of circumventing the official media during the coup. Such investments have paid dividends. Most ex-communist countries now permit the BBC and the American voices to relay news directly to their domestic listeners. Their news-gatherers operate locally. You might think that since the Cold War is over there is no reason for British and American taxpayers to continue to finance such outfits. Not so. For what we get the money is peanuts, but that is beside the point. There are two important jobs yet to do. The first is to protect the governments of the newly liberated countries from succumbing to the temptation to bully their broadcasters, just as the communists did. The spread of 'BBC standards' across eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union has yet to be achieved. It is hard to emerge from 40 years of darkness with an understanding that democracy means learning to live with the accusations of your political opponents. The second job for the freedom broadcasters is to work in those vast areas of the globe that have not yet behaved according to the suppositions of Mr Fukuyama. The people of the Middle East, much of Africa and all of China are in need of objective information about what is happening inside their countries. A US federal commission has been considering the establishment of a 'Radio Free Asia'; it is said that President Bush is opposed, on the ground that it would upset the government of China. This is perverse. The purpose of factual broadcasts in Chinese, by Chinese speakers, should be to upset the government of China. I hope the BBC maintains its traditions in its daily 45 minutes of Cantonese and 3 1/2 hours of Mandarin, broadcast from Hong Kong. Someone has to give the Beijing regime a nudge.</p>

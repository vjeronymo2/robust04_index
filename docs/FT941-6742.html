			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Inquiry into hedge fund risks: Central banks investigate exposure after bond market slide Leading central banks are investigating the risks to the world's financial system posed by highly geared US hedge funds - aggressively managed pools of private money - in the wake of recent turbulence in European bond markets. The Bank of England is holding talks with UK clearing and merchant banks and has sent them a questionnaire seeking a clearer picture of the risks involved and the extent of the banks' exposure to hedge funds. The Federal Reserve is carrying out a similar exercise in the US. A spokesman for the central bank said it had not launched a formal study, but was seeking information about the exposure of large US banks to hedge funds 'through informal means'. Mr Otmar Issing, chief economist of the Bundesbank, said any new regulation of hedge funds must be considered slowly and carefully because new guidelines inevitably led to attempts to circumvent the rules, which must be anticipated. Heavy selling by US hedge funds has been a leading factor behind the steep decline in European government bond markets in the past fortnight. That has led to concern that some of the smaller funds might be in financial difficulty. Some hedge and futures funds lost as much as 25 per cent of their value in February, according to preliminary figures from Tass Management, a fund data base that monitors the sector. The Bank of England's main concern is over the exposure of UK clearing and merchant banks. It wants to know whether banks' dealings with the hedge funds are backed by adequate collateral. The Bank is concerned in particular about financing arrangements. Hedge funds have been able to obtain funding from many banks at no margin, effectively borrowing Dollars 100 against the security of Dollars 100 worth of bonds. The Bank of England considers that to be very risky, given the collapse in bond prices. If a hedge fund were to fail, a lender might be left holding bonds worth much less than the money lent. In its questionnaire, the Bank of England asks banks: What kind of dealings they have with hedge funds and in which areas. How much information is provided by dealers acting on behalf of several funds about how much each fund is buying or selling. Do banks know the names of all funds to which they are exposed and their level of gearing? How they view the smaller funds that might be considered one-person operations when it comes to systems controls and back office capability. What the characteristics of hedge funds are and whether they can be grouped together as an industry. On Thursday, when UK government bond prices fell by almost 3 points, the Bank stabilised the market with gilt purchases of less than Pounds 100m. It feared that if dealers found they were unable to sell less-liquid gilts, they might be forced to mark down their prices. That in turn, it was feared, might push the gilt market through 'support' levels, triggering further selling.

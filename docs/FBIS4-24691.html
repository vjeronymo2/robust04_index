			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sun Zhiwu (1327 1807 2976): "Issues on the </F> Shareholding Transformation of State-Owned Enterprises and  Measures To Address Them"]    [Text] The shareholding system is a form of enterprises'  organization, which suits the needs of the socialist market  economy and is effective in separating ownership from managerial  power and pushing enterprises to the market. However, we have  to probe and address the specific issues that still exist on how  to make the shareholding transformation truly invigorate  enterprises and how to operate state-owned property more  effectively.    1. The issue on rationalizing the purposes and the  behaviors.  Motives are varied for people to feel enthusiastic for the  shareholding transformation of enterprises. Individuals who buy  stocks wish to become rich. Some enterprises conduct the  shareholding transformation either for the purpose of raising  funds to develop themselves and repay debts or for winning  preferential policies, and others do so as they are ordered.  Government departments chiefly want to promote reform or to  show off their reform achievements. The objective existence of  the various purposes of the shareholding transformation should  be permitted, but effective policy and organizational measures  should be drawn up to standardize the behaviors of the various  sectors so that their purposes and behaviors will become  rational and the healthy development of the shareholding  transformation can be guaranteed.    This writer holds that the shareholding transformation of  state-owned enterprises is, in essence, a reform of the  organizational system of the ownership of state-owned assets and  a change in the measures for operating the ownership of  state-owned assets. The purpose of the reform, from the  microeconomic viewpoints, is to suit the needs in developing the  market economy and, through the change in the organizational  form of state-owned assets, to rationalize enterprises' property  right relations, determine the legal person status of  enterprises, strengthen enterprises' internal mechanism of  restraint, and manage the value of state-owned assets. From  macroeconomic viewpoints, the purpose is to effectively develop  the leading role of state economies, adjust the operating scope  and structure of state-owned assets, establish a perfect  monetary market system, and improve the mechanism for the  optimal distribution of state-owned assets. When the purposes  of the shareholding transformation of state-owned enterprises  are clarified, we should, starting from the experimenting period  of the reform, attach great importance to the organic  combination of reform with development and with management and  strengthen the specialized functions of the departments in  charge of the ownership of state-owned assets and the  macro-control and guiding role of the departments in charge of  overall economic functions and the departments in charge of  various trades, so that the shareholding transformation will  truly facilitate the change of enterprises' operating mechanism  and the adjustment of the industrial structure.    2. The issue on defining property rights and appraising  assets. Unclear enterprise property ownership is a common and  major difficulty and obstacle to the current shareholding  transformation. Under the traditional planned economy system,  enterprises' property right relations and their administrative  relations were identical, but the property ownership relations  of many enterprises have become very complicated due to the  several changes in the managerial system. In some enterprises,  ownership has changed several times due to historical reasons.  Their assets were first invested by collectives and then  invested by local government departments. This plus their later  implementation of the managerial system similar to local  state-owned enterprises has resulted in the very unclear  original property right relations and the great change in the  property right owners, making it very complicated to define the  property right. In addition, unified and clear policy  regulations are lacking on the ownership of the property  resulting from tax reduction and exemption and the definition of  central and local ownership of state-owned property.    This writer holds that the definition of property right is  a kind of policy work concerning not only the protection of the  rights and interests of the ownership of state-owned property  but also the appraisal of relevant historical policies. It  requires that the state study and formulate unified policies.    When enterprises' property right is clarified, appraisals of  assets are needed, which involve the standards for the  appraisals and the measures for converting assets into shares.  As far as specific work is concerned, there are two measures.  One is converting assets into shares according to the original  book value and using the income from selling the shares at  higher prices to make up for the losses resulting from the  appreciation of the assets after the appraisals. The other is  converting the assets into shares according to their appraised  value. This writer holds that the former is not a proper  measure. First, the current shareholding transformation of  state-owned enterprises is conducted on the basis of the newly  established limited liability stock companies or limited  liability companies. It is not meant to increase the funds and  expand the original state-owned stock companies. Therefore, the  transformation, in fact, consists of two stages: 1) making  inventory of the original assets or some assets of enterprises  and determining the current prices of the assets and 2)  establishing new shareholding enterprises and canceling the  original legal person status of enterprises. By then, the  original assets of enterprises, as the property of the founders  of the new enterprises, are invested in the new enterprises  along with the property of other shareholders to become the  capital of the new enterprises. The combination of the  appraisals of enterprises' original assets with the fund raising  of new enterprises embodies the principle of same profits for  same shares, and assets should be converted into shares  according to the current prices only. Second, correct  appraisals of assets and converting them into shares constitute  the key to safeguarding the proper rights and interests of the  various beneficiaries. If the original state-owned assets of  enterprises are converted into shares according to the book  value and the difference between the book value and the  appraised value is made up for with the income from selling the  shares at higher prices, the rights and interests of state-owned  shareholders and other shareholders, no doubt, will be damaged.    3. The issue on converting the right to the use of  state-owned land into shares. Many enterprises, especially  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, take up large  areas of land, and some of them are even located in the  high-priced "golden" sections of cities. If all the land use  right is converted into shares, the value of the assets of these  enterprises will be doubled and redoubled, and the profit rate  of the assets will definitely decline, which is detrimental for  shareholding enterprises to attract investment from society when  they issue shares. In doing their specific work, all localities  have adopted fairly flexible ways to handle this issue. This  writer holds that the essence of this issue is the optimization  of the efficiency in operating the two types of state-owned  assets (the original assets of state-owned enterprises and the  right to the use of state-owned land). We should correctly  distinguish the state-owned land used as assets and that used as  resources and include the right to the use of the state-owned  land that is converted into shares in the management of  state-owned assets. Meanwhile, to improve the efficiency in  using and operating state-owned land, the right to the use of  state-owned land should be managed like enterprises, and  companies specializing in the management of assets should be  established to change the administrative management of assets.    An enterprise should consider two factors to determine  whether to convert the land use right into shares. On the one  hand, the advantage in converting land use right into shares is  the increase in the state-owned capital of the enterprises  transformed in line with the shareholding system and the  reduction of cost resulting from the exemption of the new  shareholding enterprises from paying rent for the land. The  disadvantage is the decline of the profit rate of enterprise  assets during the transformation, which makes the shares less  attractive. On the other hand, when the land use right is not  converted into shares, the shares of the enterprises become more  attractive, but state-owned funds will decrease because the  operation cost of the transformed new enterprises will increase  after they pay rents for the land. Under such circumstances,  initiators of the new shareholding enterprises will have to  weigh the cost of fund raising upon establishment and the later  cost of operation; and managers of the right to the use of  state-owned land will have to weigh the collection of dividends  and the collection of rents.    4. The issue on the shareholding transformation of some  assets of enterprises. The shareholding transformation of  state-owned enterprises can be conducted in two ways. One is  transforming all the assets of the enterprises, which leads to  the cancellation of the legal person status of the enterprises.  The other is transforming some assets of enterprises and, while  retaining the legal person status of the enterprises,  establishing new shareholding enterprises whose shares are also  held by the original legal persons. Due to numerous reasons,  some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have  difficulty in transforming all their assets for the time being.  They tend to convert some of their assets (certain branch  plants or workshops) into shares. This writer holds that both  ways are feasible, but attention should be given to the  following when doing specific work. First, both ways of  transformation are restructuring of the ownership of state-owned  assets, on which the ultimate decisions should be made by the  owners of the assets of the enterprises, namely the government,  and which should be included in the local plans for the  operating scope, organization, and structural adjustment of  state-owned assets and never be decided by enterprises  themselves just because they transform some of their assets.  Second, the shareholding transformation of some assets should  be conducted in such a way that they hold the legal person  status. In other words, when transformed in line with the  shareholding system, these parts of the assets are separated  from and become subcompanies of the original enterprises and  hold the civil responsibilities independently with their own  property. Third, attention should be given to the difference  between transformation of all the assets and transformation of  some parts of the assets. Generally speaking, the former is the  lateral reform of the organizational system of the property  right of state-owned enterprises, which, in general, leads to a  change in the enterprises from ones exclusively funded by the  state into shareholding ones with mixed ownership. The latter  is the vertical reform of the organization of the property right  of state-owned enterprises, which leads to a dual ownership of  state-owned assets, splitting the enterprise assets directly  owned by the state formerly into two parts, with one directly  owned by the state and the other indirectly owned by the state.  Due to the different structure of property right, the  government will adopt different ways to manage their property  right.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Savoy appointment postponed FORTE and Savoy yesterday postponed a decision on who should take over the chairmanship of the Savoy group when Sir Anthony Tuke retires in May next year. The Savoy board, which met yesterday, is believed to have discussed the issue briefly, but without reaching any conclusion. Forte is thought to be opposed to either Mr Giles Shepard, Savoy's managing director, or Mr John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner at Cazenove, becoming chairman. Forte is believed to favour Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of Smith New Court. Both sides would like to see Mr Willi Bauer, a former Savoy general manager, becoming chief executive of the group. Forte owns a majority of Savoy shares and a minority of the voting shares. Neither party would comment on the meeting.</p>

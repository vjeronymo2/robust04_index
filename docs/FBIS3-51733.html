Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, age 51, a Christian Democrat, was  elected as head of the Chilean Republic on 11 December 1993, and  will take office on 11 March. He is a civil engineer, and has  worked for 20 years in private companies. Frei is linked to  Italy through his study and work experience, having lived in  Milan between 1967 and 1969. He worked on the construction of  the "Autostrada dei Fiori" freeway and then at ENI [National  Hydrocarbons Corporation] under a study grant. Frei represents,  compared with outgoing President Aylwin, a change of generation  in politics in Chile, a country which has returned to democracy,  but over which the shadow of former dictator Pinochet still  hangs.    [Bussi] President Frei, what are the main points of your  government plan to broaden and strengthen Chilean democracy?    [Frei] In recent years Chile has successfully laid the  foundations for making growth and economic development  compatible with a framework of justice and equity. It is said  that developing countries first of all have to put their own  economies in order and then concern themselves with their poor  and marginalized populations. Thanks to the efforts that we  have made in recent years, it is now possible to combat  marginalization and extreme poverty without prejudicing economic  development. One priority of my program is eliminating the  poverty which today affects some 10 percent of the population.  I believe that the country is in a position to do this.    This means building a democracy on the bases of  participation  and solidarity, with particular emphasis on areas such as  education, health, housing, and the environment. It also  requires modernizing the state, and transferring power  progressively to civilian society, a process which is identified  with decentralization and regionalization. I would also like to  ensure the integration of young people and women, offering them  greater opportunities. For the first time, Chile has three  women in government.    [Bussi] How can one reconcile the private capitalism which  has prevailed until now and the economics of solidarity which  you are proposing?    [Frei] In Chile, more than 75 percent of investment and  production is carried out by the private sector. We have  clearly stated that it is not the state's role to occupy the  productive sector. The state's job, rather, is to concern  itself with the good of the country. What is of concern to us  is that public enterprises be efficient and productive.  Obviously, unproductive companies will be privatized.    [Bussi] President Frei, why ever did you appoint the  Socialist German Correa to the head of a key ministry like that  of the interior?    [Frei] Chile's Government is a political coalition. It is  the broadest alliance ever in our political history. It is this  coalition which has allowed us to have a durable government,  able to guarantee continuity to economic players. In this team  there are the more important parties like the Socialist Party  (PS), the Party for Democracy (PPD), the Christian Democratic  Party (PDC) -- the main party -- and the Radical Party (PR), and  smaller parties like the Social Democratic Party (PSD), the  Center Alliance Party (PAC), and the Democratic Party of the  Left (PDS).    In a presidential system like ours, appointments are made by  the president of the Republic, and I have always stated,  starting in the electoral campaign, which selection criteria I  would use for the appointments within my power: criteria of  effectiveness and of respecting the political balances which the  coalition represents, as is done in every democracy the world  over. The Socialist Party merited a key post and German Correa  offered all the human and professional qualities to make a good  success of the job.    [Bussi] Recently, the discovery of cases of corruption in  the  military government has created a scandal. Public companies  were sold to members of government at prices which can today be  said to be favorable. Court proceedings are still under way.  What guarantees do you believe you can give in the case of new  privatizations?    [Frei] In Chile there is a tradition of probity in the  public service. This is an historical constant and I insisted  greatly in the election campaign on the fact that I wanted to  give an important ethical-moral content to the management of the  public administration. All the appointments which I will make  and which I have made take this commitment into consideration.  If a company is in future to be privatized, this will be done  with total transparency, so that the country knows how things  are going.    [Bussi] There are still some accounts to be settled with the  past. What is the situation of the political prisoners whom you  will find when you take up the presidency of the Republic?    [Frei] At the time President Aylwin took office, there were  400 to 500 political detainees. Today no more than 20. For me  the problem is obviously much simpler. And I will face it.    [Bussi] The problem of internal security appears to be  taking  an increasingly important central place in political debate? Is  a reform of the police forces planned?    [Frei] Chile's police is made up of the "Carabineros" and  the  "Investigaciones," which report to the minister of defense. I  am considering changing this situation, and the extent to which  responsibility for public order can be attributed to the  Ministry of the Interior and he be given authority to govern the  police forces. This residue of our past military regime ought  also to disappear.    [Bussi] During the dictatorship, many Chileans went into  exile. Are you thinking of giving incentives for the return of  those who left for political or economic reasons and to  reintegrate them into the workforce?    [Frei] During President Aylwin's government various laws,  such as the "Return Law," were passed with a view to  reintegrating persons abroad, along with a series of legislative  provisions and facilities for their reintegration. But the true  disaster for so many Chilean citizens who escaped abroad is  economic growth, the development of a solid democratic system,  and new jobs.</p>

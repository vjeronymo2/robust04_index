			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad 'Ubaydat, carried within the "With the </F> Events" program]    [Text] Three Fatah activists in the governorate of Hebron  tendered their resignations yesterday due to the absence of a  democratic policy within the PLO institutions. This was stated  by Husayn al-Nazir, member of the Fatah Committee in the  governorate of Hebron, who resigned yesterday.    [Begin al-Nazir recording] In fact, there are several  reasons for the resignation. These reasons have accumulated due  to the bad or deteriorating internal situation in the Fatah  institutions in the past few months.    Practically, the absence of a democratic policy in the Fatah  institutions has negatively reflected on the situation in the  occupied territories, particularly the southern region. This  was one of the reasons for the resignation. In addition, there  are personalities from outside Fatah. These are bad  personalities who hold sensitive posts inside Fatah. We  recently learned about the presence of personalities who carried  letters entrusting them with forming a security apparatus. This  apparatus is one of the most serious Fatah organs, so entrusting  a bad personality with running this apparatus will practically  destroy Fatah's internal structure in our positions. [end  recording]    These resignations came after some Fatah activists in the  territories also tendered their resignations for the same  reason. These collective resignations express the existence of a  crisis inside the PLO. Al-Nazir added:    [Begin al-Nazir recording] In our opinion, our historic  leadership, led by brother leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat],  whom we respect very much, is surrounded by a group of  personalities who do not brief him on the true reports sent from  the territories. These are the reasons for the rise of  traditional personalities who are outside the organization and  who are even away from the suffering of the strugglers. These  strugglers were always in the confrontation lines.    We demand our leadership to return to the PLO Executive  Committee, the Fatah Central Committee, the Fatah Revolutionary  Council, and the Fatah General Congress, so the future internal  arrangements and reforms may, in one way or another, lead to the  circumvention of this crisis, and, consequently, decisions will  be somewhat sound ones. We would agree if 70 percent of the  stands were sound ones. However, we will not agree if only 10  percent of stands are sound ones.    In the past, we frequently tried to hold discussions with  our  leadership to tackle this situation. However, we were surprised  that it ignored us or did not pay attention to our demands. We  were also surprised by the appointment of political  personalities who are outside the organization and who are more  preoccupied with the political situation. This has prevented  these personalities from coordinating with the territories'  leadership and the leadership abroad.    We have resigned from our posts and not from our membership  or our citizenship. We are citizens and [Fatah] members.  However, we refuse to be appointed in sensitive posts under  these difficult historical circumstances, whose developments we  are far away from. We demand our leadership prepare a clear  political program for the new phase. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (9): Hopes punctured - Northern Ireland / Recession arrived this year THE recession in commercial property caught up with Northern Ireland this year. Falling rents and poor demand from tenants punctured hopes that the Belfast property market would largely escape the downturn. So far, the decline is less dramatic than on much of the mainland. Top office rents have dropped from around Pounds 9.50 to Pounds 7-Pounds 9 per sq ft. The market's problems are largely focused on second-hand stock, of which there is 592,893 sq ft on the market, compared with 115,000 sq ft of new space. The market's decline is only partially due to the recession. The Belfast office market is dominated by the public sector, which accounted for 80 per cent of take-up over the past 15 months. Back office jobs have been relocated from the mainland and government departments have been moved into new premises from Stormont, the old parliament outside the city. But public sector demand for new office space in Belfast is thought to wane, particularly with mounting constraints on public spending. Even so, the poor quality of much of Belfast's office stock points towards an eventual pick-up in demand for more development. 'We believe that developers who commence new projects will be rewarded with rents significantly above current levels,' says Lambert Smith Hampton, chartered surveyors. New development is centred on derelict land by the river bank, which is being developed by the Laganside Corporation with funds from the Department of Environment of Northern Ireland. The corporation's first office development is nearing completion but future phases are expected to proceed slowly. Confidence in Belfast property is at a low ebb, after a strong performance during the 1980s. The average annual return between 1980 and 1991 was 16.5 per cent, compared with a UK average of 9.7 per cent, according to Investment Property Databank, a research body. Retail landlords did particularly well, with returns of nearly 20 per cent in the 1980s, eight percentage points above the average for the UK. Rents were boosted by a resurgence in retailing as UK retailers, previously under-represented, moved into the province. 'Taking a seven- to 10-year view I have no doubt that Northern Ireland will outperform the rest of the UK because there is less quality property,' says Mr Tony O'Connor of Lambert Smith Hampton. 'But we are going to be in a difficult period for the next 12 months.'</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Adidas slips to DM44m at pre-tax level PRE-TAX profits at Adidas, the German sports shoe company, fell sharply last year, reflecting difficult conditions in the sportswear market - in particular stiff competition from Reebok and Nike - as well as the costs of continued restructuring. The group is controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, who last month was appointed Minister of Urban Affairs in the French government. Group pre-tax profits dropped from DM90m (Dollars 56.6m) to DM44m last year. Turnover was up just DM11m to DM3.53bn. Plans to sell off brands such as Pony, Arena and Le Coq Sportif had 'neared full completion' in 1991, Adidas said, and further consolidation measures would be taken.</p>

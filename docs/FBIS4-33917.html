			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 8 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The U.S.  Government's influence over other arms manufacturing nations is  making it difficult for Guatemala to equip the National Police  properly, government sources reported today.    Deputy Government Minister Luis Augusto Merida told ACAN-EFE  it is difficult for the government to obtain arms following the  U.S. State Department's decision to ban the sale of arms to  Guatemala because of the human rights violations in the country.  He said, "we cannot deny the U.S. Government's influence over  the rest of the world," because several countries, including  Belgium and Germany, which had offered to equip the National  Police, later changed their minds and refused. Germany also has  endorsed the travel warning the U.S. State Department issued  against visiting Guatemala because of attacks on foreigners.    President de Leon Carpio had earlier complained about  certain  governments, which he did not identify, for demanding that  Guatemala keep crime in check while refusing to sell arms to  civilian security forces because of human rights violations.    Merida said that, for the time being, the government is  negotiating with Israeli manufacturers who can "provide a  minimum of equipment." Merida expects a counteroffer to a  proposal presented last week. The government intends to spend  approximately 20 million quetzals (some $3.48 million) for  semi-automatic weapons and another 15 million quetzals (some  $2.61 million) for vehicles for the National Police.    Merida, a former head of the Army's intelligence section,  said: "We need semi-automatic, carbine-type rifles. We just  cannot go on using six-shot revolvers" while criminals are  better equipped. He estimates each rifle will cost $1,000. The  expense will be higher than anticipated, however, because "it is  more expensive to import arms from Israel than from the United  States."    Merida said the State Department's ban is heeded by U.S.  suppliers who fill orders from local Guatemalan dealers, who in  turn sell the arms to civilians, not the Army. "Some local  stores have stopped selling ammunition to the military," who  purchased it for their personal arms, the source said. He added  that he cannot buy arms for the police through local  corporations because the owners refuse to deal with the Army,  "either out of fear of losing their visas or their import  permits."    The National Police, founded 113 years ago with a regulation  enacted in 1955, has been in the sights of the international  community, which has reported human rights violations.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: French banks lift bad debt provision CREDIT Agricole and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), France's two largest banks, yesterday reported sharp increases in provisions for bad debts last year. Credit Agricole, the co-operative farmers' bank which leads the French industry, yesterday unveiled a 3.9 per cent rise in annual net profits to FFr4.7bn (Dollars 839m) after a 25 per cent rise in provisions to FFr11.9bn. Net profits at state-owned BNP, by contrast, plunged. They more than halved to FFr1.6bn, after a 6.3 per cent rise in provisions to FFr7bn, qualified by Mr Rene Thomas, the chairman, as a 'disappointing' result. BNP's operating profits fell by 14 per cent from FFr11.2bn in 1989 to FFr9.6bn last year, mainly dragged down by the mainstream French banking activities, while overseas operations held their earnings steady, said the group. It attributed the drop to a movement of customers' savings away from bank deposits towards investment funds, higher bad debts for both private and corporate borrowers and interest payment delays on sovereign loans. Lending rose by 14.4 per cent, while deposits and funds under management rose by 15.4 per cent to FFr556bn. A strike at the start of the year cost BNP FFr600m, on top of which came the FFr1bn cost of winding up the Banque Internationale de l'Afrique Occidentale, which BNP placed in liquidation last June. BNP also had to make a FFr773m sovereign risk provision on the loan book of Banque Arabe et Internationale d'Investissement, (BAII) after taking control of BAII last May. However, shareholders' funds increased sharply during the year, by FFr12.5bn to FFr41.3bn, thanks to capital increases and acquisitions of shareholdings in Pechiney, the state controlled aluminium group and UAP, the state insurer. Shareholders' funds at Credit Agricole rose by 13.8 per cent to FFr77.7bn, making it the world's third largest bank. Operating profits rose at the same time by 4.1 per cent, to FFr17.9bn from FFr17.2bn, proof of vitality in a difficult market, maintained Mr Philippe Jaffre, managing director of Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole, the bank's central organisation. Total loans outstanding rose by 12 per cent to FFr937bn from FFr837bn. The bank made FFr174bn of new loans last year, of which FFr32.4bn went to farmers, FFr81.9bn for house purchases and FFr17.4bn to corporate customers. Deposits, meanwhile, rose by 14.6 per cent to FFr885bn, from FFr772bn, reflecting a 1.5 percentage point increase in the bank's share of the market for new savings in France, to 13.5 per cent.</p>

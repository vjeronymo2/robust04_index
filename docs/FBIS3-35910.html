He told INTERFAX that Armenia's armed forces must be removed  from Azerbaijani territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh.  According to foreign sources, 8,000 Armenian citizens fight on  the side of the so-called Karabakh forces, he said.    "Azerbaijan's position is absolutely clear: We must liberate  our territories," he said. He also pointed out that Baku would  like to do so without losses on either side. He believes that  this is quite possible given Armenia's goodwill and Russia's  determination.    Assessing the possibility of locating Russian peace-keeping  forces in the zone of the Karabakh conflict, he said that these  forces might be located on the Azerbaijani-Armenian border and  between the conflicting parties after Armenia removes its forces  from the occupied territory. He noted, however, that  peace-keeping forces may be sent to a country only on the  latter's request.    Speaking about the possibility of holding talks in Moscow  between the Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents with the Russian  president's mediation, Guluzade said that a proper political  basis must be created for such talks. "If Russia acts as a  mediator, it must find a common denominator for settlement," he  said.</p>

As during the first round of talks, our delegation was led  by  Batoni Jaba Ioseliani. He presented our proposals concerning  what questions had to discussed and the views of the Georgian  delegation as to how these questions should be resolved. On the  instructions of the head of state, attention was focused on the  principal question of the return of refugees to their places of  residence.    One of the main questions (?discussed) during the  negotiations yesterday was the (?return) of refugees. We  listened to specific proposals presented by the UN High  Commission, and the Russian side also had specific proposals.  So, there were serious talks yesterday regarding this question.    We listened to information presented by a group of experts.  They agreed that, today, fundamental documents regarding these  questions would be prepared and there would also be talks  regarding individual programs relating to these individual  questions.</p>

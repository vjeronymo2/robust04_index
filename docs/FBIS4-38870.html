			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 0800 GMT on 2 June, in its  "Novosti" newscast, carries a two-minute report by an  unidentified correspondent that the authorities in the Chechen  capital, Groznyy, are "earnestly" preparing for the coming talks  with Moscow. The correspondent says that it is understood in  Groznyy that disputes with Russia damage the republic's own  interests.    The correspondent goes on to note that the rupture of the  old  economic ties have already caused considerable decline in  production and many enterprises are barely making ends meet. He  adds that wages cannot be paid because cash is in short supply.  Nor is the situation likely to change until accounts held in  the Russian banks were unfrozen, he says, adding that in the  meantime people are engaging in all kinds of commercial  activities. He notes that there are many soldiers on the  streets, because "considerable numbers" are dissatisfied with  the present regime, as evidenced by the recent attempt on the  life of Chechen President Dzokhar Dudayev.    The report concludes with a brief interview with President  Dudayev by the reporter. Asked what he personally expects from  the talks with Moscow, if they take place, President Dudayev  says:    "We expect positive results. Any talks should be positive in  spirit."</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> KOVIC SEEKS INPUT ON POLITICAL FUTURE  </P> <P> Ron Kovic, the paraplegic Vietnam veteran whose life story is told in the  current film "Born on the Fourth of July," appealed to residents in Rep. Robert  Dornan's congressional district to help him decide whether he should run for  the office. Kovic said in interviews that he is "ready to serve my country  again, but I cannot make this decision alone.  </P> <P> I am asking people to write me, to call me, to come up to me on the street. I'm  not a professional politician. If I ran it would be as a  citizen-representative, an everyday person." Kovic said he will make a decision  by the end of February when he returns from a film festival in Europe. Several  national Democratic leaders have urged him to run against Dornan in the 38th  Congressional District in Orange County. Dornan criticized Kovic's call for  more U.S. support of changes in the Soviet Union and a "perestroika in  America." "My hope for the future is a future without the communism that put  Ron Kovic in a wheelchair," Dornan said.  </P></p>

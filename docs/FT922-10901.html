			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / 'Perfect' deal sours for NSW premier IT LOOKED like the perfect political deal. A troublesome Independent MP resigns his seat to take a well-paid job in the public service, and the government calls a by-election it is almost certain to win. For Mr Nick Greiner, the conservative premier of New South Wales, it looked too good to miss, especially since the extra seat would shore up his minority government's crumbling majority. Nor was it a particularly unusual deal. For the people of Australia's richest and most populous state, though, it seems to have been the straw that broke the camel's back. And as parliament debated a censure motion last night, it looked as though Mr Greiner could pay a high price. Mr Greiner's problem is that his Liberal/National party coalition government controls only 47 seats in the 99-seat state parliament, the same number as the opposition Labor party. The government is sustained in office by a deal with five Independent MPs, who have promised to oppose opposition attempts to win power in return for changes to parliamentary procedure and greater freedom of information. Two weeks ago, the government announced that Mr Terry Metherell, a former Liberal minister who defected to the Independent benches last year, had been appointed to a senior planning job in the state's environmental protection agency. His five-year contract is worth ADollars 550,000 (Pounds 240,000). No one suggests Mr Metherell is not qualified for the job. He has a doctorate in planning law, and knowledge of government procedure and practice which will be extremely useful to the agency. However, it emerged that his appointment was actually to a special unit in the premier's department, from which he was subsequently seconded to the agency without its approval. Furthermore, his application for the job was written after the publicly announced deadline, and he was appointed without an interview, although there are believed to have been 60 other applications. Mr Metherell denies wrongdoing, but has refused further comment. The government initially shrugged off opposition allegations of malpractice and corruption, but was forced on to the defensive after Mr Greiner admitted the appointment was a straightforward 'political deal.' Now the affair is to be investigated by state's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), and government officials may be called to give a first-hand account of events to MPs. There was uproar in parliament as a series of debates on the affair began yesterday with a claim by Mr Bob Carr, state Labor leader, that Mr Greiner was guilty of conspiracy to corrupt. Mr Metherell, he said, had 'swapped his seat for a job.' Mr Greiner, clearly angered, branded Mr Carr 'a coward, a liar and a hypocrite.' The premier has his cabinet's backing, but is likely to be given a rough ride by his own backbenchers when Liberal and National party MPs meet to debate the issue today.  At least one Liberal MP is expected to call for Mr Greiner to quit, and senior cabinet ministers have begun to prepare for a leadership campaign if he is forced to go. Independent MPs will demand his resignation if he is criticised by the ICAC investigation. If the premier refused to go in such circumstances, the Independents say they would put Labor into power. All this is deeply galling to Mr Greiner, a Harvard graduate who swept to power in 1988 after a campaign centred on the alleged corruption of the former Labor government. As a student of political history, he will appreciate the irony if he is forced out of office on the same issue, especially if the death blow is struck by ICAC - the anti-corruption body he set up after the 1988 campaign.</p>

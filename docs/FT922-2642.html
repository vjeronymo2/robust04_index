			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Egypt 'could tap desert water' EGYPT'S WESTERN desert oases could support large-scale agriculture if vast underground water resources were tapped, an Egyptian hydrological expert believes. Mr Ismail al-Ramly, a water resources consultant to the United Nations, says that years of studying the agricultural potential of the sparsely populated Western Desert had convinced him of the potential of the desert oases. He estimates that the Farafra oasis some 400 km (250 miles) south-west of Cairo offers the best prospects, with sufficient water to cultivate about 200,000 acres of land, compared with the present 10,000 acres. Bahariya, some 100 km closer to Cairo, was also a good candidate for vastly increased cultivation from the present about 10,000 acres to a potential of 100,000. The Siwa oasis towards the Libyan border could also support much increased cultivated acreage, Mr Ramly says. The Egyptian expert says that his studies have established that, contrary to theories advanced earlier this century, Egypt's desert water resources are 'self-contained.' In other words, desert aquifers are not re-charged with water from surrounding Libya, Chad or Sudan. Rather, he believes that the water comes from seepage from the Nile at Qena in Upper Egypt where the river forms a giant 'S'. This water has made its way west along 'tectonic zones' to aquifers under what is known as the 'great sand sea' towards the Sudanese and Libyan borders. Mr Ramly has also identified promising areas in the northern approaches to the Dakhla and Kharga oases, south of Farafra and Bahariya. But as yet little detailed work has been conducted in those areas. Investigation of Western Desert water resources has been helped by an enhanced oil exploration programme. Data from oil drilling has enabled Mr Ramly to build up a fairly comprehensive hydrological picture that would not have been possible otherwise because of the cost involved. He estimates that water resources available to Bahariya amount to about 1.8bn cu m, sufficient for 300 years of cultivation. He has yet to complete his evaluation of Farafra. Western desert water is of excellent quality, he says, and compares favourably with that of the Nile. Mr Ramly says large-scale agricultural development of the western desert would require big investments, but he is convinced the returns would be there. For the Egyptian government, struggling to accommodate its growing population within the confines of the Nile valley and delta and to reduce its dependence on food imports, utilisation of the western desert oases may make sense - if the tapping of deep desert aquifers is cost efficient.</p>

Mr. Claes has also condemned any use of force for political  purposes. He stated that Belgium, with its tradition of  welcoming political refugees, refused "to become the theater for  violent confrontations between foreign groups," the spokesman  added. According to AFP, the semi-official Turkish agency in  Anatolia had confirmed that Mr. Claes had promised on Monday  during a telephone conversation with his Turkish opposite  number, Hikmet Cetin, that Kurd demonstrators "would be  expelled" from Belgium.</p>

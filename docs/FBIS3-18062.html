			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta: "Foreign </F> Policy at the Ballot Box: The Elections, and Italy's Role"]    [Text] The election campaign that has just begun in our  country promises to be very important. It appears that Italy  finally has the opportunity to become a mature democracy, with  an electoral system that makes it possible for one homogeneous  coalition to govern while enabling another to fulfill the role  of a credible opposition and -- at the next election-- to become  a possible alternative. One can therefore -- and one should --  speak openly about government programs, because it will  ultimately be the nation -- and no longer the SpA [private  corporation] of the party secretaries -- that will make the  decisions.    In this connection I feel it is essential to introduce  foreign policy issues into the debate, not only because of my  official responsibility (that of encouraging discussion of  Italian foreign policy and possibly reaching a consensus), but  also -- and above all -- because despite the fact that the  international dimension is becoming increasingly important to  the well-being of our country, discussion of this subject has  heretofore been imprecise and totally inadequate to the task of  making the great decisions that lie ahead of us.    In particular, Italy must decide whether to stay the course  on which it has already embarked -- that of fulfilling its  responsibilities and making its contribution to the construction  and maintenance of a "new world order" -- or to change course in  the direction of an improbable unilateralism (as the right would  wish) or an imprudent neutralism (as some on the left would  wish). The various forces that aspire to govern the nation  should therefore propose explicit solutions to these dilemmas  and discuss their proposals among themselves in an effort to  reach an appropriate consensus in this regard.    I believe that a stable and well-ordered international  environment is undeniably necessary if we are to successfully  exploit the great opportunities opened up by the defeat of the  Soviet threat. If abandoned to anarchy, the great processes that  could finally bring us a universal family of nations -- in which  war would be a rare exception rather than the rule -- might  instead break down, with disastrous consequences for those  concerned and for the entire world community.    1. The development of democracy and of the free market has  enabled many countries to be emancipated in terms of their  freedom and well-being. It has, however, also increased the  vulnerability of modern and complex societies to transnational  processes over which the individual governments have little  control (narcotics, terrorism, migrations, economic crises, and  the environment).    2. The integrative forces of the markets have given rise to  a  welcome integration (and consequent rationalization) of diverse  economies whereby even industrialized countries are united with  developing countries, as in the case of NAFTA. If, however, this  process is not supported by a parallel development of the global  economy through the GATT, it could lead to a harmful division  of the world into spheres of mutually antagonistic economic  powers -- a situation that would have a potentially  counterproductive impact on the world economy as well as  dangerous political repercussions and the inevitable exclusion  of the poorer countries.    3. Because it serves as an important instrument for  mobilization and socialization, the rediscovery of national  identity has revitalized many countries that were formerly  enslaved by dictatorship and poverty. An exacerbated  nationalism, however, could lead (and in some cases has already  led) to intolerant and discriminatory political practices that  have consequences of a manifestly conflictual nature. This is  especially true in the youngest democracies (such as those  created following the collapse of the communist empire), in  which the actual capacity for reform is not adequate to fulfill  the ever growing expectations of societies that have been  waiting all too long.    4. Lastly, it is undeniable that nuclear weapons -- despite  their diabolical capacity for destruction -- had a stabilizing  effect on relations among great powers, because governments  found the very possession of such weapons to be reassuring. The  proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction, however,  threatens to upset this process. If even weak, illegitimate,  paranoid, vulnerable, and nonsocialized governments within the  family of nations are able to possess the immense power of  nuclear weapons, then international order cannot prevail and we  shall all lapse into an anarchic nightmare in which any  megalomaniac dictator will be able to keep the entire  international community at bay.    An international order capable of ensuring that these  processes will not break down is therefore a basic prerequisite  for bringing prosperity and peace to the people. It is  accordingly in our interest -- and it is also our duty -- to  contribute to the creation of that stability. Italian  politicians, however, are not always clear as to the means  necessary to make that contribution. A generic profession of  faith in the international organization that is currently most  favored or most in vogue will not suffice.    International organizations are in fact not sufficiently  developed to solve -- by themselves -- the problems confronting  us, although governments often make them scapegoats in an effort  to avoid their own responsibilities. International organizations  do in fact play an essential role, in that they provide the  individual nations with a forum for making collective decisions  -- thereby legitimizing possible international action -- but  they do not affect the implementation of such decisions, which  today -- rightly or wrongly -- is the responsibility of  individual governments. Only individual governments (especially  the democratic governments) can decide whether the lives of  their soldiers should be put at risk.    The international organizations -- such as the UN and the  CSCE -- have therefore not eroded the sovereignty of individual  states sufficiently to be able to develop their own independent  means for implementing decisions. Proof of this is the fact that  these organizations have been unable to equip themselves with  the decisionmaking mechanisms that would overcome the one state,  one vote rule (which in the case of the CSCE is actually one  state, one veto) so that the actions taken by these  organizations could be more in accordance with the relative  proportions of the individual contributions made to their common  goal. Moreover, even when the international organizations are  not stymied by the obstructionism of one or more states that are  driven by selfish and unilateral motivations, they can sometimes  be genuinely hesitant when they have to base their action on  contradictory principles: for example, having to choose between  the principle of the inviolability of national borders and the  principle of the self-determination of peoples. You cannot,  therefore, have a clear conscience merely by declaring that you  are in favor of action by the UN if you are not prepared to pay  the physical and moral costs of carrying out that action and are  not prepared to carry out strong political intervention if the  UN organization in question is stalemated.    Italy cannot, of course, accomplish this unilaterally, but  the De Gasperian perception of an Italy that is European and  Western -- a perception that many would like to disregard now  that the Berlin Wall has fallen -- takes on renewed significance  in this context. Only the European and Atlantic West has the  resources necessary to support the decisions of the  international community; and only the European and Atlantic West  is motivated by political objectives that a great part of the  world recognizes as appropriate, that is to say, the  consolidation of democracy and freedom.    The anti-Western and Third World interpretation of the  purpose of the UN -- an interpretation shared by much of the  Italian left (which is still operating in accordance with the  models of the Cold War) -- disregards the identity of interests  between the UN and the Western nations and therefore runs  counter to the interests both of the UN and of Italy itself,  which would be isolated if it followed such a policy. Together  with its partners [preceding word in English], Italy must  therefore support decisions that will make it possible to carry  out the work of the international organizations.    First of all, this means maintaining national unity (the  constituent parts of a confederation would in fact be too weak  to make their point of view prevail in the international arena)  and taking a decisive stand in favor of the creation of a  European Union that would have the political capacity to  mobilize the resources it needs to contribute -- together with  its allies -- to the construction of a new world order.    Second, this means accepting responsibilities, and not all  of  the would-be government leaders have been explicit on this  subject. We live in an imperfect world that has been rendered  even more imperfect by the uncertainties of the transition  through which we are passing. If we wish to make our  contribution to the kind of world order that would be capable of  defending our interests, promoting peace and development, and  complying with our vision of justice, we must have a clear  understanding of the bold effort necessary to meet these  responsibilities. Indeed, not only must we prepare to defend  ourselves from an unlikely direct threat; we must also be ready  -- in terms of material and moral resources -- to intervene in  areas of the world where human and civil rights are violated, in  confirmation of the right to carry out humanitarian intervention  with the aim of protecting all human beings, even those who have  had the misfortune to be born in the wrong country.    If we wish to reassure all peoples and guarantee them the  stability necessary for their development, we must be available  to intervene in difficult situations by all means necessary  (including military means, just as the police ensure public  order within the individual states), with all the risks that  this entails. We must therefore be ready to defend our interests  (as was the case during the Cold War) and to carry out the UN's  humanitarian missions (as in Somalia and Mozambique). We must  also, however, be prepared to cope with situations which --  although risky in military terms -- do not affect our vital  interests in a way that would make the need for intervention  self-evident. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall we have twice  found ourselves in a similar situation: in the Gulf and in  Bosnia. The Gulf War demonstrated that such interventions by the  international community are possible, and Bosnia has  demonstrated that they are not easy to carry out.    These problems are of the greatest importance, inasmuch as  they involve our nation's security for the next generation. It  is therefore worthwhile for the various political forces to let  the Italian people know their views on these questions even  before the elections, in order to give our citizens the  opportunity to base their vote on these opinions concerning such  important issues, among others. From this standpoint, the  newborn Pact for Italy's decision to exclude the MSI [Italian  Social Movement] forces of the right -- who have always been  opposed to the concept of a Western-oriented Italy -- is, I  believe, a wise one, as well as its wait-and-see attitude toward  the Lega, some of whose representatives seem to be calling for  an Italy divided into three parts that would not be equal to the  tasks that I have discussed. As for the other side of the  political spectrum, I believe the Left may have difficulty  expressing itself in a coherent manner. Whereas the Democratic  Alliance appears to be ready to discharge these  responsibilities, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] seems  to me to be more irresolute, midway through its transition from  old conditioned reflexes (that led it to oppose the Gulf  operation) to a new culture of government. As for the extreme  left (Rete, Communist Renewal, and the Greens), it is light  years distant from the kind of attitude called for under the  current situation. In any case, I do not believe it likely that  before the elections the "coalition of the forces of the left"  will succeed in resolving these contradictions. If it does,  however -- and that would be desirable -- it would be at the  cost of a schism within the coalition and a clarifying  separation of groups and personalities whose conceptions of the  world are not easily reconciled.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Tarmac losses reach Pounds 1m a working day TARMAC, Britain's biggest building materials and construction group, lost more than Pounds 1m each working day last year. The company yesterday said it incurred a Pounds 350.3m pre-tax loss in 1992, the largest ever by a British construction company. It compared with a Pounds 21m pre-tax profit the previous year. The loss was struck after provisions of Pounds 372m. Of this Pounds 217m was against housing and commercial property operations. Tarmac said it will withdraw totally from speculative property development in the next two years. It plans to reduce the number of homes built in the UK this year from 8,266 to between 7000 and 7,500 - reducing capital employed in housing by a further Pounds 100m. Five years ago it built more than 11,000 homes annually. Provisions last year included Pounds 64.3m for reorganisation costs as the group has cut the size of its business in a bid to reduce large borrowings. The group had cut almost 10,000 jobs during the past two years leaving it with a labour force of 25,000. The company's capacity to produce drystone, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, bricks and black top for road building and repairs had been cut by between 5 per cent and 36 per cent. The group proposed to maintain its interim dividend at 2.5p making a same-again total for the year of 5.5p. There was a loss per share of 37.6p, against earnings last time of 0.2p. Tarmac shares rose 8p to close at 141p. Two divisions out of six incurred a loss last year. The others reported lower operating profits. US operations incurred a loss of Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.8m) (compared with an Dollars 11.8m loss in 1991); building materials a loss of Pounds 2.9m (1991 profit Pounds 1.4m). Housebuilding profits before interest and exceptional items fell from Pounds 56.4m to Pounds 38.6m; contracting profits fell from Pounds 39.7m to Pounds 22.7m; quarry products fell from Pounds 42.8m to Pounds 29.6m; industrial products profits dropped from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 4.8m. The group said net debt, excluding off- balance sheet and auction market preferred stock would have fallen Pounds 58m but for sterling's collapse, which added more than Pounds 100m to its mostly US dollar denominated debt.

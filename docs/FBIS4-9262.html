			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 21 April (MTI) -- "If elected, the  Socialists would choose the Alliance of Free Democrats and the  Federation of Young Democrats as partners for coalition talks,"  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] acting deputy chairman Imre  Szekeres said in response to a reporter's question in Budapest  on Thursday [21 April].    "Only after knowing the election results can the MSZP think  about (always assuming it is even in a position to) with whom to  form a coalition," he added and cited four criteria for such a  decision: Compatibility of party programs and an agreement on  concrete government tasks for the first six months; consensus on  the new government's composition and style; agreement to  conclude a social pact; and partners' ability to create a  constructive relationship with the opposition.</p>

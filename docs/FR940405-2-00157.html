Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspect of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to set forth an interpretation concerning the meaning and administration of Exchange Rule 409 with respect to the establishment of standards for Exchange members and member organizations holding foreign customer accounts. It is intended that this interpretation will be published as an Interpretation Memorandum for inclusion in the Exchange Interpretation Handbook. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exchange Rule 409 addresses the requirement of member organizations to send statements of accounts and confirmations to customers. One of the purposes of Rule 409 is to ensure that member organization's communications to customers are sent to appropriate and/or authorized persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 409(b)(2) provides that customer mail (i.e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> statements, confirmations and other communications) may not be addressed to any member, member organization or in care of an employee of any member organization. This, in effect, prohibits the receipt and retention by a member, member organization, registered representative or other associated person, of customer mail. The rule, however, does permit the Exchange to waive the rule's requirements, upon written request. The Exchange has received requests from member organizations to permit them to hold mail for certain foreign customers who have represented in writing that they do not wish to receive such correspondence. Reasons for such requests have included inefficient local mail services (resulting in misrouted mail or opened mail) or unstable political climates. In order to review and approve such requests, the Exchange has established guidelines. The Exchange is proposing this written interpretation to codify the procedures and standards for reviewing requests from member organizations to hold foreign customer mail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed interpretation provides that the Exchange will consider written requests from members and member organizations for the implementation of procedures for temporarily holding foreign customer mail. Such requests will be required to provide certain details and representations concerning supervisory procedures that the member or member organization will have in place with respect to holding mail. Specifically, members and member organizations will be required to obtain, at least on an annual basis, a written request from the customer to have mail temporarily held at the premises of the firm and providing appropriate reasons for such request. Additionally, the organization's written procedures must address, at a minimum that: such accounts will receive frequent supervisory review with special attention given to discretionary accounts; the communications will be reviewed annually by the compliance/internal audit department or by person(s) delegated such responsibility pursuant to Exchange Rule 342 (independent of the branch), and such review will include a test that the communications are held pursuant to written customer instructions; a log of the communications will be maintained which shows the date of transmittal of the communications to the customer; and that endeavors will be made to orally communicate the substance of the communications directly to the customer and that a written record is kept of all meetings and conversations with the customer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that this proposed interpretation will give members and member organizations the flexibility to hold mail upon customer request, while providing appropriate safeguards through enhanced supervisory procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires that the rules of the Exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest, in that it establishes standards that enable members and member organizations to meet customer requests yet provide customer protection through appropriate monitoring and supervision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

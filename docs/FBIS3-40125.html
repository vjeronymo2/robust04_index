Governments at all levels have taken this matter seriously in  recent years and done a good deal of work with a considerable  measure of success. Nevertheless, peasants in some places  continue to be saddled with an excessive social burden, which  not only constrains agricultural output growth, but also  constitutes the leading social problem in rural areas today.  <H5>  Present Situation </H5>   1. The heavy burden of rural education.    To begin with, rural elementary and secondary schools  collect  too many assorted fees and charges. Departments in charge of  education at all levels pay teachers' wages only but otherwise  give no financial aid to schools. To keep operating normally,  the schools always target students in their fund-raising  efforts. Every freshman in the junior high section of Longjiang  Secondary School in Qionghai Shi must pay 20 fees and charges  each year, which cost him as much as 141 yuan in all. Zheyuanbo  Elementary School at Dalu Zhen in Qionghai Shi issues formal  receipts for fee collection. According to a survey report issued  by the agricultural commission of Dingan County, students  attending township and administrative district elementary and  secondary schools must pay for a host of things in addition to  tuition and textbooks, including maintenance, water and  electricity, equipment, recreation, instructional apparatus,  books, private teachers, class society, school administration,  sanitation, scholarships, teaching and research, law and order,  personal insurance, cafeteria, school construction, physical  examination, tree planting, locks, and broomsticks. Each  semester a senior high student must shell out more than 180  yuan; a junior high student, 150 yuan; and an elementary school  student, 90 yuan. In Wanning County, the price bureau authorizes  rural elementary and secondary schools to collect 13 fees each  semester with a combined value of 73 yuan, 59.5 yuan, or 36.2  yuan, depending on whether the student attends senior high,  junior high, or elementary school. In reality, elementary and  secondary school students must each dish out over 100 yuan per  semester in fees and charges. Of the 140 school-age children in  Longjie district (village) in Longtang Zhen in Dingan County in  1992, 50 were forced to quit school because they could not  afford the tuition.    Second, there is a growing trend to raise funds from among  the rural population to build schools, a trend that has really  picked up steam in recent years in the countryside. Apart from a  modicum of funds from the state, peasants are left almost  entirely on their own to come up with the necessary funds. Thus  school construction expenses have become one of the onerous  burdens on peasants. In Dingan County, the per capita school  construction burden on peasants is 55 yuan. In Longjie  administrative district (village) in Longtang Zhen, 73 yuan were  raised on a per capita basis to fund school construction. Nanyin  Village has yet to achieve grain self-sufficiency; 60 percent of  the peasant households find it necessary to sell off some of  their grain to eke out a living. To help pay for a two-story  teaching building for the village elementary school, every  peasant was required to come up with 75 yuan (stones and rocks  extra). This and other burdens make life a struggle for many  peasants. Their children are forced to quit school because they  don't have the money to pay their tuition.    2. Growing sugar cane an unprofitable proposition for  peasants.    Sugar cane is a leading cash crop in rural Hainan. Since the  beginning of last year, however, the demand for sugar cane has  stagnated and prices have dropped to 1,800 yuan per ton. Sugar  cane procurement prices too have been adjusted downward three  times, from 130 to 100 yuan per ton. Furthermore, peasants were  issued IOUs as government fell behind in payment for months.  Between the pressing season of 1992 and that of 1993, sugar cane  growers in the province were owed almost 100 million yuan, or  30.4 yuan per ton. As sugar refineries fell into arrears, the  peasants experienced difficulty paying off their loans on time  even as their interest payments mounted month after month, which  translated into yet another heavy burden on them. Between the  pressing seasons of 1992 and 1993, the prices of refined white  sugar skyrocketed to more than 2,300 yuan a ton. Yet the sugar  cane procurement price remained 100 yuan or so. Furthermore, the  prices of agricultural capital goods have risen sharply since  last year, pushing up production costs steadily. Then there are  the "12 worms in every sugar cane," meaning that 12 fees have to  be paid during the entire process from the moment the cane is  cut through shipment to its sale. Everybody, including the  despatcher, the truck driver, the quality inspector, and the  person in charge of weighing the cane, tries to extort some  money from the cane grower. Paying off all these people can set  him back between 80 and 100 yuan per mu of land cultivated with  sugar cane. According to calculations, once the yield of his  sugar cane fields drops below 3 tons per mu, a grower cannot  expect to make a profit. The underpricing of sugar cane at the  procurement level has dampened the enthusiasm of peasants for  growing this particular crop. Sugar cane mismanagement has now  become commonplace in many localities, with numerous peasants  giving up on management or planning to switch to other crops.  According to statistics compiled by the appropriate departments,  a decline in sugar cane output in Hainan this year is a foregone  conclusion.    3. Taxes on pigs, cattle, and sheep excessive.    For every pig slaughtered, a peasant in Qiongzhong County is  required to pay a total of 39.4 yuan to five agencies,  specifically, 11 yuan to the food department, 16.5 yuan to the  industry and commerce administrative bureau, 6.6 yuan to the tax  agency, 3.3 yuan to the animal husbandry department, and 2 yuan  to the environmental protection agency. In Qionghai Shi, it  costs a peasant anywhere from 27 yuan to 32 yuan to slaughter a  pig, including 6.6 yuan in slaughtering tax, 11 yuan in  industrial and commercial administrative fees, 2 yuan in  environmental protection fee, 1 yuan in epidemic prevention fee,  0.4 yuan in slaughtering charge, and 5 yuan in slaughtering fee.  Some departments are given to raising the standards for  calculating fees arbitrarily. With no authorization, a certain  provincial-level department went ahead anyway and issued a  directive raising the environmental protection fees for  slaughtering pigs, cattle, and sheep from a uniform 0.5 yuan to  1, 2, or 3 yuan, depending on whether the animal is a pig,  cattle, or sheep, and passed on this extra burden to the  producers (peasants). It takes a lot of hard work by the peasant  to raise a pig, but he makes hardly a penny in profit after  selling the animal.    4. Too many fees and charges imposed on the fishery  industry.    According to the survey report by the agricultural  commission  of Qionghai Shi, the following fees and charges are imposed on  fishermen in Tangyu Zhen by the various departments involved: 1)  Each year the township government collects from every fisherman  50 yuan in harbor construction fee and 5 yuan in military  pension fund; 2) the administrative district (village) collects  15 yuan in accumulation fund annually, along with another 15  yuan in management fund; 3) the fishery supervisory board  collects 10.8 yuan for every unit of horsepower. With one worker  being equivalent to seven units of horsepower, that amounts to a  levy of 75.6 yuan; 4) the environmental protection agency  collects an environmental resource protection fee each year on  the basis of 5 yuan per unit of horsepower, which translates  into an average of 35 yuan; 5) the police sub-station collects a  law and order fee at the rate of 3 yuan per person per year; 6)  the provincial shipping inspection department collects an annual  inspection fee which ranges from 220 yuan to 250 yuan per  vessel, or 22 to 25 yuan per person on the average; 7) a new  vessel registration and certification fee is also levied, which  could be anywhere from 300 to 400 yuan. The burden on fishermen  averages 708 yuan per person per year, about 8.5 percent of the  total per capita income (including taxes). The extra-tax burden  is 308 yuan, or 3.7 percent of the total income.    5. Too many charges on agricultural vehicles.    An array of fees is collected on the walking tractor used in  the countryside, including 11 fees authorized by the provincial  price bureau and three provided for by the provincial  transportation department, not to mention other payments  required by the provincial finance department and industry and  commerce bureau. When a peasant purchases a walking tractor  before entering the rural transportation business, he is  required under the law to pay 975.8 yuan in taxes each year. In  fact, he must dish out much more. According to a survey by the  agricultural commission of Lingshui County, he who owns a  pedicab must pay 11 fees in addition to shelling out 1,645 yuan  in taxes.    6. Overly high rural electric rates.    The cost of electricity exceeds 1 yuan per kilowatt-hour in  the countryside in most municipalities and counties in Hainan.  It costs an average of 1.3 yuan per kwh in the two counties of  Qiongshan and Chengmai, 1.35 yuan in Qionghai Shi, as much as 2  yuan per kwh in some townships and towns, and a whopping 4 yuan  in a handful of townships. Hence this strange spectacle in some  villages --people lighting kerosene lamps to watch TV. The high  costs of electricity are mainly caused by: 1) the mismanagement  of the power industry. The industry is over-staffed, circuits  are poorly designed, equipment is obsolete, and waste is  considerable; 2) rural power supply stations continue to charge  fees as they please. In Qionghai Shi, for instance, peasants are  already paying for the acquisition and installation of rural  electric meters. On top of that, however, some township and town  power bureaus collect a meter fee at the rate of 1 yuan per  meter. As there are more than 60,000 meters in the city, this  levy alone generates an additional 720,000 yuan.    7. The high costs of health care in the countryside.    The prices of drugs and medical care have shot up rapidly in  recent years. In addition, a handful of rural hospitals have  been imposing or raising fees indiscriminately. The result is  hefty health care bills for peasants. As the masses in Ledong  county tell it, ever since rural hospitals introduced a new  system under which the hospital pays the basic wages and the  technical office takes care of subsidies, bonuses, and other  wages, the technical office has been charging all manner of fees  arbitrarily. To enhance their incomes, doctors have all their  patients undergo a full check-up and every laboratory test  available regardless of the severity of their illness. They also  over-prescribe. If you have a cold, a visit to the doctor can  cost you anywhere from a dozen yuan to a hundred yuan.    8. The proliferation of fees, charges, fund-raising schemes,  and apportionments proliferate.    There has been an explosion of fees, charges, fund-raising  schemes, and apportionments in the countryside, with numerous  agencies getting in the act. Taxes collected by the state have  not gone up by much, but local levies, fees, charges,  fund-raising, and apportionments are legion. According to  peasants in Qionghai Shi, marriage registration entails the  payment of five fees: marriage certificate fee, 9 yuan; sponsor  fee, 20 yuan; physical check-up fee, 25.5 yuan; fetus protection  fee, 20 yuan; and frequency modulation trumpet fee, 58 yuan. The  combined price tag is 132.5 yuan. Studies show that some  counties have written regulations requiring every peasant  household to pay a 1-yuan law and order fee, with another yuan  payable to the administrative district (village). Besides  apportioning construction investment funds among the peasant  households, some villages also collect funds to pay for bridges,  roads, wells, cultural centers, communal temples, and ancestral  halls.    9. Hidden burden getting heavier.    Following steep increases in the prices of agricultural  capital goods since the beginning of the year, agricultural  production costs have gone up significantly. Between January and  June this year the prices of agricultural capital goods soared  37.1 percent compared to the corresponding period a year ago.  Specifically, the prices of chemical fertilizers shot up 56.1  percent; oil for use in farm machinery, 78.7 percent; and small  farm tools, 25.4 percent. In contrast, the market price of grain  (rice) rose just 23 percent in the January-June period over the  same period last year. The production costs of early season rice  this year are projected to exceed those of last year by 40  percent or so, leaving little profit for grain-growing peasants.  <H5>  Causes </H5>   1. Misconceptions spreading unchecked.    As the old institutions give way to the new, the  pleasure-seeking habit of some cadres provides fertile soil for  money worship. Amidst funding contracting, some departments and  units have been scrambling to raise revenue in each and every  way possible, officially to increase the wages and benefits of  their workers but actually to line their own pockets and satisfy  their own greed. Concocting various contexts and relying on  their power and position, some power organs at the township and  town level force peasants to part with their hard-earned money,  even compelling them to sell their livestock and deducting money  from the sums payable to the peasants in return for the grain  they turn over to the government. Some municipal, county, and  township agencies try to outdo one another. Whatever one  jurisdiction levies, others want to do likewise. The idea is to  collect the most fees and charges and offer the most benefits.  As a result, fees and charges overlap one another, expenses are  apportioned indiscriminately, and funds are raised in a  disorderly manner. All these trends have become commonplace.    2. Many public welfare projects are being undertaken with no  bearing to reality.    With the introduction of the household responsibility system  of linking remuneration to output in the countryside after the  3d Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the peasants'  living standards have indeed risen markedly. On the whole,  however, most peasants have just enough to eat and wear; the  truly affluent peasants are few and far between. In some  localities, the officials overestimate the extent of wealth  among the peasants and consequently mistake unripe conditions to  be just the opposite. Divorcing themselves from reality and  ignoring objective conditions, with no regard for the level of  development of the local economy, they blindly pursue big  projects and grand projects and indiscriminately go after  "upgrading," all in the name of reaching some standards in  everything they do, whether it be building an elementary school,  a nursing home, or a nursery school. Even after a project meets  the standards, there are new demands. For instance, after a  school was built according to specifications, there were demands  for "six coordinations" or "ten coordinations" and calls for the  construction of a school of the garden style. Where does the  money come from? Since the government refuses to pay, the costs  have to be passed onto the peasants. Caught up in the social  climate of putting money before everything else, some  departments and units have come to regard as a commodity what  should rightly be provided as a service and demand that peasants  pay for it.    3. Organizational over-staffing.    The emphasis in institutional organization on having an  identical lineup of agencies or departments at every level is an  important reason why fee-collection, apportionment of expenses,  and fund-raising have gone out of hand. In recent years there  has been a mindless preoccupation with institutional matching,  meaning that when a municipality or county sets up a bureau,  townships insist on having a station or center staffed with  full-time workers. The result is a rise in the off-budget  staffing level in townships. Nowadays one can typically find  more than a dozen departments with almost 60 workers in a  township. More offices mean more staffers and a heavier burden  on peasants.    4. Shortfall in educational funding.    The shortfall in educational funding is a major problem  facing society today, with the shortage being particularly acute  at the township level. One cannot complain when rural schools in  poverty-stricken areas try to stay afloat, improve the  conditions in which they operate, and close the gap in their  budgets by imposing a number of charges as appropriate. However,  some rural schools have overstepped the bounds of reasonableness  by collecting too many charges, thus making the burden on  peasants even more onerous.    5. Poor quality of cadres    Most complaints in the countryside these days have to do  with  three trends. One is wining and dining, with rural grassroots  cadres being the worst offenders. By spending lavishly on food  and drinks, they have created a leading public evil. Second,  everybody is going in for ostentation and extravagance and  trying to outdo one another on that score. The standards are  getting more and more stringent. Third, a covert form of greed  is spreading. The cadres in some villages (administrative  districts) line their personal pockets with public funds. Using  all kinds of pretexts and in every way possible, they infringe  upon public properties and the peasants' interests. Some of the  off-budget personnel are of an exceptionally poor quality. They  have little awareness of the concept of the law and some have  been assigned to their jobs without any training. The result is  that they break the law frequently. In recent years,  municipalities, counties, townships, and villages  (administrative districts) have all been making their own  home-grown policies. Although both the State Council and  provincial government have issued repeated orders demanding that  the burden on peasants be lessened, a number of grassroots  cadres have chosen to ignore such orders and, driven by private  interests, continue to try to balance their budgets on the  peasants' backs by levying charges on them and apportioning  expenses and raising funds among them in an arbitrary manner.    6. There is no adequate effective supervision and  inspection.    It is the responsibility of the price, finance, and auditing  departments to investigate the "three indiscriminates," that is,  the indiscriminate levying of charges, indiscriminate  apportionment of expenses, and indiscriminate fund-raising. In  reality nobody wants to get involved because of the resistance  and many difficulties encountered. Moreover, cooperation is  lacking among the agencies. There are cases in which fees are  collected, expenses apportioned, and funds raised in blatant  violation of the national policy, yet such acts are authorized  by or have the blessing of leading organs at the same level of  government. The prices, finance, and auditing agencies have  neither the power to investigate nor the courage to report to  the authorities above. So the trends are allowed to go unchecked  and the "three indiscriminates" get worse and worse. Meanwhile,  the burden on peasants becomes heavier and heavier.</p>

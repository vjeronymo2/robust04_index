The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide procedures for submitting information on political contributions pursuant to rule G&hyph;37. The Board has requested accelerated approval of the proposed rule change in order to allow for the timely submission of, and public access to, information concerning political contributions. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. The Commission also finds good cause for granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G&hyph;37 on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Rule G&hyph;37(e)(ii) provides that reports on contributions made and municipal securities business engaged in during the reporting period must be submitted to the Board on Form G&hyph;37, in accordance with Board rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures, quarterly, with due dates determined by the Board. In its rule G&hyph;37 filing, the Board noted that it was developing appropriate rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures to allow for public access to the information to be submitted on Form G&hyph;37. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The current proposed rule change establishes procedures for brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers for filing with the Board information relating to political contributions as required by rule G&hyph;37. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The proposal also establishes procedures for filing voluntary information relating to political contributions. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33868 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17621 (April 13, 1994).

These dates correspond to January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31. The Board will maintain one copy of each Form G&hyph;37 off-site for back-up purposes, and will maintain the second copy of each Form G&hyph;37 at its Public Access Facility (``PAF'') in Virginia, where it will be available to the public for review and photocopying. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The Board also will maintain a database of reports filed by each dealer (as well as any other party voluntarily submitting information on political contributions), so that any member of the public may telephone the Board's offices to inquire whether a particular dealer (or other party) has submitted a report pursuant to rule G&hyph;37. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  To further enhance public access to this information, the Board will provide a list of companies that offer document retrieval and mailing services. As the Board gains experience with rule G&hyph;37 submission procedures, and as the informational needs of the municipal market change with regard to political contributions, the Board will seek to expand the access and services available to the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Board will charge 20 cents per page plus sales tax, if applicable, for photocopying. This is the same pricing structure currently used for photocopying official statements and advance refunding documents at the PAF. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the dealer's name, the information available through the database will include, among other things, the quarterly period covered by the report and summary information on political contributions. Although rule G&hyph;37 requires dealers to report certain summary information concerning contributions, it does not require disclosure of the names of individual municipal finance professionals or executive officer contributors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the rule G&hyph;37 procedures will result in many dealers filing forms at or about the same time, the Board believes that it can adequately process this information in a timely manner. However, if such processing becomes unduly burdensome for the Board, then it may consider staggering dealer submission due dates in the future. In addition, if the number of voluntary submissions substantially increases the Board's costs of processing this information, then it may consider charging a filing fee to cover some of the expenses associated with certain of this voluntarily submitted information. Finally, the Board, in the future, may review the necessity for, and propriety of, charging an access fee for the forms filed, if any, pursuant to rule G&hyph;37. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / MP calls for tapes on Thatcher allegations The head of the House of Commons committee that investigated the controversial Al Yamamah defence contract between the UK and Saudi Arabia yesterday said tape recordings allegedly implicating Mr Mark Thatcher should be released. The call by Mr Robert Sheldon of the Public Accounts Committee for parliament to hear the tapes of conversations between arms dealers and agents of the Saudi royal family follows claims that Lady Thatcher's son received Pounds 12m in commission from the deal. A demand for a fresh inquiry into the deal is likely to emerge from a meeting next Wednesday of Mr Sheldon's committee. Last weekend The Sunday Times newspaper published extracts from alleged transcripts of bugged telephone conversations, together with corroborating evidence from sources close to the contract negotiations. The transcripts suggest that Mr Thatcher was part of a team of middlemen who earned Pounds 240m in commissions from the deal. Mr John Witherow, Sunday Times acting editor, said last night that although the newspaper did not have the tapes, or know of their whereabouts, it had full translations of transcripts. Mr Sheldon said yesterday a parliamentary inquiry into the allegations would be discussed next week. But he is also considering calling on the government's spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, to undertake a fresh examination of Al Yamamah. The Pounds 20bn arms deal was signed in 1986 as a government-to-government agreement, with British Aerospace named as the main contractor. Mr Sheldon was instrumental in deciding that a 1992 NAO report was not published on grounds of national security. He said the report showed no evidence of corruption and made no mention of Mr Thatcher. Mr Thatcher has remained silent publicly since last weekend's allegations. But his mother earlier this week once again denied any impropriety in Al Yamamah, which she helped to win while prime minister. However, a senior French defence executive said yesterday The Sunday Times allegations confirmed reports circulating among rival contractors during the initial bidding process. Mr John Wyatt, director of Search Training International, a British security company which won a contract under the package, said: 'There was an agreed figure (for the package) under which all military items were subsequently drawn down. I think this made it difficult to check the authorisation of the payments. I am not surprised it was open to misuse.'</p>

China National Technical Import and Export Corporation and  the Ministry of Railways signed a contract with Sunkyong Ltd of  ROK for the deal, in the Great Hall of the People today.    According to the contract, the coaches to be imported will  be  used on the double railway line from Hengyang, a city in the  southern parts of central China's Hunan Province, to Guangzhou  City, provincial capital of Guangdong.    The contract, involving a total investment of 3.69 billion  Japanese yen, is using an important part of the second group of  loans from the Japanese Government for supporting the  construction of Hengyang-Guangzhou twin-track railway line.    Officials with the China National Technical Import and  Export  Corporation said at today's signing ceremony that the purchase  of importing ROK-made luxury coaches will enormously enhance  handling capacity for passengers on the Hengyang-Guangzhou  Railway Line.</p>

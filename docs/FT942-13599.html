			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Books: Bilious brew of theatrical passion - After reading this 'vivisection' of the theatre Richard Eyre feels a director's life is safer than a critic's THE AISLE IS FULL OF NOISES by Michael Coveney Nick Hern Books Pounds 12.99, 209 pages At a certain point in your professional life, you can be spotted in the corner of a bookshop, engaged in a solitary vice. You cannot stop yourself. You lift a copy of a newly published book of memoirs, and, after looking guiltily about you, turn to the index to seek your name. You face the shame of exclusion, or the shard of ice through the heart provoked by a slighting mention of yourself. Mercifully, Michael Coveney's 'vivisection of live theatre' gave me neither sensation - which may not be a recommendation to some people. Christopher Hampton's perspective of critics is that one should view them as lamposts do dogs, but I have never developed such a robust diffidence; I am even guilty of some backsliding curiosity. In the past year I have read three books by theatre critics about their profession: either they have developed a contagious urge to unburden themselves of their trade secrets, or publishers have sensed that, like me, lamposts cannot resist reading about themselves. Irving Wardle of The Independent on Sunday has written about the noble art of theatre criticism in a characteristically thoughtful, dogged apologia pro sua vita; Michael Billington - The Guardian - has published a collection of a thousand encounters with pen and pad, One Night Stands, an excellent history of a thousand and one nights of theatrical passion; now Michael Coveney - The Observer - has given us an enjoyable glimpse behind the front lines into his professional (and private) habitat. Coveney describes his book, correctly, as a geological survey. He delves into the stratification of the theatrical landscape, deftly stopping off on the way at his childhood, adolescence, and birth of his career. Invariably, childhood is the most interesting part of a memoir: the writer is unformed and uncorrupted by the desire to impress. The child is always the father of the man and in Coveney's collecting of autographs, programmes and handbills, acquired with the voraciousness of the train-spotter, one sees the remorseless enthusiasm for theatre which is essential for any successful theatre critic. Only the optimism of a true fan can sustain so many nights of travelling in hope and arriving in disappointment. The theatre critic's life is a solitary one. The ais1e may be full of noises, but they seldom seem to be comradely greetings. The corps de critiques is not a clubbable lot; they sniff at each other like dogs marking out their territory, and Coveney's often acerbic wit is brought to bear on his fellow critics, some of whom have given up the trade, and some he devoutly wishes would do so: he is engagingly bilious about the absurd pretensions of Bernard Levin, and the lofty disdain of John Gross. I am not sure that his current colleagues will thank him for his sometimes droll, and often acidic, observations on their idiosyncrasies (varied), dress sense (poor) and their manners (bad), but I, at least, was grateful for his chastisement of those who gracelessly sit on their hands during curtain calls, or run self-advertisingly for the exits as if their trousers were on fire. This book is essentially a collection of good and sometimes provocative essays with a narrative framework supplied by the calendar a 'year of only average significance, but the same could be said of any other theatre year'. The topics covered embrace violence in the cinema, multi-ethnic casting, the work of Robert Lepage, the Edinburgh Festival, New York theatre, Sarajevo, and the contested merits of the plays of David Hare and the music of Andrew Lloyd-Webber. Coveney is spirited in his championship of a medium often mocked by his fellow journalists, and is not afraid to fight for the serious assessment of theatre by the press who, by reviewing less and abandoning over-night notices, have let criticism dribble into a stream of previews, and have diminished its power to influence by playing into the hands of the PR claque. The essays are laced with personal anecdotes that are often funny, but sometimes veer rather less towards La Recherche du Temps Perdu than towards Jennifer's Diary. I do not know how interested I am in Coveney's journey with the RSC's chauffeur, or his jogging encounter on Hampstead Heath with Max Stafford-Clark but I much enjoyed his description of getting drunk during a water shortage in Saint Lucia and exposing himself unwittingly to his motherin-law, and his encounter with Mike Leigh on another small holiday island. He dines, starstruck, with Peter Brook, parties with real royalty at Buckingham Palace, with showbiz royalty at Cameron Mackintosh's house and Andrew Lloyd-Webber's stately home, and slums it in Hammersmith with commoners like myself. Being a theatre critic involves sitting, night after night, writing in the dark. It is a job, like any other, with its routines, its trials, its pleasures and its occupational hazards - getting abused by John Gale, mocked by Ned Sherrin, and pinned against the wall by an indignant Juliet Stevenson. Michael Coveney convincingly conveys enthusiasm for this way of life, but I think I'll stick to directing; the worst that can happen to you is a bad review.</p>

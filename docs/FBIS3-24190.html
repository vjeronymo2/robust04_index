			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by militia Major-General V. Vorobyev, chief of the </F> oblast UVD [Internal Affairs Administration]: "Without  Overcoming Crime, We Will Not Achieve a Normal Life." Comments  on summary of criminal statistics for 1993]    [Text]    [Begin boxed material]    The operational situation in the oblast during the past year  was difficult. There were 22,712 crimes recorded, an increase of  10 percent over 1992.    There was a characteristic increase in serious crimes.  Moreover, not only was there an increase in their number, but  also in their relative share within the overall structure of  crime. This signifies an escalation of violence, cynicism and  harshness in relations between people. During the year there  were 182 reported cases of murder with assault. Moreover, almost  half of them were in the sphere of family-domestic relations.  There were 421 cases of grave bodily injury, with one in four of  these resulting in the death of the victim, as well as 101 cases  of rape and attempted rape.    [End boxed material]    Behind each of these criminal acts are the grief and tears  of  the victims, their loved ones and family members, a huge and  often irreplaceable material loss, moral and psychological  trauma, and broken human lives.    The situation is particularly alarming in the rural areas,  where crime has increased by 10.5 percent and practically one  out of every three crimes registered in the oblast is committed.  The blame for this may be placed not only on the ill-planned  migration policy, which has flooded the rural areas with  convicted persons who have persistent negative habits and who  are the outcasts of society, but also on the total absence of  leisure time of the rural residents, their spiritual decline. A  rich, full life, healthy in its constant interaction with  nature, is often replaced by a ruinous passion for alcohol. The  rural areas are steadily degenerating both spiritually and  physically...    We may find many reasons for the avalanche-like growth of  greedy acts, but the main one, in our opinion, consists of the  increasing enmity between the haves and the have-nots, which is  caused by an increase in the process of stratification of  society by level of income and living standard. Criminal  expropriation is rampant. But they are robbing not only the  millionaires. Among our 10,230 fellow citizens whose property  has been subjected to criminal encroachments, the overwhelming  majority are ordinary workers with moderate or low income.  Thieves have "cleaned out" 2,858 apartments, stolen 790  automobiles and motorcycles, and performed 258 acts of stealing  livestock from personal subsidiary farms. There have been 972  cases of robbery and 166 cases of assault and brigandage  committed against the personal property of citizens.    Taking the misfortune of others close to heart and  understanding very well the condition of the people who have  suffered because of criminals, I once again call upon Smolensk  residents to show concern for the safety of their relatives and  dear ones and the safekeeping of their personal property. We are  ready to give aid in equipping residences with security alarms  and to issue permits in accordance with the law for obtaining  hunting rifles and gas-powered weapons, to help in the  protection of enterprises, stores and offices, to train our  four-footed friends for the security-guard service, etc.    Such a form of greedy-violent crime as extortion also  requires special mention. There were 125 recorded cases of  racketeering during the year. And, unfortunately, we are  predicting an increase in such crimes in the future. We must say  frankly, the detainment of extortionists presents no special  difficulties. Many are caught red-handed and brought to criminal  responsibility on all instances which have been reported in a  timely manner by the victims. Nevertheless, according to the  estimates of our experts, there are hundreds of times more cases  of extortion than are officially reported and registered. This  is an extremely dangerous crime, fraught with the most serious  consequences, and the appraisal which the criminal code gives it  is rather inadequate to the severity and social significance of  racketeering.    Indulging in extortion and the obedient payment of the sums  demanded by it will inevitably lead the bribe-payer into a maze  of crime and will place him in jeopardy, along with the members  of his family, his life and health, his property and well-being.  I suggest that anyone who knows of cases of extortion and anyone  who has become the victim of criminal terror, threats and  violence immediately report this to the law enforcement agencies.    The number of encroachments on state property is continually  growing. Underground "privatization" is going on due to the  carelessness, connivance, and sometimes even the participation  of economic managers and other official and materially  responsible persons. This is inflicting a great loss upon the  economy. Along the line of criminal investigation alone there  have been 6,470 registered crimes against state property, 79.5  percent of which constitute theft. The number of violant  encroachments on our goods has increased: There have been 100  recorded cases of robbery and 13 cases of assault and brigandage.    The decline in the level of morality and culture, the  disappearance of many hindering barriers, coupled with the  spread of alcohol, have led to a significant deterioration of  law and order. There were 2,271 crimes committed in public  places, an increase of 54.8 percent. Street crime has increased  by almost 30 percent. Moreover, almost half of these crimes were  committed in Smolensk, and one-fourth--in Promyshlennyy Rayon,  which for a number of reasons has become the most dangerous in  terms of crime for Smolensk residents.    The increase in all forms of crime has been facilitated by a  weakening in the struggle against drunkenness. Drunks committed  around 5,000 crimes, which is 26 percent higher than in 1992.  And in individual rayons, as for example in Roslavlskiy,  Khislavichskiy, Monastyrshchinskiy, Temkinskiy and Rudnyanskiy  Rayons, the increase in "drunken" crimes has comprised more than  80 percent.    Especially negative processes are taking place among the  young people. Today few are worried that a thousand youths have  been thrown out of schools and other educational institutions,  deprived of the possibility of earning an honest living. Left to  their own devices, having lost their moral guidelines and faith  in justice, raised not on respect for the traditions of the  older generations and all-human moral principles, but on worship  of far from the best examples of Western life, young people  often embark upon the path of crime.    Around 2,000 crimes of the racketeering type are committed  by  young people ranging in age from 14 to 18 years old. Among them  there are thieves, robbers, rapists and murderers. Statistics  show that the "army" of those who have transgressed the criminal  law is being replentished not from the ranks of repeat  offenders, but at the expense of young people. While recidivist  crime has declined by 5.2 percent, crimes committed by minors  have increased by one-fourth.    Especially daring crimes are often committed in groups. The  increase in group crime comprised 24.3 percent. The participants  in many criminal groupings are juveniles. An exceptional social  danger is posed by the increasing tendency of adults to involve  juveniles in criminal activity, by the division of spheres of  influence between the groupings, and by the training of  physically developed but morally deficient young people who are  ready to do anything for money in semi-underground sections and  karate, boxing and kick-boxing clubs.    One other very complex problem is the struggle against the  unlawful distribution of narcotics. The desire to withdraw into  the phantom, unreal world of dope is especially inherent to  young people. Judging by the official data, the scope of drug  distribution is huge. In Russia during 1993 there were 53,169  identified cases of crimes associated with the illegal  circulation of drugs, with one out of every 72 of these being  discovered in our oblast. The Russian internal affairs agencies  have seized around 20 tonnes of narcotic-containing plants from  criminals, and here in our oblast--over 300 kilograms! Yet the  "profession" of the drug addict is certainly not quiet:  Considerable money is required to obtain the drugs. And this  money is acquired through theft, robbery and hold-ups...    The increased boldness and violent directionality of crimes  is expressed also in the fact that criminals are using weapons  more often, including firearms. They are showing active  resistance to the associates of the militia. According to the  data of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], during the year  associates of the Russian militia had to use weapons in  suppressing crimes and detaining malefactors in 2,186 cases. The  militia itself has borne tangible losses in this uncompromising  struggle: 183 associates of law enforcement agencies were killed  and 572 wounded in encounters with criminals.    There have been over 400 cases of unlawful storage and  carrying of firearms discovered in the Smolensk region. Seized  from the underground arsenal were 70 rifles, an anti-tank gun,  53 sawed-off shotguns, 39 homemade firearms, 81 grenades, 8  mines, 13 kilograms of tolite and almost 14,000 cartridges.  There were over 800 recorded cases of resistance to associates  of the militia, and 64 criminal cases were filed against persons  using physical violence against the associates. The associates  of the Smolensk militia were forced to use their weapons in over  200 cases!    Last year, thanks to the intensive work of the investigative  services, 14.6 percent more criminal cases were investigated.  The rate of crimes solved increased by 0.7 percent and comprised  58.1 percent (for all of Russia this figure is 50.6 percent). Of  course, neither we, the professionals, nor the victims of the  crimes, nor the oblast population can be satisfied by any  positive results as long as there are 19 murderers and attempted  murderers, 51 persons guilty of committing grave bodily  injuries, 12 rapists, 500 robbers and brigands and over 7,000  thieves whose wrongdoings have not been exposed living in our  midst. All our efforts and means are directed toward exposing  these grave crimes and identifying and detaining the guilty  parties.    This in general was the criminal situation in the oblast  last  year. We cannot call it extreme, but we predict an even more  difficult situation whose control will require the effort of all  forces and the attraction of all available means.</p>

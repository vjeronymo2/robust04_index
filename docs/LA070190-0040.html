			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENTICING VISUAL TASTES  </P> <P> We are very excited about our latest review by Betty Martin in her article,  "Try These Visual Tastes of Hungary and Greece," June 3.  </P> <P> Martin did a beautiful job, and her review of our "Eternal Greece" has sparked  a great deal of response from Times' readers. We are grateful for being  included in your continuing exposure of travel videos.  </P> <P> We also enjoyed Rich Roberts' article, "Drought Is No Deterrent to River  Rafters So Far," in the same issue. In fact, your entire Travel Section was a  joy to read.  </P> <P> DIANNE KAHM  </P> <P> The Traveloguer Collection  </P> <P> Englewood, Colo.  </P></p>

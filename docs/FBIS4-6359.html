			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister endorsed the Thai armed forces  response to Cambodia's accusation that Thailand is helping the  Khmer Rouge. He said we have to respond to and correct the  misunderstanding, otherwise it could damage Thailand. He said  the Foreign Ministry and concerned agencies had been told to  make clarifications on the matter. Asked whether it is time for  Thailand to adjust its policy on Cambodia, the prime minister  said Thailand's policy is to see peace in Cambodia. If there  were no peace in Cambodia, Thailand's border areas would be  plagued by the activities of Cambodian bandits. As for the  current situation, the prime minister believed it was a result  of a misunderstanding. Asked why the service of the joint  Thai-Cambodian committee had not been used to settle the  problem, the prime minister said there had been only an  agreement to set up a joint committee.    The prime minister however said we should not fall prey to  the news media. He said that, instead of making charges,  Cambodia should seek information from the Thai Foreign Ministry.  It should ask Thailand to clarify the matter if there is any  doubt about Thailand's behavior or if there is any impact on  Cambodia coming from Thailand. Likewise, Thailand would seek  information from Cambodia if it had any doubts about Cambodia.  The prime minister said that Thailand must find out whether the  report is correct and whether there was evidence substantiating  the complaints made by Cambodian leaders. He said the foreign  minister had been instructed to seek clarifications.    Commenting on the same issue, Army Commander General Wimon  Wongwanit said there was no tension in relations between  Thailand and Cambodia; relations remain good. He said there is  no use getting angry with one another. He said words uttered by  leaders of a country or government have great significance for  international relations. One has to be careful when making  statements because the country stands at risk of suffering  damages. He said the army is unhappy with efforts by certain  countries to create conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia.  Besides, inaccurate news reports by the media will also have to  be taken into account. The army chief said the Cambodian  Government should seek clarifications from the Thai Government  if it has doubts about Thailand's attitude instead of making  accusations which are an insult to Thailand. He said the army  cannot accept that. He stressed that the army will not support  any faction, noting that the peace and happiness of the Thai  people is most important. Thailand will resort to tougher  measures if Cambodia's attitude remains unchanged and the two  countries are unable to clear up the misunderstanding. Thailand  might have to cut its assistance to Cambodia.</p>

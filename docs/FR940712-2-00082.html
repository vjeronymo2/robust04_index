			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Composition of the Index <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index is based on securities representing 25 REIT stocks that the Exchange believes are representative of the REIT markets. The CBOE represents that the 25 REIT stocks have invested a preponderance of their assets in real property (typically at least 75 percent), and the property portfolios owned by these REITs constitute a diverse pool of income-earning real estate investments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twenty-three of the REIT stocks currently trade on the NYSE, and two trade on the Amex. All component stocks are ``reported securities,'' as that term is defined in Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The Index is price-weighted and will be calculated on a real-time basis using last sale prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  17 CFR 240.11Aa3&hyph;1. A ``reported security'' is defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this rule as ``any listed equity security or Nasdaq security for which transaction reports are required to be made on a real-time basis pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan.'' A ``transaction reporting plan'' is defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this rule as ``any plan for collecting, processing, making available or disseminating transaction reports with respect to transactions in reported securities filed with the Commission pursuant to, and meeting the requirements of, this section.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As of the close of trading on June 10, 1994, the Index was valued at 212.55. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  As of the close of trading on February 14, 1994, the market capitalizations of the individual securities in the Index ranged from a high of $1.1 billion (New Plan Reality) to a low of $220.2 million (Western Investment Real Estate Trust), with a mean and median of $541.9 million and $518.7 million, respectively. The total market capitalization of the securities in the Index was $13.5 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the REITs in the Index ranged from a high of 49.1 million shares (New Plan Realty) to a low of 10.9 million shares (BRE Properties). The average price per share of the securities in the Index, for the six-month period preceding February 14, 1994, <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  ranged from a high of $39.90 (Weingarten Realty Investors) to a low of $6.99 (Rockefeller Center Properties). In addition, the average daily trading volume of the REITs in the Index ranged from a high of 560,210 shares per day (Simon Property Group) <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  to a low of 15,330 shares per day (BRE Properties), with the mean and median being 94,900 and 49,100 shares, respectively. Lastly, no one REIT accounted for more than 6.5 percent of the Index's total value (Weingarten Realty Investors and Nationwide Health Properties), and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for 30.2 percent of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted component was 1.1 percent of the Index (Rockefeller Center Properties) and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues accounted for 10.2 percent of the Index's value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The index value was set to equal 200.00 on the base date of the Index, January 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter from Dan W. Schneider, Schiff Hardin &amp; Waite, to Thomas McManus, Branch of Options Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated March 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Trading data for these preceding six months were available for nineteen of the REIT stocks in the Index. Six of the component REIT stocks commenced trading at various points of time within that six month period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Simon Property Group commenced trading on December 14, 1993. The highest average daily trading volume for a REIT stock which traded for the full six month period prior to February 14, 1994 was 122,800 shares (Rockefeller Center Properties). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four of the component stocks are currently the subject of trading in equity options, and the balance of the component stocks meet the criteria for allowing the listing of equity options under CBOE Rule 5.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Maintenance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index will be maintained by the CBOE. The CBOE may change the composition of the Index at any time, subject to compliance with the maintenance criteria discussed herein, to reflect conditions in REIT markets. If it becomes necessary to replace a security in the Index, the Exchange represents that it will make every effort to add new REITs that are representative of REIT markets as a whole and will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement security. Further, securities may be replaced in the event of certain corporate events, such as takeovers or mergers, that change the nature of the security. If, however, the Exchange determines to increase the number of Index component securities to greater than 33 or reduce the number of Index component securities to fewer than 17, the CBOE will seek and obtain Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before listing new strike price or expiration month series of REIT Index options and Index LEAPS. In addition, in choosing replacement securities for the Index, the CBOE will be required to ensure that at least 90 percent of the weight of the Index continues to be comprised of REITs that are eligible for standardized options trading. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE's options listing standards, which are uniform among the options exchanges, provide that a security underlying an option must, among other things, meet the following requirements: (1) the public float must be at least 7,000,000 shares; (2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 shareholders; (3) trading volume must have been at least 2.4 million shares over the preceding 12 months; and (4) the market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business days during the preceding three calendar months.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  CBOE Rule 5.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Applicability of CBOE Rules Regarding Index Options <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules in Chapter XXIV of the CBOE Rules will be applicable to REIT Index options and full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS. Those rules address, among other things, the applicable position and exercise limits, policies regarding trading halts and suspensions, and margin treatment for narrow-based index options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Calculation of the Index <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The REIT Index is a price-weighted index and reflects changes in the prices of the Index component securities relative to the Index's base date of January 3, 1994. Specifically, the Index value is calculated by adding the prices of the component REITs and then dividing this summation by a divisor that is equal to the number of components of the Index to get the average price. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect non-market changes in the prices of the component securities as well as changes in the composition of the Index. Changes that may result in divisor adjustments include, but are not limited to, removal and replacement of a component REIT stock, component stock splits, and the financial restructuring of a component stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

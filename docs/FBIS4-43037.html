			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jacques Santer by Jean de la </F> Gueriviere; place and date not given: "Each Country Must Be  Able To Add Its Ingredient to the Union"]    [Text] [Gueriviere] You are putting yourself before the  voters after 10 years of a coalition government with the  Socialists. What lessons have you learned from this alliance,  and how do you differentiate yourself from your partners?    [Santer] Since 1984, we have been committed to a policy of  consolidating and transforming the country. We have  restructured our steel industry and developed our tertiary  sector, especially by consolidating the financial market and the  audiovisual sector. We managed to execute these deep-rooted  changes thanks to an economic and social policy that has enabled  us to fulfil the convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht  Treaty regarding economic and monetary union. Our concern was  to position Luxembourg in this new Europe.    I think the two parties in the coalition converge in this  respect, in so far as they are both committed to a social model  that is also backed by our trade unions. We succeeded with this  change, which was extremely deep and also vital for our country,  in which two-thirds of all jobs in the steel industry were  eliminated, without any social troubles. Of course, our parties  -- I would not say the government -- have slightly different  economic and financial orientations, but it is up to the  government to integrate the various sensibilities into a  comprehensive policy. A coalition government is a marriage of  convenience lasting a specific period of time.    [Gueriviere] You have reached the end of this marriage of  convenience. Are you now ready to ally yourself with the  liberals if, as they hope to do, they oust the Socialists?    [Santer] We are not dismissing any party out of hand, no  matter what it is, as long as it is democratic, of course. I  myself was a member of a coalition with the Liberals. However,  we here in Luxembourg are not in the habit of making  declarations of intent before the voters have made their choice.    [Gueriviere] This would appear to cloud the image of the  parties and complicate the voters' choice. But do not all the  majority parties resemble each other as far as the voters are  concerned?    [Santer] We are presenting a program and results. We have  fundamentally reformed the funding of the social security  system, in that we used taxation to finance retirements and in  that we were able to maintain our social security contributions  at a low cost. In this respect, we are complying with the  recommendations set out in the white paper by Jacques Delors  regarding taxation on the indirect cost of labor.    The Luxembourg model as we conceive it, with comanagement in  companies and union participation via professional bodies, made  it possible to safeguard the social peace. Twice a year, there  is a round of tripartite negotiations to facilitate a dialogue  between the government, employers, and employees. The outcome  of these tripartite agreements is submitted to the Chamber of  Deputies and it is Parliament that has the last word in deciding  whether or not to ratify the agreements. The art lies in  seeking a common denominator among the current trends.    In the latest agreements, the employers did not get  everything they wanted, nor did the trade unions, just as the  government was unable to impose all its views. However,  overall, we succeeded in making our businesses more competitive  by further lowering wage costs. This was done by having the  state take charge of family allowance benefits. In exchange for  a guarantee of employment, the unions agreed to a certain level  of wage restraint.    [Gueriviere] Regarding the future of the European Union  [EU],  what will your attitude be at the intergovernmental conference  on the institutions to be held in 1996, if the rights acquired  by the Union's "small countries" are called into question in the  name of greater EU efficiency?    [Santer] Our position is very clear. We agree to rearranging  the institutions in order to make them more efficient, but we  feel that, in the main EU bodies, we must now maintain the  principle that each country participates "with an equal level of  dignity," as President Mitterrand said during his state visit  here in Luxembourg. Nor must we overlook the contribution made  by "small- and medium-sized" countries to EU construction. I  believe that a failure to take this contribution into account  would be to deny the European spirit and the Community spirit,  which is based on solidarity. The United States of Europe will  not be put together along the lines of the United States of  America, because our entire history runs counter to that sort of  approach. There will always be Luxembourgers, just as there  will always be Frenchmen, Germans, and Italians. Our wealth  lies in this diversity, and every country must be able to  contribute its ingredient to the Union.    [Gueriviere] Yes, but in observing the campaign for the  European and legislative elections in Luxembourg, one can see  nationalist reactions. Did you not underestimate your  population's sense of national identity?    [Santer] Luxembourg is normally extremely reticent about  anything from the outside, given that it is the smallest country  in the EU. However, we must be well aware that our entire  modern history shows that a "small" country like ours can  survive economically and politically in a large group without  losing its own identity. Our history has taught us that our  position is becoming stronger in that we are sharing sovereignty  with others. In the Maastricht Treaty, we do not lose part of  our sovereignty, we simply transfer it to supranational bodies  where this sovereignty is jointly wielded with our partners. By  doing this we gain political importance. Moreover, our country,  which was conceived as a buffer state between France and old  Prussia, has every interest in consolidating peace. It is our  mission to make the voters understand this.    [Gueriviere] In a Europe conceived with six or 12 members,  it  was clear that Luxembourg, as a founder member, played a role  that was out of proportion to its true weight. With  enlargement, does that not risk becoming less true?    [Santer] If, for example, we go by the number of deputies we  have in the European Parliament, then you are right. However, I  think I can say, and here I am going by my personal experience,  that a small country can have an influence in the Union. An  influence which is all the greater since it is isolated.    [Gueriviere] Luxembourg has just announced that it is  joining  the Eurocorps. What does that mean in actual fact?    [Santer] We made and announced a decision of principle. Now,  it is a matter of preparing our participation by seeing how we  can make a battalion available to NATO and at the same time  participate in the Eurocorps. We are talking to NATO about this.    [Gueriviere] At the European Council in Corfu, will you  support Jean-Luc Dehaene as successor to Jacques Delors, rather  than the candidate from the Netherlands, which is your other  partner in the Benelux?    [Santer] That is a delicate question! I have always said  that I would support a Benelux and Christian Democrat candidate.  The problem is that there are two! What I can tell you is that  putting off the decision until later sends a bad signal about  the functioning of our institutions and would not be credible to  public opinion.</p>

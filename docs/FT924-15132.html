			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent drops as economic outlook worsens OCTOBER's record as a month for stock market crashes, combined with falls in currencies and on Wall Street and weekend comment on domestic economic prospects, put European bourses in a seriously fragile mood yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT dropped on weekend gloom about job cuts, the DAX index falling 53.64 to a new 20-month low of 1,424.40; it could have broken down through 1,400, said a dealer, if Frankfurt trading hours had matched those of London. UK holders of German stocks realised that they still had profits to take in sterling terms. The drop in share prices reflected institutional selling in an illiquid market, although turnover rose on the day. Downgrades continued, and widened as Nikko Europe brought 1992 earnings growth projections for the market down from a plus of 8 per cent at the beginning of the year to minus 5 per cent yesterday. Export stocks came under pressure again. In carmakers, Warburgs downgraded Volkswagen which dropped 6 per cent to DM263.20, and extended its drop to 9.3 per cent at the London post-bourse close. James Capel was a heavy seller of BMW, and of Mannesmann where it had downgraded its EPS projection from DM11 to DM8 for next year. The shares dropped 5.8 per cent to DM201.50. Chemicals also came under heavy selling pressure. Hoechst fared worst, off DM11.20 at DM218.10 on a recent negative report on bulk plastics of which the company is the biggest exporter. PARIS tumbled as foreign and domestic investors sold heavily and there was a suspicion that the brief recovery towards the close was due to support buying by the government-owned Caisse des Depots. The CAC-40 index dropped below the important 1,600 level to 1,577.74 before closing 72.30 lower at 1,611.04 in heavy turnover of FFr3.4bn. Dealers said that they expected a technical bounce today but that institutions would use this as an opportunity to offload more stock. They added that the market's trend remained downwards, with the new trading range at between 1,500 and 1,600. Selling was across the board, though one of the most prominent losers was Eurotunnel which dropped FFr4.95 or 14 per cent to FFr30.35. Investors were disappointed by official comments made an analysts' meeting yesterday. MILAN was depressed by a flood of orders to sell Stet from foreign and domestic investors, disgusted by Friday's news that the telecommunications company was going to pay L700bn for an 83.3 per cent stake in the state software company, Finsiel. The 23.4 per cent drop in Stet shares, continued weakness of the lira against the mark and falls on foreign bourses worried the market. But the Comit index contained its loss to 6.9 points at 358.37, since trading in other shares was quiet. The big volume in Stet - estimated to be at least 13m ordinary shares - boosted the day's turnover to around L140bn from Friday's L125bn. Stet ordinary shares fell L315 to L1,035 at the official fixing, though trading in the stock had initially been suspended because of an order imbalance. James Capel, echoing the view held by other market participants, said the the government's decision to sell Finsiel to Stet was blatantly political, ignored the wishes and rights of minority shareholders and stuffed Stet with a wholly incompatible business. The broker now regarded Stet as an outright sell since the transaction would result in heavy dilution and higher interest costs, and consequently cut its 1993 forecast for group net income by L80bn to L1,490bn. AMSTERDAM fell steadily in line with neighbouring markets as the CBS Tendency index closed down 4.00 at 106.1. Akzo was one of the day's biggest losers, down Fl 7.60 or 5.4 per cent at Fl 132.80 while Elsevier, Fl 4.80 lower at Fl 104.60, was also affected by sterling's weakness. Nedlloyd, which rose at the opening on news of stakebuilding by DNO, the Norwegian oil group, fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 32.70. ZURICH selling centred on industrial blue chips as the SMI index fell 80.3 to 1,787.38. The dollar-sensitive pharmaceuticals featured with Ciba-Geigy down SFr21 to SFr608, Sandoz SFr70 francs to SFr2,720 and Roche SFr160 to SFr3,380. However, the defensive qualities of the banking sector were not so evident as in some other bourses, as UBS fell SFr24 to SFr75, SBC by SFr7 to SFr269 and CS Holding by SFr90 to SFr1,875. STOCKHOLM's concern over high interest rates and currency turbulence sent the Affarsvarlden General index down 42.2 to a new 1992 low of 1639.0 in moderate turnover of SKr443m after SKr350m. Stora B fell SKr11 to SKr175 after the forestry and paper group revealed an eight-month loss after a corresponding profit last year. MADRID was unimpressed by the partial relaxation of capital controls and the general index fell 6.8 to 179.48 with the losses spread throughout the large blue chip stocks. Turnover was Pta13.4bn. Banesto went against the trend with a Pta35 rise to Pta1,955. Elsewhere Repsol weakened Pta135 to Pta2,090 while Telefonica extended last week's losses, down Pta53 to Pta876. VIENNA's fall was largely the result of interbank transactions, dealers said. The ATX index shed 29.87 or 3.7 per cent to 769.45.  --------------------------------------------------------------------               EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS - CHANGES ON DAY  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Market                  Fall %        Market                 Fall %  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Sweden                     6.2        Germany                   3.6 Norway                     4.8        Spain                     3.6 Switzerland                4.3        Belgium                   3.3 France                     4.3        Finland                   2.5 Austria                    3.7        Denmark                   1.9 Netherlands                3.6        Italy                     1.9  --------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - OCT 5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Hourly changes   Open    11.30am  12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     4 pm     close  966.75   963.15   962.43   961.63   960.33   957.69   944.69   937.42  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  966.75            Day's Low  937.17  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Oct 2          Oct 1         Sep 30         Sep 29        Sep 28    993.56         1006.01       1003.44        1009.98       1016.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

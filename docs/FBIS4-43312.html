			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn June 10 (CTK) -- Some of the postwar decrees  of Czechoslovak President Edvard Benes contradict international  law embedded in the valid Czech Constitution, the Sudeten German  Landsmannschaft (SL) says in a statement issued in Munich today.    The statement has come in reaction to a complaint recently  lodged with the Brno-based Constitutional Court by a Czech  citizen of German nationality living in Liberec, North Bohemia,  who demands that some of Benes's decrees be revised and possibly  rescinded.    Not mentioning the name of Benes, the SL's statement says  that the legal order of a democratic state cannot be built on  the "moving sands" of the decrees of a "self-styled president"  that it says contradict international law. The Sudeten German  Landsmannschaft would welcome it if the Czech Constitutional  Court "demonstrate such a sovereignty," which is characteristic  of the Constitutional Court in Germany, the SL says.    "The abolition of certain decrees would by no means  destabilise the Czech Republic's legal system," the statement  says. "The abrogation of the decrees on `forced labour,' the  dissolution of the German University in Prague and the German  Evangelic Church, the "recolonisation of the Sudetenland," and  on "legalising crimes committed against the expelled," would  mean a chance for a new fundamental beginning, the SL believes.    The abolition of these decrees would not automatically mean  the renewal of the initial legal state, the SL says. It  believes, however, that it is necessary that members of the  "groups discriminated against thus far" -- and not only Sudeten  Germans -- be able to participate in the Czech Republic's  development as full-fledged citizens.</p>

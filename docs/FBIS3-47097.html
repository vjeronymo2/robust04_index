			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] THE Burmese junta's calls for ceasefire  negotiations with armed ethnic groups have started to bear fruit  with the Karen, Karenni and Mon -- the final hold-out minorities  -- either being pressed to enter talks or already tied to a  "loose truce" with Rangoon. [passage omitted]    "Since the beginning of this year (1993), we have come under  increasing pressure from some Thai sources, most probably in the  line with the Thai government policy of constructive engagement  with Slorc," leaders of the three ethnic groups said in a signed  joint letter to one of Thailand's highest institutions.    "Some forms of pressure involve the threat to push our  refugees back into the war zone or cut off food supplies, and  restricting our travel for medical treatment ...    "Our understanding is that for positive or constructive  results, pressure should be applied equally to both sides.    "Actions perceived as not evenhanded could only be  counter-productive," they said.    A copy of the Dec 3 letter signed by Karen leader Gen Bo  Mya,  Karenni leader Saw Maw Reh and Mon leader Nai Shwe Kyin was  obtained by THE NATION. [passage omitted]    According to well-informed border sources, the Mon and Slorc  agreed at a meeting late last year in Moulmein, in Burma's Mon  State, to an "unofficial" or "loose truce deal". The deal  effectively ends the fighting in southern Burma's Thaton, Mergui  and Tavoy areas.    Several more rounds of talks are needed to finalise details  before an actual truce agreement can be concluded, said the  sources.    Burmese southern commander Maj Gen Ket Sein headed the  Burmese negotiating team while Nai Htaw Mon a senior military  affairs officer, led the Mon delegation to the Moulmein meeting.    Meanwhile, the Karenni have delegated a three-member mission  to meet Slorc officials this week, according to a senior Karenni  leader, Abel Tweed.    He said Karenni Deputy Army Chief Maj Aung Mya will head the  team, which also includes Karenni officials Paulu and Shan Reh,  to a "preliminary meeting" in Daw Gnew Khu, a small border  village of about two-days walk from the Thai border.    Tweed said no agenda has been set. The forum will look into  the possibilities of further talks.    Tweed conceded that the bilateral talks could eventually  lead  to a military ceasefire, but said the Karenni National  Progressive Party has not abandoned its political objective of  an independent Karenni state.    He expressed the hope that future peace talks would be held  in Thailand, and said the Karenni mistrust Slorc too much to  ever go to Rangoon.    "They (Slorc) refused to meet in Bangkok or Chiang Mai but  if  there is some progress from the (first) meeting then we may have  the next talks in Thailand... Thai authorities are willing to  host peace talks either in Chiang Mai or Mae Hong Son if both  sides agree," said Tweed.    Sources said the Burmese armed forces attache in Bangkok,  Col  Thein Swe, travelled to Mae Hong Son at the end of last year to  propose that the two sides meet.    As for the Karen, their leader Gen Bo Mya sent a letter last  week to Prime Minister Chuan Likphai urging the Thai government  to "persuade" or "pressure" Slorc to enter into a peace dialogue  with the collective ethnic opposition.    An informed border source said that the Karen group has  finally agreed to meet Rangoon officials to seek out common  ground for further truce negotiations.    The source said the group has already appointed a team to  engage in "preliminary talks" with Slorc.    It was not known when they will meet. The source added that  Gen Bo Mya at a meeting last Friday with a senior Thai security  general urged Thailand to host the Karen-Slorc talks.    Bo Mya sent a similar letter, which bears his title as  chairman of the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), to Foreign  Minister Prasong Sunsiri and Interior Minister Gen Chawalit  Yongchaiyut. [passage omitted]    In his letter, Bo Mya accused Slorc of trying to disunite  the  opposition and warned Rangoon's policy of approaching individual  groups would not lead to "a stable peace" or a "comprehensive  solution" to the problems in Burma.    "Slorc's insistence, needless to say, could only be viewed  as  a crude attempt to divide the resistance forces and, at the same  time, to improve its international image," he said.    "Moreover, Slorc's approach would never lead to a stable  peace as desired by the people, and a comprehensive solution to  the problems besetting the country.    "Whatever the circumstances, the DAB is the only  organisation  that can bring about general reconciliation and peace in the  whole country.    "If you have the means to persuade or make pressure bear on  Slorc, we would like to urge you to use it for the emergence of  a peace negotiation between the Slorc and the DAB as a whole,"  said the Karen leader.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Leonid Kravchuk for foreign </F> journalists on his visit to the United States in Kiev on 1 March  -- recorded]    [Text] [Kravchuk] The official visit by the president of  Ukraine to the United States will begin on 3 March and will be  the second official visit to the United States. I am convinced  that after we signed the trilateral agreement in Moscow, this  visit will become a turning point in the establishment of  relations between Ukraine and the United States. Another thing  I would like to emphasize is the fact that the preparation for  the visit is taking place in a good atmosphere. All the issues  put on the agenda, and all the draft agreements upon which the  experts are working, agree with the interests of both Ukraine  and the United States.    I attach great importance to this visit, and hope that our  plans and forecasts will be accomplished. Now I am ready to  answer your questions.    [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Radio  Liberty  Russian service. Esteemed Mr. President, after your statement  of 18 February this year [words indistinct] that you believe  early presidential elections inexpedient, do you realize that in  the eyes of the U.S. Administration and the entire Western  community, because the parliament of Ukraine in fact failed to  ratify the January agreement, you remain the sole guarantor of  its implementation?    [Kravchuk] I will start from the end: I do not think the  parliament failed to ratify it. The parliament ratified START-I  and made the decision to exchange instruments of ratification,  and the parliament lifted its reservations on Paragraph 5 of the  Lisbon Protocol, which is interpreted as Ukraine's commitment to  join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as a nonnuclear  state. Thus, the parliament did not fail in anything, but made  an important step forward. Another thing is that the parliament  did not ratify the NPT -- that is also true.    Second, my statement had to do with the situation that  emerged today and that can emerge, according to the forecasts,  in April, May, or June. I explained this both in my interview  for Radio Liberty and in my interview for our television. I  never say everything at once, however; I always leave some room  for future clarification. You know that the parliament's  decisions on early elections of the parliament and president  were made under the pressure of a miners' strike. I agreed that  such elections were needed, but I do not agree that it should  become customary in the life of the society for elections and  re-elections to be held under the pressure of a strike.  Agreeing to that sort of thing, one will have to agree that we  are not building a civilized or a law-governed society. My  participation in an early election would mean that I agree to  that. That is why I am saying this to emphasize that I have  stood and do stand for a law-governed and civilized state, and I  will do my best to ensure that this state is being built in  Ukraine. Therefore, the president may agree to any steps  required by the situation at hand, but his personal involvement  would mean that he agrees, not only theoretically but also  practically, with an unlawful situation.    [Rudenko] Larysa Rudenko, SVOBODA newspaper. Mr. President,  a body has been set up within the Cabinet of Ministers to deal  with clearing up enterprises. Does that mean that large  emissions will be launched again? Which enterprises, do you  think, need to be saved from bankruptcy?    [Kravchuk] First, those that manufacture products needed for  Ukraine must be saved. Also those that manufacture products  that can be sold and bring hard currency to Ukraine must be  saved. Those that will be of crucial significance in the future  structure of Ukraine's economy must be saved. There is no point  in saving the rest, which manufacture products that may not be  needed in the future and may not be competitive in quality and  technological standards. This is a conceptual principle that  was also voiced in Russian President Yeltsin's address to the  joint session of the Federal Assembly and Duma. He also  emphasized that Russia would manufacture products needed for  Russia. Taking this into account, I think that Belarus will  also manufacture products needed for Belarus which can also be  competitive. Taking this into account we must create a market  in the CIS instead of crying over broken ties. If we should  restore, as some wish, all the ties, we will have to restore the  Soviet Union and the entire Soviet economy.    The budget and the decisions made by the Cabinet of  Ministers  have nothing to do with the emission. They have to do only with  those problems that are agreed upon today with the Cabinet of  Ministers and the National Bank concerning the granting of  appropriate credits to enterprises needed for Ukraine.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, as far as I  understand, the issue of providing Ukraine with guarantees is  not in a very good state. Do you think that your visit to the  United States can improve the situation in this respect, because  we understand this situation has to do with the attitude of the  U.S. Administration?    [Kravchuk] I do not think that anything will change on paper  regarding the guarantees. The trilateral agreement in Moscow, a  document that the three of us signed, ties guarantees to  Ukraine's accession to the NPT. That is, the issue of  guarantees has been resolved in principle, but the provision of  guarantees and putting them in a documented form is tied to  Ukraine's accession to the NPT. I do not think this position  will be called into question or will be subject to change.  Another matter is that we will be able to clarify again  conceptually the essence and the nature of guarantees, textually  and conceptually. The provision of guarantees, however, I must  stress, is tied to Ukraine's accession to the NPT.    [Unidentified correpondent] Will the instruments of  ratification be exchanged in Washington, and if not, where? The  second question, apart from $350 million, what other aid do you  expect from the United States? Third, can you explain to  American readers, how can an independent Ukraine that is outside  Russia's sphere of interest be within the U.S. sphere of  interests?    [Kravchuk] I will have, if nothing changes, a telephone  conversation today with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and we will  agree upon the issue of exchange of ratification instruments.  This needs to be agreed by both sides, not only by Ukraine.  The second question on the U.S. aid, specifically the $300  million: With all the importance of $300 million, or even a  lesser figure, for Ukraine, I am going to America not for the  $300 million, but for the establishment of large-scale economic  cooperation. To revive Ukraine's economy on market foundations  and for Ukraine to join market structures, including European  and world ones, we need billions in funds, powerful investments,  an influx of private capital, and others. All this needs  establishment of large-scale economic cooperation.    For your third question -- it is a rather original one,  implying certain complications, both politically and otherwise.  Ukraine is a member of the CIS, and as a member of the CIS, it  is placed within a political, economic, and legal area  determined by the CIS documents. The CIS documents do not  preclude any state from joining other structures, in Europe or  worldwide, including political ones.    We in Ukraine understand very well that Ukraine, and not  only  Ukraine, but also other European countries -- I mean the  European countries of the CIS and the former Warsaw Pact -- are  today under a certain influence of the Russian policy. The  question is, what kind of influence is it? Is that an influence  of democratic and market- oriented transformations, or is it an  influence which certain political forces in Russia want to  impose today? We are in favor of cooperation, partnership, and  interaction with Russia. Everybody must understand, however,  that Russia will never resign itself to playing a mediocre role  in the world. Russia cannot renounce its thousand-year-old  history; this would not be understood either by the Russians or  by Russian politicians. The question is, how can we prevent the  transformation of this concept into an imperial one? Therefore,  we cannot set ourselves euphoric goals, to have Russia suddenly  renounce its role in the world and in Europe. It is unfeasible.  However, we -- I mean Ukraine -- can and want to give an  opportunity to the states of the world to balance out the  politics in Europe.    I would even say that we can, given the will and assistance  to Ukraine, open the road for democracy to the east, from  Europe's old borders. We can also play a certain part in the  creation of a [word indistinct] market in Central Europe and  further east. Thus, I am talking about a stabilizing role for  Ukraine. However, to see that happen, the Western countries  must decide whether they can assist Ukraine in this, while  Ukraine is ready, because Ukraine currently has no political or  conceptual complications in this respect. We all need to assist  both Russia and Ukraine, and others, in the development of  democratic processes.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think the refusal of the  Supreme Council to join the NPT will affect the granting of aid  to Ukraine by the United States? When do you expect Ukraine to  join the NPT? Another question, will you discuss the issue of  guaranteeing American investments by Ukraine?    [Kravchuk] I will reply in several theses. The first thesis  is that, having ratified Paragraph 5 of the Lisbon Protocol,  Ukraine in fact announced its commitment to join the NPT. I  will try to convince the American business community,  politicians, the President and the public that Ukraine has its  peculiarity as a country having nuclear arms on its territory.  The peculiarity is that Ukraine cannot use its nuclear arms and  does not pose a potential threat to the United States.  Therefore, the main thing is that Ukraine has practically begun  to carry out the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow, thus  creating favorable conditions for its relations with the United  States. That is why there is no need to tie so closely all the  documents and relations between Ukraine and the United States  with accession to the NPT. Our accession has its specifics,  because Ukraine, I stress again, is not a nuclear state.  Moreover, everybody understands that even if someone should  wish this, Ukraine will not be able any time soon to become a  state that produces nuclear arms or has all the components of a  nuclear state.    The guarantees for investments will be discussed. We have an  agreement called Treaty Between Ukraine and the United States on  the Encouragement and Mutual Safeguarding of Investments. This  agreement has been fully coordinated and finalized.    [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr.  President, are you worried by the fact that if the election  fails to take place in March, the situation can get out of hand  and will not be possible to deal with by normal means?    [Kravchuk] Of course I am worried, but I attach greater  importance to the economic situation, rather than to the  question whether the election will take place or not, although I  always stressed that I would like the election to take place at  once. Even if the election fails to take place, there is an  executive authority, there is a president, there are local power  structures, presidential representatives, and councils that  perform their functions today, and there will be no great  complications. However, the economic situation can be  complicated even by the problems involved during the election to  the Supreme Council.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, you emphasized  that a priority in your policy toward Washington is the  expansion of economic relations with the United States. What  can Ukraine offer to the United States, and what would you like  to receive from the United States?    [Kravchuk] I would like the United States and the European  states to actually settle the issue of quotas for Ukrainian  goods, and then we would have a great deal to offer. This is  first. Second, we have a rather powerful Black Sea shipping  company, Blasco, but the main cargoes are carried not by our  ships, but by ships of third countries. We could do this  ourselves and make money. As for the United States, I stress  again, I would wish for large-scale economic cooperation, to  open the road for private investments, to open the road for  investment, genuine trade, scientific, and technical cooperation  in all areas. Then we would feel a real boost to economic  transformations in Ukraine and to normal cooperation in the  economy. I would say this: Ukraine is a young state and does  not have a lot of experience. The United States, with its  possibilities and experience, could lead Ukraine to the economic  market, the scientific market, the technological market, and  give us an opportunity to work there, to sell and earn, and to  buy.    [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr.  President, can you name all the agreements that are (?prepared  for signing in Washington)?    [Kravchuk] The first agreement: Treaty Between Ukraine and  the United States of America on the Encouragement and Mutual  Safeguarding of Investments; second: Convention Between the  Government of the United States and the Government of Ukraine on  the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Tax Evasion  in Respect of the Income and Capital Tax; third agreement: Joint  Statement on the Main Principles of Cooperation in the Sphere of  Agriculture; fourth: Statement of Intent on the Granting of  Expertise in the Sphere of Agriculture Between the Ministry of  Agriculture and Food of Ukraine and the Department of  Agriculture of the United States; next, a document on the sphere  of competence of the Ukrainian-American Joint Commission for  Assistance to the Development of Trade and Investment. The  other four agreements are at the stage of coordination. The  first is a treaty between the Goods and Credit Corporation of  the United States and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture of  Ukraine; an agreement between the Governments of Ukraine and the  United States on cooperation in the sphere of science and  technology. Next, an agreement on protection and conservation  of cultural heritage, and a joint statement on cooperation in  the sphere of trade and economy. The last two have already been  mentioned -- a charter and a treaty between the ministries of  defense.    [Unidentified correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Kravchuk] Well, Oksana Baiul is a world champion. I met  her, if I recall, with a glass of champagne, and I greeted her  as a world champion. Naturally, when I saw it on television,  for me it was not just the joy of a human being. It was very  important. It was the first time Ukraine appeared as an  independent team, it was the first time it won two medals --  gold and bronze. Thus, Ukraine makes its appearance as a world  power. It is important that it be represented by such young,  beautiful, and gentle people as Oksana Baiul.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] leader  Afonso Dhlakama left Portugal about an hour ago. Before  leaving, he expressed his confidence in the role of Portuguese  investors in Mozambique. He described the investment as  essential to peace. Despite being pleased, Dhlakama criticized  the Portuguese Government once more. He said the government  should have acted sooner, and that would have prevented death  and destruction in Mozambique.    [Begin Dhlakama recording] I have always criticized some of  the Portuguese Government's attitudes. This time I told PUBLICO  that things have changed and that is why many people died in my  country. I have said before that if the Portuguese Government  had understood five years ago that it was necessary for the  sides to negotiate, it would have pressured the regime, the  Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] government, and perhaps  only a few people would have died, and perhaps what happened --  the destruction -- could have been prevented. I blame the  Portuguese Government for this. [end recording]</p>

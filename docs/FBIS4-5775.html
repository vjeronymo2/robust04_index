			<p>BFN     [Text] Hiroshima, April 13 KYODO -- A forum on atomic  energy started a three-day conference Wednesday [13 April] in  this atomic-bombed city to discuss the peaceful uses of nuclear  energy.    Takashi Mukaibo, chairman of the Japan Atomic Industrial  Forum, urged participants to discuss the elimination of nuclear  weapons and the peaceful uses of atomic energy as the 50th  anniversary of A-bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki is  approaching.    About 1,500 atomic power specialists from Japan and abroad  are taking part in the 27th annual conference.    Around the conference hall in central Hiroshima, about 30  antinuclear activists protested the meeting.    Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), told the meeting that the IAEA will hold a  special meeting on April 21 and 22 in Vienna to discuss the  Chernobyl nuclear reactors in Ukraine.    Chernobyl was the scene of one of the world's most serious  nuclear accidents in 1986. Although the nuclear reactor  involved in the accident has not been operational, two other  reactors have since been in operation. The Ukrainian government  decided to continue to operate the two reactors and has asked  the IAEA to investigate safety.    On Thursday, atomic power advocates are scheduled to meet  with citizens of Hiroshima and victims of the 1945 atomic  bombing, including the head of an association of Korean victims  of the nuclear holocaust, Yi Sil-gun [name as received], for an  exchange of opinions.</p>

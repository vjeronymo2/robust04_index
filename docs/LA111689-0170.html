			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AVALON IS WHERE THIS PRINCE'S HEART IS, AFTER ALL  </P> <P> In the end, he couldn't bring himself to leave island life behind.  </P> <P> Avalon City Manager Chuck Prince, who submitted his resignation last weekend,  on Wednesday announced he changed his mind -- as surprised city officials  abruptly called off their search for a replacement.  </P> <P> Never mind that Prince had already taken a job as redevelopment manager for the  city of South Lake Tahoe.  </P> <P> "It came down to not being able to leave the island," Prince said. "I've become  accustomed to this place much quicker than I thought."  </P> <P> Local officials said they were delighted that Prince, 34, is remaining on Santa  Catalina Island, where he had been Avalon's city manager for less than a year  but had quickly won over the tight-knit community.  </P> <P> "We're very happy with Mr. Prince," said Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith, who had  already telephoned five job finalists to find a new candidate for the  $62,000-a-year post.  </P> <P> Obviously, South Lake Tahoe officials were less pleased.  </P> <P> "I'm really left shocked and breathless," said South Lake Tahoe City Manager  Kerry Miller. "This leaves us in a publicly embarassing situation."  </P> <P> Prince, who is from Northern California, said the South Lake Tahoe offer  attracted him because it "was an opportunity to return to that part of the  state. But when you balance that off against Catalina, Catalina wins." ADRIANNE  GOODMAN  </P></p>

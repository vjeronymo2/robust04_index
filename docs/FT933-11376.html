			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie backs away from 2,900 mark MOVES towards lower interest rates in Germany and a successful outcome to the auction of British government bonds were not enough to take the London stock market through the higher end of its technical trading range yesterday. After challenging the Footsie 2,895 area at the day's peak, the market gave back most of its gains later, with the final plus of only 4.8 to 2,884.2 on the index reflecting little more than rises in Glaxo and Wellcome, which had announced important marketing agreements with Warner-Lambert, of the US. Investors were clearly taking profits in a stock market which must today face significant challenges to its recent recovery of confidence. The stock market was not completely convinced by the money market arguments that yesterday's reduction in German repurchase rates would mean a cut in Bundesbank discount rate today, followed by a cut in UK base rates tomorrow. A  1/4 point reduction in German discount rate would not be enough, according to UK analysts, and Friday morning is certain to bring bad news on the Christchurch by-election showing of Mr John Major's Conservative party. However, the news from Germany pushed the Footsie ahead by 16.3 at midsession, and the blue chip shares were also encouraged by a brief move above 2,900 in the FT-SE 100 September futures contract. Equities also responded to strength in government bonds following news that the Pounds 3.25bn bond auction had attracted a 2.29 times cover and a healthily narrow spread of bid prices. But with the current equity trading account closing tomorrow night, profit-takers were unwilling to leave share gains to run any further. In its new trading session, Wall Street extended its fall away from its recent peak to show a loss of 16 Dow points in London hours yesterday. The retreat by the stock market during the second half of the session was all the greater since it was offset by the sharp rises in Glaxo and Wellcome, which between them represented a 4-point gain on the Footsie. The brighter tone in equities was better displayed in the second line stocks, and reflected in a 6.1 gain in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed at a new high of 3,244.8. Seaq business jumped to 690m shares yesterday, with non-Footsie shares making up about 60 per cent of the total, a relatively high percentage. On Tuesday, 662.6m shares through the Seaq network were worth Pounds 1.58bn in terms of retail, or customer, busi-ness - with this figure boosted by the Pounds 76m placing of shares in Pearson by Mr Rupert Murdoch. Strategists were not surprised to see the stock market balk at the Footsie 2,900 area, but drew attention to successful placings of large lines of stock at, or close, to market prices. If a cut in base rates materialises within the next few days, this may provide the impetus to take the Footsie above 2,900 again. But the big institutions are likely to remain wary if the market moves to challenge the all-time peak of 2,957.3 achieved on March 8. Prospects for the London stock market today will hang on the meeting at mid-morning of the Bundesbank policy council, with the global money markets likely to call the tune.</p>

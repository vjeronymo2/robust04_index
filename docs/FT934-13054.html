			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Maximum Imro fine rises to Pounds 1m IMRO, the self-regulating body for the fund-management industry, has substantially increased the fines that can be levied under its disciplinary procedures. The maximum fine which can be awarded against a member for any single charge by its own disciplinary committee is to rise from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 1m. This contrasts with an alternative, more formal membership tribunal operated by Imro which has no ceiling on fines. The increase in fines under the informal disciplinary committee is part of a wider process of reforming Imro's regulatory procedures. The organisation is also considering giving greater publicity to findings reached by the informal 'first-tier' disciplinary committees. The decision to raise the fines was approved at a board meeting earlier this week, and follows a wider restructuring of Imro after criticisms made against it in the last two years. The disciplinary committees comprise members of Imro's board, and have been widely used in cases including that against Invesco-MIM, which was fined a record total of Pounds 750,000 in June for a range of regulatory breaches in connection with the Maxwell affair. The more formal disciplinary procedure involves a hearing before an independent membership tribunal. Only two of the organisation's members have chosen this route since 1988, against about 30 using the informal route. 'All these moves are designed to make the disciplinary processes more speedy and simple,' said Mr David Brewster, Imro's legal director. Other changes over the next few months may include efforts to reduce response times in inquiries.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Technology: Scoring on the digital pitch - Tom Foremski believes US computing will fare better in the World Cup than the country's football team The US national soccer team is not expected to go far in the 1994 World Cup. But the country's high-tech companies hope to score strongly on the digital playing field with a state-of-the art computer network that will support all aspects of the competition. In what is probably the most sophisticated computer network ever assembled for a sporting event, US companies Sun Microsystems, Sybase, Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and Sprint, have collaborated to produce a sophisticated system for the US-hosted event. More than 1,000 Sun workstations running multimedia and other software from Sybase, and applications developed by EDS, will form a national and international network linking 12 sites where the games will be played. In the process, the Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) network will help propel World Cup USA 1994 into the ranks of the Fortune 200 companies from just a few dozen employees one year ago. This is an example of a so-called virtual corporation - comprising groups of people linked electronically for a specific purpose - growing to more than 15,000 staff during the summer games. The organisers of World Cup '94, which kicks off on June 17, face formidable challenges. Unlike Olympic events, where the sporting action takes place within a short distance of a central location, the computer network must tackle what could easily turn into a logistical nightmare. 'It's like fighting a war - the logistics problems are very similar,' says Norm Koo, technical office director for World Cup, at Sun. 'Things are further complicated because we have to take into account the national culture of each team. For example, Moslem teams need to be placed in hotels that can accommodate their special dietary needs. We also have to be very careful that all the hotels are of a similar standard. It would be easy to offend a national team if they thought we placed them in a lower standard hotel.' Nine US cities will host 52 matches played by 24 national teams during four weeks across four time zones. The computer network has to calculate all the logistics of moving teams and their support staff to the next location within two days of the match result. Security is another major task. The computer network will be used to streamline security procedures developed with the aid of the US defence department and the FBI. The system will track security clearances for more than 50,000 people, including team players and 15,000 media representatives from around the world. There are special safeguards to prevent computer virus infections and break-ins from computer hackers. This is done by creating 'fire walls', explains Bill Alaoglu, director of technology for the organising body, World Cup USA 1994. 'The system will not accept file transfers from outside the system.' Security badges will be issued at various sites connected to the computer network. The accreditation system is based on Sybase's Gain Momentum multimedia software from its subsidiary, Gain. 'We can feed video images of each person through the network to issue photo ID badges,' says Frank Strelau, director of product marketing at Sybase. 'Even if someone loses their badge, they can get another one within minutes at any stadium site.' Sybase's SQL Server database software will be used to deliver match results and other news and background information to thousands of journalists. The World Cup News Service will include a large database of historical information about previous World Cup games, statistics on each team, team member biographies and cultural information on each participating country. All this information will be in both English and Spanish, with about 80 per cent also available in French and German. The historical database, based on the records kept by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (Fifa), has also been useful to the organisers, Koo says. 'Selecting referees can be a difficult matter since the nationality of the referee and his experience are taken very seriously by each team. With the World Cup database, we can quickly check the qualifications of thousands of referees and which games they took part in.' Sun workstations and Sybase software are also used to create multimedia kiosks, connected to the computer network, in which users can access the World Cup database through a touch screen. The original plans called for the placement of the multimedia kiosks in public areas but they will now be found only in VIP areas. However, the World Cup will be accessible to travellers on the information superhighway. The World Cup News Service can be reached by computer users around the world with a subscription to the Fifa World Cup Bulletin Board Service which can be accessed through the commercial online service Compuserve. The action on the soccer field will be keyed into the network by special observers, providing an online real-time commentary to each game. US long distance carrier Sprint will handle the communications links for the network. Working with local telephone carriers, it will install more than 1,000 telephones at each of the nine cities hosting the games. It will also provide the data links connecting the nine stadium sites with EDS in Plano, Texas, the World Cup USA '94 offices in Century City, California, and the Fifa headquarters in Zurich. 'Each of the cities hosting the games has two data links,' explains Bill Heuston, national account manager for the World Cup at Sprint. 'This way, we can ensure that should one link fail, we have a back-up that will keep the network running.' The network is being managed by EDS, which specialises in setting up and running computer systems for large corporations. EDS is also developing the applications that run on the network and is co-ordinating the efforts of its other technology partners. The most important feature of the World Cup network is that it uses a client/server model rather than terminals linked to a central mainframe. The client/server model uses PCs and workstations connected to dozens of small but powerful computers called servers. This gives the network remarkable adaptability - allowing the organisers to quickly add and move hundreds of workstations at a time from site to site. Most of Alaoglu's technical expertise was gained in mainframes. 'With a client/server approach, we have much more flexibility. With mainframes, I've known it to take two weeks to bring in an extra terminal online,' he said. Harold Bendic, EDS account manager for World Cup '94, says the network performance is impressive. 'Because most of the processing is being done on the server in true client/server fashion, we're getting sub-second response times, even when we pull data from remote locations thousands of miles away.' The computer network has already undergone extensive testing when parts of it were used for the US Cup competition last year. The last few software applications are now being completed. The technology employed by World Cup USA '94 has helped it not only to achieve its stated goals in a short time, but also to earn the distinction of becoming the world's fastest growing 'virtual corporation' with important lessons to be found for other organisations. While the organisation will disband after the final games, parts of the computer network and equipment will survive, donated to the US Soccer Federation to help promote soccer in the US. The applications and the historical database will go to Fifa and the rest will be taken back by the participating companies. 'The virtual corporation approach means that I don't have an actual plant that I have to sell off. And I have outsourced all our computer and telecommunications requirements to our technology partners,' Alaoglu explains. As US and worldwide attention begins to shift to the World Cup soccer finals this summer, Sybase, Sun, EDS and Sprint hope that their efforts will create a valuable technology showcase. But with the competition looming, few in the US seem to know about it. Strelau, an Englishman, isn't concerned. 'Americans are very good at marketing. They'll get the message out.'</p>

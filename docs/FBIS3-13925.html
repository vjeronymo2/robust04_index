			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Roni Shaqed: "The Investigators Were Appointed </F> According to Clan Affiliation"]    [Text] Six days after the Hebron massacre, the Academics  Association offices in Hebron received the following faxed  message: "In view of my authority, and in view of the  circumstances, I hereby order the establishment of a commission  of inquiry into the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The  Commission is to present its findings to the PLO Executive  Committee as soon as possible." The message was signed by  "Yasir 'Arafat, President of the State of Palestine."    Attorney Hashim Salman al-Qawasimi was appointed chairman of  the commission of inquiry. He was named along with five  lawyers, three physicians, two clergymen, and two public  figures; all Hebron residents who represent the large families  in the city.    "I was surprised by the appointment," al-Qawasimi said last  week. "No one called me from Tunis, and no one in the  territories has spoken to me about setting up the committee."  Al-Qawasimi, 50, had worked for 17 years for the Civil  Administration judicial system in the West Bank. In his last  duty he was president of the Ramallah District Court. He has  engaged in private practice since 1985 and is not politically  affiliated with any camp. "Being a judicial investigator, I  take orders from no one, nor am I subject to any element," he  said. "This is a professional, not a political committee, and  its job is finding the truth."    Last Friday, a day after they received the letter of  appointment, the members of the committee convened and  established working procedures. The five lawyers were tasked  with collecting evidence and eye-witness testimonies. The three  physicians were to collect medical evidence. The remaining  three committee members were to collect evidence linked with the  cave itself. The committee wishes to end its work in two weeks,  at the most. To this end, they are assisted by Hebron attorneys  who collect testimonies of eye witnesses and the wounded.    The Hebron committee has managed to obtain testimonies from  several Israelis. "We received written testimonies which were  legally obtained. I will not say whether they were from  civilians or servicemen," al-Qawasimi said.    Last weekend, al-Qawasimi drafted a letter addressed to the  military governor of Hebron, asking for permission to question  Army soldiers and officers. He is about to send a copy of the  letter to the defense minister. "We have to question anyone who  witnessed the massacre, including Israelis. If we are allowed  to question Israelis, it would be a precedent and will serve as  basis for future cooperation," al-Qawasimi said.    [Shaqed] Why not cooperate with the Israeli commission of  inquiry?    [Al-Qawasimi] Our committee has no authority to judge those  responsible; we cannot judge those who govern us. Thus,  cooperation with the Israeli commission will never be on an  equal basis. Also, if we ask for their cooperation, they would  not agree." [end al-Qawasimi]    Fayiz Qapishah, a committee member considered a  representative of the families of the wounded, does not rule out  cooperation with the Israeli commission. "I am willing to  testify before the Israeli committee, provided that my remarks  are publicized. In the end, we want to find the truth."    Last week, the members of the committee did not listen to  Qol  Yisra'el in Arabic which carried live the Shamgar commission  deliberations with simultaneous translation. Only after the  Israeli committee members toured Hebron last Wednesday did those  siding with cooperating with it win the upper hand. One of the  offers raised was to officially ask Israel to cooperate with the  commission. This way the Hebron committee hopes to obtain  material which is in the hands of Israel, such as the videotapes  of the cave cameras.    Other voices were heard as well, however. "The Israeli  committee represents the side that committed the murders. It  was established to whitewash the Israeli administration," said  'Ali al-Qawasimi, who is considered the Hebron Fatah leader.  "Whether we trust the Shamgar committee will be determined in  lieu of its conclusions."    One of the central questions the Hebron committee wishes to  determine is whether Barukh Goldstein operated alone or was  aided by others. Many eyewitnesses told the committee that IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers also shot at the worshipers.  One of them said that one of the soldiers was standing next to  Goldstein and handed him magazines. As a rule, the residents of  Hebron find it hard to believe that Goldstein managed to kill  and injure so many worshipers with only 111 bullets.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Ashhab, the head of the committee's  medical team, said: "Most of the people were shot in the back,  but some were shot in the side of their body, which indicates  that some of the fire came from a different direction. In the  X-Ray pictures we identified metal of other objects that do not  look like slugs. Perhaps it was shrapnel. This may indicate  that the murderer also threw hand grenades."    Another member of the committee, former Hebron Mayor Mustafa  'Abd-al-Nabi al-Natshah, tried to sound more careful: "Our  evidence indicate that the murderer threw two hand grenades. I  would say there is a 90-percent probability that he used hand  grenades. Also, we cannot yet clearly determine that he acted  alone. This will only become apparent at the end of the  investigation."    Another issue the committee wants to determine is the  precise  number of casualties of the massacre and the shooting outside  the Cave of the Patriarchs. Until this day, two weeks after the  massacre, there no final figure. The IDF determined that 29  were killed and some 50 were wounded in the incident. The  residents of Hebron say that 32 were killed and some 200 were  wounded in the massacre.    "We collect all the evidence. We receive evidence from the  hospitals, such as death certificates, if there are any. We  obtained documents from the mukhtar, and visited the homes of  the dead," Attorney 'Abd-al-Ghani al-'Awawi said. "The same  procedure applies to the wounded."    The East Jerusalem Waqf handed over to the committee a file  of its correspondence with the Defense Ministry containing  hundreds of complaints about abuse of Muslim worshipers by  Jewish settlers in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Attorney  al-'Awawi said that the committee will examine testimonies and  the security arrangements and procedures in the cave. "We  question the guards and the other workers, and anyone who was in  touch with the Israeli authorities on issue pertaining to the  cave."    There is almost not a single committee members whose clan or  close family does not have a casualty of the Hebron massacre.  The daily reality of Hebron adds tension to the already tense  inquiry. The committee members move between hospitals, mourning  families, houses of the wounded and eye witnesses. Being under  curfew, movement around Hebron includes undergoing checks at IDF  roadblocks or the chance of encountering a violent clash.    Since the murder, support for the PLO reached an  unprecedented low in Hebron. The street is not too anxious to  cooperate with a committee associated with Fatah. In the middle  of last week, the committee attempted to shake off any marker  that would associate it with Fatah or any other organization.  Until last Tuesday, the committee sat in the Academics  Association building. On Wednesday, it moved to offices hired  for its purposes.    Attorney Husayn al-Shayukhi, one of 'Arafat's associates in  Hebron, was not pleased with the establishment of the committee:  "'Arafat's advisers misled him by advising to establish a  Hebron commission of inquiry. The Cave of the Patriarchs is  sacred to all Arabs and Muslims, not only the Hebron residents.  Therefore, there was a need to establish an international  committee; or at least an Arab or Muslim committee. If this was  impossible, a committee that includes members from throughout  the territories should have been set up. It should have  included representatives of all movements, including the  Islamic. And, in general, a committee should not have been  established at all because it lacks authority."    Last week, before the PLO committee was set up, another  Palestinian committee began investigating the incident. It was  appointed by the Supreme Muslim Council in Jerusalem. It is  headed by the Hebron religious court judge Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-Muktasib. It includes notables identified with the PLO  opposition, such as Shaykh Taysir Bayyud al-Tamimi, and Dr.  'Aziz Duwayk, both of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], and  'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Natshah, who is considered affiliated  with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.    This committee is conducting an investigation of its own.  Being part of the religious establishment, its members  approached the Civil Administration, through the East Jerusalem  Waqf, asking for permission to enter the Cave of the Patriarchs.  The have been rejected so far. Shaykh al-Tamimi, who is  normally in charge of the cave, fears that Israel is using the  massacre to change the complex. "We have testimonies that Israel  has brought building materials into the cave. We will not agree  to any changes in the complex, certainly not to erecting walls  inside the cave."    Another committee set up in Hebron is made of family members  of the murdered. European and Arab organizations and  institutions have announced their willingness to financially  support the victims' families. Israel also announced it will  compensate them. The families are afraid that the some of the  money will be lost on its way to Hebron. They decided that any  contribution made will be presented only through the families'  committee, or through the Hebron charity foundation, controlled  by Hamas.    The family members are not interested in any of the  commissions of inquiry. "We paid the price," they say, "and the  committees will not bring our loved ones back."    The Hebron youths also showed no interest in the work of the  committees. "Revenge -- this is the conclusion of our  commission of inquiry. Nothing but revenge."</p>

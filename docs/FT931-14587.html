			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Attack widens target range: Cheney argues for keeping up sanctions, denying Saddam the ability to rebuild his forces PRESIDENT George Bush's decision yesterday to launch a missile strike against an Iraqi nuclear facility moves the allied response to President Saddam Hussein's challenges a notch higher. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, warned yesterday that US concern about Iraq's intentions was growing. The Tomahawk missile launch made clear the riposte had also moved a notch higher. Over the last few weeks Mr Saddam has challenged the UN, particularly the US, Britain and France, on different fronts: bomb attacks on UN relief lorries in Kurdistan, threatening missile and aircraft movements in the two no-fly zones, raids across the Kuwaiti border, and obstructions to movement of UN inspectors charged with destroying Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons capability. Until yesterday, only the challenges in the no-fly zones had drawn a military response. Allied fighters shot down an Iraqi Mig aircraft violating the southern zone late last month; on Wednesday, they bombed missile and radar sites in the zone. Yesterday they shot down another Mig in the northern zone, and fired a missile at radar locked on to allied aircraft. Yesterday's Tomahawk attack extends the range of targets beyond the no-fly zones. Pentagon doctrine has generally held that if you are to use military force against an opponent, you should use it overwhelmingly. Last Wednesday's air raid has strengthened the hand of those who question the effectiveness of such limited attacks. For several days some officers have argued for an assault over several days, targeting troops, air defence sites and nuclear plants. The coalition seems anxious to keep some proportion between Mr Saddam's challenges to UN resolutions and the punishment. By attacking a nuclear factory, the coalition kept a direct link to the obstruction of UN inspection flights. Mr Richard Cheney, US defence secretary, suggested the coalition had little prospect of shaping Mr Saddam's behaviour by its military actions, but argued that the important aim was to maintain sanctions against the Iraqi leader, preventing him rebuilding his military forces. Philip Stephens, Political Editor, adds: The UK government last night offered unequivocal backing for the latest air strike against Iraq, insisting the action was fully underpinned by UN resolutions. But amid growing concern that Mr Saddam is determined to step up his confrontation with the west, it was privately acknowledged in Whitehall that the coalition against him faces important constraints. Downing Street stressed that the facility attacked was one of those on the inspection list of the UN Special Commission. The missiles were fired only after personal consultations between Mr Bush and other western leaders, and with the UN weapons inspectorate team. Diplomatic contacts had been concerted with Arab governments to reassure them of the coalition's intentions. Officials conceded that military advisers would have preferred a severer assault, directed at Iraq's military capacity, especially its air defences. But the Bush administration's anxiety not to risk US aircrews and the concern of its partners, including Britain, not to fall outside the UN resolutions, argued for a limited strike. Officials denied a split with Washington over the timing and scale of the latest operation. But Mr Major is keen to keep the unity which has given him all-party backing at Westminster for military enforcement of UN resolutions. A dozen or so Labour MPs oppose military action, but the proportionate nature of the strikes so far has ensured Mr Major the support of both the Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL BACKS MAYOR'S PATROL PLAN  </P> <P> Despite criticism from outraged residents of Los Angeles' crime-ridden  neighborhoods, a City Council panel has voted to back Mayor Tom Bradley's move  to scale back a police foot-patrol program.  </P> <P> Bradley used a rare veto Friday to halt the council's plans to spend $2.5  million over the next 10 months to allow the Police Department to use about 60  officers on overtime at 18 crime "hot spots" around the city. The mayor said  the appropriation was a "raid on the city's reserve fund" and urged the council  to support a $750,000 three-month pilot program instead.  </P> <P> This week the council's Budget and Finance Committee voted to sustain the  mayor's veto and approved the pilot program, recommending that the funds come  from the department's $1.3-million surplus from positions that were budgeted  but not filled.  </P> <P> Assistant Police Chief Jesse Brewer said the department supported the  committee's action but would have preferred that salary savings not be used.  </P> <P> The measure will go to the full City Council for a vote. The date of the vote  has not been scheduled.  </P></p>

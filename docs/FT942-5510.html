			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FDP in vote to support Kohl coalition Germany's Free Democrats yesterday voted overwhelmingly to support Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition after Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and chairman of the party, delivered a blistering attack on the policies of the opposition Social Democratic Party. In the keynote speech in the opening day of the FDP's three-day congress in the northern port of Rostock, Mr Kinkel warned the 660 delegates to pull together and support continuity rather than face the prospect of a government ruled by the SPD and Greens, or a grand coalition comprising the Christian Democratic Union and SPD. Opinion polls ahead of the federal elections on October 16 show growing support for Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. However, the FDP, in power as a junior partner with either the CDU or SPD for a quarter of a century, has still to move above the 5 per cent threshold necessary to gain representation in the Bundestag, the lower house. Mr Kinkel's speech, which received a standing ovation, was aimed as a warning to the FDP that it faced possible political isolation if it did not pull ranks together, support the CDU and drop any lingering sympathy for an SPD/FDP coalition. 'We have been a successful balance in difficult times (with the current coalition). A strong FPD is the guarantor against a Red/Green or a Grand coalition,' he said. Only 16 of the delegates voted against the motion, which asked the congress to support 'on the basis of the FDP's liberal programme, a successful coalition with the CDU/CSU in the next legislative period.' Earlier in the week, Mr Kinkel and his supporters had to persuade the rank and file to stick with the status quo even though the party's two ideological wings failed to unite during the presidential election last month of Mr Kohl's candidate, Mr Roman Herzog. Nearly 40 per cent of the FDP delegates voted for Mr Johannes Rau, the SPD candidate. The SPD yesterday called for a pact between government, unions and the Bundesbank to create jobs, Reuter reports from Bonn. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD challenger to Chancellor Kohl, told a gathering of 600 labour representatives that industry would continue to cut jobs this year, despite signs of a moderate economic recovery.</p>

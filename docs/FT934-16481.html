			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Investment risks and rewards Sir, The Risk and Reward column of October 4 ('Setback for active quantitative fund management sector') suggests that quantitative investment management techniques give rise to new problems for performance measurement of investment portfolios. In fact, there is little reason for doubting that greater accuracy in performance measurement should be a normal by-product of quantitative investment approaches. To suggest otherwise really is rather controversial. Peter W Stanyer, chairman, NAPF Pension Fund Performance Code Monitoring Group, CP23 Euston House, 24 Eversholt Street, London NW1 1DZ</p>

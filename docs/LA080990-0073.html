			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Bernstein's Back: After a doctor-ordered rest of nearly three weeks, conductor  Leonard Bernstein returns to work this weekend.  </P> <P> His first assignments: preparing for a concert Tuesday at Tanglewood in western  Massachusetts with the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra, and an Aug. 19  engagement with the Boston Symphony. Then, in celebration of the 50th  anniversary of the summer music festival near Lenox, Bernstein takes the Center  Orchestra on a brief European tour, ending Sept. 2. In mid-July, the  73-year-old conductor cut short his tour of Japan with the London Symphony due  to "exhaustion." BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings Williams Holdings yearns to be seen as a focused industrial group rather than a blindly acquisitive conglomerate. The signs are that it is gradually winning the battle. Williams' shares command a premium rating of 12 per cent against the market and are up nearly a quarter against the diversified industrial sector in the past 12 months. Yesterday's Pounds 80m deal helps show why. The purchase of Angus Fire on a multiple of 17 times last year's after-tax profits is unlikely to dilute Williams' earnings in 1995. This is despite the need for Pounds 3.5m of restructuring charges to be taken above the line. Thereafter it should enhance earnings as margins are brought into line with the group's 15 per cent target and synergies with other fire businesses are exploited. It may not be huge for a company with a Pounds 2.4bn market capitalisation, but it demonstrates that Williams is putting its shareholders' money where its mouth is. Angus is one of the larger transactions in a string of deals - worth Pounds 250m in the past 12 months - which give credibility to the strategy of growth by bolt-on acquisitions. That said, Williams still suffers from a number of problems. Its cash-flow, though now positive, is still not luxuriant. Moreover, the recurrent need to write off goodwill following acquisitions means that shareholders' funds are tiny for so large a group. This means gearing rises rapidly. And as yesterday's cautious trading statement hinted, trading conditions are tricky. But Williams deserves its new-found credibility, and its rating.</p>

A contractor's conflict of interest can harm our Superfund litigation (either cost recovery litigation under section 107 of CERCLA, or litigation for injunctive relief under section 106) in several ways: (1) By creating a conduit for confidential government information, including potential litigation and negotiation strategies, which may be leaked to the parties with opposing interests in the litigation, (2) by subjecting the credibility of EPA witnesses and/or the work they perform on behalf of EPA to attack, and (3) by causing the work performed by that contractor to be redone, raising potential issues in cost recovery litigation as to whether the cost of the extra work is recoverable. This rule requires EPA contractors to disclose all conflicts of interest so that EPA will have the opportunity to consider the significance of the conflict and to take appropriate measures to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has indeed faced several actual conflict situations which demonstrate the need for the Agency to strengthen its conflict of interest procedures in order to protect the public interest: One such conflict involved a contractor which had performed a removal action for EPA on a hazardous waste-contaminated site and which was currently doing research work for EPA pertaining to that site. Another office of the contractor's company agreed to serve as an expert witness in the EPA cost recovery litigation on behalf of one of the PRPs and, thus, against EPA, without knowledge or approval of the Agency. The contractor's work in performing the removal action and research for EPA in anticipation of cost recovery litigation conflicted directly with the contractor's serving as an expert witness on behalf of one of the PRPs. Further, the contractor proceeded to convey confidential information to the PRP in the context of trying to explain to the PRP why there was no conflict. Although settlement negotiations proceeded in this case, the strength of the Agency's position was significantly weakened because the contractor was working for both parties and confidential sensitive information had been divulged to the PRP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the issues in Superfund litigation ultimately are matters of expert technical opinion for which EPA relies on contractor personnel, e.g., support of remedy selection and findings that sites present ``imminent and substantial endangerment'' to the public. In that role, contractors may be privy to the government's litigation and negotiation strategies and other privileged and confidential information. The above case has taught us that contractor ``side switching'' carries a strong potential for the passing of confidential information to defendants, even if unintentionally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In another actual case, a contractor was performing remedial investigation/feasibility study work for both the EPA and a major PRP on a contiguous site. Well over a quarter of a million dollars had been expended by EPA prior to the discovery of the conflict. Work subsequently had to be stopped and all work which had been completed by the contractor had to be either redone and/or verified for accuracy and completeness by another independent contractor. In addition to the fiscal drain on the Superfund Program that this causes, we are also likely to be faced in cost recovery litigation with a defense argument that such ``double expense'' is unnecessary and unrecoverable. This may also increase the time and expense that the litigation and negotiation require, not including the potential millions of dollars at risk during the cost recovery/enforcement action itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

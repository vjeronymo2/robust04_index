			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Spanish credits fuel Dollars 5bn loan speculation TWO Spanish government-backed credits are being brought to the international loans market, adding to speculation that the Kingdom is about to borrow up to Dollars 5bn directly from international banks. In a transaction expected to be announced this week, Ajesa, a company set up as a refinancing vehicle for the Expo '92, is to seek the equivalent of Pta70bn (Dollars 603m). The loan will be denominated in another European currency, probably Ecu, according to one of the banks leading the transaction. Last Thursday's devaluation of the peseta has effectively decreased the size of the loan, in Ecu terms, by 8 per cent. Ajesa, which carries a guarantee from the Kingdom of Spain, has taken over the assets and liabilities from the Expo in Seville. The spread on the seven-year loan, of just 25 basis points over Libor, was described by one banker as very aggressive. The loan is being led by Argentaria, ABN Amro and Deutsche Bank. The loan will look tightly priced when set against a DM300m (Dollars 188m), five-year loan for RTVE, the Spanish state-owned television company, which was launched on Friday by Chemical Bank. The margin on that facility, which according to Chemical has been accorded a zero-weighting for capital adequacy purposes by the Bank of England, is wider at 35 basis points. Speculation continued last week that the Kingdom was planning a standby credit facility, as a back-up for its commercial paper programme. However, no terms are believed to have been agreed. Repsol, the Spanish oil and chemicals group, reported a slight improvement in first-quarter profits. Operating profits rose to Pta39.4bn from Pta34.4bn in the opening three months of 1992. Net earnings totalled Pta23.6bn, up from Pta21.4bn. See International Capital Markets</p>

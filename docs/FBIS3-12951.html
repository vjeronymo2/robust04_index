			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Annihilation Way Toward Peace!"] </F>   [Text] Most of us cannot understand how the Ramadan  massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque could open the road to peace,  nor can we understand how each massacre will remove an obstacle  facing a settlement we all have been talking about and believe  is achieving big victories that are late but almost close at  hand.    We realize the annihilation of the Palestinian people will  enable the Israeli entity to achieve the peace it wants. We  realize that the annihilation of Muslims in Yugoslavia makes  peace the right of those the Westerners call Bosnian Serbs. We  also realize that the continuation of the racist embargo of the  Iraqi people will lead to the death of all the Iraqis. Through  this, international legitimacy -- the respect for which the  United States is seeking to impose on the enemies of Washington  to the exclusion of all others -- would be achieved.    The Americans are the only ones who can make peace in the  Middle East. By virtue of the fact that the Americans have a  strategic alliance with the Israelis, the anticipated peace will  be one that achieves the interests of both allies. Moreover,  when Goldstein, the hero of the Ramadan massacre, sees that the  world is applauding the killers in Somalia, Yugoslavia, and  Iraq, then it is natural for him to consider those killers --  who are slaughtering people in the name of protecting them and  are launching wars of annihilation under the pretext of  defending international legitimacy -- as his model. It is no  coincidence that Goldstein should have been born and raised in  America and have a Zionist behavior and mentality. Such a  combination is what produced the killers in Baghdad, Mogadishu,  and Sarajevo and before that in the capitals of South America  and Southeast Asia.    Those who are talking about opening the road to peace via  the  slaughtering of Palestinians are talking about a policy that  satisfies the new world order but does not satisfy the sentiment  of millions of Arabs, whose Islam and Christianity as well as  their basic rights, foremost of which is their right to live,  are fought by Zionism and its allies. The United Nations, which  refuses to condemn the Zionist crime, is not to blame, because  there are those among us who, since the first moment of the  massacre, have been seeking to acquit the Israeli Government and  Army and lay all the blame on one settler called Goldstein  without any reference to his many accomplices.    Those who are laying all this blame on Goldstein are  demanded  to respect the blood of martyrs if they do not want to respect  the peoples' intelligence. They are also demanded to frankly  read the files of Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres, in the chest  of each of whom dwell one hundred Goldsteins. Zionist extremism  and the desire to liquidate and wipe out all Palestinian people  in order to achieve peace are not the ideas and behavior of one  settler. They are the ideas and behavior of an entire entity  that was brought up under Western imperialism, specifically U.S.  imperialism. Here it is practicing what this imperialism has  been practicing since the beginning of this century. The  international community, which is watching our annihilation with  all this bias, will not secure protection for the Palestinians  by sending a few hundred international observers.</p>

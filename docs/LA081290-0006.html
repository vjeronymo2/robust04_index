			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALZER ON WINE: PRIZE GUENOC WINES  </P> <P> WE OFTEN GET LETTERS and telephone calls from wine lovers trying to find wines  that have been glowingly described in this column. They say they can't find  them. But rest assured, these wines are out there. Here's some advice, from the  late wine expert, Andre L. Simon, on how to make your hunt easier:  </P> <P> "Choose a good wine merchant, the best you can find in your neighborhood. Share  with him your likes and dislikes. As you become friends, he'll reward you with  good finds to your taste. Reward him with your loyal patronage. Stay with him,  until he disappoints you; then find another."  </P> <P> Good wine merchants are rare these days, but even supermarkets have managers  who appreciate loyal customers. The wine merchant or supermarket manager can  order all the discoveries that I've written about. His store is your store.  </P> <P> And now here's some news about wines from Guenoc, another small winery in  California, once owned by Edwardian beauty Lillie Langtry, who produced claret  on the 37-square-mile estate. After Prohibition, the Guenoc Valley property was  used for cattle grazing -- until Orville Magoon, from Hawaii, came along in the  early '70s and planted his first vines. From those plantings, gold medal wines  are being produced. Trust engineer Magoon to have a vineyard where each vine is  monitored by computer to register the soil's moisture and condition. Production  has reached 83,000 cases annually.  </P> <P> I'm particularly fond of the Guenoc Petit Sirah, and the 1987 edition ($9) of  this wine is already garnering its share of recognition; the 1986 won three  gold medals, plus a "Best of Class." The Guenoc 1986 Napa/ Lake Merlot ($12)  and the 1985 Cabernet Sauvignon Premiere Cuvee ($17) took gold medals at the  InterVin competition in Canada. The Tasters Guild in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,  recently gave its top gold to the 1988 Guenoc Valley Genevieve Magoon Vineyard  Chardonnay Reserve ($20).  </P> <P> When you find that Guenoc Petit Sirah, bake a batch of fudge brownies, and in  the cool of the evening, nibble on one or two between sips of Petit Sirah.  Lillie Langtry never dreamed wine from her estate could be so wonderful.  </P></p>

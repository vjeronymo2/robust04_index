At 0500 GMT  the terrorists demanded vodka and a new helicopter since they  think the engine of the one they are on is faulty. Contact with  the criminals is still one-sided and is taking place on their  initiative only. According to information at 0800 GMT, the  helicopter is on a runway. There is no movement around it. The  food demanded by the terrorists has been brought on board the  helicopter. This is the information as of this hour. As new  reports from our correspondents on the spot arrive, we will  report them to you in Ostankino Novosti bulletins.</p>

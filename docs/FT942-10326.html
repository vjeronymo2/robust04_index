			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Arts: The Ralf Ralf illusion - Theatre in London The brothers Jonathan and Barnaby Stone - aka Ralf Ralf - are so crazily concerned with illusion and with theatricality that I would call them baroque artists if I did not feel that might lead to confusions. They are entirely modern, and they keep presenting you with satires of modern life. But, in their current show It's Staring You Right in the Face - which launches this year's Barclays New Stages season at the Royal Court - they play sketches-within-sketches and roles-within-roles, so that you are seamlessly led from one stage event into another. They even wear suits-within-suits. Again and again, they make uncanny jokes about fake spontaneity. They present several sketches as if they were TV presenters, and we the studio audience; they catch perfectly the awful, synthetic manners of such people, even though most of the time they are speaking not English but a brilliant genre of jabberwocky. They conduct an entire chat show in this lingo, through which somehow they reproduce the inflections of real English as it is spoken on TV, so effectively that the audience cackles. And, while one of the star guests reads a nonsense poem with richly inflected sincerity, the show's presenter quietly slips off into sleep. Then the guest poet turns the words of his poem into a kind of hypnotism on the TV presenter . . . and from then on we no longer know where we are. Is everything that follows part of the presenter's trance? Even when the whole show suddenly (as if we had switched channels and found ourselves watching American TV) becomes a Bible-belt show? Replete with casting out devils, handing over all worldly goods, and leading on 'live' members of the audience to sing the praises of Him . . . all of which is achieved in more coherent nonsense language, with every twanging vowel somehow speaking of the religious fervour of the American South. Behind these satires is a disturbing vision. You laugh at the soul-barings of this religious event, but you also know the alarming realities it evokes. You laugh at the con-man smoothness of other TV presenter types, while knowing that their banality is one of the most depressing features of modern life. You laugh because Ralf Ralf shows how fake these things are; but you are disturbed because you know how effective they are. And the connection of reality and illusion keeps you happily bewildered. This is a considerably revised and improved version by the way (it toured from the middle of 1993 until early '94.) There are still moments when the show gets struck in a groove, but these do not last long now. And the show's structural ingenuity is far more apparent and far more baroque. Does the word baroque confuse? Ralf Ralf confuses too, and brilliantly. At the Royal Court Theatre until June 11</p>

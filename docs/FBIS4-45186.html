			<p>of   Cardinal's Assassination   <F P=102> 94WB0039A Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 5 May 94 pp 5-A,  31-A </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0039A </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Patricia Cerda] </F>   [Excerpts] The Mexican Bishops Conference [CEM] asserted,  through its secretary general, Bishop Ramon Godinez, that the  capture of the Baja California deputy attorney general, Sergio  Ortiz Lara, represents an advance in the investigation of  Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas' assassination. He added that this  act could help to dismantle the Tijuana and Guadalajara drug  trafficking cartels that have damaged the country with violence  and death. [passage omitted]    Godinez explained: "We believe that this capture advances  the  investigation of Cardinal Posadas' murder mainly because the one  captured is alleged to be linked to the escape of persons  connected with the Arellano Felix group. This incident also  leads us to regard as valid the hypothesis cited by the Mexican  bishops in 1988, to the effect that drug trafficking would not  occur if certain authorities were not implicated in it. This  phenomenon is taking place in a clever, despicable manner on  that market."    He continued: "I think that we must make a distinction among  the varying degrees of responsibility existing on the drug  market, that is, in the drug traffic, ranging from large-scale  traffickers to authorities concealing or protecting them, and  including those growing and distributing drugs.    "This capture gives us hope that we may learn the details of  Cardinal Posadas' assassination. Furthermore, although this is  an extremely difficult and complex task, we think that it could  help to eliminate the drug trafficking cartels in Tijuana and  Guadalajara. As pastors, what is most important to us is to  prevent evils such as drug addiction, especially among the most  vulnerable population: children and adolescents." [passage  omitted]    He explained that the bishops are aware that "although the  drug trade has large-scale production and distribution  operations in the national territory," it is primarily a problem  of international dimensions. It is in other countries, such as  the United States, that the major drug trafficking  decision-making centers operate, and the largest drug  consumption market exists.    He emphasized that, in the text issued by the Bishops  Conference, an analysis is made of the very close ties linking  the drug traffic to violence and the arms trade. Those involved  in it are risking their lives and those of their families.  "Almost every day we hear of murders, to the point where this  state of violence has become customary in some of the country's  towns and regions." [passage omitted]    He stressed that, in the case of the drug traffic, a  distinction must nevertheless be made among the varying degrees  of responsibility. The guilt of the large-scale drug market  leaders, who have all the power and cleverness for carrying out  their sinister business, and of the authorities implicated, is  not the same as that of the day laborers, including peasants and  Indians. The latter are associated with this activity because of  their ignorance or extreme financial need.    Finally, he indicated that the complete solution to the drug  trafficking problem would lie in eliminating the demand, and  rehabilitating the society demanding drugs. For this reason, he  claimed, the consumer countries must also assume the share of  the blame that they deserve.</p>

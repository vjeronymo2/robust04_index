The dealers fled to nearby flats on January 24 when they saw  the police arriving in the al-Harisiyah area, where they were  exchanging money.    The police opened fire, killing about 30 of them, the  sources  said.    Another 10 dealers surrendered, and were still in jail, they  said.    The raid came two days after a warning published in the  daily  Babil, which blamed the collapse of the Iraqi dinar on street  dealers, and called for them to be punished.    The daily is run by President Saddam Husayn's son 'Udayy.    The sources said the dollar was changing hands on the black  market for 230 dinars the day of the raid, but the rate now was  265 to the dollar.    The official rate is one dinar to 3.2 dollars.    On January 27 the deputy governor of the central bank, 'Asim  Muhammad Salih, announced a ban on foreign currency trading by  street dealers.</p>

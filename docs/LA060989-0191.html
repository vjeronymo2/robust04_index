			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CANSECO WON'T FIGHT GUN CHARGE  </P> <P> Oakland Athletics' slugger Jose Canseco, the American League's Most Valuable  Player in 1988, will plead no contest to gun charges, according to one of his  attorneys.  </P> <P> Michael Stepanian also said Canseco will get rid of the flashy Jaguar linked to  much of his recent trouble.  </P> <P> "He's not going to fight the courts," Stepanian said after a closed-door  conference Thursday with Municipal Judge J. Dominique Olcomendy. "He's got the  pennant to fight for. And as for the car, I can honestly say that in six months  it won't be around." Canseco was cited for driving the 1989 car recklessly on a  Florida freeway and for running a red light in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Canseco is accused of illegally carrying a loaded 9-millimeter handgun on the  floorboard of the car during an April 21 visit to the University of California  Medical Center at San Francisco.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WAY TO ACHIEVE REAL DEPRESSION  </P> <P> In Sean Mitchell's Nov. 25 article, "Misery" director Rob Reiner says, "You  can't know real depression until you've had great wealth."  </P> <P> Did he try that line on the parking valet mentioned in the story, who might be  relieved to know he's never been really depressed?  </P> <P> May I suggest that Reiner get in his Mercedes or Porsche, drive down to  South-Central Los Angeles, find a woman whose 6-year-old child has just been  killed in a drive-by shooting and tell her how she's not experiencing "real,  abject depression" because she isn't rich yet. He might just learn what the  title of his new movie really means.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS McEWAN, Hemet  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Arts: Gyorgy Ligeti turns 70 - Concert Next Friday week is actually Ligeti's birthday; but the London Sinfonietta's homage-concert at the Barbican last Saturday came near enough. Ligeti's long career has been a perpetual tonic for contemporary music (though interrupted for a while some dozen years ago by ill health), and it continues apace. His opera after Lewis Carroll's Alice books is eagerly awaited. This Sinfonietta programme, nicely devised, revisited signal achievements of that career: the Chamber Concerto and Melodien of 1971, the recent Piano Concerto, and some tantalising reminiscences of his mid-1970s opera Le Grand Macabre (for which an ENO revival is surely due). Those last provided the only echoes of his early Dadaist phase, now remembered chiefly for the mock-operas Aventures and Nouvelles Aventures, which play rather like Ionesco but are really in-jokes about the earnest contemporary-music scene. Early Ligeti pieces were always sophisticated jokes or calculated experiments, or most often both at once. In his evergreen Ten Pieces for wind quintet, the comic 'Fragment' for groaning bass-instruments (promised for this concert, but withdrawn by the composer because the joke no longer strikes him as good enough) or indeed the Chamber Concerto for 13 players, each movement exploits some narrowly specific musical language-game to the hilt. Somehow the intricate workings-out generate their own pungent flavours and suggestions. For bigger ensembles Ligeti's experiments with 'micro-polyphony' (dense contrapuntal knitting for many little voices, adding up to much broader effects), which began with Apparitions and Atmospheres, led to Melodien, tangled skeins of half-heard tunes. By now the Sinfonietta players must know their Melodien parts virtually by heart, and under the meticulous direction of young Markus Stenz the performance sounded luminous. Every fragmentary voice contributed poignantly to the sense of the whole. Like his Polish contemporary Lutoslawski, Ligeti conjures ghosts of old feeling from arcane new mechanisms. The five movements of the Piano Concerto, delivered here by Pierre-Laurent Aimard with the utmost finesse, showed a new Ligeti. The first three were completed in 1986, two racing studies in multi-rhythms flanking a 'Lento, deserto' of extraordinary stark power. By 1988, however, the composer had added two more movements, exciting and seemingly transparent, but of such expressive density as to leave the listener quite wrung out. Nothing merely 'experimental' there: this is music with a formidable grip. After that, Mysteries of the Macabre offered what was almost light relief. Drawn from the opera, it is Elgar Howarth's arrangement of the Secret Police Chief's coloratura arias for C-trumpet and ensemble. It retains the neo-Dada effects of the original setting - rattles and police-whistles, spoken interjections by the players, which lose much of their point out of context. Hakan Hardenberger's soaring trumpet, however, was its own justification and more.</p>

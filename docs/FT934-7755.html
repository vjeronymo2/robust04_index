			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Protecting Earth's life-support system - UN scientists see 'biodiversity' as crucial to future food supply A QUARTER of the Earth's plants and animals are in danger of extinction in the next 30 years, raising fears for food supplies for future generations, according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Global food production will have to increase by more than 60 per cent in the next 25 years, the organisation estimates, and 'biodiversity' is essential for this. Yet about three-quarters of the genetic diversity of agricultural crops have been lost since the beginning of the century, says the FAO, 'and the world is increasingly dependent on fewer and fewer crop varieties'. The world's population obtains about 90 per cent of its calories from 30 crop species, it says. Four plants - rice, maize, wheat and potatoes - account for 50 per cent of total calorific intake. Yet there are an estimated 75,000 potential food species in existence, many of them in the tropical forests. While the introduction of high-yielding varieties of rice, wheat and maize, under the so-called 'green revolution' has raised yields, it has caused the replacement of thousands of local varieties of those crops by a few, genetically very uniform varieties. That loss of biodiversity means less plant breeding material is available for the development of new strains of crops, the FAO warns. If a disease wipes out a crop, it is considered vital to have new strains available for farmers so that output can be maintained. The organisation was one of the chief supporters of the green revolution in the 1960s, but it now stresses that 'intensified food production can be achieved by the sustainable use of a broader range of species and genetic material'. 'Biodiversity is the source of economic and food security,' says the FAO's director-general, Mr Edouard Saouma. The world's richest nations contain the least diversity, while the poorest countries have the richest reserves, 'which underscores the interdependency of all nations'. Tropical forests and woodlands contain at least 50 per cent of all known plant and animal species, but are being destroyed at the rate of 15.4m hectares a year, the FAO estimates, causing reductions in the number of species. It believes only about 10 per cent of those forests are being managed in a way that will enable the output of timber to be sustained. Properly managed tropical forests could provide both timber and non-wood products while safeguarding genetic resources. A number of studies have shown that harvesting non-timber products is more remunerative than logging trees or burning them down. One study estimated that a hectare of forest on Mishana, Peru, produced fruits and rubber worth Dollars 700 a year. After deducting collecting and transport costs, net annual revenues to farmers were just over Dollars 400 a year. If a farmer with a hectare of trees chopped them down, earnings would come to around Dollars 1,000. In that situation it therefore paid farmers to leave the trees standing and to harvest fruits and rubber from them to earn a regular annual income. The FAO says the rate of extinction of animal breeds has increased dramatically in the past 100 years, mostly due to the highly specialised nature of modern livestock production. Animal production contributes about 30 per cent to the total global value of food and agriculture. About a fifth of existing breeds are at risk of extinction the FAO estimates, with endangered breeds more likely to be in developing countries. Although the world fish catch has more than quadrupled over the last 40 years, it is now under considerable pressure, with over-fishing and the use of intensive modern technology having a damaging impact on many fish stocks. The catch in 1992 declined for the third year in a row, to just under 97m tonnes, compared with a record 100m tonnes in 1989. The overall figures hide an even steeper decline in the fish caught at sea, the FAO says. In 1992, the marine catch was about 80m tonnes, down from about 86m tonnes in 1989. Commercial fleets are driving some fish species close to biological extinction, destroying natural ecosystems such as coral reefs and seagrass beds. Climate change could affect stocks of fish 'in an unpredictable fashion'; global warming could cause changes in the marine habitats and plankton that might lead to shifts in distribution and production. The FAO plans a major conference on biodiversity in 1995. 'Biodiversity is a life-support for the planet - cut it off and we will die,' warns Edouard Saouma.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] Congress  and the delegate assembly of the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] have adopted, both with a large majority, the coalition  agreement reached two days ago. Kata Peli Nagy reports on the  circumstances of the ballot at the MSZP congress.    [Nagy] [passage omitted] According to Gyula Horn, the  agreement promises a predictable policy that focuses on people,  which is sociologically well-grounded and which intends to  modernize. [passage omitted]    Gyula Horn sees the basis on which the government program is  founded as neither liberal, nor left-wing, but a realistic one.  It is unequivocally clear from the document that the coalition  wants a social market economy, it is enterprise-friendly, and  encourages foreign investment. Its strategic aim is to speedily  join the West European organizations, to establish  good-neighborly relations with countries surrounding Hungary,  and to support as far as possible the Hungarians living as  minorities.    Gyula Horn, who is the MSZP candidate for the post of prime  minister, views his upcoming government as a government of  experts despite the concessions he had to make during the  negotiations with the SZDSZ.    Horn said that finding state secretaries for the ministers  will be next week's task. In connection with this I have  learned that no candidates have been found as yet for filling  the state secretarial posts that were originally offered to  Gyorgy Janosi and Sandor Csintalan. Janosi rejected the post of  state secretary at the Ministry of Culture and Public Education,  while Csintalan refused the post of state secretary at the  Ministry of Labor that Mrs. Kosa, nee Magda Kovacs, candidate  for the post of minister of labor, offered him.    Pal Vastagh, candidate for the post of justice minister, has  also failed to find a state secretary. MSZP Deputy Chairman  Ferenc Baja has asked Katalin Szili to accept the post of state  secretary at the Ministry of Environmental Protection.    Csaba Tabajdi has been nominated for the state secretarial  post of chairman of the Office of Hungarians Beyond the Border  and the National and Ethnic Minorities Office--the two offices  will be merged.    MSZP Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres was elected as leader of  the MSZP group of parliamentary deputies at the congress this  afternoon. [passage omitted] The group decided on the people it  will delegate to posts of chairmen and deputy chairmen of the  parliamentary committees:    Sandor Orosz--chairman of the Agricultural Committee;    Judit Csehak--chairwoman of the Social Affairs Committee;    Etele Barath--chairwoman of the Environmental Protection;    Ivan Vitanyi--chairman of the Cultural Committee;    Gabor Gellert Kis--chairman of the Human Rights Committee;    Gyorgy Janosi--chairman of the Education Committee;    Sandor Nagy--chairman of the Audit Committee;    Jozsef Alajos Geczi--chairman of the Parliamentary  Immunity Committee.</p>

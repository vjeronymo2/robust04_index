			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["South Side's Authorities Urged To Accept North's Proposal </F> for National Conference" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- The preparatory  committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of  the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification  (Pomminnyon) strongly urged the South side authorities to accept  the proposal for the convocation of a national conference, a  proposal initiated by the DPRK at a joint meeting of its  government, political parties and public organizations on April  11 with a view to finding a way of achieving the great unity of  the whole nation.    In a document distributed on April 15 it charged that the  Kim  Yong-sam "government" deepened the national division by refusing  even to accept the proposal of the North, without so much as  showing an attitude to sincerely examine it.    Noting that the crisis of the nation cannot be defused, nor  can the way of an independent and peaceful reunification of the  country be opened by such mode of dependence on outside forces  as "South Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation", the document stressed  the only way is to activate diverse dialogues of all levels  including dialogue between the government authorities and thus  boost the sentiments of great national unity and find an  independent solution.    It repeatedly urged the South Korean authorities to accept  the proposal of the North for a national conference.</p>

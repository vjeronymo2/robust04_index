			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Output prices held steady Manufacturers have barely increased their prices since the summer according to government figures released yesterday that illustrate the weakness of inflationary pressures. Prices of materials and energy bought by manufacturers were 1.8 per cent lower in November than 12 months earlier, the biggest yearly drop since July last year. The figures from the Central Statistical Office underline how inflation has been falling under the influence of low demand, small increases in wage costs and a fall in the prices of many commodities such as oil. Sterling's 10.4 per cent depreciation since Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September last year has failed to spur inflation in spite of higher import costs. Between July and last month prices of manufactured goods for domestic sale at the wholesale level have risen by just 0.2 per cent on a basis that does not include adjustments for seasonal factors. Prices were unchanged last month from October. In the year to November, prices rose by 3.6 per cent - the smallest yearly increase since February and a figure slightly lower than City expectations. In the year to October output prices rose 4 per cent. Excluding food, drink, tobacco and petrol - whose prices are affected by tax changes - wholesale prices of factory goods rose 3.2 per cent in the year to November, the same as in the year to October. Adjusted for seasonal changes, prices of these classes of products rose 0.2 per cent in November compared with October while they increased 1.1 per cent between July and last month on the same basis. The fall in the year to November of prices of materials and fuel bought by manufacturers came in spite of a rise last month in the costs of electricity to large industrial groups. In the year to October, overall prices of materials and fuel rose 0.5 per cent. Prices of crude oil bought by manufacturers fell by 16.2 per cent in the year to last month. Over the same period prices of UK-produced foodstuffs fell 3.3 per cent, while prices of general fuels, chemicals, metals and imported foods increased by 0.6 per cent, 0.9 per cent, 0.2 per cent and 4.9 per cent respectively.</p>

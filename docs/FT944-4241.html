			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Power generators warned on plant disposals Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, yesterday showed impatience with the two main generators over plant disposals and said he was considering regulatory changes to allow regional power companies to buy plant from them. Prof Littlechild said neither National Power nor PowerGen had submitted proposals which would meet the objectives of an undertaking to try to sell off 5,000MW to 6,000MW of capacity to increase competition. He said he had told the generators that 'arrangements which left either company with a continuing involvement in or significant influence on the commercial operation of the plant would not resolve the underlying competition issues'. He added: 'I have asked both parties to explore a range of alternatives.' The generators have until the end of next year to try to sell the plant, but Prof Littlechild is believed to be concerned about their lack of progress to meeting the commitment. His statement comes a month before the government publishes the prospectus for the sale of its remaining 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen. The potential problems arising from the plant disposal commitments are a concern for investors. Prof Littlechild has previously warned that he will refer the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if he is not satisfied with the outcome. Writing in a consultation document, Prof Littlechild said several regional electricity companies had asked about the possibility of relaxing limits on generating their own electricity needs. The limit is about 15 per cent. Some companies want it lifted to allow them to bid, either alone or as part of consortia, for the National Power and PowerGen plant. Eastern Group and Southern Electric are thought to be among them. The prospect of regional electricity companies buying more electricity from their own subsidiaries raises monopoly questions, however. Prof Littlechild said even after 1998, when full competition is planned for power supply, the companies 'would be likely to retain a significant degree of de facto market power for a period'. He added: 'Where such market power exists, a (company) which is purchasing electricity from a power station in which it is a shareholder may face a potential conflict of interest.' The regulator is suggesting a system under which regional electricity companies would be prohibited or restricted from buying hedging contracts from power stations in which they had an interest. This, he says, could allow a company to 'contribute more fully to the development of competition in generation without the allegation that it was exploiting its captive market and local monopoly position'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas by </F> Maja Narbutt; place and date not given: "The Treaty Will Be  Assessed by Future Generations"]    [Text] [Narbutt] The  Polish-Lithuanian treaty will soon finally be signed; it has  already been initialed. Why did the negotiations take so long?  They started almost immediately after Lithuania regained  independence in 1991.    [Brazauskas] Everyone both in Poland and in Lithuania knows  the historical contacts between our states and nations. For  ages everything has happened between us--both good and bad  things. Therefore, the discussion was difficult and protracted.    The treaty negotiations were held in special circumstances.  There is a certain category of people who think--I would  say--that they love their homeland more than others. These  people react in a very special way to anything that occurs in  interstate relations. Not only with Poland, even though this  problem really causes the greatest emotions. I also mean the  relations with Russia.    [Narbutt] However, was it really not possible to complete  the work on the treaty earlier? Was it not possible to abandon  the demand of condemning "the Polish occupation of the Vilnius  area" earlier? Everyone expected the new Lithuanian authorities  to be more pragmatic than the nationalistic Sajudis; everyone  expected that the negotiations would be accelerated.    [Brazauskas] When the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party came  to power after last year's presidential elections, relat point.  [incomplete word, sentence as published]. Both parties had to  take certain steps to find a solution that would be acceptable.  This is when I realized that one cannot look into the past and  that Poland did not want that. Let us look into the future, let  us think about the future.    If everyone in Europe thought about the past--and in the  past  terrible things happened, such as World War I, World War II, the  revolution, and civil wars--it would not be possible to live a  normal life.    [Narbutt] You said much earlier that as far as Polish-  Lithuanian relations are concerned, one should look into the  future. You said this after the parliamentary elections, which  your party won, in the fall of 1992.    [Brazauskas] A treaty is not agreed upon overnight, or  within a month. When I became president, lying on my desk was a  Lithuanian draft of the treaty which differed a lot from the one  that will actually be signed. There were fundamental  differences. Step by step we were removing the controversies  that existed between Poland and Lithuania.    The treaty that President Walesa and I will sign will be  assessed by historians, and future generations as well. They  will evaluate the importance of the treaty, its significance for  both our states and for Europe.    [Narbutt] The treaty with Poland was a subject of an  internal political game in Lithuania. The government found  itself under strong pressure from the rightist opposition, which  demanded that the treaty include formulations which Poland could  not accept. Do you not fear difficulties that may arise when it  comes to the ratification in the Lithuanian parliament, as well  as a wave of protests against the treaty, in which the past was  referred to in one general statement about both countries'  sorrow because of the use of force.    [Brazauskas] There are certain people, certain organizations  that do not like the treaty. We have already started to explain  to them why the treaty must be signed. There was no other  solution--we had to regulate the relations with Poland.    If need be, we will explain this over and over again, until  this gets across to them.    I do not think there will be any serious problems related to  the treaty, any major protests. I would also like to stress  that the treaty guarantees the interests of all the citizens of  our states, irrespective of their nationality.    [Narbutt] Some of the Lithuanian politicians say out loud  that "those who oppose the treaty with Poland push Lithuania  into the arms of Russia." What do you think of such a statement?    [Brazauskas] Yes, I do agree with it in a way. In  general, all disputes, all the misunderstandings between Poland  and Lithuania clearly serve someone. Now, Lithuania wants to  go, and is going, in the direction of the West, toward the  European structures: NATO, European Union, Council of Europe.    I want to reiterate this: establishing relations with Poland  is of great importance to us.    [Narbutt] The initialing of the Polish-Lithuanian treaty has  been received with satisfaction in the declaration that ended  the recent summit meeting of the presidents of the Baltic  Republics in Palanga. It was also stated there that the treaty  should be the first step to shorten the distance between the  Baltic states and the Visegrad Group.    [Brazauskas] The four states of the Visegrad Group have  developed more than we have. This results from the most recent  history. The states united in the Warsaw Pact had more  possibilities at their disposal than those states that were  incorporated in the USSR. We want to be similar to you. Not  only Lithuania, but also all the other Baltic Republics are  interested in cooperation with the Visegrad Group--both  political and economic cooperation.    [Narbutt] It seems that since the last elections the  situation in Russia has been heading in a dangerous direction.  What is your attitude toward the Russian foreign policy, toward  the statements by Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev on the  Baltic states and toward the theory of "close foreign states,"  as well as the "special interests" of Russia in the Baltic  states?    [Brazauskas] What right does Russia have to make any claims  to other states? Russia is a member of almost all the  international organizations. It wants to be admitted to the  Council of Europe. The Council of Europe demands high democratic  standards. Such a test must be passed. We have already passed  it--we have been admitted.    Such statements are unacceptable, absolutely inadmissible in  today's world. And they cannot be put into effect as well. If  they cannot be implemented, why say such things? In order to  frighten someone? Who needs this?    Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have never volunteered to  join  the USSR. They were invaded. This is how it should be  understood; any claims, speaking about zones of interest are out  of place. Russia has taken such a strange approach not only  toward the Baltic states, but also toward other countries.    [Narbutt] The concentration of Russian troops in the  Kaliningrad Oblast must be cause for European concern, Lech  Walesa stated during his recent visit to Latvia. This brought  about an angry reaction from the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs. Soon afterward General Grachev, Russian minister of  defense, stated that the Kalinigrad Oblast is "a special defense  zone" of Russia. Does Lithuania have similar concerns as Poland  does?    [Brazauskas] The Kaliningrad Oblast should be demilitarized.  I agree with President Walesa. The concentration of troops  always causes misgivings--I discussed this at the forum of the  UN General Assembly.    The special location of the Kalinigrad Oblast should be used  economically, not militarily.    Maintaining its military outpost by Russia in the west is  not  understandable, all the more so because Russia wants to join the  "Partnership for Peace."    [Narbutt] As the second post-communist state, after Albania,  Lithuania officially applied for NATO membership. As it is  known, none of the states of our region have a chance to be  admitted to NATO very soon.    [Brazauskas] We are not so naive as to believe that once we  submit our motion, we will be admitted right away. We like the  idea of the "Partnership for Peace" as an intermediate stage on  the road to NATO. If the "Partnership" is joined by various  states, it will not be indispensable for us to join NATO  immediately. The dangers, which might exist in the  international relations are automatically smaller. The  "Partnership" will create a new security system.    I am definitely in favor of Russia's signing the  "Partnership." Then it would be possible to look differently at  many issues that we have mentioned.    [Narbutt] Before the presidential elections, you told  RZECZPOSPOLITA that the president should be a man who restores  agreement, reconciles those who are at odds. You have not  managed to do that, have you? In the speech that summed up the  previous year you said many bitter words about the opposition.    [Brazauskas] Representatives of the opposition have only  just left my office. They often come to me and we talk. As far  as the moods among the Lithuanian opposition are concerned, it  must be remembered that they are quite peculiar. These are  people who have done an awful lot for Lithuania; they helped  Lithuania regain independence. They were supported by masses;  they were not only in power, but on a pedestal as well. And  then they lost.    However, it is not all that bad. There is social peace--even  though we have many difficulties, such as low wages and low  living standards. There is no hatred, no open conflicts. The  opposition in Lithuania has every possibility of presenting its  views. Have you noticed how extraordinarily democratic  Lithuania is? The opposition is shown on television probably  more frequently than those who are in power.    [Narbutt] Yes, indeed. And it often attacks you. Despite  the attacks of the opposition, you are invariably the most  popular politician of Lithuania. In all the opinion polls you  occupy the first position, then for a long time there is no one.    [Brazauskas] For the time being.    [Narbutt] It is definitely difficult for you to talk about  this, but how could you define the reasons for such popularity?    [Brazauskas] Popularity. I am wondering about it myself.  Sociologists should answer this question; however, they only  conduct polls. Now, why is it that one politician is backed by  52-54 percent of the people, and another is supported by 6  percent? I do not know. I am not concealing my  biography--everyone knows it. I was a member of the party.  Just like many others. I was elected the first secretary of  the party when the movement of national rebirth started in  Lithuania. Sajudis supported me. They saw something in me,  they believed in me. At the first congress of Sajudis I was  received as a kind of a hero.    [Narbutt] Does your political past never disturb you?    [Brazauskas] Membership in the party is a real burden for  me. I knew that it would be so as soon as I was elected  president.    [Narbutt] However, most Lithuanians do not evaluate you that  harshly. I am again coming back to your popularity.    [Brazauskas] I am over 60 and I sometimes look back. A few  years ago no one knew me, that is, the people did not know me,  except the people that I worked with--those linked to the  industry. Then it simply happened. Perhaps I said certain  things louder and more boldly than others. Yes, certainly  louder and more boldly. I was attacked for not saying right at  the beginning that Lithuania should be fully independent. Well,  I wanted each step to be fully considered. It had to be fully  considered and it was.    [Narbutt] Your greatest success and your greatest failure.    [Brazauskas] Someone might say that my greatest success is  that I am the president. I do not agree with that. It is not a  success; it is responsibility.    The most recent period in the history of Lithuania began in  1988--it was the beginning of the fight to regain independence.  There were various moments. Also a moment when we--I mean, my  party--were down at the very bottom.    The greatest success was that when we came to power over a  year ago, we managed to continue the reforms--but not at the  cost of the man in the street. This is very important. Nothing  can happen at the cost of the people; the entire burden of the  reforms should not rest on their shoulders. So far we have not  spoiled anything; at any rate, the situation is certainly not  worse.    What will happen next--we will see. Life does not end with  one party. Anything may happen. Maybe new forces will emerge...</p>

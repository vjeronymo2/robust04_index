The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on March 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BASF Rensselaer plant (3.84 mil.sq.ft/88 acres) is located at 36 Riverside Avenue, Rensselaer (Rensselaer County), New York, one mile east of the city of Albany across the Hudson River. The plant (440 employees) is used to produce certain chemical dyes and pigments, such as powdered and liquid dyestuffs, uvinuls, sicotans, and other pigments for the plastics and coatings industries (duty rates_free to 20%, some currently under duty suspension). Approximately 40 to 60 percent of material inputs are sourced from abroad, including: Rosa chloride CF/BRF, diaminoimid, uvinul, dimethylaminobenaldehyde, inorganic acids, chlorides, hydroxides, sulfites, acyclic hydrocarbons, acyclic acids, phenols, benzaldehyde, aldehyde-function compounds, ketones, quinones, oxalic/carbolic acids, polyamines, aminos, sulfurs, heterocyclic compounds, colorants, organic active agents, lubricating preparations, carbon finishing and antioxidizing agents, acrylic polymers, urea/thiourea resins (duty rates_free to 20%, some currently under duty suspension). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone procedures would exempt BASF from Customs duty payments on the foreign materials used in export production. On domestic sales, the company is seeking to eliminate duty payments on foreign materials which under Customs procedures would be subject to accountable loss in the manufacturing process. Also, the plant would pay duties on a deferred basis. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the facility's international competitiveness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is May 23, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period June 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Office of the Port Director, U.S. Customs Service, James T.

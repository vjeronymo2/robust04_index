			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Take a rich sprinkling of serious chefs . . .  -Nicholas Lander gathers some tips from top professionals for entertaining throughout the year David and Mary Adlard, Adlard's, 79 Upper St Giles Street, Norwich, NR2 1AB. Tel: 0603-633522. This year is the restaurant's 10th anniversary and so far Mary and I have survived my stroke, two children, moving the restaurant, moving homes and the recession. One of the most exciting times in the kitchen is discovering a new supplier. It may be the opted-out teacher with an array of wild mushrooms, the organic farmer with Swiss chard, globe artichokes and La Ratte salad potatoes, or the woman with quails' eggs in her plaited basket. As a result of our latest move we now have a garden and I grabbed a tiny area as a vegetable garden for salads and edible flowers - nasturtiums, pot marigold, Oriental Saladini, sorrel and Japanese salad, nizuna and tatsoi from a visit to Amsterdam. With these ingredients we serve a simple dish at lunch - Salad of globe artichokes and La Ratte potatoes with a red pepper sauce. Peel the artichokes, revealing the heart. Submerge in white wine vinegar for 20 minutes. Wash the vinegar off and cook until tender in chicken stock. Remove the choke and cut up the artichoke and dress with vinaigrette (5:1 extra virgin olive oil to red wine vinegar plus seasoning). Cook the unpeeled potato in salted water until al dente. Peel and slice the potatoes and toss in vinaigrette and chives, chopped shallots and garlic while the potatoes are warm. Check the seasoning. Discard the pith of the red pepper. Sweat the pepper with shallots and garlic, add white wine and orange juice and reduce. Add chicken stock and cook until the red pepper is soft. Magimix and pass through a sieve. Season. Then assemble the dish starting with the red pepper sauce, then the artichokes and potatoes and a great fresh dressed salad with edible flowers, using fresh herbs. Please, eat the flowers.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHLORINE LEAK AT FILTRATION PLANT FORCES EVACUATION  </P> <P> A leaking chlorine tank forced the evacuation of about 125 people before dawn  Sunday as hazardous materials crews worked for several hours to secure a faulty  valve at a Serrano Irrigation District water filtration plant.  </P> <P> Firefighters said people who lived near the facility were awakened and  evacuated at 1:25 a.m., about 45 minutes after an Orange police officer  reported a strong chemical odor coming from the plant at 19352 Taft Ave.  </P> <P> Hazardous materials crews from Anaheim and the Orange County Fire Department  found chlorine used for water purification coming from a 500-gallon tank and  ordered residents evacuated from the surrounding neighborhood. Chlorine fumes  can be lethal in cloud form.  </P> <P> Although inconvenienced by being awakened from their sleep early Sunday, those  who were evacuated said they were generally thankful that authorities took  swift action to protect them.  </P> <P> "I was delighted they moved us out," said Larry Dick, who lives on Playano  Avenue. "We might have slept right through it, and I am not comfortable with  what the ramifications might have been."  </P> <P> Authorities allowed residents to return home about 3:50 p.m. when the leak was  shut off. They were temporarily housed at Villa Park High School in a center  set up by the Orange County Chapter of the American Red Cross. No one was  injured.  </P> <P> "I just took it in stride," said J.B. Fowler, who was awakened and told to  leave his home on Yurok Street. "It seemed to be a very orderly and smooth  operation.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Fourth National Working Meeting on Cracking  Illegal Textile Transit-Trade Activities, jointly sponsored by  the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the  General Administration of Customs, and the State Administration  for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, was opened  in Guangzhou today. Over the past year our government  departments have adopted a series of measures to stop illegal  textile transit-trade activities. Since 1990 our country has  punished 14 domestic export enterprises and manufacturers,  suspended trade contacts with three foreign enterprises, and  closed the office of a foreign enterprise in China.    The meeting participants published a bulletin on punishing  four enterprises including Shengyang's (Dongmao) Industrial  Company, and others which engaged in illegal textile  transit-trade activities. The meeting will also study and solve  several specific problems occurring in the course of cracking  illegal transit-trade activities, such as exports of textile  products without the country of origin noted, export permits for  textile products, appeals lodged by relevant export enterprises,  controversial places of origin, and falsification of place of  origin. This year the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, General Administration of Customs, and the State  Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export  Commodities will form a leading group responsible for cracking  illegal textile transit-trade activities. They will continue to  carry out a nationwide investigation and formulate specific  measures and methods.    On behalf of Guangdong Province, Vice Governor Lu Ruihua  addressed the meeting. He said: Guangdong has never supported,  concealed, or covered up illegal textile transit-trade  activities. It will make checks at all levels in terms of orders  of goods, agents, and exports to put an end to illegal smuggling  of textile goods.    Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation, attended today's meeting and  spoke.</p>

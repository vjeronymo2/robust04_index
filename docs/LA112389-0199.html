			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: SURGERY MIGHT BE NEEDED LATER  </P> <P> Q My 7-year-old female Shih Tzu suddenly developed a sore neck. My local vet  treated her for several days, then referred me to an orthopedic surgeon  veterinarian. My little dog was very inactive, cried out when touched on top of  her neck area and walked stiffly and only when urged. The orthopedic  veterinarian X-rayed her and recommended removal of a portion of the vertebra,  saying it was a pinched-nerve, slipped-disc situation. The charge for surgery  would be about $1,000, which I could not do, so I have continued with  medication prescribed by my local vet -- prednisone, Robaxin and Valium. Now,  one month after the onset, she seems OK. She runs, plays and acts quite  normally.  </P> <P> I would like a second opinion, please. Would it be injurious to her to continue  medication (side effects, etc.)? If the neck situation is eased, what are the  chances of reoccurrence? Is surgery on a little dog's vertebra usually  successful? She has had a lower back problem very similar to the problem with  her neck but closer to her tail. Both times, a cortisone shot cleaned it up.  The last time was nearly nine months ago. Should this be treated with surgery  too? I would really appreciate your comments about my dog's problem.  </P> <P> Lois Copenhagen,  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P> <P> A From your description of your dog's signs and the diagnosis of both your  veterinarian and the referral surgeon, it is apparent that your dog has a disc  problem of the cervical spine (neck), which is relatively common for her breed  and age. Treatment depends on the severity of the signs and the potential  damage done to the nerve roots or the spinal cord.  </P> <P> Many dogs respond well to long-term medication such as the prednisone and  restriction of activity. The use of a harness instead of a collar is mandatory  to prevent further injury to the neck. If the damage is more extensive, with  the disc material putting pressure on the nervous tissue, and your dog becomes  weak and suffers more pain, surgery may be your only alternative. Success with  surgery is generally very good, depending again on the condition of the dog's  neck and her neurological status. If her weakness and pain become severe,  surgery may not be as successful.  </P> <P> Long-term medication is generally given on a reduced protocol in order to  prevent any side effects and yet provide the relief necessary for your dog. You  should follow your veterinarian's advice and have her checked frequently for  any signs of a deteriorating condition. Reoccurrence is a definite possibility,  and surgery may be her only alternative for a normal life, if she does get  worse.  </P> <P> Q Where can I purchase a healthy cockatiel for Christmas? I have seen them for  sale at swap meets and wonder if it is OK to buy them there.  </P> <P> Cheryl Twain,  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P> <P> A Any time you want to purchase a pet, it is best done through a reputable  breeder or, for birds, a pet shop that specializes in birds and their  accessories, such as food and cages. Be sure to ask about the pet's age, sex  (if possible), special diets, exercise needs and any potential illness or  problems. Avoid the quiet recluse or any bird that just doesn't seem right to  you. Birds are very good at masking their illnesses, so you must be very  observant. Hand-tamed birds are going to be more expensive than those that  aren't tamed, so be sure to ask how the bird was raised and if it will need any  special training. Avoid any smuggled birds, regardless of cost.  </P> <P> Q With the cold season starting, do I need to keep my dogs indoors, or is it OK  to put them out at night? They are both shepherd mixes and have good coats and  love to be outdoors. They are out at nights now.  </P> <P> Tim Buchanan,  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P> <P> A If your dogs enjoy the outdoors and are healthy, it would be OK as long as  you do provide shelter from the rain and dampness. Most dogs like to come in at  night, so if the house is off-limits, you might give them access to the garage.  If the weather turns extremely cold, do keep them in.  </P> <P> Got a question about your pet?

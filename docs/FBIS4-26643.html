			<p>BFN     [Text] Liu Zegang, the arch criminal belonging to a big  gang of criminals who abducted women and forced them to engage  in prostitution, which caused a sensation in the mountain city  of Benxi, was shot dead on the spot by public security police  when he resisted arrest with a gun and put up a desperate  struggle.    In March 1994, Benxi city public security bureau cracked a  case involving a big gang of criminals who abducted women and  forced them to engage in prostitution. This gang involved 31  criminals. Under the pretext of helping them find a job in  Guangzhou or arranging a tour for them, they fooled 39 school  girls and unemployed young women and took them to Shenzhen and  forced them to engage in prostitution in an effort to seek  exorbitant profits. In addition, they also used despicable and  cruel means to inflict mental and physical suffering on them.  So far, public security organs have captured 16 criminals and  saved 10 young women. Criminal Liu Zegang was the chieftain of  the criminal gang. In September 1990, he was sentenced to three  and a half years imprisonment for theft. After his release, he  was unemployed. Shortly after 1500 on the afternoon of 26 May,  after being pursued and captured by the police with no way out,  criminal Liu ignoring the police's repeated oral warnings and  warning shots, stubbornly resisted arrest with a gun and was  wounded by our public security police's decisive firing of guns  and subsequently died.    Recently, Benxi city public security bureau held a  commendatory meeting to award a citation of merit, third class,  to Inspectors Wang Ge and Wang Baoren who pursued and shot  criminal Liu.</p>

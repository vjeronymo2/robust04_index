			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Funds show surge out of Germany GERMANY'S long-term capital account deficit increased almost eight-fold in June because of a surge in demand for foreign securities, the Bundesbank said yesterday. The swing resulted in net capital exports during the month of DM6.7bn (Pounds 2.37bn) compared with a net inflow of DM1.9bn in May. Some observers suggested the rise in the long-term deficit - to DM7.43bn from DM933m in May - was caused by investors shifting funds abroad to escape a 30 per cent tax on investment income, to be introduced next January. But others pointed out that the surge, of which DM4.2bn went into D-Mark-denominated bonds issued by foreign banks, coincided with an increase in such issues. They noted that the June deficit a year earlier was DM10.29bn. Total long-term capital outflows for the first six months of the year were only DM27bn, compared with DM40bn in the comparable part of 1991. Clearer indications of the impact of Germany's new withholding tax, which was widely expected although only approved in July, should appear over the next few months. However, the government is clearly anxious about the possibility of accelerating capital flight to countries with no or less rigorous taxes on investment earnings. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, appealed recently to the European Commission to prepare proposals for harmonisation. Bonn introduced its new rules reluctantly after a ruling from the constitutional court which demanded that all income should be taxed on the same basis. Provisional figures issued by the independent central bank yesterday showed Germany's overall capital account surplus in June shrank to DM4.99bn from DM8.75bn in May, and compared with a deficit of DM613m in June last year. The May surplus was corrected from a provisional DM6.3bn because of a heavy revision of the short-term balance. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday he was sure economic growth next year would exceed 3 per cent after a 2 per cent increase in gross national product in 1992. Meanwhile, the federal statistics office confirmed the slow-down in west German inflation. Consumer prices in July were 3.3 per cent higher than a year earlier. The consumer price index stood at 115.2 (1985 = 100). However, the cost of services, which have been hit by relatively high wage awards, is still increasing above the average rate. Motor repairs were 8 per cent dearer than a year ago. Bread, beer and rents were up by about 5 per cent.</p>

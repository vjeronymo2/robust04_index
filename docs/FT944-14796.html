			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Rate rise damps mortgage lending The rise in interest rates last month appears to have hit mortgage lending - with commitments to new loans made by building societies in September slipping from the previous month. However, the rise of 0.5 of a percentage point in interest rates also helped societies - by boosting the inflow of customer savings. Statistics released yesterday by the Building Societies Association show that net new commitments last month dropped to Pounds 2.97bn, compared with Pounds 3.02bn in August. In 1993, the September figure was Pounds 2.56bn - increased from Pounds 2.43bn in August. The monthly loans figures are an important forward-looking indicator as they translate into lending carried out in following weeks. New net lending in September totalled Pounds 1.11bn, against Pounds 1.13bn in August and just Pounds 747m in September last year. In spite of the slight month-on-month drop in both gross and net new loans Mr Adrian Coles, the association's director-general, sounded upbeat. He said levels of lending were now close to those in 1992 and significantly higher than in the same period last year. But he warned that the 'cautious, yet relatively stable market' could be damaged by further rises in interest rates. He said the growth in lending probably meant societies were recovering market-share, rather than that the market was improving. Last summer the popularity of fixed-rate mortgages offered by banks severely hit societies' lending. The higher rates societies were able to offer on deposits after the rise in base rates helped them to attract more savings. Net retail receipts totalled Pounds 322m - the highest monthly level since May and more than three times the August figure of Pounds 91m. Seasonal factors were also an element - savings usually increase at this time of year.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Very Heath Robinson - William Packer admires an old favourite TO HAVE one's name enter the language is rare enough a distinction, one usually reserved to the inventor by virtue of the eponymous invention - mackintosh, biro, wellington, umbrella: well, perhaps not umbrella. For an artist to do so through his work must be rare indeed, and as a bare and general descriptive too, without benefit of qualifier or pointer, as in 'Titian-haired'. 'Hogarthian', 'Dickensian' or 'Turneresque' do not really count, for being too close to the work itself and its context, a very particular mise-en-scene. Yet the cartoonist and illustrator, William Heath Robinson, managed to pull off the trick within the few years of the First World War and after. By the end of the 1920s his name was in the language, and there it has remained, active and meaningful still, through decades in which the work itself has slowly begun to fade from the collective memory. By the time of the Second World War, he was a national institution, his humane and ludicrous satires catching exactly the national mood, a most effective and ironical shield against War and all its horrors. It is a nice paradox that to those generations with direct experience of total war, his visual pleasantries were entirely acceptable, while to us, whose battles come by way of the television screen, they might seem arch, escapist, even inappropriate. War kills people: don't make jokes: someone might be upset. So it is that with Heath Robinson we have the curious case of work that is certainly less generally familiar than it was, and yet the associative power of the word in no way diminished. How very Heath Robinson it is, we say, as we look at some wretched, gim-crack contrivance of wire and string and sticky tape, any improvised system of rods and pulleys, any kind of mechanical first-aid. We all know just what we mean. It is good, therefore, to be brought back directly to the work, and to confront again the extraordinary visual inventiveness from which such meaning sprang. William Heath Robinson was born in 1872 and died in 1944, the youngest of three brothers, all of whom were to distinguish themselves as illustrators. Now, at the Royal Festival Hall (until March 29), as part of Towards the Millennium, that on-running celebration, through the 1990s, of the 20th century, the South Bank Board is showing his Machines and Inventions. The exhibition has been arranged by Chris Beetles, who has also put on a large show of the work of the three brothers together, Thomas, Charles and William, at his London gallery (8 Ryder Street, St James's SW1, until March 20). They all come of the same school of British illustration, that in late Victorian and Edwardian times had proved so robust, rich and various in talent, from Tenniel and Keene, through Morris, Crane and Beardsley to Rackham and Dulac. But it is William who is at once the most graphically original and inventive, besides being by far the most humorous of the three. His has been a lasting influence, with Nicholas Bentley perhaps his most distinguished follower in terms of formal example, but also Pont, and both Ronald Searle and Roland Emmett in terms of surreal invention. The jokes still work wonderfully, the explosions and the splashes, the tunnels and balloons, the spikes and levers, but it is the graphic sophistication that is now, if anything, the more astonishing and enjoyable. He moves from inside to outside, from underwater to mid-air, from diagram to description, with the most disconcerting uet convincing ease and certainty. Cranes and tanks, submarines and aeroplanes, divers and balloonists, cooks and waitresses, all give him particular joy. Here is a tramp-steamer about to pin an enemy submarine to the ocean floor by mounting an attack with trunks and sea-chests; here a diver snipping the bait from the fisherman's hook; here a drilling frame to keep raw recruits in step; here a tea-shop regulating machine, to measure out the rationed tea and sugar. Underground, far below no-man's land, the British siphons off the German soldier's beer. The cook pumps the steaming dinner plate up the service shaft to the anxious housemaid far above. Always we work out the problem with him, follow the string from the bed to the sprung shelf, to the lead weight which will fall on the bellows, which will blow out the candle. Step by step, we read and accept the mad, credible logic. If you live in a flat, of course you take your exercise in mid-air: of course you do. Whatever next? Quite wonderful.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Letter: Objectivity in radio jamming Sir, Your editorial on Bosnia ('Strong words, weak action', July 9) ends on a James Bond type of note by referring to a mystery ship 'that was broadcasting objective news to all the ex-Yugoslav republics from offshore in the Adriatic'. It ceased operations 'because of a Serbian complaint to the International Broadcasting Union'. You urge the nations that are enforcing sanctions in the Adriatic to render all necessary assistance to enable the ship to resume operations. I can only conclude that the Serbo-Croat programmes of the BBC World Service and of the Voice of America, which, incidentally, are not subject to jamming, are deemed by you to fall short of object-ivity.

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Revolution cracks the mould: How the big four's strategies have diverged Mr Martin Taylor was employing his rhetorical skills yesterday to play down the significance of his decision to 'move marbles from one jar to another' at Barclays. Yet the reorganisation of the largest UK bank contributes to a gradual but revolutionary change taking place in the industry. Since the last century and the regional bank mergers that culminated in the 'big four', Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds and Midland have been hard to tell apart. They have been run by bankers who worked their way up through the lending hierarchy, emerging from the same mould. This means banks have tended to adopt similar lending policies; they have made a poor job of managing investment banking arms; and they moved in a herd into new markets without analysing them well. Mr Brian Pitman's emphasis at Lloyds on judging all operations by the yardstick of return on equity has now gained universal acceptance among UK banks. Indeed, Mr Taylor said yesterday that he would like to have more internal competition at Barclays for the use of capital. Mr Taylor's proposed reforms address two issues with which other clearing banks have struggled. The first is how to respond to the growing tendency of large and medium-sized business to raise money on capital markets; the second is the need to improve the standard of management. Yesterday's move mainly dealt with the first point, but was intended to allow him to see more clearly how to achieve the second. He ended the split between the two large divisions covering investment banking and commercial banking, creating a new group covering all services to large companies. He explained this as 'trying to use all the organisational string and plaster I can' to make sure that lending bankers co-operate with those offering services such as securities custody, cash handling and equity underwriting. Each of the big four now has a different approach to this conundrum. NatWest put corporate lending within investment banking; Midland divided the two after trying to combine them three years ago in a similar group to that proposed at Barclays; Lloyds does not have an investment banking arm. Mr Keith Whitson, Midland's chief executive says that HSBC abolished the Midland Montagu group, which combined lending to large companies with broking, because it was hard to combine the cultures. Lending bankers wanted to develop relationships, while brokers were driven by single transactions. Mr Whitson says Midland preserves the divide between the functions but brings teams of specialists together. It also emphasises that it will not tolerate disputes. 'Debates on how to divide the fees may arise occasionally, but we hit them on the head very hard,' he says. NatWest placed corporate banking within its investment bank NatWest Markets 18 months ago. This was part of changes by its new management, which included creating a new group head office to which its four divisions report. About 200 people - some of the most senior recruited from outside - form this group. Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest chief executive, argues that the split between the head office and operating arms - which Mr Taylor says he may implement at Barclays - is vital in imposing discipline. It also encourages managers at the centre to plan strategy and allocate capital among operations better. 'There was always a view before that the headquarters was essentially part of the clearing bank, which was going to struggle to understand other parts of the business,' he says. Mr Wanless says it was important to recruit some executives from outside banking to give the right mix of skills. Mr Taylor expressed similar thoughts yesterday: 'It may well be that at some stage we will need to refresh the group by bringing in people at the centre.' Such refreshment is likely to reinforce the process by which the big four are slowly becoming easier to distinguish.</p>

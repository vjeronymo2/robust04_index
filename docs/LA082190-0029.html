			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> COUNTY SUES TO HALT REDEVELOPMENT PLAN  </P> <P> Ventura County has filed a suit against the city of Santa Paula and that city's  Redevelopment Agency, saying the agency's approval July 16 of a redevelopment  plan is illegal.  </P> <P> The suit, filed Friday, says the city's general plan, upon which the project is  based, is inadequate and does not meet government codes.  </P> <P> In addition, Santa Paula has not proved that the formation of the Redevelopment  Agency will not financially hurt the county. "The $240-million project will  cost us more than $80 million over the 40 years it is planned to run," said  County Counsel Daniel F. Murphy.  </P> <P> Santa Paula City Councilman Les Maland said, however, that the county  ultimately would benefit from the project, because property values would rise,  thereby generating more taxes.  </P> <P> Under redevelopment, the city's property tax base is frozen so taxing agencies,  such as the county, no longer automatically receive revenue from a rise in  property taxes.  </P> <P> Such taxing bodies must come to an agreement, called a pass-through, with the  Redevelopment Agency on the percentage of the increment they will receive.  Because of the size of the area, which at 30% of the city far exceeds the 8%  that the county allows for redevelopment projects, the county says it is  entitled to a 100% pass-through.  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency's environmental impact report is also deficient,  Murphy said, because it does not address such areas as the effects of  redevelopment upon traffic outside the project area.  </P> <P> Santa Paula Mayor Kay Wilson responded by saying the lawsuit was expected. "We  . . . understand the county feels it has to do it. But I have to defend Santa  Paula because it needs and deserves a redevelopment project." AMELIA CHAFFEE  </P></p>

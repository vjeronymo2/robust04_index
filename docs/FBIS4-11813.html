			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi in Bani Walid on 29 </F> March -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Brothers, the rumors of colonialism and  appendices of colonialism, and the attempts of colonialism are  smashed today on the steadfast and proud mountains of Wadi  Dinar, on the mountains of Bani Walid just as they were in the  Italian era, brothers. Today, brothers, we challenge the  enemies from Wadi Dinar in Bani Walid, the Wadi where the blood  of martyrs had flowed, the martyrs of Bani Walid who fought the  Italian army which was stronger in number and equipment and  material. The free voice, the voice of defiance rises from Bani  Walid, from Wadi Dinar. Our voice rises, brothers, in defiance  of the agents, the disreputed American intelligence, and we  challenge America with its might. We are stronger than it  because we have the right to our land and we have the right to  live freely, proudly, under the sun and on the land of our  fathers and ancestors, which was irrigated by their blood,  brothers.    Brothers, from this sacred valley, in which the blood of  your  martyr fathers and grandfathers of Bani Walid flowed, our voice  rises with defiance, and we announce the destruction of the  conspiracies of America, its hirelings, its intelligence  service, its rumors, and its [word indistinct].    Brothers, we are destroying their rumors as we have  destroyed  their armies in this valley.    Brothers, sons of Bani Walid, grandsons of the martyr  (?Gulbar) hero of Afya battle, sons of Bani Walid, grandsons of  the martyr al- Sadiq (?Buli), hero of (?Tagirbit) battle, you  must remain faithful to the blood that flowed in Dinar valley to  defend the freedom of Libya, to defend Pan-Arabism and to defend  Islam, the religion of Pan-Arabism. You must remain faithful to  the blood that flowed in [words indistinct] against Turkish  colonialism.    [passage omitted] Brothers, today Bani Walid's role has come  to line up in the preparation battle, in the defiant battle  against the international encroachment and haughtiness  (?practised) by America and its allies. In this Wadi we did not  fear Italy's legions and we smashed Italy's arrogance in Wadi  Dinar. [passage omitted]    Now, we declare that, once again, we are ready for  confrontation and defiance in Wadi Dinar, in Zaytouna, and  everywhere in our land, to face up to a new confrontation  against new colonialism. We are the sons, the grandsons of  those people whose blood flowed in this Wadi. Brothers, we will  be faithful to this blood.    Today, brothers, Bani Walid's voice is raised in the defiant  battle as long as colonialism points its rifles against the  chest of each son of our people, and as long as colonialism  targets the freedom of every area of this homeland. Wirfallah  [a tribe, members of which were accused of spying] cannot but  line up in the battle of glory, pride, defiance, and  independence. It is a battle of independence, a battle of  awakening of the Arab nation from the Ocean to the Gulf.    Your shouts at Wadi Dinar and Bani Walid will not go unheard  and in vain; today the whole Arab nation, from the Atlantic to  the Gulf, is hearing your shouts. These shouts represent a  boost for the Palestinian militants and thousands of  Palestinians kept inside the prisons of the Israeli forces of  occupation. Your shouts raise the morale of Lebanese fighters,  fighters of the Somali people, and all militants of the Arab  nation to liberate the occupied territories that stretch from  Ceuta and Melilla to the usurped Palestine. Brothers, this voice  emanating from Wadi Dinar and Bani Walid is being heard by the  whole Arab nation.    From this position, from the sacred Wadi Dinar, we invite  Warfalah to take a leading role and mobilize itself for  confrontation, as we always expect it to do. It should lead the  confrontation to defend the dignity, honor, and the whole  nation. Brothers, we will never give up, and history will never  be able to record that we have abdicated our duties. We are the  sons of the district [word indistinct], the sons of the martyrs  and heroes. History will never be able to write that we have not  responded to the call for the preparation for confrontation.    Bani Walid will never miss the opportunity and will answer  the call of the holy war, the call for the confrontation against  the United States and the allies of the United States. Cursed  are those agents: the traitors, the cowards, those who gave up  and bowed, those who sold their country to others. Cursed are  the pitiful cowards. Glory and honor for these revolutionaries,  these brave people, the sons of Bani Walid who march today in  Wadi Dinar to announce their collective pledge. Bani Walid is a  fortress of defiance, Bani Walid is a fortress of steadfastness,  Bani Walid is a fortress of confrontation. The struggle  continues, and victory is inevitable, brothers. Forward we  march until the sun of liberty shines on the whole Arab world,  from the Atlantic to the Gulf. Forward we go and may the  struggle continue.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTEREST COSTS RISE FURTHER AS FED HIKES DISCOUNT RATE  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve, sending a strong public signal that the central bank is  determined to continue its year-long trench warfare against inflation, boosted  a key lending rate from 6.5% to 7% Friday.  </P> <P> The hike in the Fed's discount rate to its highest level in almost three years,  although widely expected, jolted Wall Street and helped spark another round of  broad interest-rate hikes.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average fell 43.92 points to 2,245.54, and most banks  immediately fell in line behind Chase Manhattan Bank, which lifted its prime  lending rate Thursday from 11% to 11.5%. The interest rate hikes will be  translated quickly into higher borrowing costs on a variety of consumer and  business loans.  </P> <P> The Fed's board of governors, citing "inflationary pressures in the economy,"  approved the hike in the discount rate -- the interest rate that the central  bank charges financial institutions for emergency loans -- on a 6-1 vote.  Martha Seger was the lone opponent of the move.  </P> <P> The increase, the first since August, brought the discount rate to its highest  level since April, 1986.  </P> <P> President Bush, speaking at a press conference in Tokyo before departing for  Beijing, said of the Fed's action: "I can't say I'm happy about the rise in  interest rates." But he minimized his differences with Alan Greenspan, chairman  of the Federal Reserve.  </P> <P> "I don't think Greenspan and I are far apart," Bush said. "We've got a little  difference . . . on how you read the indicators on inflation . . . ."  </P> <P> He said that interest rates would decline once the White House and Congress  reach agreement on a plan to reduce the U.S. budget deficit.  </P> <P> Bush has expressed concern that higher interest rates might choke off the U.S.  economic expansion.  </P> <P> The increase came at the end of a week of steady rises in another key interest  rate controlled by the Fed. The federal funds rate, which banks charge each  other for overnight loans, rose from roughly 9.25% at the beginning of the week  to close at 9.875% Friday.  </P> <P> The Fed fixes the federal funds rate, regarded as an even more significant  measure of the central bank's policy intentions than the discount rate, by  controlling the supply of credit to the banking industry. The federal funds  rate last was as high as 9.875% in October, 1984.  </P> <P> The boost in the discount rate followed closely on the heels of two recently  released inflation reports, which showed that prices at both the wholesale and  consumer levels jumped sharply in January.  </P> <P> It also came only a day after Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady presented  the most critical of a series of comments by Bush Administration officials over  the last few weeks questioning the Fed's policy of trying to curb higher  inflation by gradually pushing interest rates up.  </P> <P> "I don't see as strong evidence of inflation right now as does the Federal  Reserve," Brady told the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee.  </P> <P> But there were signs Friday that the Bush Administration was having second  thoughts about the wisdom of its verbal jawboning of Greenspan.  </P> <P> "Keeping inflation low is essential to sustaining the economic expansion . . .  " Brady said. "The Federal Reserve's actions must be viewed in light of those  goals."  </P> <P> Another key member of Bush's economic team, Richard G. Darman, director of the  Office of Management and Budget, told reporters that public criticism of the  Fed generally does the Administration more harm than good. It is "extremely  unhelpful," he said, "to have overt, visible disagreement (between) key  economic policy makers of an Administration and the chairman of the Fed."  </P> <P> Darman acknowledged the Administration is worried that if higher interest rates  "continue over a period of time, it would have seriously adverse consequences"  on its hopes for sustained economic growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeks Budget Bargaining  </P> <P> Attempting to prod Democrats on Capitol Hill to launch behind-the-scenes  bargaining with the White House on the budget, he said that the recent rise in  interest rates should give both Congress and the White House "all the more  reason for negotiating (a deficit reduction agreement) on some basis that isn't  business as usual."  </P> <P> Michael J. Boskin, the White House's chief economic adviser, said that he  supports the Federal Reserve in its goal of trying "to keep inflation low and  prevent it from rising."  </P> <P> The discount rate move also appears to have deflected a potential rift between  a group of Fed regional bank presidents, who frequently have pushed for tougher  actions against inflation, and the Washington-based board of governors, some of  whom had thought inflation fears were exaggerated.  </P> <P> The discount rate is set by the board, while actions that affect the fed funds  rate are determined at meetings attended by all of the Fed's top officials.  </P> <P> Wayne Angell, a Fed governor, insisted that "it is way too simplistic to talk  just about a dichotomy between the (regional bank) presidents and the board."  But he added that "some of us here are very well aware that monetary policy in  the past has often led to stop-go policies, and we have a large incentive to  avoid those kinds of disruptions."  </P> <P> And some signs of tension inside the Fed remained. The central bank said that  two of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks -- Cleveland and Dallas -- did not  join in the request for a 7% discount rate, and it appeared that those banks  would have preferred an even sharper increase in the discount rate.  </P> <P> The discount rate was last at 7% from March 7 to April 18, 1986, when it  dropped to 6.5%. The rate bottomed at 5.5% in August, 1986.  </P> <P> Analysts were sharply divided over the impact of the Fed's action.  </P> <P> Some said that they believe the central bank's discount rate hike does not go  far enough to stem inflationary pressures. "The Fed was too little, too late,"  said A. Gary Shilling, a New York economic consultant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Against Tightening  </P> <P> But other economists said that they are just as convinced that the Fed should  avoid any further credit tightening. They argued that recent signs of  escalating inflation will soon dissolve and that the Fed is unnecessarily  running the risk of pushing the economy into a recession.  </P> <P> "The Fed is moving the economy into an unknown danger zone," warned Richard  Rahn, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "They are overreacting  to nothing more than an inflationary blip we're in and already have gone far  enough that there's a good chance we'll move into a low-growth posture."  </P> <P> Most analysts, however, agreed with Shilling that the Fed's action is necessary  to prevent the economy from overheating and help keep inflation from  escalating.  </P> <P> "If the Fed waited too long to confront the growing inflation problem, you  could blow this economy out of the water," said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed  governor who is chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Assn. "The economy is  still too robust for its own good."  </P> <P> John Makin, a top economist at the American Enterprise Institute here, agreed  that the Fed "is moving in the right direction. If they hadn't tightened,  interest rates would have gone up anyway and the Fed would be further behind  the curve."  </P> <P> He acknowledged, though, that signs of higher inflation increase the odds of a  recession later this year or next year. "They may be doing the best they can,"  he said, "but there are no guarantees the Fed won't make a mistake."  </P></p>

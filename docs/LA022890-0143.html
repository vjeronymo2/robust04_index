			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> OCC'S 'BOYS' LIFE' PROVES MERELY EXASPERATING  </P> <P> At one point in Howard Korder's "Boys' Life," Jack says he handles most of  life's bumps by thinking of Ray Charles. Someone such as Ray would always be  cool, always do the right thing, no matter what the dilemma.  </P> <P> A nice role model, Ray Charles, but he would probably say "hit the road" to  Jack and his pals for the way they behave, especially with women. Jack, Don and  Phil, Korder's thin impressions of arrested male development fired by hormonal  fuel, tend to do the wrong thing as they drink too much beer, smoke a lot of  dope, joke about breasts and hit on most of the women they encounter.  </P> <P> They're pretty silly, really, so it's hard taking them seriously. The thing is,  Korder anxiously wants us to take them seriously. He wants us to see them as  symbols of the male predicament.  </P> <P> "Boys' Life," now in a wobbly production at Orange Coast College, is generally  an immature play about immature men. Korder has shown that he can be an  intelligent and dynamic writer -- his "Search and Destroy" had impact in its  recent run at South Coast Repertory -- but this 1988 drama is often a shallow  experience.  </P> <P> You can see where Korder is trying to take "Boys' Life." Growing up to be a man  is a tough business, with all that sexual conditioning to deal with. Should we  be gentle, loving guys (as Don apparently chooses when he acquiesces to a  normal life and gets married) or perfect heels? Hey, aren't men designed to be  predators, or at least beasts?  </P> <P> Jack (Sharr White) understands the irony too well. He's got a wife and a kid  and an overcoat of cynicism that weighs him and everybody else way down. Jack's  still attractive, though, so he has an easy time with women. He's just filling  space; Jack hates himself, so he might as well take it out on others.  </P> <P> Phil (Greg Guy) is a wimp, the opposite of take-charge, can-do Jack. He  persuades women to sleep with him by whining. He lies to himself and to them.  He's full of guilt for being such a weak creep. Phil should feel bad -- he  actually has sex with a date while she is passed out, drunk.  </P> <P> Don (James Rurup) is like Jack but he's also like Phil. He wants to take it  easy and stroll through life. Responsibility is like grit in the bed for Don,  until he meets a strong-willed sculptor. She helps him become an adult. Out of  gratitude, or maybe fear, he decides to marry her.  </P> <P> A lot of the time during "Boys' Life" you want to grab these boys by the collar  and give them a shake. Hey, snap out of it! Come on, grow up! That's when it  almost works. But the play doesn't take us further, we don't see where these  three are going. They're exasperating, and so is "Boys' Life."  </P> <P> At OCC, there's an air of appropriateness in having a college-age cast take on  Korder's characters. The John Ferzacca-directed actors naturally convey the  self-absorption inherent within the theme, but they don't fully evoke the  roles' dimensions that might overcome some of the script's weaknesses. Too many  single notes being played over and over again.  </P> <P> The performances have consistency but not enough of the contradiction that  should result when playing characters out of touch with themselves. Rurup, with  his low-wattage, fairly internalized approach, comes the closest to embodying  the paradox.  </P> <P> 'BOYS' LIFE'  </P> <P> An Orange Coast College production of Howard Korder's play. Directed by John  Ferzacca. With Sharr White, James Rurup, Greg Guy, Daniel J. Combs, Shannon  Cernich, Alma C. Ferrera-Grand, Angela Sanders, Stacey Stapleton and Elizabeth  Hoffmann.

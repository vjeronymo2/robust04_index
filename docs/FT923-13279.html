			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: US sales at Visa climb by 11.5% VISA, one of the leading US credit card companies, said its first-quarter results showed an 11.5 per cent increase in domestic sales volume. The San Francisco-based company claimed this was superior to the average 10 per cent growth rate for other large credit card companies during the first three months of 1992. The statistics are set against the backdrop of a perception by most economists that US consumer confidence remained weak during the opening months of the year. Visa said it recorded Dollars 40.7bn in card transactions for the quarter ended on March 31. The number of Visa cards in circulation in the US rose by 4.5 per cent to 143m cards. The number of Visa transactions in the US increased by 9 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN ALBUM: ATLANTA HOPES TO SPRUCE UP PEACHTREE STREET;  </P> <P> A CIVIC GROUP WANTS TO REFURBISH RUNDOWN PORTIONS OF THE FAMOUS ROAD IN TIME  FOR THE OLYMPICS.  </P> <P> When Atlanta won the 1996 Summer Olympics, it guaranteed itself a massive face  lift.  </P> <P> For parts of Peachtree Street, the lift can't come too soon.  </P> <P> Peachtree is Georgia's most famous thoroughfare, and one of the best known in  America. While it sparkles around the downtown area where developer John  Portman's creations soar, the street sinks to tawdriness only a few blocks  away.  </P> <P> Tourists can spend big money in the hotel district, with its upscale shops,  stores and restaurants. But if they venture a little to the north on Peachtree,  they run into empty buildings with dirty windows and homeless men sleeping in  doorways. They also see the Imperial Hotel, an eight-story wreck of a historic  building owned by the financially squeezed Portman. It is a stark contrast to  the nearby Hyatt Regency and its airy atrium, which made him famous.  </P> <P> Such contrast is common in the downtown areas of most American cities. The  glitter often has grime as its backdrop.  </P> <P> But here, people seem more embarrassed by that than in most places. Atlanta  prides itself on its newness, a pride that has in the past gone so far that  beautiful old buildings were razed in favor of ugly modern boxes.  </P> <P> Now the Olympics are raising hopes of a building boom and cash bonanza.  Coincidentally, a civic group launched a competition for architectural and  urban design plans to refurbish a four-mile stretch of Peachtree and an  intersecting street, Auburn Avenue, the city's longstanding black commercial  district.  </P> <P> Paul Kelman, vice president of the civic group, Central Atlanta Progress, said  the Olympics victory "couldn't have come at a better time" because it will  attract creative entries and help ensure the plans get off the drawing board.  </P> <P> "Now the city will be motivated to see the project through by the time the  Olympics get here," Kelman said.  </P> <P> In the blush of victory, all problems seem soluble, but like the challenge of  funding and building the Olympic facilities, sprucing up Peachtree will not be  easy.  </P> <P> Wade DuBose Burns is an Atlanta architect whose projects include remodeling and  rebuilding the 28-acre town square in Greenwood, S.C., a project on which $100  million has been spent so far. He said planners here must overcome the problem  of "disjointed real estate, where there isn't a continual flow of activity." He  said property owners and public officials must be convinced of how important  the street is to visitors, who are the lifeblood of Atlanta's economy.  </P> <P> "Visitors are out on the street," he said. "They want that street to . . .  entertain them."  </P> <P> Even if the politicians and property owners agree on the need to cater to  tourists, there is no guarantee they will agree with Central Atlanta Progress  on how to improve the street and how to pay for it, Olympics profits  notwithstanding.  </P> <P> Several owners of what one real estate broker called "Grade-B" properties  complained that they are reluctant to invest money to upgrade the properties  because the area is thick with street people.  </P> <P> Richard Shair, president of a real estate brokerage that handles properties on  Peachtree, said tenants "put benches out, and you got bums sleeping on them."  </P> <P> Ray Boyd, a Peachtree property owner, said he tried to beautify his property by  putting a $1,000 planter on the sidewalk. It soon "looked like a trash dump,"  he said.  </P> <P> Kelman said the designs for upgrading Peachtree will focus mostly on the public  right-of-way, including sidewalks and "street furniture," such as trash  containers and lights.  </P> <P> He acknowledged that some property owners may balk at paying for the  improvements, but he said his group is considering several financing plans,  including the creation of special tax districts that would cover Peachtree  properties. He also said congregations of several churches, which are  tax-exempt, might be persuaded to help finance the refurbishing.  </P> <P> Several Peachtree occupants said they supported the idea of making the street  look better, agreeing that the timing is right because of the Olympics.  </P> <P> "Atlanta is destined to be a great international city," Boyd said proudly.  </P> <P> Is he willing to invest to improve Peachtree? "I can give you a definite  maybe."  </P></p>

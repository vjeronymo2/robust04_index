			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Tomkins The market still seems lukewarm about the wisdom of Tomkins' bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, notwithstanding Mr Gregory Hutchings' strenuous efforts to persuade. As Monday's deadline for the rights issue looms, a price of 213p tells Tomkins' shareholders to take up their rights, albeit by a fairly narrow margin. But RHM holders would still be better off accepting the 260p cash alternative rather than the paper offer, which is worth some 8p per share less. That does not suggest that RHM will do a great deal for Tomkins even if the outcome of the bid is now pretty much a foregone conclusion. The risk in the short run is that Tomkins may have to resort to uncharacteristically large fair-value provisions and cash outlays to set RHM to rights. True, ample benefit could flow from that restructuring for a year or two. But then Tomkins could find itself dependent for a large proportion of its earnings on a business with low inherent growth. It would need more large acquisitions to keep up earnings momentum. At a rating discount of more than 10 per cent to the market, Tomkins' shares look cheap. There should be some catching up to do once the rights issue and RHM have been absorbed. Yet Tomkins may not easily regain that substantial premium which makes the acquisition trail inviting.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FLORIDA STATE BECOMES ACC'S 9TH MEMBER;  </P> <P> COLLEGES: OFFICIALS AT THE INDEPENDENT FOOTBALL POWER ARE ELATED OVER THE  CHANCE TO JOIN A MAJOR ATHLETICS CONFERENCE.  </P> <P> Florida State officially joined the Atlantic Coast Conference today after  receiving unanimous approval from the Board of Regents.  </P> <P> "This is an outstanding opportunity for Florida State, and I'm sure they'll  make the most of it," said Charles Reed, chancellor of the state university  system. "It's a good fit for the Board of Regents' goal of making  student-athletes students first."  </P> <P> The ACC formally extended the invitation Thursday night, and Florida State  officials and the regents immediately moved through bureaucratic details to  sanction the move.  </P> <P> Florida State President Bernard Sliger was elated with the outcome after months  of deliberations over possible membership in the ACC or the Southeastern or  Metro conferences.  </P> <P> "It's an achievement for Florida State when you consider where we were 15 years  ago in regard to this," Sliger said. "If someone would have told me we'd be a  likely candidate for a major all-sports conference . . . personally, I feel  very, very good about what's happened."  </P> <P> Florida State officials called a news conference for Saturday at which Sliger  and ACC Commissioner Gene Corrigan will discuss details of the membership.  </P> <P> "I think it's a terrific opportunity for us in terms of every aspect of  athletics, in terms of how they view athletics and how we view athletics,"  Sliger said. "This is the fast lane, and we would hope we can keep up."  </P> <P> Florida State is ranked third in this week's Associated Press football poll and  finished in the top three each of the last three years. Only once in those  seasons did an ACC team finish in the Top 10; Clemson was ninth in 1988.  </P> <P> Corrigan said in a prepared statement that Thursday's vote to expand followed  long talks and that Florida State had been an attractive candidate from the  outset.  </P> <P> The current members of the ACC are Clemson, Duke, Georgia Tech, Maryland, North  Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia and Wake Forest. Duke and Maryland  voted against the expansion.  </P> <P> "I questioned whether expansion was in the best interests of the ACC," Duke  athletic director Tom Butters. "I never had a question about Florida State."  </P> <P> The addition of Florida State marks the fourth time the ACC's membership has  changed. There were seven charter members in 1953 -- Clemson, Duke, Maryland,  North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina and Wake Forest. Virginia  joined later that year, South Carolina left in 1971, and Georgia Tech joined in  1978.  </P> <P> There has been speculation that if the ACC added a ninth school, a 10th would  naturally follow. But ACC President Tom Spragens, Duke's faculty  representative, said he would oppose that and does not sense support for it.  </P></p>

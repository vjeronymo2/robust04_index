			<p>BFN     [Text] The morning Supreme Council session on 23 June was  attended by Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko, who for three  hours had to answer questions from parliamentarians.    The head of government had a difficult time answering  questions. Deputy Vladimir Chernyshev announced that he, as all  the citizens of the Republic, for the past 64 months has  suffered from difficulties caused by the transitional period and  asked whether the government intends to use the population's  money in reforms that are being carried out. According to him,  without this it will not be possible to fulfill the targets.    If only 32 ministers participate in building the market  economy, the prime minister said, we will not achieve anything.  It is important that the whole nation understands the need for  the introduction of new economic relations and actively  participates in this. With regard to the population's money,  the government envisages restoring the people's trust in  depositing their money in savings banks.    Answering other topical questions Sergey Tereshchenko said  that ministers are appointed in accordance with the existing  Constitution. He himself never wrote a resignation application  and does not intend to do so in the near future. Under the  present difficult and objectively shaped conditions replacing  the government will not lead to the immediate improvement of the  population's life.    The prime minister believes that the division of the former  single administration into a presidential and governmental  administration, and inclusion [word indistinct] of regional  administrations into the latter one, is the right step under the  present circumstances. It will contribute to a more effective  implementation of a program aimed at speeding up reforms and  lifting the country's economy out of crisis. As was reported  earlier, President Nazarbayev suggested reducing the time of its  implementation to 15 months.    The methodology of defining expenditure and revenue parts of  the state budget for the current year has been dictated by the  target of bringing inflation down to 8-10 percent. With regard  to spending connected with the creation of the military and  naval fleet they could be explained by the need to protect the  Caspian Sea borders.    With regard to the issue of restoring benefits for certain  categories of the population, Sergey Tereshchenko said, this has  to be decided by deputies when they endorse the budget, and they  should take into account the real financial capabilities of the  state, since you cannot solve all the problems at once.    The government thoroughly supervises the foreign debt of the  state for it not to exceed the sum that could be repaid.    Touching upon the subject of the Baykonur space range, the  prime minister reminded of a relevant agreement that has been  signed with Russia. After its ratification by the parliaments  of both countries the republican budget will be replenished at  the cost of the lease payment by the neighboring state.    Our agriculture is still too costly. We spend 30-40 percent  more per unit of produced good, compared to world standards.  Under these conditions, allocation of credits to the  agro-industrial complex is absolutely unprofitable. [Word  indistinct] mineral fertilizers, new economically beneficial  machinery and give it an opportunity [word indistinct]. The  state keeps licenses only for 33 types of exported goods.    He said that a change in the tax policy is expected. Taxes  charged on entrepreneurial activity will be reduced and  penalties for concealing profits will be increased.    In reply to one of the questions, the prime minister said  that it is economically unprofitable to stop the construction of  a new presidential residence and sport complex. The decision on  the construction of them was approved by the previous parliament.    He also said that the implementation of the new program is  not simple and it could only be carried out provided that the  government and the Supreme Council join their efforts.</p>

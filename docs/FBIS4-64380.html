			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner has  sharply criticized the current discussion about the Bundeswehr  in Germany. The German armed forces have increasingly turned  into a "quantity that is negotiable at short notice," he stated  today in Bonn during the presentation of a book by Bundeswehr  Inspector General Klaus Naumann. "If this development  continues, we will be facing problems," he pointed out.    Woerner criticized that the strength and the structure of  the  Bundeswehr seem to be "manipulable at will." This cannot be  blamed on the defense minister alone. The whole government and  the whole parliament are responsible. Woerner added: "If the  impression is created among the public that one can treat the  Bundeswehr in this way, this is the beginning of the end of  sensible security precaution in Germany." Yet not the soldiers  are to blame but the entire political class.    The NATO secretary general stressed that the reunited and  sovereign Germany can only remain a reliable partner if, as the  central land power in Europe, it maintains armed forces that  correspond to its geostrategic situation and its political  significance -- both in quantitative and qualitative terms. At  the beginning of his speech, Woerner pointed out that, as NATO  general secretary, he is not allowed to interfere with the  internal affairs of the member states of the alliance.</p>

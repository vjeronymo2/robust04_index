			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Milan scandal deals a heavy blow to Craxi: 26 people have been arrested on corruption charges FOR a nation long inured to businessmen and politicians lining their pockets, the corruption scandal in Milan marks a watershed in the morality of Italy's public life. Milan magistrates are exposing, with fresh ramifications daily, a network of pay-offs on rigged public works contracts with the funds being channelled to the political parties. In the past two months 26 businessmen, municipal officials and politicians, including five over the past two days, have been arrested on corruption charges. Many more are under investigation including Mr Carlo Tognoli, a former Socialist mayor of Milan and outgoing minister of tourism, and Mr Paolo Pillittieri, also a former mayor of Milan, newly elected deputy and brother-in-law of Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader. Previous scandals in Italy have involved larger sums of money  - like the collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano  - or more prominent public figures, as in the unmasking of the masonic lodge, P-2. But the investigations were always obstructed by powerful vested interests and the truth was obscured. The Milan scandal is different. The large nationwide protest vote in the April general elections has weakened the traditional parties of power, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, obliging them to seek new partners in a yet unformed government. In Milan the emergent populist Lombard League became the second largest party, committed to clean out corruption. These two elements make it more difficult for the course of justice to be obstructed and indeed the post-electoral political climate in Italy is unprecedentedly favourable to a clean up of public life and the investigation has acquired a seemingly unstoppable momentum. Magistrates, egged on by the media immediately judging every accused to be guilty, have uncovered the following. On February 17, Mr Mario Chiesa, the head of the city's oldest charitable hospital, the Pio Albergo Trivulzio, was arrested allegedly in the act of taking a L7m (Pounds 3,160) bribe relating to work at the Pio Albergo. Enquiries by magistrates led to allegations that he possessed L12bn in cash and bank accounts. According to magistrates' charges, Mr Chiesa was the central figure in an elaborate system of rigged contracts, pay-offs and secret funding of political parties since the mid 1980s. Under investigation are some of the major public works contracts in Milan such as the enlargement of the metro, refurbishment of the San Sirio stadium, the rebuilding of Linate and Malpensa airports, and the new 'Piccolo' theatre. Officials of companies involved in these contracts are alleged to have handed over money to prominent members of the local Socialist and Christian Democrat parties as well as the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The Socialists and the Christian Democrats have set up special commissions to examine the affairs of Milan. Milan has long been run by a Socialist controlled administration and has been the power-base of Mr Craxi - his son, Bobo, is the local secretary. This city, the symbol and centre of modern Italy's wealth, has long prided itself on its efficient 'clean government'. The damage to Mr Craxi's reputation, the involvement of the 'uncorruptable' PDS and the undermining of the Milanese sense of propriety have given an added edge to the affair. Mr Craxi's once-fancied chances of heading the next government have been dealt a serious blow and the formation of a new government is expected to be further complicated by the divisions within, and among, the parties exacerbated by the effects of the scandal. In the case of the socialists, there are calls by anti-Craxi figures for a special congress to discuss thorough reform of the party. The Christian Democrats are split over what action to take, afraid that being too tough over Milan would oblige a further cleansing of the party apparatus elsewhere in Italy. The PDS leadership is distancing itself from its members under investigation in Milan. The revelations also coincide with Italy's economic recession and growing public demands for sweeping reforms of the political system. On the one hand, hard pressed businesses have begun to discover they can no longer pay 10-15 per cent 'commissions' on contracts. On the other, the Lombard League has put morality onto the agenda. Systematic rigging of public works contracts, political pay-offs and illegal funding of the parties are national phenomena in Italy. They are products of a political system which has encouraged a vast army of people - at least 1m according to rough estimates - to live off inflated party bureaucracies which need in turn ever more funds to survive. The Lombard League is calling for a complete revision of, and total transparency in, party funding. Five more prominent Milan businessmen and politicians have been arrested in connection with the scandal, writes Robert Graham. They are Mr Sergio Radaelli, a Socialist board member of SAE, which runs Milan's airports' and an associate of Mr Paolo Pillittieri; Mr Maurizio Prada, head of the municipal transport company and a Christian Democrat national executive member; Mr Gianstefano Frigerio, CD regional secretary; Mr Augusto Rezzonico, a former CD senator; and Mr Enzo Papi, managing director of Cogefar Impresit, a leading construction company. All but Mr Radaelli were detained after being charged with corruption.</p>

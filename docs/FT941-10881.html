			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Stock markets slide but fears of steeper fall are unfounded: European exchanges stem declines - Far eastern bourses hardest hit International stock markets stumbled yesterday as the aftershock of Friday's rise in short-term US interest rates reverberated around the world. In London, the FT-SE 100 fell by 93.4 points to 3,382.0 by midday before eventually closing down 56.3 points at 3,419.1, a drop of 1.6 per cent on the day. The broader FT-SE 350 index fell 28.8 points to 1,731.7. Asian stock markets were the worst hit, with Hong Kong dropping 6.1 per cent and Thailand falling 6.9 per cent. But fears of a substantial setback proved unfounded, with European equity markets rallying in the afternoon after a calm opening on Wall Street. The mood in the markets indicated that yesterday's falls were a one-off correction. Attention will now focus in the short term on far eastern markets, with the Hong Kong market falling a further 3 per cent in indicative trading in London yesterday. The markets were clearly jittery but traders said there was little sign of panic. Much of the fall represented a catch-up with the 96 point decline in the Dow Jones Average on Friday, a large part of which occurred after European markets had closed. The timing of the Federal Reserve's move was a surprise, but a rise in US interest rates had been expected and does not necessarily presage a similar rise in Europe. Analysts said there was still scope for European rates to fall, given low inflation and the relatively depressed European economies. In Frankfurt, the Dax fell 58.85 points, or 2.75 per cent, to 2,079.4. In Paris, the CAC Index dropped 42.11 points, or 1.81 per cent, to 2,287.06. However, analysts pointed to a number of issues which could yet disturb the markets: the Federal Reserve might increase rates farther and faster than anticipated; US private investors might redeem some of their substantial holdings in mutual funds, causing managers to sell equities; or the Bundesbank might decide not to cut German interest rates, in order to stop the D-Mark from weakening against the US dollar. Mr Michael Hughes, managing director, BZW Global Economics and Strategy, said that the latest changes marked an end to the 'emerging markets bubble'. He said that markets such as Hong Kong, which had been buoyed by speculative flows from US investors, might suffer particularly. US financial markets were restored to relative calm yesterday after Friday's big losses. Although share prices fluctuated erratically after the opening bell, by noon the stock market had settled down with dealers reporting plenty of buying and selling activity but no clear direction. Later, a series of computerised buy programs pushed stocks, especially those of big companies such as IBM and Walt Disney firmly higher. By 1pm the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.23 at 3,893.65. The US Treasury market was also relatively quiet yesterday morning, although continued selling of long-term government securities, some of it linked to this week's auction of Dollars 11bn in new bonds, pushed the benchmark 30-year issue down about half a point, to where it yielded 6.387 per cent. In Europe, government bonds traded lower, with gilts down around  3/4 of a point. In London, the US dollar traded slightly higher against the D-Mark at DM1.7630 and slightly weaker against the yen at Y108.7050. Analysts said the Fed interest rate move had been positive for the dollar but was insufficient to move the US currency any higher until the Bundesbank indicates the likely direction of German interest rates.

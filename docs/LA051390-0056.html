			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON HEALTH-CARE MATTERS  </P> <P> Re "Laguna AIDS Refuge Cited" (May 3): I would like to commend Ahimsa and the  staff for courageously providing care for persons with AIDS when other  facilities make excuses for not doing so.  </P> <P> Since Ahimsa opened its doors in November of 1988, I have personally visited  the facility and found the environment to be clean and most of all staffed by  incredibly caring individuals.  </P> <P> Have you ever visited a convalescent home or other skilled-care facility? The  smell of urine is often overwhelming; not so Ahimsa. The patients appeared well  cared for and in good spirits.  </P> <P> Providing quality care in this day and age is extremely expensive, and hiring  good help is very difficult. Ask any acute-care hospital where wards are being  closed because of the nursing shortage. Instead of attacking their efforts, it  would behoove us to roll up our sleeves and ask what can we do to help Ahimsa  provide quality care.  </P> <P> We are in the midst of a health-care crisis not just related to AIDS. The  medical needs of many residents are not being met; the Medi-Cal system is in  disarray; the thousand points of light in Orange County are being stretched to  their limits.  </P> <P> Let's not waste our time and energy bad-mouthing people like Sharon Lucas and  Ahimsa. Let's work together to solve these problems.  </P> <P> PEARL JEMISON-SMITH  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

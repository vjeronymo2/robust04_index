			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sami Abu al-'Iz] </F>   [Text] Egypt has a number of commissions and authorities  created to oversee the exportation of Egyptian goods. These  include two commissions headed by the prime minister, Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi: The High Commission for Export Promotion and the Supreme  Export Council. A third, headed by the economy minister, is the  Export Promotion Commission. There are also numerous others,  including the Central Council for Export Promotion, the  Commission for Export Support, Export Oversight Authority, and  the Export Development Bank. Dr. 'Atif Sidqi announced at a  recent meeting with the Federation of Industries and Chambers of  Commerce that he would soon create [another] high commission for  export promotion, to be headed by him.    How much longer will the government keep on forming  commissions that convene and meet to no other end than the  formation of still other commissions and organizations, thereby  restarting the cycle anew without the adoption of effective  measures? How much longer will government policies continue to  be mere slogans and more commissions that exist on paper only  and are removed from reality? Do we in fact have need for new  commissions to promote Egyptian exports? What are the obstacles  difficulties that prevent existing commissions from doing their  job? How can we free Egyptian products from the bottleneck and  ease their flow into foreign export markets in order to compete  with international products?    The strategy for economic relations with the outside world  determines the course such relations must take in the years to  come. As such, they are supremely important, have the most  profound impact on the development of the national economy, and  are inexorably tied to and have a correlation with domestic  economic policies and with regional and international  developments.    A report issued by Specialized National Councils pointed out  that the primary purpose of devising a strategy for economic  relations with the outside world is to cultivate contacts that  will lead us to define objectives for that strategy that would  serve the public interest at the various stages of the national  economy, ensuring that those objectives are in harmony with  domestic economic policy objectives and with the capabilities of  the national economy as well as with the world economic  developments, especially international trade, capital movements,  and the type and intensity of competition in world markets and  the regional and international combinations that govern them.  Once the objectives of the new strategy are defined, policies  must be devised for their realization.    A specialized report emphasized that, in the absence of a  clear international economic strategy, the various economic  policies being pursued will, in fact, result in a haphazard  strategy lacking a logical method for defining objectives and  policies establishsed to achieve them. Such a stragety will also  not take into account the coordination of these objectives with  other national economic goals as well as regional and world  developments. This is the basis upon which the policies that  will achieve those objectives will be selected.    The report discusses the current status of our economic  relations with the outside world and points out that the trade  balance of commodity exports and imports has been consistently  in deficit over the years. The trade deficit gap widened from  64.1 million pounds in 1952 to 162.4 million pounds in 1970 to  19,115.8 million in 1989/90, for a 300-percent growth. The trade  deficit is worsening because commodity imports are growing at a  faster rate than commodity exports; the ratio of exports to  imports having declined from about 70 percent in 1952 to about  23 percent in 1989/90. The ratio of the trade balance deficit to  GDP is also considerable.    Raw cotton is no longer in first place among commodity  exports. Whereas it accounted for 85 percent of total exports in  1952, now it is almost not exported and accounts for only 33  percent of aggregate exports in 1989/90. If we factor in Egypt's  imports that year of short-staple cotton, it becomes clear that  Egypt has become a net importer of cotton.    The report went on to point out that the character of the  balance of payments in previous years is but the end result of  the strategies pursued in those years, whether deliberate and  planned, as such, or simply the cumulative outcome of successive  decisions and choices made over time. But those developments  mandate a reevaluation of Egypt's strategy for its economic  relations with the outside world in order to keep it in tandem  with domestic and international developments and in order to  optimally serve the interests of the Egyptian economy.    The report urged that industrial and agricultural commodity  exports and tourist revenues be increased at higher and  accelerating rates--since these components inevitably carry the  major burden of accomplishing the desired balance of payments.  However, this in no way ignores or diminishes the importance of  other balance of payments revenues.    The report also advised that agencies with oversight over  commodity exports should be scrutinized again in order to  facilitate and abbreviate the procedures involved in dealing  with them. Stricter standards should be enforced in order to  improve the quality of exports to the level necessary for  efficient competition in overseas markets. Government and  quasi-government agencies concerned with foreign trade and its  development should undertake detailed marketing studies of  potential exports and of likely markets, and should publish  those studies and make them available to all who are involved  with exports in Egypt.    The tax structure and the various fees applied to exports  should also be reexamined. Export operations should be granted  ample and wide-scale exemptions. The pricing system for  agricultural exports should be abolished. Relations should be  bolstered with economic blocks in Europe, Asia, and the Western  Hemisphere. For our exports to those blocks, we should seek the  same preferred nation treatment granted other categories of  developing nations.    Will the commission soon to be formed under Dr. 'Atif Sidqi  keep those considerations in mind? Will it accomplish its  targeted objectives in order to enable Egyptian exports to  compete in world markets?  <H5>  Change of Policies </H5>   Egyptian exports, including petroleum, have a total value of  $4 billion. The value of petroleum exports is slightly more than  $2 billion. Exports other than oil are valued at less than $2  billion, according to economic experts who point out that this  ratio is minimal in comparison with many other countries. We are  supposed to bring the volume of exports up to a reasonable level  since our experts are currently at no more than 5 percent of  GDP. We must bring this ratio up to at least 15 or 20 percent.  This means that we must boost exports three-fold. This would  require a lot of things, such as improving and raising  performance levels in order to compete in world markets. We must  begin by identifying that group of goods in which Egypt could  have a comparative advantage and, consequently, with which Egypt  can face world competition. We should also produce products  suitable to the tastes of consumers abroad. The study of foreign  markets, their needs, patterns of consumption, and  specifications of popular goods is therefore of value for  promoting future exports. We must wade through the arena of  establishing export services companies whose preoccupation would  be to study markets and their needs and define specifications  for the products they want, thereby establishing a link between  Egyptian producers and foreign importers.    Experts likewise emphasize that we must change our mind-set,  from merely exporting surplus to establishing firms for the sole  purpose of exporting. We should also attempt to prepare  ourselves for world market developments, and the liberalization  of foreign trade, anticipated as a result of signing the Uruguay  Round agreement. This requires effort on the part of Egyptian  exporters in order to meet the challenge of penetrating world  markets and protecting domestic industry by improving quality  and features and offering products at reasonable prices.  <H5>  Pressures </H5>   Dr. Ahmad al-Ghandur, formerly dean of the faculty of  economics, points out that the Cabinet has instructed the  economics minister to form a general committee to study the  economic impact of the new GATT agreement and formulate future  economic policies in order to take advantage of the agreement  and avoid its negative impact. Such is a commendable action  taken by all countries. However, that committee's report should  avoid generalities and should draw a detailed future program. I  believe that this is no more than tactics, since we have  persistently taken a flawed approach to the export problem long  before the current cabinet. To promote exports is to restructure  the Egyptian economic structure. Resolving the problem of  exports in Egypt, in the sense of relying on exports as an  essential means requires changing the nature of the Egyptian  economic system by focusing its policies, procedures, and  administrative structure on reducing production costs, improving  product quality, linking the Egyptian economy to the outside  world with advanced information systems, and giving enlightened  institutions charge of the new national undertaking, because  this is a matter of "life and death."    In dealing with the export problem in this fashion, the  Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade has equal, if not less,  responsibility for exports than the Ministry of New Urban  Commnities. Building worker housing in new cities helps exports  more than anything imaginable that the Ministry of the Economy  can undertake at the present time. The Ministry of Industry  could likewise do more for exports than the Ministry of the  Economy by offering technical assistance to all industrial units  in Egypt. The same goes for other ministries.    Dr. Ahmad al-Ghandur, commenting on the story about creating  a new export commission in the next few days, said that the only  explanation for this is that the government is under pressure to  transform the Egyptian economy into an export economy in order  to break free of the current crushing crisis.    Another explanation he cited was that all previous export  promotion commissions and institutions have had very little  output and that the prime minister has come to believe that the  solution lies in changing the nature of the economic system in  its entirety. The creation of the new commission is therefore  dictated by political considerations. All we have to do is  quicken the pace of our basic thrust to transform the economy  into an export economy and simultaneously announce the failure  of steps based on the philosophy rooted in creating one  institution or making minor adjustments to another. People are  well-aware that the institutions created for that purpose have  failed to achieve their goals and that export promotion has been  relegated to the media "headlines." Focusing on the actual  performances of institutions such as the Export Oversight  Authority, the Export High Commission, and the Export  Development Bank, and others, we find great disparity between  nomenclature and function. Exporters view the performance of  Export Oversight as restraint of the export function that does  not go beyond good intentions. The Misr Export Development Bank  is no different in function or performance from any other  commercial bank.  <H5>  The Bottleneck </H5>   "We all must concur that we need to promote exports and that  that is a major development for us if we are to emerge from the  bottleneck and overcome our balance of payments and general  budget deficits," thus began Dr. Hasan Ghallab, dean of the  College of Commerce at 'Ayn Shams University. He explained that  there is no disputing the need for a commission that would work  to provide the elements needed for the promotion of exports; but  that the multiplicity of commissions without well-defined  responsibilities causes the emergence of conflicting procedures,  except perhaps if the creation of the proposed commission means  making its predecessors obsolete. The methodology of providing  procedures conducive to export promotion is a function of market  mechanisms and also a function of other societal factors and  variables. The strategy, for instance, is to avoid exporting  products that society needs, especially at prices lower than  those of comparable imports. In other words, there is no harm in  exporting a product that has a substitute of reasonable quality  that can be imported at lower cost. Naturally, both products  cannot be of identical quality if imports are lower in price.  Furthermore, there are certain products that distinguish the  Egyptian market, for example long-staple cotton. There is no  reason at this time why we should not import short-staple  cotton, since it is cheaper, while encouraging the export of  long-staple cotton, provided that Egypt has mechanical systems  capable of the optimum utilization of imported products. We  should not lose sight of production for the sake of export  promotion. It should be noted that I would not permit the  exportation of certain commodities and encourage the importation  of alternatives if costs to importers were lower since that  would create idle capacity in society at a time when the state  is diligently seeking a solution to the unemployment problem.  The proposed commission must also simplify export formalities."    Dr. Ghallab concluded: "I hope that the issue of export  promotion will not come at the expense of what is necessary to  keep food in people's mouths. I also hope that export revenues  of foreign currency will be retained in the country and put to  work here; and that the magnificent national capitalism would  restore the glory Egypt once had in the era of Tal'at Harb,  'Abbud Pasha, and other ingenuous patriotic businessmen."  <H5>  Production and Marketing </H5>   If the issue of export promotion is an important matter for  the economies of all countries, then the success of that policy  would depend on two important factors--production and marketing,  and opening new markets, according to Dr. Faraj 'Abd-al-Fattah,  instructor in economics at Cairo University.    On production, he says that we must utilize the concept of  comparative advantage when producing all products by determining  that their requirements are particularly available plentiful and  that conditions are conducive to their production--farm  products, for instance. The concept of comparative  advantage-based production means producing at world standards  but with less cost than in other countries.  For marketing purposes, we must promote our output through the  coordinated efforts of sponsors as well as of diplomatic  missions (trade representatives) in various countries. This  would necessitate scrutinizing many aspects of marketing, such  as the positions of our competitors in those markets as well as  consumer tastes in those markets, their incomes, and the degree  to which they would accept substitute products.    It takes this two-pronged approach to develop and revive our  exports. A single approach is not sufficient to market a product  and export it. That product must first conform to international  standards and must be produced at low cost. But markets must  also exist.    The professor of economics added: "The uniform tax law  provides exporters with tax incentives in order that they may  boost their exports, but this is not sufficient in itself.  Exporters need the availability of extensive but reliable  information in order to accurately define their markets. Such an  information network should be a priority of the various  commissions concerned with export promotion."  <H5>  Export Surge </H5>   Dr. Rida al-'Adl, professor of economics at 'Ayn Shams  University's College of Commerce, has no objections to adding  new commissions to those already in existence or to  restructuring existing commissions or redefining their  functions, because this is all perfunctory and natural. The  issue of forming a new commission headed by Dr. 'Atif Sidqi may  explain the special importance currently attached to exports  which have become a question of life or death for us. If we  could sustain current markets as we penetrate new ones, we could  first utilize idle capacity and develop new production lines to  create new jobs for workers, raise incomes, and improve  development in general. This applies to all sectors whose  products or services may be in demand abroad. Exports today are  the checkpoints on the road to economic prosperity, and a new  high commission must be created for them. Egypt has great  economic potential, but actual exports are low. We must  diligently work for a substantial surge in Egyptian exports.  <H5>  Duplication </H5>   Economist Dr. Sharif Lutfi believes that some of the  agencies  that oversee exports, such as the Export Development Bank, have  distinct functions that they are indeed performing. Commissions  concerned with policymaking, on the other hand, include some  that were created but have never functioned and therefore do not  get to practice their specialties.    He said: "I am less concerned with commissions than I am  with  the policies pursued, because it is those policies that will  determine our success or failure in export promotion. Such  policies include aspects dealing with taxation, with shipping  exports and raising them to the standard needed for exportation,  and with government or private efforts to expand export markets.    "In any case, it is necessary that exporters participate in  devising and categorizing such policies so they will not  exclusively reflect government outlook that may be removed from  commercial reality.    "It is also of value to select a number of nontraditional  exports and focus on propelling them in such a manner that the  push is concentrated on a limited and specific number of  nontraditional exports. When we have succeeded in doing this,  then we can move on to another group of nontraditional exports  in order to expand their markets.    "Pound exchange rate policies must also be taken into  consideration because of their great impact on export  profitability."</p>

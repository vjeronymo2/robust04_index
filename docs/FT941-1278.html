The New York-based institution, one of the most profitable commercial banks in the US, made after-tax earnings of Dollars 1.73bn, up from Dollars 1.13bn the year before. The British-born Mr Weatherstone, who has headed the bank since 1990, was paid a base salary of Dollars 700,000, with the rest of his income linked to performance. Among other high-paid bank chairmen, Mr John Reed of Citicorp received Dollars 6.2m, while Mr Dan Tully, chairman of Merrill Lynch, received Dollars 9.6m, a rise of 30 per cent.</p>

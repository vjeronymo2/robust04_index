			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE CULTURE AND POLITICS OF LITERACY BY W. ROSS WINTEROWD  (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 226 PP.)  </P> <P> Numerous writers in recent years have deplored the high rate of illiteracy in  the United States and advocated political action to combat the problem. W. Ross  Winterowd approaches the problem from another perspective. What is literacy, he  asks. Is it the ability to read an employment application? The morning paper?  The answer he proposes is that literacy is culturally determined. A practical  approach to increasing literacy, he argues, begins with an examination of what  is needed in this society at this time, how literacy is acquired and what it  means.  </P> <P> He begins with a historical overview, pointing out that literacy has always  been an important political tool. He shows how various types of illiteracy are  linked to certain mental abilities; introducing literacy necessarily changes  not only a person's social position, but also his way of thinking of  traditional life. Using examples from his own teaching, Winterowd illustrates  how the individual learns to read, both at the elementary level -- learning to  recognize words -- and at the level of "cultural literacy" -- learning the  associations that distinguish the simply literate person from the educated  person. He also discusses the common neurological problems that interfere with  the process of learning to read.  </P> <P> Although "The Culture and Politics of Literacy" proposes no easy solutions, it  does provide a thoughtful and clear look at a complex part of human life. It is  that rare book that offers something of use to everyone it purports to address:  parents of school children, teachers, politicians.  </P></p>

"Pyongyang seems to have decided to accept nuclear  inspections because it wanted to deal with economic problems  such as food shortages and to keep relations with the  international community from deteriorating further. The  Japanese Government regards Pyongyang's decision as a change in  attitude toward the international community, and so decided to  work to restart negotiations with Pyongyang on normalizing  ties," NHK said.    Negotiations between Japan and North Korea broke off at the  eighth round of talks in Beijing in November 1992, when Tokyo  demanded an investigation into the alleged abduction of a  Japanese woman named "Yi Un-hui."    North Korean terrorist Kim Hyon-hui, who planted a bomb on a  South Korean airplane that exploded over the Andaman Sea off  Myanmar in November 1987, confessed that she had learned  Japanese from a Japanese woman who had been abducted from Japan  to Pyongyang by North Korean agents.    Pyongyang refused the investigation demand and no meetings  between Tokyo and Pyongyang have been held since.</p>

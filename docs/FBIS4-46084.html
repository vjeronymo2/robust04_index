			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 26 (AFP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Wednesday that no plutonium was  missing from a Japanese factory processing nuclear fuel.    Some 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of plutonium, enough to make  nine nuclear bombs, had in fact accumulated as "hold-up" in dust  form on exposed surfaces of processing areas, the IAEA said in a  statement.    "The IAEA has been well aware of the presence of this  material throughout, which has been fully declared as hold-up by  the operator and is measured by the IAEA on a monthly basis,  using a specially-designed system," the statement said.    In other respects, the Tokai-mura plant northeast of Tokyo  was a highly-automated facility with the most advanced nuclear  material accountancy system in existence, providing information  to the IAEA on the movement and quantities of such material on a  near real-time basis, the nuclear watchdog said.    The plant operators had decided to leave the deposited  hold-up where it was since the plant opened in October 1988 to  minimise radiation exposure to personnel, the IAEA said.    However with a view to improving the quality of the  measurements the IAEA had urged the necessity of collecting the  hold-up material and a schedule for this was currently being  worked out with the Japanese authorities, the statement added.    The Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute, a  non-governmental organisation, said on May 9 that the plant  should be closed until the problem is solved.    NCI president Paul Leventhal said there was no proof that  Japan was diverting plutonium for a weapons program. But he  asked the IAEA to closely monitor the Japanese facility.    A plant spokesman rebutted the demand for the shutdown on  May  11, saying, "There is nothing unclear about what are strictly  residuals in the production process. We have made efforts to  reduce them and we will."    Leventhal said the NCI had sent a letter to U.S. Secretary  of  State Warren Christopher urging him to take the matter up with  Japan as most of the plutonium being used at the plant came from  the United States.    According to press reports, the IAEA was concerned because  the instrument monitoring the amount of plutonium in the  production process had a margin of error between 10 and 15  percent.    It means that for every 70 kilograms of plutonium counted,  some eight kilograms, enough for a nuclear bomb, could have  escaped detection.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Budget debate rules attacked A cross-party committee of MPs yesterday accused the government of stifling debate on the first unified Budget, delivered last week by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. In a sharply critical report, the procedure committee says the government has rejected proposals for radical changes in the parliamentary arrangements for the Budget. The committee, chaired by Sir Peter Emery, Conservative MP for Honiton, says that the government has 'failed in the objective it set itself of enabling 'a more informed and focused debate'.' The report shows that the government rejected a series of proposals by the committee. They included: Splitting the finance bill to allow detailed tax changes to be presented in a separate taxes management bill. Setting up a standing committee of MPs to consider the details of technical changes in taxation regulations. Delaying the start of the Budget debate for two days to allow MPs to digest the contents of the chancellor's speech. Allowing minority parties and individual MPs to table amendments to the chancellor's spending and taxation plans, in addition to the traditional opposition amendment. In its response to the committee the government said that its proposals amounted to 'a radical change' in procedures which would create 'confusion'. The committee, which has a Conservative majority, says an amendment to the ruleswould allow MPs to express an opinion on the Budget strategy without affecting the passage of the finance bill. The committee says: 'The range of economic policy options available at any one time must justify a vote on more than just one amendment. To refuse this is stifling the expression of views of the minority parties or of the strength of feeling of a minority within the government party.'</p>

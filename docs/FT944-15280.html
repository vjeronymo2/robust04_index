			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Personal View: US healthcare - the issue that won't die When Senator George Mitchell announced last month that he was ending his drive to pass a healthcare reform bill through Congress, he invited the US electorate to ask 'Who killed healthcare?' He hoped that voters in next month's mid-term elections would punish the assassins, including Republicans and other congressmen who have acted on behalf of the health industry interest groups operating on Capitol Hill. However, the senator should look at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue for an answer to his question. The two people most responsible for the failure of the bill are President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary. As a presidential candidate, Clinton rode a tide of voter frustration with the US healthcare system, winning widespread support for fundamental change. Once in the White House, however, he had to make two fundamental choices on the route to reform. First, should the priority be a swift dash to universal health coverage or measures to control costs? Second, should he put forward a detailed blueprint of his own or set out some basic principles and challenge Congress to fill in the details? In drawing up legislative plans for universal coverage, the Clintons chose the first option in both cases. The complexity of the resulting proposals scuppered prospects for radical reform in 1994 by raising the opposition of too many interest groups. Yet, despite this setback, healthcare reform will return to the political agenda with the new Congress next year. Healthcare is too important an issue to disappear. Employee health insurance costs remain a problem for business. Some of the largest employers have made progress in reducing their medical expenses, but they are far from satisfied. Many smaller companies have yet to see substantial benefits from attempts to drive down healthcare costs. Local, state and federal governments must also give priority to bringing medical costs under control. They are responsible for more than 40 per cent of US health expenditure through Medicaid and Medicare, two publicly funded schemes, and their own employees' health benefits. Cost containment means giving further incentives to business to insure employees through health maintenance organisations that have proved successful in holding down costs. The health insurance market will attempt to reduce administration costs through further mergers and alliances. Medical litigation should also come under deep scrutiny from legislators. There are few congressmen who do not accept that too great a burden is put on doctors by lawsuits. While the legalistic culture of the US is likely to make reform difficult, it needs to be tackled. Savings in treatment costs would help keep the cost of health insurance down and allow more employers to offer coverage to staff and reduce the number who opt out of their employer's medical scheme on grounds of cost. This incremental approach will, however, be insufficient for the liberal wing of Congress, which hankers after much wider coverage. The failure of the Clinton plan has probably taken universal coverage off the national agenda for the next few years (although some states may attempt to pursue it). An alternative may be to extend Medicaid benefits to selected groups, such as pregnant women and children. Many of these proposals have already been tabled in the present Congress by the bipartisan 'Mainstream Group' in the Senate and in the Cooper/Grandy proposal, which achieved cross-party support in the House of Representatives. Had these groups been given a free hand and two years to work on them, healthcare reform legislation might already have been signed. They could not deliver largely because the healthcare debate had to wait nine months while the Clinton administration produced its 1,300-page draft plan. The plan proved so complex and divisive that another nine months elapsed before serious negotiations on a politically practical draft could begin. In the next Congress, representatives of both parties should be able to pursue such an agenda without the heavy hand of the White House. The irony is that the White House has won on healthcare. It is now too big an issue to go away and the new Congress will have to take it on next year. Reforms based on incentives to contain the cost of treatment and limited steps to increase coverage may disappoint those who supported the Clintons' more ambitious healthcare plans. But they could be the chief achievement of the president's first term - even if he will get little credit for them in the 1996 presidential contest.

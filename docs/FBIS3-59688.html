			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Next fiscal year the Energy Agency will begin  "technical confirmation tests of systems for recycling the waste  resulting from the dismantling of nuclear reactors used for  generating electrical power," the objective of which is to  accelerate the development of technology to accompany measures  for shutting down nuclear power plants. The Energy Agency is now  moving ahead with "technical confirmation tests of equipment for  shutting down reactors," to expand the development of  dismantling technology, and "surveys of reactor shutdown  technology," to investigate waste disposal measures and the  legal system. In the steps that will be taken next time, reactor  shutdown measures will be carried out in three steps.    The basic policy in shutting down nuclear power plant  facilities is to seal off the facilities for a fixed period of  time, then to dismantle and remove them. The concrete scheduling  of such steps will be after the year 2000 because nuclear power  plants are normally in use for 30 to 40 years.    From now on the important thing is to work toward harmony  with local societies based on a premise of guaranteed safety.  Then, while promoting further technological sophistication,  there must be systems of safety regulations and measures for the  disposal of the resulting waste, as well as studies from a  social perspective that take into consideration the local people.    The Energy Agency is now concerned about the Tokai nuclear  power plant (166,000 kW; in operation since 1966), which is  expected to be shut down in the near future. At the same time,  the agency is heading toward providing governmental guidance so  that the government and private sector will cooperate in studies  for the purpose of formulating concrete procedures for shutting  down reactors. While the agency will continue to implement  conventional confirmation tests and technical surveys on reactor  shutdown measures, it will also begin the development of  technology for recycling the waste resulting from dismantling a  reactor.</p>

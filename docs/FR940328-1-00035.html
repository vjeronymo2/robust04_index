The determination shall include findings that the contractor sought private financing of the facilities but it was not available or that private financing is determined not advantageous to the Government. If the contractor's inability to provide facilities is due to insufficient lead time, the Government may furnish existing facilities until the contractor's facilities can be installed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The original determination and the contractor's written statement asserting inability to obtain nongovernment facilities, if applicable, shall be included in the contract file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Government facilities with a unit cost of less than $10,000 shall not be provided to contractors under the exception in subparagraph (a)(7) unless the contractor is a nonprofit institution of higher education or other nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Even when one of the exceptions in subparagraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section applies, agencies shall not_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide new facilities to contractors unless existing Government-owned facilities are either inadequate or cannot be economically furnished; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Use research and development funds to provide contractors with new construction or improvements of general utility, unless authorized by law; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Provide facilities to contractors solely for nongovernment use, unless authorized by law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The applicability of the exceptions in subparagraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section shall be documented in the contract file by a Determination and Findings signed by the contracting officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Government facilities provided to contractors shall be individually identified in the solicitation and the contract. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6897 Filed 3&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;34&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The military situation in the city of Kuito remains  unaltered. Clashes are under way and the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces are being reinforced  with contingents from Huambo and Cuando Cubango Provinces. Many  people are still dying in the Bie capital. The atmosphere of  war in Kuito is characterized by gunpowder, blood and hunger,  and the main victims are civilians whom the UNITA rebels have  decided to strike with their Machiavellian actions with the aim  of taking over the city at all costs.</p>

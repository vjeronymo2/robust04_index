			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Viktoria Mstislavsakaya </F> for TASS]    [Text] Odessa 13 April, TASS -- A total of 39 officers and  warrant officers of the 318th Division of the Black Sea Fleet  swore allegiance to Ukraine. Now, they will serve in a newly  formed division of naval border guard ships belonging to the  Ukrainian Navy.    Apart from the newcomers, the new division of the Ukrainian  Navy includes the entire 46th Hydro-Region, consisting of two  hydrographers, eight boats, a radio-technical unit and auxiliary  services. This is presumed to be the result of a recent  incident involving the "Cheleken" hydrographer, which was barred  from leaving the sea port of Odessa.    Commander of the Western Naval Region of the Ukrainian Navy,  Captain First rank Dmitriy Ukrainets, told a correspondent of  the UKRINFORM news agency that the main cause of the incident in  Odessa was an attempt to rob the ship. "The problem of the  division of the fleet, its property and equipment has not been  finally resolved yet, and some `anxious servicemen' are trying  to grab as much as possible" Ukrainets said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Chun-pom: "The Security Affairs-Related </F> Ministries Are Not Working Cooperatively"]    [Text] Some question whether there is a loophole in the  government's system to deal with a crisis because the national  security affairs-related ministries, such as the National  Unification, Foreign, and National Defense Ministries, are not  working cooperatively on the North Korean nuclear issue.    Noteworthy examples are the talks between ROK Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry,  the issue regarding the deployment of Patriot missiles to the  Korean peninsula, and the timing of the announcement on the  suspension of Team Spirit exercise.    The government on 8 February held a security affairs-related  ministers meeting chaired by President Kim Yong-sam and  discussed ways to relieve "the rumors on the crisis on the  Korean peninsula" and the government's follow-up measures in  case North Korea's nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security  Council.    The meeting was this year's first security affairs-related  ministers meeting to be presided over by President Kim and was  attended by Premier Yi Hoe-chang, Unification Minister Yi  Yong-duk, the ministers of foreign affairs and national defense,  the director of the Agency for National Security Planning, and  the senior secretary of Chongwadae [presidential office].    Following the meeting, Foreign Minister Han on 9 February  hurriedly departed for the United States seven days earlier than  planned. On 11 February, he met U.S. Defense Secretary Perry in  Washington and, during the meeting, made clear that a crisis is  not looming on the Korean peninsula, as the U.S. media has been  reporting.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, however, did not knew about  the Han-Perry meeting in advance. The Ministry of National  Defense [MDN], after learning about the meeting via foreign  reports, expressed its regret over the Foreign Ministry's  failure to inform the MDN of the meeting.    A high-level MDN official conceded: "Although Foreign  Minister Han sat right beside Minister Yi during the security  affairs-related ministers meeting held at Chongwadae, he did not  utter a word about his plan to meet Perry. This shows that  there is a large loophole in the cooperative system among  ministries."    Even though the MDN can get access to information on the  Han-Perry contacts through various channels as a Foreign  Ministry official is stationed at the MDN and a military attache  resides at the ROK Embassy in the United States, the MDN has not  acquired any information on the contacts.    Regarding the deployment of the Patriot missiles, even  though  the U.S. assistant to President Clinton for National Security  Affairs had conferred over the phone with Chong Chong-ku, senior  secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs, the Defense  Ministry became aware of the fact when the Foreign Ministry  later officially announced that "the deployment of the Patriot  missiles to the Korean peninsula is now under review."    The MDN expressed concern about the team work of the  security  affairs-related ministries by saying that: "There has never been  a case in which an important military issue has been pushed  ahead without prior consultations with the MDN."    On 16 February, even after North Korea's acceptance of  inspections on its nuclear facilities was announced, a  difference of opinion among the ministries was clearly revealed.    The MDN, which restrained from commenting officially on the  issue regarding the Team Spirit exercise, unofficially expressed  a prudent stance on the afternoon of 16 February by saying that:  "The announcement on calling off the Team Spirit exercise will  be made around 10 March at the earliest and, furthermore, the  time is not right to announce the issue officially."    On the next day, however, a National Unification Board  official announced: "With North Korea's acceptance of  International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, the suspension  of the Team Spirit exercise will be announced next week."    Even when the National Unification Board made such an  announcement, the MDN adhered to its position that was revealed  the day before and did not reveal if the National Unification  Board's announcement had been discussed among the relevant  ministries.    Some military experts, commenting on such differences in  opinion among the ministries, point out that the fundamental  problem lies in the fact that the national security affairs  ministries have been slightly neglected since the new government  took office.</p>

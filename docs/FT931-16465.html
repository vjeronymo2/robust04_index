			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: German banks ruling criticised GERMANY'S public sector banks are getting 'free' capital worth DM10bn, (Dollars 6.2bn) giving them significant competitive advantages over private sector institutions, the Bundesverband deutscher Banken, the association of private sector German banks, complained yesterday. The complaint follows the German banking authorities' decision to allow Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) and other public sector banks to consolidate their housing finance subsidiaries. This decision should be investigated by the European Commission, the association urged. The Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das Kreditwesen - the supervisory body for the banking sector - ruled last week that public sector banks should be able to treat the capital locked up in housing finance subsidiaries as core equity capital under tough new European Community-wide capital adequacy rules which took effect at the beginning of the year. Private sector banks have had to hold expensive rights issues to meet the rules and are bitter at what they see as the unfair advantage given to public sector competitors. The association singled out WestLB, the acquisitive Dusselfdorf-based public sector bank, for special criticism as its capital would be bolstered by DM4bn as a result of the ruling. The ruling allows WestLB, the strongest public sector bank in Germany, to consolidate the assets acquired on the acquisition of WFA, the housing finance subsidiary for the state of North-Rhine Westphalia acquired in 1991. WestLB is controversial in Germany as a result of its aggressive approach to industrial investments and its determination to take the lead in the restructuring of the public banking sector. Critics fear that access to the new capital will allow chief executive Mr Friedel Neuber to pursue a more aggressive policy. On Monday, WestLB said it had increased its stake in the Thomas Cook travel business to 86 per cent from 10 per cent, in spite of investigations by the Berlin cartel office into its mounting influence over the German travel industry. WestLB said that its holding in the former Midland Bank subsidiary would be combined with other travel interests in a new wholly-owned subsidiary, TCT Touristik Beteiligungs.</p>

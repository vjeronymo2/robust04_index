			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 Apr -- Russia's position regarding  partnership with NATO has not changed, but the agreement to this  effect should have real substance. A serious partnership  requires closer political coordination, Andrey Kozyrev said to  journalists today.    The relations of true partnership should rule out situations  where important measures are being taken without consulting  Russia in areas where close cooperation is needed -- as in, for  example, looking for a solution to the Bosnia crisis, Kozyrev  said. Moscow is interested in a serious agreement, stressed  Kozyrev.    He also noted that all the sides involved will perhaps need  some time to reflect on what it is that they want exactly.  Russia intends to propose its own, really substantial draft  agreement to NATO. We want a true, serious partnership, said  the Russian foreign minister.</p>

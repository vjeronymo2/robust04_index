			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Tokyo 'dearest airport' Tokyo's Narita airport has become the world's most expensive, while London's Heathrow and Gatwick remain among the cheapest. Heathrow, the world's biggest international passenger airport, continued to slip in the annual index of charges at the world's top 40 airports, published by the UK Travers Morgan consultancy group. It fell to 31st position from 24th last year and 18th in 1990, when the first review was done. Airports are ranked according to landing, parking, passenger and terminal navigation charges. The 1994 review takes into account changes in the world airline fleet: an increasing number of noisy airliners such as DC-10s and 737-200s have been replaced by quieter jets. This trend will intensify during the next 10 years as airlines seek to avoid paying surcharges for noise. Noise charges at Berlin's Tagel airport had placed it at the top of the index last year. It has now slipped to fifth. London's Gatwick airport dropped to 34 from 30 last year. The competitive charges at the two London airports, operated by the privatised BAA group, reflect the UK Civil Aviation Authority's pricing formula for them. Dublin dropped four places from 15 to 19, reflecting in part a discount on charges for flights into the UK. Charges at Heathrow's main European rival airports are higher. Frankfurt has become Europe's most expensive airport and lies fourth in the index. Amsterdam is ninth and Paris Charles de Gaulle 11th. 'Overall, we are seeing a trend of airports introducing new charges, with the exception of BAA, rather than increasing existing charges,' said Mr Peter Mackenzie-Williams, Travers Morgan principal aviation consultant. *Review of Airport Charges 1994, Pounds 335 from 2 Killick Street, King's Cross, London N1 9JJ  --------------------------------------------------------------- Airports: where the price is highest  --------------------------------------------------------------- Airport charges index Rank       Airport             Special drawing        Index                                        rights*  ---------------------------------------------------------------  1         Tokyo                        39,333          100  2         New York JFK                 24,199           62  3         New Jersey Newark            23,952           61  4         Frankfurt                    23,432           60  5         Berlin                       23,090           59 31         London Heathrow              10,585           27 34         London Gatwick                8,896           23  --------------------------------------------------------------- * Unit of currency used by International Monetary Fund Source: Travers Morgan  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

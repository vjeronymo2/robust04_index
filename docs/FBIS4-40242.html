			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 14, BNS -- Talks continue in Moscow  today between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin  and a deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Raul  Malk, a spokesman at the Foreign Ministry in Tallinn said.    Churkin and Malk held their first talks in Tallinn June 7  and  8 without any tangible result toward resolving the tangled state  in relations between the two countries. But both parties at the  Tallinn talks said they will continue active contacts.    Churkin told reporters before leaving Tallinn that "with  good  will, there is nothing unrealistic" about the Aug. 31, 1994,  troop withdrawal deadline. In his words, there has to be a firm  basis in terms of agreements to proceed energetically with what  is necessary to complete the withdrawal.    The Russian diplomat said a "realistic agreement that is up  to the very high international standards of human rights" is  needed to remove the tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. He  voiced hope that such an agreement will be concluded.    Both Churkin and his Estonian partner in talks were  short-spoken when commenting on actual progress in hammering out  such agreements.    "(There is) nothing concrete to announce at this stage,"  Malk  said. "Over the course of two days we have had good talks. ...  We have just agreed that we will continue as soon as possible."    Churkin, too, noted that talks with Malk were at a stage  when  it was premature to get more specific. In his words, an  agreement was reached that the talks would soon continue and  that Malk may go to Moscow already next week.    "It seems to me that (we talked) with a sincere attempt on  both sides to solve as quickly as possible those questions which  still remain, in order that we can turn the page, perhaps even  finish an entire chapter in the history of our relations,"  Churkin told reporters June 8.</p>

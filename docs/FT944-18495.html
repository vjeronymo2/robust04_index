			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UN and Nato still split over use of air power against Bosnian Serbs The United Nations and Nato have failed to bridge their differences over the use of air power against Bosnian Serbs, agencies report from Split. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, discussed the issue for nearly three hours with Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special representative. Afterwards, Mr Akashi indicated that the two sides had agreed on the need for a speedier response to provocations, but he could not unconditionally agree with Nato's call for strikes to be made without warning. In Sarajevo, the UN announced that seven convoys carrying supplies for its peacekeeping forces were being allowed to proceed by the Bosnian Serbs, despite a day's delay in implementing an agreement.</p>

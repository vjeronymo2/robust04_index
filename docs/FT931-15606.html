			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Observer: Prime object John Birt, the new director-general of the BBC, was remarkably frank yesterday when he spelt out details of his reorganisation plans at the Corporation. A Programme Strategy Review across all the directorates of the BBC would get under way immediately. 'The review will be this year's major task; it should be creatively stimulating and highly enjoyable. Exactly what we all joined the BBC to do,' he said. Hope the programmes will be enjoyable too.</p>

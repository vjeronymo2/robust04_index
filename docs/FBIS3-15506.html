Sparking the dispute was a report which originated in Japan  that after 24 years of negotiations, Russia and Mainland China  have agreed that the big Ussuri Island belongs to China.    The large island is only a few hundred meters off the coast  of the Russian city Khabarovsk, and if it is turned over to the  PRC, the two nations would only be separated by a small strip of  water.    The report has raised the ire of local residents, who  reportedly are willing to fight to remain under Russian rule.    "If the big Ussuri Island is transferred to the jurisdiction  of the People's Republic of China, the whole city will take up  pitchforks and go out and fight, and I shall be in the  frontline," Mr. Viktor Ishayev, the head of the Khabarovsk  regional administration, was quoted as saying by SEGODNYA, the  Moscow daily.    However, reports about the transfer have been denied by  Russian officials.    Yuriy Arkharov, deputy head of the joint Russian-Chinese  Commission on Border Demarcation, resolutely refuted the  allegations of a secret "sell-out." Other officials have also  denied any of the reported 2,000 island were turned over to the  Chinese Communists.    Cross-border traffic and disputes have increased since  recent  relaxations in border controls, SEGODNYA reported. The  relaxation of controls has cleared the way for "barbaric fishing  practices by Chinese fishermen," and increased Chinese ship  traffic, has "exacerbated the poor ecological conditions in the  city," the daily said.    Regardless of the growing discontent, the official Russian  stance is that since no mutually acceptable decision is in view,  both sides will put the issue aside for the time being and  continue to uphold the status quo.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Foreigners given electoral drubbing: With the Soviet empire out of the way, candidates are picking on other targets BY tradition, the US secretary of defence is supposed to stay out of election year politics, presumably to mind the nation's security while the president is out winning votes at factory gates, in farmyards and, increasingly these days, in the television studios. Mr Dick Cheney, the Pentagon incumbent, has not broken with tradition; and only a cynic would suggest this detached role might suit him if the Republican ship went down as he might then stand a better chance of becoming its captain in 1996. He did give a speech a few weeks ago in which he lamented the fact that foreign policy was not getting much of an airing in the campaign, but Mr Cheney must be truly disengaged if he believes this to be so. To most people it is obvious that now there is no Soviet empire to kick around, the dread generic foreigner is the villain in the presidential drama. President George Bush set out by proclaiming himself the 'foreign policy president,' which certainly sounded more plausible than his claims to be the 'environment president' and the 'education president'. He had won a war, two if you count Panama, while the country was not conspicuously greener or more learned. But this was pretty much an open invitation for Governor Bill Clinton to complain, as did every other Democratic primary contender, that Mr Bush cared far more about foreigners than he did about Americans. This grew worse after Los Angeles erupted in flames and while Mr Bush was spending his time trying to persuade Congress to send money to Russia rather than to Watts. When Mr James Baker was moved from the State Department to the White House, a subtle shift was discernible. Mr Clinton now charged that Mr Bush cared far more about his re-election than he did about foreigners, which was all wrong as anybody could see the world was going to hell in a hand basket. But, of course, so was America. This had earlier prompted Mr Clinton to proclaim that foreigners, in the shape of international corporations, simply were not paying their full tax whack. If they did - and he had a plan to make them - all sorts of wonderful things could be done for Americans. Mr Bush also changed his tune. The flaw in Mr Clinton, he suddenly detected, was that he had fallen under evil foreign influences. There was his time at that cradle of European social engineering, Oxford University, which could hardly be seen as part of the great American tradition. After all, social engineers were only a step away from communist engineers and everybody could see what good they had done. Nor was the president above hinting darkly that Mr Clinton might even have been doing the commie bidding, by going to Moscow and by demonstrating against the Vietnam war. Mr Clinton even wanted to do business with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, the ultimate unacceptable foreign face, even though, naturally, Mr Bush had his own good policy reasons for doing precisely the same thing. But neither of the candidates come close to Mr Ross Perot. A believer in conspiracies and cover-ups, the independent from Texas sees a foreign hand behind everything that is wrong with America. He packaged it all in last Monday's televised presidential debate. The country, he declared, was being ruined by foreign lobbyists, many of whom were actually Americans working for the Bush and Clinton campaigns, and Mexicans would be 'sucking' away even more American jobs courtesy of the Nafta agreement. Indeed, in every trade pact he could think of the US government was 'breaking our business' legs' and had been consistently out-negotiated by the wily foreigner, who ought not to be allowed to land his cars at America's docks if the rules were not changed. It got worse. British Airways and KLM were conspiring to undermine that great American birthright, its airline industry. Pretty soon there would be no Boeing and McDonnell Douglas jets to fly around in any more, what with the subsidised Airbus and the Japanese plotting to get into the commercial aviation business. And then there was President Saddam, not to mention General Manuel Noriega. Curiously, all three also like some foreigners. Mr Bush is always talking to Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, mostly about how awful it was that the Canadian flag was flown upside down at the baseball World Series game in Atlanta and sometimes about how to win elections from behind. He used to talk to British Prime Minister John Major about that, too. He certainly thinks the Arabs and Taiwanese do not have enough weapons and is even willing to talk to the Vietnamese, although that might be because he is growing a little worried about China. Mr Clinton does not seem to like the Chinese much either, but he got on famously once with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, is surrounded by Rhodes scholars, and has invited foreign corporations by the hundreds to set up business in Arkansas. Even Mr Perot thinks Germans and Japanese are pretty good at 'bidness', although that might not be so if they paid more, as he thinks they should, to defend themselves. And nobody likes the Serbs.</p>

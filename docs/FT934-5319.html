			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: US broker takes super computing to Wall St The most powerful computer introduced to the financial markets was switched on yesterday by Merrill Lynch, the US's biggest broking firm. In a sign of the growing importance of computing power to Wall Street, Merrill has paid more than Dollars 1.75m for what is believed to be the first supercomputer to support trading in the financial markets. Supercomputers are high-performance machines capable of processing large amounts of data very rapidly. Mr John Galonte, a Merrill Lynch first vice-president, said the machine's ability to process information was intended to give the firm an edge in its trading activities. 'We want to improve the timeliness of some of our calculations,' he said. The machine, a Cray Research MP2E with two processors, is described by the maker as 'the middle to low end of our product range'. Supercomputers are used mainly for forecasting the weather or in other government or academic applications, though companies in the aerospace, motor manufacturing, chemicals and energy industries have begun to use them in recent years. The need for greater computing power follows the development of both derivatives and arbitrage trading, which rely on the analysis of large amounts of financial data.</p>

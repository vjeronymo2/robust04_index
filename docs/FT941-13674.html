			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Japanese share prices fall sharply Japanese share prices plunged yesterday amid fears of political turmoil following the defeat of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform bill. The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares fell 954.19 points or 4.9 per cent, the largest single-day drop since August 1991, as shaken investors and dealers, who had accumulated shares in anticipation of the vote's passage through parliament, rushed to unload their holdings. The unexpected rejection of the reform bill came after the Tokyo market closed on Friday, depressing Japanese stocks traded overseas. Early today stocks showed a firmer trend, with the Nikkei average about 150 points above its close yesterday of 18,353.24 after an hour's trading. Ms Manae Kubota, the Economic Planning Agency minister, said the recovery reflected expectations that the government would soon take steps to stimulate the economy. However, traders expect further turbulence on the Tokyo stock market this week due to the uncertainty surrounding Mr Hosokawa's efforts to formulate a compromise package of the reform bills by Saturday. 'There's no knowing how much the market could fall if Mr Hosokawa is forced to resign,' warned Mr Takashi Kanasaki, a director at Yamaichi Securities. But Mr Hosokawa yesterday put on a brave face, saying share prices would rise eventually, while Mr Jiro Saito, the vice-finance minister, said the fall in the stock market would not change the government's assessment of economic conditions. If pessimism among domestic investors persists, buying by European and US investors, who have so far supported Japanese stocks in favour of weak south-east Asian stock markets, may also peter out. On the foreign exchange market, worries over political confusion also prompted selling of the yen against the dollar yesterday; it closed down Y0.80 at Y112.10. The diminishing prospects of an imminent revival in the economy also fuelled hopes of an early cut in the official discount rate. Yields on the No 157 10-year benchmark bond declined 11.5 basis points to 3.205 per cent. World Stock Markets, Page 39</p>

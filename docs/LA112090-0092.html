			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARTNERS SAY BIG ACCOUNTING FIRM MAY FOLD;  </P> <P> SERVICES: LAVENTHOL &amp; HORWATH HAS BEEN HURT BY THE POOR ECONOMY AND  MALPRACTICE SUITS. SOME OF ITS OFFICES MAY BECOME INDEPENDENT; SOME MAY  AFFILIATE WITH OTHER FIRMS.  </P> <P> Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the nation's seventh-largest accounting firm, may be  dissolved or put into bankruptcy, with some of its offices operating as  independent partnerships or affiliating with other firms, partners said Monday.  </P> <P> The firm, whose legal and financial troubles have mounted in recent months,  declined to comment.  </P> <P> But its 350 or so partners met over the weekend in Houston to decide the  Philadelphia firm's fate. Options reportedly included dissolution, filing for  bankruptcy court protection from creditors and shrinking the firm to a few core  offices.  </P> <P> "My understanding is they're taking whatever actions are necessary to dissolve  the firm," said Richard Pimentel, partner in charge of the San Francisco  office, who attended the Houston meeting. No date for the dissolution was  given, but a clear message was sent "to go about our lives," he said.  </P> <P> Other partners and former partners reached Monday echoed Pimentel. Orange  County Managing Partner Richard Carpe said he expects the company to file a  Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition by month's end. He doesn't expect it to survive  as a national firm.  </P> <P> "Hmm. I have no information on that," spokesman Thomas Derr said when asked if  the firm is shutting down.  </P> <P> The company released a brief statement by Chief Executive Robert N. Levine,  saying that partners had discussed "a number of scenarios regarding both the  short-term and long-term future of Laventhol &amp; Horwath."  </P> <P> "At this time, we cannot comment on any of the business plans discussed at the  meeting," the statement said. "The partners and staff remain dedicated to  providing the highest quality of professional service to their clients."  </P> <P> In an angry statement issued last week, the company acknowledged that "of  course, L&amp;H has problems. Every single accounting firm in the nation has  severe problems -- many caused by the 'sue the accountants; they have deep  pockets' mentality so prevalent today. The soft economy has also hurt the  profession, L&amp;H and hundreds of other companies worldwide."  </P> <P> Laventhol &amp; Horwath, with 50 offices and 3,400 employees, has been hit hard  by litigation. The suits, including a multimillion-dollar one arising from the  company's audit of imprisoned evangelist Jim Bakker's PTL ministry, have  alleged poor accounting and consulting work.  </P> <P> The company has been laying off employees. In October, it cut wages for those  that remained by 10% -- a reduction that it said would last only three months.  </P> <P> In was unclear Monday if pension plans for employees are secure. Some partners  said basic pensions are fully insured but that an added amount for partners  will be lost. One former partner said pensions were being funded by current and  future earnings.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the Century City office will reorganize into three firms  serving the entertainment industry, said partner George Savitsky. They will be  Savitsky, Satin &amp; Geibelson, an entertainment business management  corporation; Satin &amp; Lever, a music industry accounting firm; and Sills  &amp; Adelmann, a film and television accounting firm.  </P> <P> He said he is "90% certain" that the mid-Wilshire office, which did accounting  and consulting work for various industries, will fold. On Monday, only an  answering machine greeted calls to the mid-Wilshire office.  </P> <P> Pimentel said the 70-employee San Francisco office will continue to operate,  perhaps by affiliating with another accounting firm. The 40-employee Orange  County office of Laventhol &amp; Horwath will become independent and be renamed  Carpe, Wachs, Kipper &amp; Davis, after the four partners, Carpe said.  </P> <P> "It was our intention to liberate the local office from the national firm and  take whatever steps were necessary to see it happen as quickly as possible,"  Carpe said.  </P> <P> About 40 of the 50 offices probably will become independent practices, he said.  </P> <P> Carpe said business is growing at the Costa Mesa office, with projected  earnings of $4.5 million for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, compared to $4  million the previous year.  </P> <P> Officials at the San Diego offices could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Laventhol &amp; Horwath specializes in audit and consulting work for the hotel,  entertainment, real estate and health-care industries. The company had about  $350 million in revenue last year.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Leslie Berkman contributed to this story.  </P></p>

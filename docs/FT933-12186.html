			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Avon districts face office costs: The review of local government structure itself faces radical revision after fierce controversy. FT reporters examine the issues THE CREATION of unitary authorities should reduce central administration costs and overheads, says the local government commission. But the potential expense of new civic centres has not been quantified. In Avon the commission has proposed that a single authority be created from the existing district councils of Northavon and Kingswood, to the north and east of Bristol. Both have modern purpose-built council offices. Northavon's offices were built six years ago at a cost of about Pounds 2.5m and Kingswood's 11 years ago. Both lack the space, or adjacent land which could be developed, to act as the headquarters of a single large authority - unless many administrative services were housed elsewhere. They are 13 miles apart along congested roads and if one civic centre became the new town hall residents from the other district might object to the distance. The two councils are still pressing the case to become unitary authorities in their own right and say it is premature to consider the cost of new headquarters. Both point out that the existing civic centres could be used as area offices. At a recent public meeting in Kingswood the commission was criticised for not favouring the option of the area having its own unitary authority. Miss Mary Leigh, one of the commissioners, said they believed that only an authority the size of Kingswood and Northavon combined - 220,000 people - could provide strategic planning.</p>

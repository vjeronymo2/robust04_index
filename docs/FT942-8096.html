			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Southern Yemen declares new state Southern Yemeni leaders early this morning announced that they were seceding from united Yemen and declared a separate state, four years after North and South Yemen united. The announcement was made by Yemeni Vice President Ali Salem al-Baidh, the country's southern leader. He said general elections would be held a year from now. The move was a slap in the face for the north which only hours before had announced a three day ceasefire starting today to mark the Moslem feast of Eid. Earlier however North Yemeni military forces had stepped up their attacks on Aden, firing two missiles into the port city and shelling a vital military base 60 km to the north. Southern officials said one missile hit Aden's airport, while the other was shot down over the harbour. No deaths or injuries were reported in the attack. The missile attack broke northern promises made last week not to bomb southern cities. Northern troops also kept up pressure on the southern military base at al-Anad, 60 km north of Aden, shelling the base overnight. Southern forces were said to be counter-attacking with prolonged air attacks and ground bombardment. As the civil war entered its third week Western observers said al-Anad was a vital defensive position for the south. Journalists approached to within 3 km of the camp yesterday but were prevented by heavy artillery fire from getting closer to the battle. Northern forces are also reported to be massing at Zinjibar, about 60 km east of Aden. But western observers say southern defences have already repulsed several northern drives from that direction.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Kragujevac, 23 Jan (TANJUG)--Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the Srpska republic assembly, told Radio Kragujevac  today that, in its constant efforts to restore peace, the Serb  side would offer a so-called modus vivendi to the Croat and  Muslim sides.    Explaining what that means during the "Hallmark of Time"  program, Krajisnik said: "We bind ourselves not to take any  military action--not even to respond to provocations, although  that is very difficult--until 10 February. The world should see  once again who is for war and who is for peace."    "We suggest that all front lines be frozen, all military  activities halted, and relations be normalized. We are  ready--which is yet another sacrifice on our part--to discuss  all issues, including those that are completely clear and do not  cause any problems for us. This is because it is very important  to restore peace and, by lifting the sanctions, to return to  life as it was before the war, although the victims cannot be  brought to life," Krajisnik said.

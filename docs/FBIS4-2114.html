			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wang Dongjin, director of the Hebei </F> Provincial Commission for Restructuring of the Economy, on  priorities of Hebei's economic reform for 1994]    [Text] [Reporter] What will Hebei emphasize in its endeavor  to facilitate price reform this year?    [Wang Dongjin] Hebei will emphasize four aspects of work  when  facilitating price reform this year. First is to increase the  grain and cotton purchasing prices to protect peasants'  production enthusiasm. Beginning 1 April, we will lift the  control on the grain purchasing price throughout the province,  change state fixed-quota purchases into contracted purchases,  ensure the quantity but decontrol the price, and implement the  protection price system in the purchases of grain. Second is to  adjust the prices of crude oil, refined oil, and electricity at  an opportune time in line with state arrangements and lift the  price control on coal and chemical fertilizer. Third is to  further lift the price control on competitive commodities and  services and properly adjust the state-controlled prices for  some commodities and services. Fourth is to control the  benchmark land price well and gradually establish a mechanism  for normal real estate prices to take shape. We should  carefully organize the implementation of the various price  reform measures, strictly forbid unauthorized price increase,  adopt effective measures to stabilize the prices of nonstaple  food, and keep the general price increase within the scope  bearable to all fields of society.    [Reporter] Hebei won notable achievements in cultivating and  developing commodity markets in the past few years. What  measures will it take to accelerate this work this year?    [Wang Dongjin] This year's commodity market construction  should be focused on four aspects. First, based on local  resources advantages, laws governing commodity circulation, and  regional demand, we will cultivate on a priority basis a number  of wholesale markets for farm and sideline products, such as  grain, vegetables, fruits, aquatic products, meat, poultry,  eggs, and livestock, that meet local demands and have their own  characteristics to clear the channels for the circulation of  farm and sideline products and to resolve peasants'  "difficulties in purchasing and marketing." We will open a  number of specialized wholesale markets for industrial goods in  the areas where these goods are produced, marketed, or  transferred, and we will open a number of tourist, recreational,  and catering markets. Second, we will develop the markets for  the means of industrial and agricultural production at various  levels and through various channels in line with the principle  of letting those who invest gain the ownership and interests and  establish, throughout the province as soon as possible, a  pattern of the markets of means of production in which the  regional wholesale markets in the key energy and raw material  producing areas are placed in the lead, the markets of means of  production in the cities directly under the jurisdiction of the  province are the channels, and those in county seats are the  mainstay. We will also develop the commodity circulation  organizations and production and marketing forms that help  stabilize the relations between production and marketing to  serve industrial and agricultural production still better.  Third, we will build large retail outlets more rapidly. Cities  directly under the jurisdiction of the province should  particularly develop a number of large, multi-purpose, and  fairly well-known shopping centers that provide a good shopping  environment, have competitive edges, and create high economic  efficiency to satisfy people's ever growing consumption demand.  Fourth, in compliance with the State Council requirement for  "standardizing the beginning and experimenting with all work,"  we will work hard to create favorable conditions, train  high-level personnel for futures management, and draw up plans  for experiments to be submitted to the State Council Securities  Commission in order to strive to establish two pilot futures  markets.    [Reporter] The focus of the current endeavor to cultivate  and  improve the market system is to develop the markets for  essential elements of production. Please give us specific  details about it?    [Wang Dongjin] We should put the cultivation of the markets  for essential elements of production in a prominent position  this year and expedite building of the markets for money, labor  forces, personnel, technology, real estate, information, and  enterprises' property rights.    We will develop and improve the money markets with banks'  money-lending as the major form, actively develop the  standardized inter-bank lending and the markets for discounted  bills, improve and define the business scope of the provincial  money-lending center, and establish its branches in some cities  directly under the jurisdiction of the province. We will  further develop the securities markets, prepare for establishing  securities trading centers in Shijiazhuang and Tangshan cities,  and establish securities trading agencies in the cities directly  under the jurisdiction of the province and securities transfer  agencies in county-level cities. We will actively raise funds  by issuing bonds and stocks, create favorable conditions for  issuing trust profitable securities and investment fund  securities to satisfy the needs of investors and raise more  funds for construction projects.    We will give full play to the role of the market mechanism  in  rationally distributing urban and rural labor resources. We  will expand and improve the functions of labor markets to enable  them to provide integrated multi-purpose services for offering  jobs, employment consultation, unemployment insurance, and  pre-employment training. We will provide active support for all  fields of society to establish employment agencies and gradually  establish a service network composed of the labor markets at  city, county, and township (neighborhood) levels and those built  by all fields of society so that we can provide conditions for  enterprises to employ workers and laborers to choose jobs by  themselves. Cities directly under the jurisdiction of the  province should expedite construction of the facilities for  labor markets and connect all the markets in the province into  an integrated network. We should strengthen regional labor  service cooperation and guide the orderly mobility of rural  labor forces.    We will accelerate construction of personnel markets and  change, as soon as possible, the personnel management methods  characterized by departmental ownership and unified and  guaranteed job arrangements. All cities and prefectures should  build and improve personnel markets, strengthen their services,  and realistically develop the role of the markets in regulating  the supply and demand of personnel. We will facilitate the  reform of the scientific and technological system and greatly  develop technology markets. We will promote the restructuring  of scientific and technological departments, the transformation  of their mechanisms, and the diversion of their personnel in  line with the principle of "holding fast to one end and leaving  the whole field open." We will transform scientific research  institutes engaged in technological development into enterprises  more rapidly and encourage scientific and technical personnel to  establish nongovernmental enterprises engaged in scientific and  technological development. We will establish an open technology  market network to encourage the scientific and technical  personnel and scientific research achievements of scientific  research institutes, colleges, and universities to enter urban  and rural technology markets. We will develop the various forms  of technology trading activities to transform technological  achievements more rapidly into commodities and to industrialize  them.    In 1994, we will prepare for building the provincial-level  economic information market and connect it with the information  markets of the cities directly under the jurisdiction of the  province so as to establish a provincewide economic information  market network. We will build specialized markets for  information on medicinal herbs and building materials to service  the production and operation of Hebei's medicinal herbs and  building materials industries.    Hebei will prepare for building an enterprise property  rights  trading center to meet the needs in the adjustment of the  organization of enterprises. All cities and prefectures should  also establish property rights trading markets to provide  service for enterprises to deal with property rights.    [Reporter] Deepening the reform of the foreign economic  relations system and opening wider to the outside world are the  strategic measure for building an economically strong province.  What are the major measures Hebei will take this year for this  work?    [Wang Dongjin] We will continue to unswervingly implement  the  policy of opening to the outside world and open still wider. We  will exert more efforts to achieve success in the opening up of  Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou, the development belt along  the Beijing-Shenzhen Expressway, and the various regional  central cities, link them to the world market as soon as  possible, and fully develop their radiating and leading role.  We will adhere to the principle of developing foreign economic  relations, foreign trade, and foreign capital simultaneously and  accelerate the development of the export-oriented economy. We  will strive to make foreign-funded enterprises successful;  broaden the channels for using foreign capital; coordinate the  work to bring in funds and technology from abroad with the  adjustment of the industrial structure and the renovation of old  enterprises; develop on a priority basis technology-intensive  enterprises and the enterprises that produce import substitutes  and earn foreign exchange through exports; increase the  proportion of foreign investment made in infrastructural  facilities, basic industries, and high- and new-tech projects;  and attach importance to bringing in funds from abroad through  issuance of capital stocks and securities. We will make the  best of Hebei's abundant labor resources to undertake  construction projects and labor service cooperation abroad  through various channels and measures. We will establish a  pattern of multi-directional opening up step by step.    We will further deepen the reform of the foreign trade  system  in line with the principle of unified policies, open business,  competition on an equal footing, sole responsibility for profits  and losses, integrated management of industry and foreign trade,  and wide application of the agency system. We will speed up  transformation of the operating mechanism of the import and  export enterprises of various categories and reorganize the  state-owned foreign trade enterprises according to the modern  enterprise system. Large and medium-sized enterprises where  conditions permit should actively apply for and use well the  import and export authority. Those without the necessary  conditions for dealing with imports and exports for the time  being may "borrow ships to go to sea," actively promote the  integrated management of industry, commerce, technology, and  agriculture with foreign trade, and develop the  internationalized, industrialized, and conglomerate trading  companies. In this way, more enterprises will be able to enter  the world market. We will encourage establishment of  enterprises outside the border and improve the export tax refund  system. We will further lift control on import and export  commodities and gradually distribute the quotas through bidding  and auction the small number of import and export commodities  under quota management in a fair and open manner while  considering their efficiency. We will make the city,  prefectural, and county foreign trade management systems more  rational and delegate financial management powers to lower  levels to stimulate the enthusiasm of grass-roots enterprises.    [Reporter] What is your opinion on accelerating the reform  of  the social security system and the housing system?    [Wang Dongjin] We will follow the principle of "unified  management and separation of government administration from  functions of institutions" to make the social insurance  management system more rational and gradually establish the  multi-layered social security system. The focus of this year is  to accelerate the reform of the urban social insurance system to  strengthen the social service function and reduce the burdens on  enterprises; and to encourage various types of social mutual aid  and actively develop commercial insurance to satisfy the needs  of various levels. We will consolidate and improve the  provincial-level unified planning for the old-age insurance  premiums of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the unified  planning of society for the old-age insurance premiums of the  staff members and workers of collective enterprises to make sure  that the unified planning will cover more than 85 percent of the  staff members and workers this year. We will further expand the  coverage of the old-age insurance and gradually include all the  temporary workers, Chinese staff members and workers of  foreign-funded enterprises, staff members and workers of private  enterprises, and self-employed laborers in the insurance. We  will actively experiment with the reform of the calculation and  issuance of the old-age insurance premiums of staff members and  workers and explore the ways to combine unified planning of  society with individual accounts to gradually make enterprises  and individuals share the insurance premiums together. We will  further establish and improve the unified unemployment insurance  system that cover all staff members and workers of enterprises  of various categories, including the Chinese staff members and  workers of foreign-funded enterprises, exercise integrated  management, establish the unemployment insurance premium system  at the provincial level and city or prefectural level, and  coordinate unemployment insurance with employment service to  promote social stability. We will continue the experiment with  the reform of medical insurance, industrial injury insurance,  and maternity insurance of women workers. Based on peasants'  voluntary participation, we will institute the old-age insurance  derived from accumulation of individual accounts. We will  develop and improve rural cooperative medical service. We will  strengthen the management and public supervision of various  insurance funds.    We will conscientiously implement the State Council decision  on accelerating urban housing reform; sell, lease, and build  houses simultaneously, with the focus on selling houses;  actively but prudently promote sales of public houses; and  strictly implement the principle for fixing prices defined by  the State Council. We will continue to raise public house rent,  expedite urban housing construction in coordination with the  implementation of the "live-in-peace project," greatly develop  economical and practical houses, and promote fund-raising and  cooperation in housing construction. We will extensively apply  the accumulation fund system to housing construction. We will  develop money lending for houses and issue mortgage loans for  people to buy houses.    [Reporter] Hebei is a large agricultural province, and the  issue on agriculture, rural areas, and peasants is a basic issue  concerning our economic development and modernization drive.  How will Hebei further deepen the rural economic reform this  year?    [Wang Dongjin] To deepen the rural economic reform, we  should  stabilize the party's basic rural policies and establish more  rapidly the systems for the operation and management of the  rural economy that meet the needs of the socialist market  economy and that aim mainly at cultivating the mainstay of the  market, strengthening macroeconomic guidance, intensifying  protection of agriculture, and increasing peasants' income. We  should stabilize the household-based output-related contract  responsibility system and further improve the dual management  system that combines unified management with independent  management. On the premise that land is owned by the  collective, we will conscientiously implement the central  stipulation of extending the land contract another 30 years  without change. The term of the contracts for reclaiming barren  hills, wasteland, sandy land, and beaches for developmental  production may be even longer, and inheritance of such contracts  and paid transfer of land use rights according to law are  permitted. Based on the voluntary participation of the masses,  the small number of localities with fairly developed economies  may develop the optimal-scale operation through the transfer of  contracts or purchases of stocks to improve agricultural labor  productivity and land productivity. We should facilitate the  development of township enterprises in line with the principle  of "providing active support and correct guidance and ensuring  their continuous improvement and gradual standardization." We  should particularly develop the shareholding cooperation system  and innovate their property right system and operating system to  further enhance their vigor. After clarifying property rights,  we will promote the flow and organization of the essential  elements of production between different communities so that a  more reasonable enterprise layout will take shape. Meanwhile,  we will intensify planning to develop concentrations of township  enterprises in certain areas. We will make active efforts to  achieve success in the experimental reform to urbanize rural  areas to accelerate the progress of the urbanization. We should  speed up development of county-level cities, and the counties  which possess the scale of a city and the conditions for  building themselves into cities should actively apply for  abolishment of the counties and establishment of cities. In the  meantime, we should make the best use of and renovate the  existing small cities and towns and build new ones. We will  gradually reform the residence registration management system of  small cities and towns and allow peasants to develop industrial  work, commercial business, and the tertiary industry in small  cities and towns to promote the transfer of surplus rural labor  forces.    [Reporter] The market economy, in a certain sense, is a  legally codified economy. How will Hebei step up establishment  of the laws and regulations for the economic reform this year?    [Wang Dongjin] We will further establish and improve the  laws and regulations compatible with the socialist market  economy system, coordinate the policies for reform with those  for legislation, and step up establish of the local laws or  regulations on standardizing the mainstay of the market,  safeguarding the market order, strengthening macroeconomic  regulation and control, improving social security, and promoting  opening to the outside world. We should conscientiously  organize the enforcement of relevant laws issued by the state  and draw up corresponding methods or detailed principles for  their enforcement that are suitable to the provincial  conditions. Meanwhile, in view of the continuously deepened  reform in Hebei, we will step up establishment of the  regulations on the management of private enterprises,  shareholding cooperative economies, shareholding enterprises,  and property right deals. We will clean up the laws,  regulations, and policy documents incompatible with the  establishment of the socialist market economy system and do a  good job in "abolishing and amending them and formulating new  ones."    We should strengthen and improve administration of justice,  administrative law enforcement, and supervision of law  enforcement and resolutely investigate, handle, and correct the  failure in abiding by laws, strictly enforcing laws, and  investigating law breaches, the abuse of power, and the law  breaches committed for benefiting one's own department,  locality, and small group.    The provincial party committee and government have placed  great emphasis on the work to strengthen leadership over reform.  Proceeding from the overall interests, all levels and all  departments should truly embrace the guiding thought of  promoting development through reform and truly concentrate the  attention to accelerating development on deepening reform.  Governments at all levels should pay close attention to the  reform in key areas, carefully organize it, formulate specific  plans and implement them meticulously, and study and address in  a timely manner the new conditions and new problems emerging in  the process of reform.</p>

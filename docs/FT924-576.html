			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: Sweden provides fresh start deal for Nordbanken THE SWEDISH government is providing a further SKr14bn (Dollars 2bn) in equity and SKr10bn in guarantees as part of the reconstruction of the troubled Nordbanken group. The announcement yesterday came as the state said it would formally take over Securum AB, a company holding SKr67bn in bad loans and shares (SKr50bn after write-downs), from Nordbanken at the beginning of 1993. The aim is to provide Nordbanken with a fresh start, facilitating the bank's eventual return to the private sector, while gradually disposing of the assets within Securum. The government is financing Securum with SKr24bn in equity and it is providing a SKr10bn guarantee for a further SKr30bn in credits which Nordbanken is making on favourable terms to Securum. The support is in addition to a SKr10bn injection which Nordbanken received from the state last month, and it includes SKr10bn of help already promised but not given. It means the state will contribute a total of SKr34bn in equity to resolve the problems relating to Nordbanken. Nordbanken was generally considered to be in a more critical condition than the other banks in Sweden's ailing financial sector. However, the figures announced yesterday were much higher than indicated in June, when a SKr20bn support package was announced. The deterioration implies more support is going to be required for the Swedish banking system as a whole than previously thought. The worsening in the general economic situation is the main reason for the change. Nordbanken's credit losses, including those within Securum, will now be SKr10bn more than the SKr6-SKr8bn estimated in May. The government also accepts that it will take longer to dispose of the assets within Securum and prices realised will be lower, than it thought earlier. The bank is also cutting SKr1bn off costs and reducing staff 20 per cent to 4,500 people.</p>

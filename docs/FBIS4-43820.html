			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 21 (AFP) -- More than 20 French  charities and development assistance groups have formed a  committee to oppose French plans for military intervention in  Rwanda, they announced on Tuesday [21 June].    "The French government cannot intervene directly in Rwanda,  its past in that country is already too weighty and its  activities have been too pronounced," the chairman of the  Medicins du Monde (MDM; Doctors of the World) Bernard Granjon  told a press conference held to launch the committee.    He called instead for armed deployment and "humanitarian  intervention by the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda".    The mainly Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has  warned it will resist French military deployment, accusing Paris  of backing the Hutu majority, training the army and being  indirectly responsible for the ethnic massacres of hundreds of  thousands of Tutsis and opposition Hutus by extremist militias.    Other member associations of the France-Rwanda National  Solidarity Committee include Pharmaciens sans Frontieres (PSF;  Pharmacists without Borders), Handicap International and  SOS-Racisme.    In the Rwandan capital Kigali, two PSF personnel complained  Tuesday that they had been ordered to leave because of the  French plans for military intervention.    "We have the impression of betraying everybody," one of  them,  Michel Sounalet, said before they joined a UN convoy heading for  neighbouring Tanzania.    Another member of PSF, which has been working with orphans,  distributing food and medicines to people hiding from death  squads and helping in the evacuation of endangered children from  the bloodied Rwandan capital, will remain in Kigali.    Speaking at the Paris press conference, another PSF  representative, Claude Simonot, said there should be no military  intervention at the expense of humanitarian relief.    The UN Security Council was Tuesday to debate a French draft  resolution proposing to send in up to 2,000 French troops and  head military intervention until the United Nations can beef up  its mission in Rwanda.</p>

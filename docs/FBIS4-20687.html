Yokomizo of the Industrial Wastewater </F> Treatment Department, Mechanical and Electrical Headquarters,  Sanki Engineering Co. Ltd., Japan]    [Text] Plans to regenerate building wastewater for reuse  are being actively promoted for implementation, with an  increasing number of wastewater regeneration installations  (water reclamation systems) coming into operation every year.  This is not only because the need is created by the already  existing limitation to further development of water resources in  urban areas as well as by the growing water demand in cities due  to shortages of water, but also because the public sewer system  is beginning to have relative shortages in capacity due to the  ever-increasing volume of wastewater, as a result of the  gravitation of the population toward cities.    Under such circumstances Sanki Engineering succeeded in  developing its wastewater reclamation system utilizing the  ultrafiltration membrane separation (UF membrane) technology.  This treatment technology combines the activated sludge process  with membrane separation. Since 1980 when its first full-scale  installation came into being as a commercial size MSR (Membrane  Sewage Reclamation) System Sanki Engineering has successfully  installed a great number of plants utilizing this technology. At  the same time the company has undertaken maintenance and  operation management for these plants and through this  experience has developed and acquired a broad knowledge of  problems associated with operation management.    Building on this extensive operating experience Sanki  Engineering discusses here the outline of the building  wastewater regeneration and reuse technology incorporating the  UF membrane separation technology.  <H5>  1. Basic Requirements for a Building Wastewater Regeneration </H5> System    As the basic requirements, the system must:    (1) be installed in small space;    (2) be easy to operate and maintain;    (3) produce treated water of high and stable quality;    (4) not cause secondary nuisance such as an odor problem,  etc.  <H5>  2. Selection of Flowsheets Recommended for Systems </H5> Incorporating UF Membrane Separation Technology    Several alternative process flows can be considered as  systems incorporating the UF membrane separation technology.    Introduced here is a representative process flow combining  UF  membrane separation with biological treatment (activated sludge  process). Although some types of system flows do not incorporate  biological treatment, it should be safe to adopt a system flow  combined with biological treatment for building wastewater  regeneration, since it is almost impossible to exclude living  wastewater when reuse is considered within standard office  buildings.    This paper discusses later ``The Kinds of Wastewater To Be  Regenerated and Their Uses.''  <H5>  3. Kinds of Wastewater To Be Regenerated and Their Uses </H5>   Building wastewater is classified into low BOD loading  wastewater such as from washstands, washbasins, etc. and high  BOD loading wastewater such as kitchen wastewater and sewage  (toilet flush water), but any kind of building wastewater can in  principle be regenerated for reuse, regardless of its source.    Special caution, however, is needed when the latter is used  by itself or in case its mixing ratio is higher even when used  together with low BOD loading wastewater.    The point is that it is necessary to remove oily substance  contained in kitchen wastewater or to take necessary measures  with the treated water (regenerated water for reuse) for its  color in case of sewage.    3-1. Low BOD Loading Wastewater    (1) Wastewater From Washstands, Washbasins and Hot Water  Makers    Wastewater from these sources amounts to about 10 percent of  the total wastewater volume discharged from a standard office  building, and, because lower in contaminants loading, should be  given priority for reuse from a water quality standpoint.    In many cases, however, the volume of wastewater from these  sources alone may not be sufficient to cover the required  quantity of regenerated water.    (2) Blow Water From Cooling Towers    Wastewater from this source is virtually free from  contaminants loading and of good quality, and, therefore, should  be recovered for reuse, separately from living wastewater.    This kind of wastewater can be adequately treated for reuse  by a simple method such as a usual type of filtration plus  sterilization.    This kind of wastewater can be effectively treated together  with rainwater, and does not require an application of the UF  membrane separation system for its treatment.    3-2. High BOD Loading Wastewater    (1) Kitchen Wastewater    This is wastewater discharged from corporate dining rooms  and  other eating and drinking establishments. This kind of  wastewater is very high in organic type contaminants loading and  contains mainly BOD, oily substance, surface activating agents,  etc. Because it is comparatively stable in volume and can serve  as a nutrient source for microorganisms in the aeration tank,  this kind of wastewater can be effectively treated together with  low BOD loading wastewater.    It is, however, necessary to remove oily substance to a  required level in case this kind of wastewater is used by itself  or in case its mixing ratio with low BOD loading wastewater  exceeds 30 percent when using the two kinds of wastewater  together. This is because unless the level of oily substance  removal is adequate, sludge generated in the biological  treatment process will be of such nature that it tends to clog  up the UF membrane.    (2) Sewage (Toilet Flush Water)    Because this kind of wastewater is very high in organic type  contaminants loading and contains ammoniacal nitrogen, bilious  coloring matter, etc., and further because oxidization of  ammonia forms nitric acid resulting in lower pH, it is necessary  to neutralize the regenerated water from this kind of wastewater  for reuse and also to provide the aeration tank with acid-proof  treatment.    It is also necessary to further treat this regenerated water  by taking decoloring measures (by activated carbon, ozone  treatment, etc.), as it takes on light yellow color because the  substance formed from bilious coloring matter in it remains  undissolved.    For those reasons there are few cases where this kind of  wastewater is positively reclaimed for reuse even when the  treatment system incorporates a UF membrane separation unit.  However, the MSR system can be considered as an effective means  in case this kind of wastewater needs to be regenerated for  reuse, since decoloring effects on it can be expected by  lowering the pH level of the aeration tank.  <H5>  4. System Constitution </H5>   Elements which constitute the system generally consist of  the  following, although they may vary somewhat with the kind of  wastewater to be treated:     -  Screens (Screens with Coarse Openings, Screens with Fine  Openings)    -  Pumps, Blowers, etc.    -  Ultrafiltration Unit    -  Aeration Tank    -  Other Tanks       In addition to the above, an oil removal device (pressurized  flotation tank, etc.) and/or an activated carbon adsorption  tower may be required in case measures are necessary to remove  oily substance or color, depending on the kind of wastewater  intended for reuse.  <H5>  5. Features of the UF Membrane System </H5>   (1) Availability of Regenerated Water of Stable and High  Quality at All Times    Because organic matter is completely decomposed in the  aeration tank and all of suspended solids are eliminated by the  UF membrane separation unit, this system can produce treated  water of extremely high quality.    This means that no special consideration is required of the  materials of construction used for those piping and equipment  handling this superior quality treated water and serves as a  good proof that combination of the activated sludge process with  the UF membrane separation technology makes a superior treatment  system.    (2) Generation of Little Excess Sludge    Little excess sludge is generated, since activated sludge  that can not pass through the UF membrane separation unit is  concentrated and returned to the aeration tank.    This means that the propagation of microorganisms and their  self-oxidization is well balanced by the increased concentration  of activated sludge in the aeration tank.    (3) Compact, Reduced Size    Wastewater regeneration systems employing such processes as  activated sludge process, contact oxidization process, rotating  disc process, etc. require sedimentation tanks and may have to  be equipped with two stages of biological treatment or followed  by a sand filter, activated carbon adsorption tower, etc. in  case high quality treated water is needed.    This system, however, requires no sedimentation tank nor  does  it almost require two stages of biological treatment of  post-treatment equipment.    (4) Ease of Operation and Maintenance    Since this system requires no sedimentation tank, it is not  necessary to control the volume of excess sludge to be returned.  Consequently, the system is very easy to operate and maintain.    Furthermore, this system, not being subjected to effects  from  the settling characteristics of the sludge, is easy to manage in  respect of operation, unlike other conventional types of systems  equipped with sedimentation tanks which may have to heavily  depend on filtration and other post-treatment equipment in case  of handling a type of sludge difficult to settle.    (5) High Wastewater Recovery Rate    Ninety-nine percent or more of the original wastewater can  be  recovered as treated water, because little excess sludge is  generated.    (6) No Odor Dispersion    Since all the process equipment is tightly enclosed, no odor  dispersion occurs.  <H5>  6. Uses for Regenerated Water </H5>   Regenerated water is used as toilet flush water in almost  all  cases for the present time except that part of it is used as  sprinkling water for gardens. Since the quality of regenerated  water from the water reclamation system incorporating the  activated sludge method combined with UF membrane separation is  very high, it is expected that many other uses will be developed  for this high quality treated water in the future. Uses will be  found, for instance, as make-up water for cooling towers,  landscaping water, car washing water, fire-extinguishing water,  etc.  <H5>  7.

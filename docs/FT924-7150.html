			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Tube chiefs adopt tough stance LONDON Underground's management was yesterday preparing to take a tough line if workers carry out their threat to strike next week over job cuts and a new pay and conditions package. The management is determined to win the dispute at any cost. If that means letting people travel without paying fares because no one is available to staff booking halls and ticket barriers, it says, then so be it. Workers have been told that if a strike goes ahead, future redundancies could be compulsory instead of voluntary; and that the pay rises offered to staff who remain, averaging 6 per cent, will lapse - in which case any new offer will be subject to the government's newly introduced 1.5 per cent ceiling on public -sector pay rises. Even if this tactic fails, the management is convinced that it will have enough people available for work to keep a service running. Many of those getting the biggest pay rises - and therefore with the most to lose if they lapse - are operational staff such as train crews and traffic controllers. The tactics also include the threat that strikers will be sacked and replaced with non-union personnel if necessary. The training period for a driver can easily be cut from the present 12 weeks, London Underground says. The origins of the dispute lie in London Transport's attempts to turn the Underground into a modern, efficient, well-run railway - with one eye on the possibility that this could ultimately lead to some form of privatisation. After months of studying the potential for efficiency gains, the Underground came out a year ago with a plan which set the scene for radical changes in employees' conditions of service with the aim of increasing productivity. Archaic working practices were to be swept away, employees would be required to be more flexible, services such as train and station cleaning would be contracted out - and above all, the workforce would be cut by nearly a quarter, from 21,000 to 16,000. Employees and union representatives opposed the changes. The management said redundancies would be voluntary and spread over three years; that staff who remained would end up with more interesting and better-paid jobs; and that the minority of employees suffering a fall in pay would have their level of earnings protected until 1995. Negotiations over the package have been going on ever since. However, implementation has already quietly begun: London Underground says about 1,000 employees have taken voluntary redundancy, many of them as a result of the contracting out of cleaning services. What seems to have brought about yesterday's crunch is an attempt to implement the changes in the core operational areas - the running of the trains and stations. The RMT railworkers' union accuses London Underground of having pulled the plug on negotiations over the new conditions of service. London Underground says the RMT was just spinning out the talks with no intention of ever reaching a deal. Whatever the truth of the matter, yesterday's ballot has set the scene for a damaging strike which threatens to bring chaos to the capital. London Underground, however, is in no mood for conciliation. It said yesterday: 'We have got to the stage where we either take this railway forward into the next century or we just stopmanaging it altogether.'</p>

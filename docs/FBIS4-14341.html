			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher started  his Middle East tour with his arrival in the Saudi capital,  Riyadh, where he was welcomed by his Saudi counterpart Prince  Sa'ud al-Faysal. In addition to his meeting with King Fahd of  Saudi Arabia, Christopher will hold a joint session with the  foreign ministers of the six Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC]  member countries.    Although it is said that Christopher's talks in Riyadh will  concentrate on three topics--the Middle East compromise, the  situation and developments in the Persian Gulf, and the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina--political observers believe  that the major topic of discussion among the U.S. secretary of  state, Saudi officials, and GCC foreign ministers will be these  countries' role in activating the talks with the Zionist regime,  the recognition of this regime, and the normalization of  relations with it.    In view of the difficulties that the compromise talks are  facing on bilateral levels, especially those of Syria and  Lebanon, as well as the bleak prospects for the Israeli-PLO  talks, the foreign sides--especially the United States--are  trying to shift the talks' center of gravity from bilateral  conflicts between the front-line countries and those that are in  contact with the Zionist regime to multilateral sessions. By  removing the support from behind the front-line countries, they  hope to transform compromise with the Zionist regime into a road  of no return.    Within this framework, a new round of multilateral sessions  with Zionist diplomatic delegations have started in the Arab  littoral countries of the Persian Gulf. Although Saudi Arabia  is apparently not the host of any of these sessions,  Christopher's visit to Riyadh shows that the center of  Washington's new diplomacy for activating the rusty wheels of  compromise is in Riyadh.    One of the most important topics in the discussions between  the six GCC foreign ministers and the U.S. secretary of state is  a statement proposed by the United States in which countries  participating in the multilateral talks would mutually recognize  the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and so-called political  independence of each other and declare their firm belief in a  peaceful solution of differences, respect for human rights, and  support for economic cooperation with each other. Moreover, the  statement proposed by the United States emphasizes the need for  political reform, the implementation of democratic principles,  and the freedom of political parties.    Thus, the GCC countries are currently facing a new  bottleneck  and have to resort to a deal with Washington. These countries  consider the implementation of any type of fundamental political  reforms to be destructive. Thus, they will possibly resort to a  political transaction that will include concessions to Tel Aviv  in the political and economic fields in return for Washington's  acceptance of the slow pace at which political reforms are  moving in these countries.</p>

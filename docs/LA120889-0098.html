			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW;  </P> <P> PROGRAM OF VILLA-LOBOS AT CSUN DISPLAYS BRAZILIAN COMPOSER'S UNUSUAL BLEND OF  TRADITIONS  </P> <P> Heitor Villa-Lobos was a hard man to classify during his career as a musician  and composer, and the task has not gotten any easier in the 30 years since his  death. Brazil's tireless innovator delighted in unusual meldings of ideas from  his classical training and from his homeland's popular music. The result is too  idiosyncratic to be imitated and too delightful to be overlooked.  </P> <P> The lineup of a Villa-Lobos concert coming Tuesday to Cal State Northridge  shows the extent of the composer's playfulness. Among the scheduled works are  "Bachianas Brasileiras 5," one of his nine suites that interpret Bach from a  Brazilian musical tradition. The piece uses eight cellos and a soprano to  surprisingly lilting effect. Singing will be Janet Momjian, a CSUN student who  won last year's Metropolitan Opera Western regional competition.  </P> <P> Also to be performed is "Sextuor Mystique," or "Mystical Sextet," which  features flute, oboe, alto saxophone, harp, guitar and celesta.  </P> <P> "How's that for a collection of instruments," said David Aks, director of the  CSUN Symphony and one of the principal organizers of Tuesday's concert. "It's a  very unusual sound.  </P> <P> Aks said the Villa-Lobos works will be performed as chamber pieces by a loosely  knit collection of students and faculty, including Music Department Chairman  Jerry Luedders, a saxophonist. About 16 performers will take part, with no more  than nine appearing at a time.  </P> <P> "We just ignore Latin American composers in this country, which is a big  mistake," Aks said. "With Villa-Lobos, some of the music is more European  sounding, and a lot of it has a strong Latin flavor. It's lively, it's rhythmic  and it's tuneful."  </P> <P> The idea for the event came from Gustavo Neiva Tavares, 28, a Brazilian who is  pursuing a master's degree in music at CSUN. Tavares, a cellist like Aks, was  first cello for Brazil's National Theater and studied six years in West  Germany. He has done considerable research into Villa-Lobos, who wrote more  than 1,300 works.  </P> <P> "He is the most important composer in Brazil and one of the most important on  the American continent," Tavares said. "He played many instruments: cello,  guitar, piano. He came from a family where music was very alive. He was very  interested in music but also very independent and did not want to go into  academic settings."  </P> <P> Instead, the composer traveled widely in Brazil, learning the popular music.  </P> <P> "He developed a need to become more Brazilian to be honest as a musician,"  Tavares said. "Of course, much of the popular music is by guitar. As a cellist,  Villa-Lobos played opera and serious music, and as a guitarist he is much more  acquainted with Brazilian popular music."  </P> <P> Tavares said the works of Villa-Lobos expose the myth of Brazil as a land of  little more than sun, bananas and simple, bright music.  </P> <P> "He had many ideas about orchestration that were not European. Because of that,  many people, like Artur Rubinstein and Aaron Copland were influenced by him.  There is a very rich, complex culture behind him that allowed him to become  great."  </P> <P> The concert will last about an hour and a half. Preceding it will be a talk by  Robert Stevenson, a music professor at UCLA who has studied Latin American  music extensively.  </P> <P>  "The Chamber Music of Villa-Lobos" will be Tuesday, Dec. 12, at 8 p.m. in the  Little Theatre, Speech-Drama Building, Cal State Northridge, 18111 Nordhoff St.  Tickets are $5 and $2 for students and seniors.

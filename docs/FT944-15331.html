			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Interest rate rise rocks north-east A 'needless' rise in interest rates last month has started to suppress a fragile regional economy, according to a survey by the Trades Union Congress in Yorkshire and Humberside, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. Mr Paul Jagger, TUC regional secretary, yesterday warned that any further rises in rates would have a 'very detrimental' effect. Yorkshire and Humberside's growth had been only modest so far. He said a regional survey by the TUC showed steel industry production up 1.4 per cent to 323 tonnes a week in August, but concerns that energy prices would rise, damaging profitability, were increasing . Mr Jagger said the TUC was particularly concerned about lack of new jobs and investment in higher education, in spite of increasing numbers of students. Government funding was getting tighter.</p>

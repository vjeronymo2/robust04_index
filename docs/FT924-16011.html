			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Philips hit by supply problems in audio market battle PHILIPS, the Dutch consumer electronics group, is facing an embarrassing setback in its attempt to take the lead in the next-generation portable audio market. The launch, scheduled for today, of the digital compact cassette (DCC), a digital audio tape format developed by Philips, has been marred by a lack of pre-recorded digital tapes to listen to on the new machines. Matsushita, the Japanese electronics group which is a co-developer of DCC, launched the world's first DCC systems in Japan last month. But while Japanese consumers can buy the much-heralded DCC machines, they cannot listen to pre-recorded DCC tapes which are being withdrawn due to alleged defects. The DCC camp, lead by Philips, had said there would be about 500 titles ready for the planned worldwide launch. However, Philips had to postpone the launch of its machines due to defects. The delay comes as consumer electronics makers prepare for the battle between DCC and mini disc, a format similar to a small compact disc developed by Sony. Both DCC and mini disc are recordable digital audio equipment, but DCC hardware can also play the traditional cassette tape. The months before Christmas are crucial to sales. Record companies said they expect the launch of DCC tapes to be postponed until next month. The pre-recorded tapes, manufactured by Victor Company of Japan, which is 52 per cent owned by Matsushita, represent mainly regional titles. Meanwhile, international titles, manufactured by Polygram, are still en route to Japan and are not expected to arrive on store shelves for another few weeks.</p>

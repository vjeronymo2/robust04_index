"It is very important to build up our relationship with the  democratic leaders in Russia as well as Central and East  Europe," he said.    "They are our friends. They have new and democratic  institutions and they have liberalised their economies.    "Russia has a hugely important part to play in the world.  The relationship between Russia and NATO can only be to the  benefit of both sides. We have been seeking at this meeting to  build a stable framework for the most profound changes in modern  history."    Mr. Major went to meet NATO military chiefs, including the  Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General George Joulwan, and the  chairman of the Military Committee, Field Marshal Sir Dick  Vincent.    He wanted to hear their advice about what action was  feasible  in Bosnia and how the summit's decisions to open NATO doors to  the East could be implemented.</p>

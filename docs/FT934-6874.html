			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / People: Townsend leaves NHS for Btec Tina Townsend has been appointed the new chief executive of the Business and Technology Council, one of the bodies which validates vocational qualifications. She succeeds John Sellars, who has led Btec from its inception in 1983. Townsend takes up her appointment in February 1994 from her present post as chief executive of the National Health Service Training Directorate. Her recent experience of leading a major organisation through a period of change will be apposite for Btec which is at the forefront of change in vocational education in an effort to meet the government's national education and training targets. Townsend, 46, started her career as a lecturer in vocational education and training at the University of Wales and was a senior research officer with the Manpower Services Commission. She joined the NHS Training Authority as director of research in 1984. She said yesterday: 'Britain's need for a fully motivated and technically equipped workforce has never been greater.' A self-financing organisation, Btec was set up in 1983 by the then Department of Education and Science with the aim of promoting and developing quality work-related programmes.</p>

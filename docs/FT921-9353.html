			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher leads passing-out parade of MPs - Ivor Owen on those leaving the Commons at the general election even though the general election is at least eight weeks off. They are the 80 politicians who know they are not returning to the Commons, whatever the voters decide. A former prime minister, three former chancellors and an assortment of panjandrums are among those not seeking re-election at the poll, which is likely to be on April 9. Whatever the final verdict on the achievements of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, she is certain to be remembered as the first prime minister to vacate 10 Downing Street after being given notice to quit by disenchanted party colleagues. Two of the former chancellors - Sir Geoffrey Howe and Mr Nigel Lawson - were closely associated with Mrs Thatcher's successes in the days when opponents as well as supporters believed she was electorally unstoppable. Until his resignation speech in November 1990 Sir Geoffrey Howe seemed content with the mantle of Sir Austen Chamberlain - the Conservative cabinet minister and leadership contender of an earlier generation - who was said to have 'always played the game - and always lost it'. Sir Geoffrey may have failed in his ambition to emulate his political hero, David Lloyd George, by becoming prime minister - but the 19-minute speech in which he spelt out the way in which Mrs Thatcher had dispensed with the concept of cabinet government was the key link in the chain of events that led to her departure from office. It was just over a year earlier that Mr Lawson resigned as chancellor when his policy differences with Mrs Thatcher and Sir Alan Walters, her chief economic adviser, finally became unbridgeable. Mr Denis Healey, whose dramatic recall from London Airport to the Treasury in 1976 as the pound tottered left an indelible imprint on his period as chancellor, will be absent from the Labour benches when MPs return after the general election. He, like the other former chancellors and Mrs Thatcher, seems certain to be among the dozen or so former ministers heading for the red benches of the Lords later this year. They are unlikely to be joined by another prominent politician with a clear claim to a peerage - Mr Michael Foot, the former Labour leader, who has frequently called for the abolition of the Lords. Mr Foot first entered the Commons in 1945 as MP for Devonport. He will leave parliament at the same time as the current occupant of that constituency, Dr David Owen, who led the Social Democratic party into oblivion. It is generally recognised that Dr Owen's persistent but vain attempts to change the electoral system and end the dominance of the two main parties seriously aggravated the injuries Labour suffered under Mr Foot's leadership. Mrs Thatcher's frequently expressed admiration for Dr Owen reflected her judgment that, whether by accident or design, he made a significant contribution to the most spectacular of the three successive general election triumphs secured by the Conservatives under her leadership - the majority of 144 in 1983. Also bowing out from the Commons will be Sir Ian Gilmour, whose background of Eton, Balliol and the army - as well as an inherited baronetcy - would, in earlier times, have classified him as the archetypal Tory MP. Sir Ian was never taken in by what he saw as the exaggerated claims about the achievements of Thatcherism. Both before and after his dismissal from the cabinet in 1981 he warned that the so-called economic miracle - enthusiastically trumpeted by Mr John Major among others - would prove illusory. Another notable departure from the Conservative ranks will be Mr Michael Latham, who at the politically early age of 49 has decided to vacate Rutland and Melton, which returned him with a 23,022 majority in 1987. Mr Latham, an Anglican lay preacher, took up the initially unpaid appointment of executive director of the Council of Christians and Jews at the start of February. Mr Bernard Weatherill, the retiring speaker, had a distinction not shared by any of his predecessors. He presided over the introduction of television cameras to the Commons - and, with the footage becoming popular in the US, he has become a familiar figure on both sides of the Atlantic. His successor as speaker will preside over the biggest Commons membership since the Second World War. The growth in the electorate of Milton Keynes has entitled the area to an additional constituency - 651 MPs, instead of the present 650, will be returned at the election. Mr Edward Heath, who looked towards Europe in his maiden speech in 1950 and as prime minister took Britain into the European Community in 1973, will be the 'father' of the new House.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An increase in the 1994&hyph;95 budget of $700 for compliance audits, $200 for salary expense, $100 for audit expense, and $500 for postage will be offset by a decrease of $1,000 in Committee expense and $500 in the miscellaneous category. Major expense items include $4,000 for Committee member compensation for meeting attendance, $2,000 for surveillance inspection, $1,800 for office supplies, $3,000 for postage, $1,500 for miscellaneous, $1,000 for audit, $2,400 for Washington Potato Commission contract fees, $11,200 for salaries, $1,800 for salary expense, and $5,200 for compliance audits. The Commission provides certain services to the Committee as specified in a memorandum of understanding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interim final rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 31, 1994 (59 FR 15039). That interim final rule added &sect;946.246 to authorize expenses and establish an assessment rate for the Committee. That rule provided that interested persons could file comments through May 2, 1994. No comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this rule will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 946 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Potatoes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 946 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 946_IRISH POTATOES GROWN IN WASHINGTON <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

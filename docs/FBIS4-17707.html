			<p>BFN     [Text] In Vilnius an hour ago the presidents of Poland and  Lithuania, Lech Walesa and Algirdas Brazauskas, signed a treaty  on cooperation and good-neighborly relations.    [Unidentified correspondent] This is a breakthrough in our  bilateral relations because, out of seven our neighbors,  Lithuania was the only one with which we did not have a  bilateral treaty. The treaty was prepared not without  difficulties, with accompanying protests from extreme  nationalists on both sides. The Lithuanian side wanted to  condemn in the treaty the occupation of Vilnius region in the  period 1920-39 and regard as illegal all the effects of the  presence of the Polish state in that region.    This was not acceptable to us, among other things because of  the Poles living in Lithuania. Apart from that, it would be  difficult to find a country which would condemn its own history  in a treaty. Finally, both sides agreed that historical entries  should be included in a separate declaration which would not  have the force of an international agreement.    As a result, we are talking about the bad experiences of the  past. Instead of a condemnation of the occupation there is a  statement that Warsaw is the capital of Poland and Vilnius is  the capital of Lithuania. This confirms Lithuania's historical  rights to Vilnius. Neither Poland nor Lithuania have any  territorial claims on each other. Both countries consider the  present border as inviolable.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1990 BOOK PRIZE WINNER: HISTORY;  </P> <P> ON RICHARD FLETCHER'S 'THE QUEST FOR EL CID'  </P> <P> As anyone who has ever taken a course in medieval Spanish history can attest,  the subject is nightmarishly complicated. When Rodrigo Diaz, who would later be  known as El Cid, was born around 1043, the southern two-thirds of the Iberian  peninsula, Al-Andalus, was still under Muslim rule, but the formerly unified  caliphate of Cordova had broken down into a score of tiny city-states known as  taifas.  </P> <P>  The northern, Christian portion of the peninsula was divided into the rival  kingdoms of Castile-Leon, Navarre, Aragon, and the county of Barcelona.  Frontiers constantly shifted as the various petty rulers formed alliances that  often cut across religious lines in their relentless efforts to conquer and  exploit their neighbors.  </P> <P> Although by the year 1000 the population of Spain is thought to have been 75%  Muslim, Christians lived and practiced their religion throughout Al-Andalus,  while many Muslims lived in Christian territory, and there were important  Jewish settlements throughout the peninsula. Large sectors of the population  were bilingual or even trilingual, and intermarriage and conversion from one  religion to another were commonplace.  </P> <P> The great virtue of Fletcher's "The Quest for El Cid" is that he manages to  bring some order out of all that chaos and to tell the story of those long ago,  turbulent times in a way that is both comprehensible and fascinating to the  modern reader. The title, which strikingly parallels Schweitzer's "The Quest of  the Historical Jesus," is somewhat misleading. Fletcher's stated purpose is to  strip away the layers of myth and legend that somehow transformed a rather  opportunistic mercenary warlord who fought for both Muslims and Christians into  Spain's national hero, "the crusading warrior who waged wars of re-conquest for  the triumph of the Cross over the Crescent and the liberation of the fatherland  from the Moors."  </P> <P> In fact, though there may be a few laymen who still cherish the heroic image of  El Cid portrayed in late 19th- and early 20th-century children's books and in  the 1961 Charlton Heston film, the true facts of Rodrigo Diaz's career have  been well known since at least 1849, when Reinhardt Dozy published his  iconoclastic "Recherches sur L'histoire et la litterature de l'Espagne pendant  le moyen age." Fletcher contributes no new material that significantly alters  Dozy's conclusions.  </P> <P> Fletcher is a sophisticated historian who knows how to read his sources -- both  medieval and modern -- critically, probing beneath the surface for the biases  that led earlier historians to emphasize certain events while ignoring others.  For example, he astutely points out that Evariste Levi-Provencal, as a  Parisian, "was culturally attuned to centralism and regarded the provinces as  shabby and distasteful."  </P> <P> Hence, his account of 10th-Century Islamic Spain needs to be balanced by a more  thorough study of events in the provinces. Fletcher obviously does not believe  in the possibility of truly objective history. All historical narratives, he  insists, are filtered through the minds of historians whose writing is  inevitably colored by their own conscious or unconscious prejudices. That of  course raises the question: what hidden agenda was Fletcher promoting in  writing this book?  </P> <P> The answer lurks between the lines of almost every page of this book. Fletcher  is a proponent of global culture, the notion that men and women all over the  world are basically alike, and that the concept of uniquely national cultures  is a dangerous and outdated idea. He loathes Ramon Menendez-Pidal's "La Espana  del Cid" precisely because it is, in Azorin's words, "a wonderful lesson in  patriotism." The fact that Franco exploited Menendez-Pidal's portrayal of the  Cid as the embodiment of the unique and admirable qualities of the Castilian  spirit makes that image all the more odious and deserving of deflation.  </P> <P> Fletcher cannot avoid the fact that the Spanish people have been notoriously  resistant to the imposition of a central political authority, but he argues  that "this is not owning to any stubborn streak of cussedness or pride in the  Spanish character. It arises simply from the size and physical conformation of  the Peninsula." The fact is that other, larger nations divided by more  formidable physical barriers have in fact developed a very strong sense of  national unity. As the tourist posters used to remind us, "Spain is different,"  and it is different in much the same ways that the Muslim world is different.  </P> <P> Fletcher argues that the Poema largely responsible for creating the myth of the  Cid was written during the turbulent reign of Alfonso VIII, when the kingdom  was imperiled by "those who put sectional interest before the common good, who  neglected their Christian patriotism and forgot their duties to the king. The  poet reminded his compatriots of where their responsibilities lay." If that  were true, why would the poet have portrayed Alfonso VI in such a negative  manner? Why the famous refrain, which Spaniards have had reason to repeat all  too often in their later history: "God, what a good vassal, if only he had a  good lord!" Fletcher quotes Dozy's description of the Cid as "more Muslim than  Catholic" -- a statement which has far-reaching implications, but which he does  not choose to pursue.  </P> <P> The uniqueness of Spanish culture derives from the coexistence during seven  centuries of Christians, Muslims, and Jews -- unlike anything that occurred  anywhere else in Europe. Fletcher argues that "the most striking feature about  (Spanish) Christendom's reaction to Islam was incomprehension. At least, that  is what we would call it today.  </P> <P> Early medieval Christians would have been scandalized to have their reactions  characterized in this manner, but we live today in an atmosphere of religious  pluralism." It is hard to imagine any other time or place history more  characterized by religious pluralism than medieval Spain. The tragedy is that  that rich pluralism was ultimately destroyed. Perhaps the most important lesson  we can learn from medieval Spanish history is not that cultural differences are  illusory or unimportant, as Fletcher seems to suggest, but rather that there is  much of value to be gained from a unity founded on respect for diversity.  </P> <P> Nominees In History  </P> <P> AWASH IN A SEA OF FAITH; Christianizing the American People by Jon Butler  (Harvard University Press)  </P> <P> ITALY AND ITS MONARCHY by Denis Mack Smith (Yale University Press)  </P> <P> A PEACE TO END ALL PEACE; Creating the Modern Middle East, 1914-1922 by David  Fromkin (Henry Holt)  </P> <P> THE QUEST FOR EL CID by Richard Fletcher (Alfred A.

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: FCC forecasts significant turnround PEAK US timber prices, a sharply lower Canadian dollar and strengthening demand for most papers are bringing back some optimism in the battered Canadian forest products industry. A restructured Fletcher Challenge Canada, the first integrated group to report for the final quarter of 1992, says a significant turnround is under way. The company is 72 per cent-owned by Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand. In the second quarter to December 31, it lost CDollars 4.8m (USDollars 3.2m), or 6 cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 17.2m, or 28 cents, a year earlier which included a CDollars 35m net gain on an asset sale. Sales were CDollars 263m, against CDollars 250m. The first-half loss was CDollars 23.6m, or 30 cents a share, against a small profit equal to 1 cent a share a year earlier after the special gain. Sales were CDollars 470m, against CDollars 502m. The figures mask a significant turnround, said the company. For instance, newsprint shipments in the second quarter were up 49 per cent and coated papers 11 per cent. Overall, the industry is expected to post total losses of nearly CDollars 1bn for all 1992, against a loss of CDollars 2.5bn in 1991. It shipped 75 per cent of its products to the US. Price increases are likely in the second quarter of 1993 and inventories will tighten. Timber prices have soared with rising US housing starts and some mills are calling back workers to raise output.</p>

The radio of the Bosnian Croat state of Herceg-Bosna said on  Saturday that Moslem forces in the region of Kiseljak, Kresevo  and [word indistinct] continue violating the ceasefire agreement  by opening mortar and infantry fire on Croat positions.    The radio said that the situation in the other Moslem-Croat  fronts was somewhat quieter but that the Moslem army continues  reinforcing its positions, regrouping and bringing in fresh  troops.    The Zagreb-based Croatian radio, however, said that on  Saturday afternoon the Croat part of the Herzegovina city of  Mostar was hit by a shell fired from the Moslem positions, after  which a general alert was sounded.    Moslem Sarajevo radio claims that Croat snipers in Mostar  continue firing on the separation line and civilian facilties in  the Moslem-controlled part of the city.    According to the radio, in the southern parts of Mostar, the  Croats are torching the remaining Moslem homes to prevent their  owners from returning.    The Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who have been fiercly  clashing in central and southwest Bosnia since last spring, are  continuing their battles despite a draft agreement on a  Moslem-Croat federation in this ex-Yugoslav republic which was  signed early this month in Washington under strong U.S. pressure.    The military part of this agreement was on Saturday signed  by  the commanders of the Moslem and Croat forces, Rasim Delic and  Ante Roso.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Reebok results fall below Wall Street expectations REEBOK International, the US sports shoe maker, yesterday posted disappointing earnings for the third quarter and warned that its fourth-quarter results would trail earlier projections. Net income for the quarter advanced to Dollars 74.4m, or 80 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 863.2m, from Dollars 66.2m, or 71 cents, on sales of Dollars 764.3m a year earlier. Most analysts had expected earnings of about 83 cents a share in the latest quarter. The results were released after Wall Street's close, but shares in Reebok were unavailable for late trading yesterday. The stock closed at Dollars 29, up Dollars  5/8 on the day. Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said the company had cut its expected full-year earnings from operations to a range of Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 2.55 a share from earlier estimates of Dollars 2.70 to Dollars 2.85. Although sales of Reebok and Rockport brands increased in the quarter, sales of Ellesse and AVIA fell sharply. Ellesse sales dropped to Dollars 12.2m from Dollars 20.4m, while AVIA lost 22.4 per cent to Dollars 36.4m.</p>

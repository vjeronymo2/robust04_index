			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY OFFERS PLAN TO EASE OBSTETRICAL SYSTEM CHAOS;  </P> <P> MEDI-CAL: PRIVATE HOSPITALS WOULD BE PAID DIRECTLY FOR SERVICES AS PART OF  PROPOSAL TO EASE OVERCROWDING.  </P> <P> In a novel program, Los Angeles County health officials have joined forces with  the private sector in a plan to divert thousands of pregnant women to private  hospitals to ease the tremendous overcrowding of the county's obstetrical  system.  </P> <P> In exchange, the county has offered to cut Medi-Cal red tape for private  hospitals and doctors by paying them directly for their services, then claiming  reimbursement from the state under Medi-Cal guidelines. The plan also offers  the incentives of filling empty obstetrical beds at some of the private  hospitals, and of bringing some order to the current chaos in obstetrics.  </P> <P> So far, 21 private hospitals -- which collectively can provide about 300  additional obstetrical spaces per month -- have agreed to participate. If all  goes well, officials say the plan could be implemented within two months.  </P> <P> Virtually every hospital, public and private, is struggling with the problem of  women showing up in labor in their emergency rooms without a doctor or any  record of prenatal care. Overcrowding in the county health-care system -- from  neighborhood health centers to the county's five hospitals with obstetrical  services -- is largely to blame.  </P> <P> Things were so bad one Saturday last month at the county's Harbor-UCLA Medical  Center in Torrance that an exhausted staff obstetrician simply stopped  admitting patients, even as they arrived at the hospital in labor. Instead, he  handed them road maps, saying they would be better off delivering their babies  elsewhere. Private hospitals in the area were marked on the maps.  </P> <P> Embarrassed hospital administrators quickly declared the doctor's actions to be  contrary to policy, and said no such diversion of patients would be attempted  again, no matter how busy things were in the obstetrical unit.  </P> <P> But Dr. Charles Brinkman, Harbor-UCLA's chief of obstetrics, will not guarantee  that is possible.  </P> <P> "It is a judgment about whether the conditions are safe," he said. "We are  running at 130% above our designed capacity. We are staffed for 17 deliveries a  day and are routinely hitting 25 to 35 a day. . . . The staff here are heroes  in my eyes, and I am really upset that the community hasn't helped us out."  </P> <P> The plan being formulated is just such a community effort, which is what makes  it unique, local officials and the American Hospital Assn. say. Besides the  county Department of Public Health, the major players are the Los Angeles  County Medical Assn. and the Hospital Council of Southern California.  </P> <P> "We saw the crisis coming. We can see very clearly that the county is over  capacity," said David Langness, the council's vice president for community  relations. "What we are attempting to do is apportion out the overflow births  from the county system to the private hospitals that are willing and able to  deliver."  </P> <P> The plan has two goals: to provide for the orderly use of existing hospital  facilities for deliveries and to get women into care early in their pregnancies  so they and their babies have the best chance.  </P> <P> For the program to work, planners say, staff doctors at these hospitals must  also be willing to participate. The medical association has given the health  department the names of nearly 5,000 private obstetricians, pediatricians,  anesthesiologists and family practitioners, all specialists involved at some  point in the care of pregnant women and the safe delivery of their babies.  </P> <P> The county mailed contracts to the doctors on the association's list earlier  this month, accompanied by a letter of endorsement from medical association  President David Chernof. It is still too early to predict how many will sign  up, he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, county health officials are negotiating with Medi-Cal authorities  for approval of the plan's financial aspects. Both sides say agreement is near.  </P> <P> Early prenatal care has not been an option for many poor women in Los Angeles  County, particularly as the public health care system has seen its funding  reduced while the number of people depending upon it for care has increased.  The burden in obstetrics is especially acute because few private obstetricians  are willing to accept Medi-Cal insured patients. This is a major factor in the  current imbalance, with five county hospitals handling a crushing load of the  county's 190,000 annual births while obstetrical units in some private  hospitals have empty beds.  </P> <P> Too much paperwork, slow reimbursement and outright refusal of claims are the  reasons most cited by doctors and hospitals for washing their hands of Medi-Cal  -- and the poor patients it serves. Last June, Medi-Cal stopped paying its  bills altogether because of legislative delay on a supplemental appropriation.  The program resumed payments in July, but the incident was yet another black  mark on a record that already made the program a tough sell to health-care  providers.  </P> <P> There is a hitch, though. Medi-Cal requires hospitals receiving its money to  offer a full range of care to publicly insured patients, not only single  services such as obstetrics. Of the 130 hospitals in Los Angeles County, 70  have Medi-Cal contracts, not enough to make the obstetrical program work. Few  outside the system want to join, but a good number of these are willing to help  out in a limited fashion in the obstetrics area, according to Langness.  </P> <P> Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia is one. Its president,  Frederick C. Meyer, said the pressure to join the obstetrical safety net came  from doctors on the staff who knew of the "terrible overcrowding" at nearby  County-USC Medical Center.  </P> <P> When the Hospital Council of Southern California pitched the cooperative plan,  he readily signed up. His hospital also stands to make some money, since it's  obstetrics unit is under-used.  </P> <P> The county medical association's Chernof, who has brought single-minded  enthusiasm to the project, confesses to some dismay at how long it has taken to  put the plan together. His involvement began last September. He worries that  the incident at Harbor-UCLA, however unsanctioned, may scare hospitals and  doctors who might otherwise participate in the program, undermining trust in  the county's ability to refer overflow patients in an orderly manner.  </P> <P> Carl Williams, Los Angeles County's administrator for hospitals, worries about  the imminent possibility of another overload at Harbor-UCLA or Olive View  Medical Center in Sylmar or Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in  South-Central Los Angeles. Of the five county hospitals with obstetrical  services, these are the busiest.  </P> <P> "The triage system (a means of referring less-urgent cases) is what we need to  do right away," he said. "But we recognize that that is not the best solution  long term. The other part of this is the better way to avoid these situations  building up in the county hospitals in the first place."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting  was held at the Grand People's Study House Friday to mark the  550th anniversary of the creation of Hunminjongum (Korean  alphabet).    The meeting was attended by Yi Chong-ok, Politburo member of  the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and  vice-president, Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the Central  Committee of the WPK, and officials concerned.    The Korean alphabet created on the basis of the Sinji  letters  which had been used by Koreans for thousands of years was  proclaimed in 1444.    In his report at the meeting, Vice-premier of the  Administration Council Chang Chol said the Korean alphabet is a  set of national letters worthy of praise, which reflect the  creative wisdom and resourcefulness of the Korean people, and a  valuable asset and cultural heritage of the nation that holds a  particular position in the development of written languages of  the world.    Turning to the advantages of the Korean alphabet, Chang Chol  said it is scientific theoretically and orderly in structure and  system, it fully reflects the characteristics and richness of  the sound and easy to learn and write.    "With the creation of the Korean alphabet, the Korean people  came to have a means of writing suited to the national  characteristics of the mother tongue and a powerful weapon in  the cause of transforming nature and society," he said.    He recalled that during their occupation of Korea in the  past, the Japanese imperialists forced the Koreans to change  their names to Japanese style and speak and write in Japanese in  everyday life in order to obliterate the Korean language and  letters as well as the Korean nation.    "This was the most heinous crime never to be condoned and a  beastly act without precedent in history," the reporter said.    "Under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, darkness and illiteracy were dispelled, the  anti-popular system of writing demolished and a new system of  writing based on national independence established, so the  Korean people, who were far removed from modern civilization,  have become the true masters and users of the written and spoken  languages," he said. "The idea and guidance of the great leader  to develop the national language on the basis of chuche and  improve it are being successfully carried forward by the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il today."    He said the treacherous acts of the Kim Yong-sam puppet  clique to obliterate the mother tongue in league with the U.S.  imperialists can never be pardoned because they are aimed at  keeping the Korean nation divided into two forever.    "In order to smash the moves to obliterate the national  language on the part of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges  in South Korea, all the Koreans who love the country and the  nation must rise as one in the struggle to prevent a permanent  division of the nation and achieve a unified development, be  they in the North or in the South or overseas, be they  communists or nationalists," stressed the reporter.</p>

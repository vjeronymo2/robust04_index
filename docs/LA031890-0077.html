			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DETOX CENTERS' FOR 'ELECTRICAL ABUSE'?  </P> <P> Your article on use of electrical stimulation to relax seemed too good to be  true. Maybe it is ("Getting Wired for Relaxation," March 6).  </P> <P> A couple of questions come to mind. What does electrical stimulation  chronically do to the body? Will we be developing a generation of electrical  junkies who require a 20-minute zap to feel their best? Already, one week after  Cloris Leachman purchased an Alpha-Stim unit, she "won't leave home without"  it. Will there be a rebound loss in one's normal alpha state when the  artificial stimulation is discontinued?  </P> <P> Please note that the units are FDA approved for pain relief, not relaxation.  </P> <P> Hopefully, these questions will be answered before usage becomes commonplace. I  can already envision commercials for detox centers to treat electrical abuse.  </P> <P> DR. ROBERT W. EITCHES, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Median's Survey Commissioned by </F> MAGYAR HIRLAP -- Popularity of Party List Leaders"]    [Text] Commissioned by MAGYAR HIRLAP, the Median Public  Opinion and Market Research Institute regularly examines the  popularity of the parties' list leaders and people's familiarity  with them.    The change at the top of the popularity of list leaders  "only" affects the order: The three-point decrease of Gyula  Horn's [chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP]  popularity is not statistically significant, but it is enough  for Janos Palotas [chairman of the Republic Party], who  continues to enjoy broad popularity, to get into the first  position.    Since the Median's previous survey, familiarity with Gabor  Kuncze [parliamentary group leader and prime ministerial  candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] has  increased significantly (from 64 to 70 percent). In addition to  being more familiar with people, he has also become more popular  during the time between the two surveys. In addition to him,  the views on Tamas Nagy [chairman of the Agrarian Federation],  Jozsef Torgyan [chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party,  FKGP], and Istvan Csurka [cochairman of the Hungarian Justice  and Life Party, MIEP] improved more than the accidental  deviations.    The election campaign that has now started is making an  impact because, between January and February, the electors have  become more informed about which party the various politicians  belong to. The change can be observed in the case of list  leaders whose party affiliation is still not well known (the  proportion of people who correctly named the party affiliation  of Csurka increased from 35 percent to 40 percent, Zoltan Kiraly  [chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary] from 19 to  24 percent, Kuncze from 36 to 45 percent, and Tamas Nagy from 17  to 21 percent). The proportion did not change in the case of  list leaders whose party affiliation is well known and of Laszlo  Surjan [chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party,  KDNP] and Palotas, therefore, the data also indicate, what  proportion of the population takes party aspects into  consideration when assessing the politicians.    The popularity averages naturally mainly depend on the  electors' party sympathies. Out of the list leaders of parties  that have a significant voting basis, Horn has the highest  appreciation by his party's supporters: Horn's popularity index  is 91 points among these people, while it is 45 points among the  smallholders who like him the least. Surjan was given 87 points  by his party's supporters and the MSZP supporters gave him 49  points. Viktor Orban's [chairman of the Federation of Young  Democrats, Fidesz] popularity with the Fidesz camp is 84 points  and 46 points with the smallholder supporters. Torgyan is only  really acceptable for the FKGP's supporters: They gave him 84  points while he reached the second highest rating (30 points)  with the Hungarian Democratic Forum's [MDF] supporters. [Prime  Minister] Peter Boross is more popular with the government  supproters and the opposition feels antipathy toward him (MDF:  79 points, KDNP: 69 points, FKGP: 55 points, Fidesz: 47  points, SZDSZ: 45 points, and MSZP: 40 points). Increasing  familiarity with Kuncze is also indicated by the fact that while  his popularity index was only 71 points within his own party's  supporters in January, the SZDSZ's supporters gave him 79 points  in February. Kuncze was able to improve his rating mainly with  those people who have not yet decided which party they will vote  for: His popularity index improved by 11 percent among these  people.    Boross, Csurka, Surjan, Torgyan, Palotas, and Orban have  better ratings in the villages than with Budapest people. Horn  is most popular with people in provincial towns while the  popularity of Kiraly, Kuncze, and Nagy do not show much  difference according to the living place of people.    Surjan, Palotas, Orban, Nagy, Kiraly, and Boross are more  popular with women, while Torgyan is rejected less by men than  by women. Surjan (and his party) is most popular with women over  the age of 60: In this age group, women rate him 16 points  higher than men.    Boross's and Surjan's popularity increases parallel with the  age increase of the voters while Orban's decreases. Horn's  popularity among people between the ages of 50 and 58 is 18  points higher than in other age groups. Kiraly, Kuncze, and  Palotas are somewhat less popular among the youngest and oldest  generation than otherwise.    The popularity index of the list leaders is also connected  to  the educational level of the voters. The educational level  fundamentally influences people's habits of acquiring  information: University graduates gain their information from  many and diverse sources while less well educated people mainly  do this from the electronic media. Therefore, it is not  surprising that politicians who have often and extensively  appeared on television and radio are more popular among people  with a low educational level, while the relatively less  well-known Kuncze who can be found more in the written media is  more popular among people with high qualifications. This is made  more complicated by the fact that the popularity of left-wing  politicians (Horn and Kiraly) does not depend on the educational  level of the electors.    The proportion of those who would welcome the various list  leaders at the head of the new government after the elections  has not changed significantly, except in the case of Palotas  because -- although he took over leadership of the popularity  list -- fewer people wanted to see him as prime minister in  February than in January.</p>

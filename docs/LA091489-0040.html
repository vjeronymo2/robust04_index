			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> PREFERENCES IN STREET SIGNS  </P> <P> Looking over samples of street signs in their chambers, City Council members  expressed their preferences Tuesday about a purchase that is expected to cost  $160,000.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds frowned at what she called the "post-modern" look  of one sign, die-cut to echo a motif of the new City Hall complex. "This isn't  where we want to spend our money," she said. "What we're after is readability.  And it will look dated after a few years."  </P> <P> But while Reynolds said she wanted a simpler design, she also said that instead  of the palm tree that graced another model, she would prefer the city seal  under an arch that would fit over the sign.  </P> <P> Councilman Bernard J. Hecht said he preferred the die-cut City Hall motif.  Mayor Max Salter favored dropping "street" and "avenue" designations in favor  of larger lettering and a clear indication of the block number.  </P> <P> The mayor instructed Environmental Services Director Mark Scott to prepare two  new samples that would incorporate the council members' preferences. In an  interview after Tuesday's study session, Scott said the city's art director had  worked on the signs. No outside designers had been consulted, he said.  </P> <P> City officials said they had not decided when to install the new street signs.  </P></p>

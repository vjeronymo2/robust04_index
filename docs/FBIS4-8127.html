			<p>BFN     [Text] Our Skopje correspondent Takis Dhiamandis has  reported that the Defense Ministry of Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] has denied reports about  an alleged concentration of Greek armed forces along its  northwest borders. These reports have been circulating for the  past few days. Moreover, it was one of the issues Skopjean  President Kiro Gligorov raised in his interview with the French  newspaper LE MONDE.    Tension was noticed in Skopje last night after reports began  coming from Gevgelija, which is near the border, about the  movement of a Greek tank column. The Defense Ministry of Skopje  issued a statement late last night that stressed that these  reports are not consonant with the facts.</p>

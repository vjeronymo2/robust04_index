			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Amato shuffles cards to his advantage: The Italian prime minister's limited cabinet changes may still help his credibility THE weekend reshuffle of the Italian cabinet is a classic example of the time-worn dictum that politics is the art of the possible. Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, wanted to use the opportunity presented by the enforced resignation of his health and finance ministers to carry out a broad reshaping of the government. However, the Socialist prime minister came up against the firm opposition of the Christian Democrat leadership, the dominant partners in the four-party coalition, and the refusal of other parties outside the government to join in. As a result he was obliged to carry out a lesser game of musical chairs  - swapping portfolios and bringing in three new faces. Nevertheless, the new 25-person cabinet reflects Mr Amato's desire to press ahead with budgetary austerity and recover some of the lost momentum in the plans for privatisation. Meanwhile, the all-important issue of electoral reform and institutional change remains in the hands of the parliamentary parties. Mr Amato had sought a cabinet shake-up as early as February 10, when Mr Claudio Martelli was forced to resign as the Socialist justice minister because of his alleged involvement in the corruption scandal. Although Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, gave the prime minister his full backing, he insisted on a mere replacement to Mr Martelli. Mr Amato then showed his independence by choosing a 'technocrat' judge, Mr Giovanni Conso, instead of turning to the ranks of the Socialist party, who wished to see their balance of ministers retained. Following Friday's resignations of the finance and health ministers, Mr Amato again floated the idea of a broad reshuffle to give new legitimacy to a cabinet tainted by corruption scandals. This was opposed by elements in his own Socialist party and by the Christian Democrats, afraid a big reshuffle would leave him with too much autonomy, allowing him to emerge as the country's uncontested leader. Mr Amato was seen as a servant of the party bosses when brought in last June. But even without such autonomy, the government leader has managed to strengthen his economic team by switching Mr Franco Reviglio from the Budget to the Finance Ministry and bringing in Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the most distinguished economist in the Christian Democrat camp, to the Budget portfolio. He has also finessed the refusal of Mr Giuseppe Guarino to leave the Industry Ministry where he was blocking privatisation, by appointing Mr Paolo Baratta, a technocrat banker, to a new portfolio specifically dealing with privatisation. Mr Amato has also done well to place the no-nonsense Liberal, Mr Raffaele Costa, in the Health Ministry, where his skills will be needed to sell reforms of the health and pensions systems. At a broader level the reshuffle has demonstrated that, no matter how much the Amato government has been weakened by the recent resignations and the accumulated effects of the corruption scandals sweeping the country, the political parties can see no immediate alternative. Indeed, this was the first reshuffle in the post-war era carried out with an eye on the financial markets. The discussions lasted little more than 24 hours and were complete by Sunday in order to present the markets with the outcome when they reopened. This explicit recognition that government crises have to be resolved within hours, not the leisurely weeks of previous years, is an important change. The threat of a plunging lira and its consequent impact on inflation forced a solution. The other lesson from the reshuffle centres on the gradual shift of power away from the party bosses. They have traditionally treated cabinets as their servants. Mr Amato remains beholden to the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals who comprise his coalition. But they also rely upon his credibility, his political skills and the backing he is being given by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The new cabinet now contains 10 people who are either technicians or only loosely affiliated to parties. No other Italian postwar cabinet has had such a non-political complexion. At a moment when the ruling parties have lost so much legitimacy as a result of the corruption scandals, Mr Amato is hoping this will help his credibility in the difficult days ahead.</p>

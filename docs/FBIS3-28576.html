			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Washington, YONHAP] </F>   [Text] A high-ranking official from the North Korean UN  mission said today that North Korea does not want a war to break  out on the Korean peninsula over the nuclear issue. The  official stressed that North Korea has been very patient with  the nuclear issue but that North Korea will not shrink but be  resolute [turyoum opsi tangdanghage taehalkosirago] because its  existence is at stake.    The official from the North Korean UN mission, however,  warned that if a war should break out, it will not be a  repetition of the Gulf war situation in which Iraq suffered.    In connection with the UN sanctions, the official said that  although North Korea is having difficulties [pirok oryopkinun  hana], it has been living without help from the United States,  Japan, and Russia, and warned that even a worm resists when  trampled upon. He did not make a negative statement about  China, supporting the speculation that North Korea has had close  contacts with Beijing over the nuclear issue.    The official said that he has no knowledge of the reported  possibility of a behind-the-scenes contact between the United  States and North Korea this week prior to the International  Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors meeting.</p>

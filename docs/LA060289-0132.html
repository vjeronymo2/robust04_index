			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRADUATES HAVE DESIGNS ON MARKETABILITY  </P> <P> Two fashion design programs, at Woodbury University and Santa Monica College,  finished the school year with graduating-student shows last week. And the  audiences were impressed.  </P> <P> "You know," said one viewer at the Woodbury event, "I saw a lot of clothes I  could go out and buy, if they were sold in a store." That sentiment was  prevalent throughout the crowd, and it may be the ultimate compliment to any  student designer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reasonable Interpretations  </P> <P> Part of the reason may have been that many of the garments were reasonable  interpretations of looks by cutting-edge designers from the United States and  abroad.  </P> <P> Cecelia Pham, who won a prize for her custom-quality tailoring and another for  her sportswear designs, showed a cocoa suede dress trimmed with black  passementerie that would look at home in a posh, Beverly Hills boutique.  </P> <P> Before she decided on fashion as a career, Pham spent three years as a nuclear  reactor operator at Oregon State. Some of that precision and attention to  detail shows up in her design work.  </P> <P> Mona Momtaz carried off three awards from Woodbury in the contemporary, evening  and flashback (retro fashion) categories. Her black-and-white houndstooth-check  dress, trimmed in glossy black fur, looked inspired by Bill Blass. And her  black velvet minidress with hooded, velvet cape, encrusted with faux jewels and  gold tassels, was clearly a homage to Christian Lacroix.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Winning Look  </P> <P> As was Bonnie McAllister's frolicsome can-can dress in orange and hot pink. But  her winning look was in the burlap category, for which she created a farm-girl  outfit. Oversize burlap overalls went with a red-and-white polka-dot top.  </P> <P> Gasps and spontaneous applause filled the room when Linh-Xuan Nguyen's bridal  gown came down the runway. The bubbly Nguyen, a Vietnam native, fashioned a  dress with definite cowgirl influences, down to the beaded, silver fringe.  </P> <P> In Woodbury's best-of-the-show category, the winner was J-Me K (a hip moniker  that's pronounced "Jamie K"), whose clothes seem in sync with Paris designer  Jean Paul Gaultier's irreverent approach to fashion. K's cheeky bridal gown was  replete with recycled soda-can tabs, including the bra top. More interlocking  tabs tinkled like wind chimes against an ivory chiffon skirt. It was chosen, a  school spokeswoman explained, based on creativity and salability. Some in the  audience seemed unconvinced. "Only Cher could wear that dress," one observer  said.  </P> <P> Rounding out the winners at Woodbury, Stacy Seeds got honors in the "cultural  exchange" category for a pewter-colored pants outfit with draped pants and  bolero jacket, inspired by Middle Eastern folk costumes.  </P> <P> The next evening, at the Santa Monica College school of fashion design and  merchandising, two elements stole the show -- the children's clothes and the  young models themselves. The self-conscious pre-adolescents mimicked runway  models, and the shy, rosy-cheeked toddlers earned their own round of applause.  </P> <P> So did the refined styles of Irene Raskin, whose work took a prize in the  contemporary category. She showed a winsome navy dress with lace collar. Other  winning looks included Katherine Dyer's red wool coats that evoked images of  English grade school. Kristine Beck's sassy play clothes would likely be a hit  among preteens. She won an award in the menswear and children's wear category.  </P> <P> Santa Monica's best-of-show winners were Kristine Beck and Tommy Shenker. But  Shenker's reworking of the little black dress did little to convey why the  judges felt he was a star in his field. And Becks' floral and black ensembles  were pleasant, but not obviously outstanding.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Carlo Gholami's beautifully cut clothes for both sexes --  especially his double-breasted, glen plaid jacket with matching miniskirt --  showed the strong influence of his idol, Giorgio Armani, and marked him as a  definite comer in the industry. He won a number of prizes, including first  place in menswear and children's wear and second place in the evening and  career categories.  </P></p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (20): The atmosphere warms up / Assessing Poland's foreign policy POLES understand the importance of diplomacy and foreign policy. Living in a flat country surrounded by Russians and Germans, their history has taught them to take relations with their more powerful neighbours - and events further afield - very seriously. This is one reason why Mr Krzysztof Skubiszewski, the 67 year old former international law professor from the Poznan academy of sciences, has become the Talleyrand of post-communist Poland. Five governments have come and gone, but the urbane Skubiszewski has soldiered on as foreign minister throughout, giving Polish diplomacy a continuity lacking in other areas. His steady hand on the tiller has helped steer Poland through a period of breathtaking change since demolition of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and Moscow's adoption of the 'Sinatra doctrine.' Moscow's benign indifference to the fate of its former satellites completely changed the context in which Poland found itself. On Poland's western border the re-unification of Germany has taken place in circumstances which guarantee that Germany will be largely self-absorbed for years. But it also opens up new prospects for cross-border co-operation, following signature of the Polish-German treaty which guarantees the Oder-Neisse border line and marks formal Germany acceptance of the loss of most of former Pomerania and Prussia. To the north, the end of the cold war offers hope for co-operation across the Baltic, while relations with newly divorced Slovakia and the Czech republic in the south are problem free - and institutionalised, to a degree, by moves towards freer trade under the auspices of the Visegrad accord between the central European states. It is on the east that the biggest changes have taken place. No longer hemmed in by a monolithic Soviet state, Warsaw can now deal with a patchwork quilt of small or medium sized nations similar to western Europe. Poland's only physical contact with Russian territory is along the southern borders of the Kaliningrad enclave. Elsewhere it now borders Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine, all independent states with whom it is once again possible to have 'normal' political, economic and trading links. 'For the first time in over three centuries we no longer have a huge neighbour to our east. This means that we can once again have an active eastern policy. Thanks to our experience in political and economic transformation we feel that we have lot to give our neighbours and to Russia itself,' Mr Skubiszewski explains. 'They especially need help in creating the institutions of a modern state and a market economy. We can help them in this respect.' While relishing Poland's new-found freedom of action, Mr Skubiszewski constantly underlines Poland's sense of belonging to western Europe. 'For Poland, eventual full membership of an enlarged European Community is the solution for our future. The established nations of western Europe could perhaps survive without the EC. But Poland is a state whose existence was eliminated for over 150 years. Membership of the EC would make us feel safe,' he explains. Membership of the EC is so important to Poland that the outgoing government appointed Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, a former prime minister, as minister for relations with Europe. He was charged partly with raising Poland's profile in Brussels, but also to ensure that Poland's laws and institutions change in conformity with EC practice. But the EC's mishandling of the Yugoslav crisis, the narrowly-focused, nit-picking reality of EC trade negotiations, member states' delay in ratifying the Association Agreements with Poland and other post-communist states, and what Mr Skubiszewski gently chides as 'a tendency in the west to wash their hands of the complexity of post-communist transformation and an obsession with stability', has led to a more critical approach in recent months. 'We want co-operation with the EC in reaching common political decisions, not just a dialogue,' Mr Skubiszewski adds. With the Copenhagen summit in mind, the foreign minister recently accompanied President Lech Walesa to Portugal. This was part of an effort to persuade the EC's southern European members that amending the Association Agreements to grant central Europe greater EC market access to sensitive products such as steel, textiles and food products should not be seen as a threat, but as an opportunity for increased trade in both directions. Poland's drive for full integration into the EC ultimately reflects a demand for recognition that, to all intents and purposes, the real border between the 'west' and eastern Europe now runs down Poland's eastern frontier. This was underlined last month when Warsaw, after months of negotiations with Bonn, agreed to stricter passport, visa and other controls along Poland's eastern and southern borders, and to turn back would-be illegal immigrants before they could reach Germany and fall foul of Bonn's tighter asylum laws. 'We understood Germany's difficulties and reached a reasonable agreement. It imposes upon us the duty to watch out for those who come from the east, not just former Soviet citizens but also Romanians, Bulgarians and others hoping to slip in through Ukraine.' In co-operating with Germany in this matter, Mr Skubiszewski adds: 'Poland showed that it regards the problem of immigration as a European problem which is therefore also our problem.' But the influx of east Europeans into Poland also shows how three years of often painful economic reforms have turned Poland itself into a land of hope and economic opportunity for millions of east Europeans from the former Soviet Union. Controls on the border have been tightened. Many Poles can still remember recent times when they were just like the impoverished traders and job seekers from further east who now crowd Poland's outdoor markets or busk in the city squares. This ensures that there is still a humanity about Polish relations with its poorer neighbours  -alongside the determination to be treated as an equal by the west.</p>

In particular, the  National Unification Board and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  have greatly different views on the following issues: The  importance of North-South dialogue regarding the third DPRK-U.S.  talks, the form of the North- South dialogue, the announcement  date for the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, and the  government's attitude regarding public relations.    In the 18 February seminar to greet the 2d anniversary of  the  effectuation of the "North-South Basic Agreement," Yi Yong-tok,  deputy prime minister and chairman of the national unification  board, stressed that "the third DPRK-U.S. talks would be held  only if there is significant progress in North-South dialogue,"  and that "through an exchange of special envoys, in particular,  North Korea should discuss the following issues, such as its  return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, its resumption of  ad hoc [imsi] or ordinary [tongsang] inspections by the IAEA,  and the simultaneous inspections of the North and South."    Before returning to Seoul after he visited the United  States,  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said, however, that "we cannot  deny the importance of North-South dialogue, but it may be  unhelpful to the settlement of the issues pending between the  North and South in the light of the settlement of the North  Korean nuclear issue."    The two ministers have the same opinions regarding the  importance of North-South dialogue. However, Foreign Minister  Han has stressed that the settlement of the nuclear issue can be  delayed if we attach too much importance to progress in the  North-South dialogue, while Deputy Prime Minister Yi has said  that a certain progress must be made in the North-South dialogue  to resolve it.    Regarding the resumption of the North-South dialogue, they  also have a different view on the form of dialogue. Song  Yong-tae, vice minister of the National Unification Board,  stressed in his 17 February news interview with reporters that  "the North-South dialogue must be carried out in the form of the  exchange of special envoys."    While he was in Canada, Foreign Minister Han said that "he  would not care if the North-South dialogue is carried out in the  form of the exchange of special envoys, or in the form of a  meeting of the North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee, or  in the form of the North-South high-level talks, if they are  intended to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue."    They have also different views of the announcement date of  the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise. In a Television  interview on the morning of 20 February, Vice Foreign Minister  Hong Sung-yong has set the concrete date for the conditional  suspension of the Team Spirit exercise by saying that "the  government would announce the conditional suspension of the Team  Spirit exercise at the time of the IAEA inspection team members'  arrival in North Korea and when the North and South resume their  working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys."    However, Deputy Prime Minister Yi said on 18 February that  "the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit exercise will be  determined depending on the result of the IAEA's inspection and  the progress in the North-South dialogue for the exchange of  special envoys."    The attitude shown by the National Unification Board and the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs since North Korea has accepted the  nuclear inspections is very comparative. On the morning of 16  February -- the day the fact that North Korea accepted the  nuclear inspections was disclosed -- Vice Foreign Minister Hong  expressed the government's position on future policy direction  along with the detailed explanation of the process of nuclear  negotiations.    On the other hand, relevant responsible officials of the  National Unification Board did not express official commentary  regarding its position that day. It has been confirmed that a  relevant high-level official instructed them not to do so.  Although the fact that "a meeting on unification-related  strategy" was held on the morning of 17 February chaired by  Deputy Prime Minister Yi was disclosed by other ministries, the  National Unification Board has continued its secret  administrative business by saying that "it has never heard it."    Depending on the progress in the settlement of the North  Korean nuclear issue, the different views of the issues between  the National Unification Board and the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs are likely to be catalysts in creating discord between  the governmental ministries in charge of the issues of the  unification, security, national defense, and foreign diplomacy.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Spanish stocks falter on economic worries - But 1993 prospects may improve No-one could have scripted a more nerve-wracking scenario than the one facing Madrid's unhappy stockbrokers next week. For more than a year now, with the general index languishing mostly in the mid to low 200s, brokers have been desperately trying to convince clients that the market is cheap and that a major rebound is just around the corner. It has never come. Earlier this year the markets were stunned again by very bad inflation figures but the government seemed to have grasped the nettle in March when it published a rigorous plan to contain public spending and converge the economy with those of leading European Community member states. A few weeks later, however, data began to show a massive overshoot on public spending and the current account deficit, making it clear that spending targets contained in the convergence plan could not possibly be met this year. In June the Danes voted against the Maastricht treaty and foreign investors, the mainstay of the equity markets, began to desert in droves. The government, determined to try and keep the convergence plan on target, then sideswiped the market again, just before the August holiday, by announcing a tough fiscal package which included raising VAT and income tax, raising the amount retained on incomes, and a slew of cuts on 1992 ministerial budgets not already committed. Interest rates rose from 12.4 per cent to 13 per cent, but it was about then that the scale of French resistance to the Maastricht treaty began to become apparent; the peseta came under pressure. In a fair world, the 5 per cent devaluation of the currency forced on the Spaniards this week should have been the last straw. But no. Tomorrow the French vote on the Maastricht referendum and in the next few weeks Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, will inflict probably the meanest budget in 10 years of government by the Socialist Party. The market simply did not know what to do with the devaluation, so long resisted by the government and so often demanded by industry. On Thursday the index moved hardly at all, to close marginally down at 210.98. Yesterday, while the government was working hard not to raise interest rates and insisting that devaluation would put less than than half a percentage point on inflation, the index gained 3.99 to 214.93 on renewed hopes for a Yes vote in France. The market has risen 4 per cent on the week. What might the market do on Monday? In the worst case, and as far as the Spanish are concerned that means a No vote, brokers are preparing themselves for a fall. But even if the vote is a Yes, there is no guarantee that the market will behave any differently from the way it was behaving before the French referendum became an issue. Partly, this is because the scale of this year's deficits. Also, doubts about interest rate cuts have forced long bond yields upwards, close to short term yields; and the Treasury is to finance the bulk of the Dollars 17bn requirement for the rest of the year in short term paper, thus draining more liquidity from equities. Secondly, short-term interest rate uncertainty could hurt the rate sensitive but popular utility stocks. And the prospect of a tough budget (with public spending rising, possibly, no more than 5 per cent, down from the 8 per cent being suggested before the devaluation) will hurt already damaged construction and cement stocks. But if the peseta survives a No vote, and the government sticks to its budget 1993 is actually looking quite bright. For a start, the rise in VAT planned for 1993 was brought forward to last August. That, combined with the fact that the economy is slowing down so quickly now, with 1992 growth estimates having fallen from around 3 per cent to around 1.5 per cent, is more than likely to drive prices down and open the way for interest rate cuts next year. Even yesterday, the peseta was beginning to claw its way back, close to its new D-Mark parity of Pta68.42 after falling as low as Pta71.00 In the meantime, perfectly good stocks are still likely to be ignored. Spain's profitable big banks, by any measure, are cheap, with average price earnings ratios close to half of what they were in 1989. But the banks have huge capital adequacy ratios, about 14 on average, and have already provisioned about 4 per cent of their total loans. Construction stocks, the other favourite with foreign and local investors, will probably have to wait longer for a fulsome recovery as public spending limits are going to cut deep in spite of Madrid's commitment to continue infrastructural spending. Industrials are also likely to struggle to take advantage of devaluation, even although Spanish exports should be boosted by its effect. Industrial exports are low anyway, and with economic slowdown in the EC, Spain's biggest market, 5 per cent may not be enough to overcome the fact that very few companies  - Tudor, the battery maker, and the Campofrio processed meats group among others  - have well developed export networks.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Revamped SW Wood at Pounds 0.4m THE REVAMPED SW Wood group reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 425,000 in the half year to September 30, its first six months as a specialist printing and packaging business having abandoned a 20-year history of metal trading. The group made a Pounds 154,000 pre-tax loss in the same period last year - when it was reduced to a cash shell - before new management bought Riverside Packaging Printers in August and Grange Press, the lithographic printers, in January. Interim dividends are being restored via a 0.5p payment after a 1.9p loss per share was turned into earnings of 2p. Turnover was Pounds 5.7m compared with Pounds 2m. Mr Bryan Bedson, chief executive, said the printing and packaging sectors were proving resilient and the outlook for increased profits was good. Grange benefited from state-of-the-art technology, high productivity and a healthy reputation, despite its recent receivership as a subsidiary of the ailing RKF conglomerate. Mr Bedson led a management buy-out of Grange in February 1991. Grange could increase production quickly to meet any upturn in the economy and the likely boost it would give to the size of magazines as advertising increased. There was potential for significant growth at Riverside, which currently contributed 25 per cent of sales. Mr Peter James, business development director, said that while the group had Pounds 2m in cash reserves and was keen to make acquisitions in related businesses, it was proceeding carefully.</p>

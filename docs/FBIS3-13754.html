			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 20 Mar--In an interview published here  today, Defense Minister Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah  ruled out that the ministry would review or withdraw from  purchasing a number of U.S. Patriot missiles.    The defense minister's statement to the AL-ANBA' newspaper  followed reports on the dependence of the U.S. Army on new  missiles, cancelling its dependence on the Patriot in air  defense missions. The Kuwaiti defense minister clarified to the  newspaper that the new type of missiles were still being tested  for their effectiveness. He added that the upgraded Patriot  missile that was being used by the U.S. Army would be the same  type used by Kuwaiti forces.    Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah justified the delay in purchasing these  missiles and other types of armament and military equipment for  the forces by citing a delay in the approval of the military  budget. He also added that a reduction in the number of American  technicians working in the various army units came after they  had concluded their duties. He said they had completed their  business and that their contracts had ended in a normal manner.</p>

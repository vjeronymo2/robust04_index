			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Nuclear bribe trial opens THE trial has opened in Newark, New Jersey, of two US companies alleged by the Philippines government to have bribed former President Ferdinand Marcos to win a contract in the mid-1970s to build a nuclear power station. The two companies, Westinghouse Electric and Burns &amp; Roe, the engineering consultant, deny the charges. The civil action trial, brought by the Manila government, is being presided over by Judge Dickinson Debevoise, who heard nearly four years of arguments from the plaintiffs and defendants before committing the two companies for trial. The plaintiffs claim that a Dollars 17.5m commission paid to a Mr Herminio Disini, a Marcos family associate, was a bribe, with Mr Disini acting as a conduit to the late Philippines leader. Mr Disini, they allege, had little experience in the power business, and his main strength was his ability to influence the president. The defendants maintain the commission was legitimate and that Mr Disini had widespread business connections that would enable him to marshal the logistical support for the project. They had hoped to avoid a trial following the findings of an independent arbitration tribunal under the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva which reported in 1991 that it could find no evidence bribes had been paid. But Judge Debevoise argued the US court would not be bound by the tribunal finding, saying the ICC had disregarded the large body of circumstantial evidence he had been reviewing. The original jury trial was to have taken place a year ago, but in an out-of-court settlement Westinghouse agreed to revive and upgrade the mothballed plant and operate it for 30 years. However, the settlement collapsed when the new government of President Fidel Ramos found it could replace the 620 MW nuclear plant much more cheaply with conventional power stations.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PAC-10 TO TALK OF EXPANSION AT S.F. MEETING  </P> <P> Pacific 10 Conference athletic directors will be discussing expansion this  weekend in San Francisco because of Arkansas' decision to jump from the  Southwest Conference to the Southeastern Conference next year, Pac-10 spokesman  Jim Muldoon says.  </P> <P> University of Arizona Athletic Director Cedric Dempsey said the Pac-10 is ready  to look at its options.  </P> <P> "I feel that we would be negligent as a conference if we didn't explore what is  out there," Dempsey said. "We are headed toward the merging of conferences and  realignment on a national basis. It is important for the Pac-10 to stay in the  forefront."  </P> <P> San Diego State of the Western Athletic Conference reportedly has expressed  interest in joining the Pac-10. Arizona and San Diego State agreed last week to  renew their football series on a non-conference basis.  </P> <P> "I predict if we do what a lot of people are doing, there may be four or five  major conferences and a football playoff in the very near future," Dempsey  said.  </P></p>

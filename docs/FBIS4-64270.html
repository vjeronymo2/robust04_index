			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Parties Quarrel Over Number of </F> Bundeswehr Garrisons"]    [Text] The possible closure of Bundeswehr garrisons has  caused heated debates within the parties. The Defense Ministry  has rejected accusations that Defense Minister Ruehe was keeping  quiet about the number of garrisons to be closed. A ministry  spokesman explained yesterday that matters concerning deployment  of Army units would be considered "at the appropriate time."  But this can only happen after the completion of talks on the  basis of guidelines set down by Ruehe concerning the future  development of the Bundeswehr.    SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] defense expert  Erwin  Horn told BILD AM SONNTAG that Ruehe was not going to evade the  question of closures; nevertheless, probably as a result of  pressure from the coalition, smaller Bundeswehr garrisons will  be kept intact. Ruehe's concept is also based on the assumption  that some barracks consist of mere "janitors in uniform" who  maintain the facilities in poor condition.    Appearing on Sender Freies Berlin, FDP [Free Democratic  Party] general secretary Werner Hoyer warned against creating  unnecessary fears with the debate on garrisons. He called for a  statement as soon as possible about the number of garrisons to  be closed.    A working committee of the ruling parties will examine  Ruehe's concept, a very controversial one among the coalition,  on 17 May at the very earliest. Hoyer said he hoped "a tangible  preliminary result" would be achieved before parliament's summer  recess at the beginning of July.    During the working committee's talks, the FDP general  secretary also wants to discuss Ruehe's planned military service  period of 10 months for the main defense forces and 12 months  for the crisis reaction forces. He said he is ready to "broaden  his mind." Recruits undergoing basic military service should  belong to the crisis reaction forces only on a voluntary basis.  Only after receiving "top-class training" should they be sent  on front-line missions. Therefore it is quite sensible to  encourage them to serve longer than the statutory 12 months in  return for higher pay.    During the weekend, Bundeswehr chief inspector  Lieutenant-General Hartmut Bagger also made it clear that he had  not criticized Ruehe's suggestion of cutting military service  down to 10 months. It is not true, he said, that he considered  12-month military service "absolutely necessary."    Meanwhile, FDP deputy Guenter Nolting insisted that the  Bundeswehr should set up units that would react to critical  situations involving German hostages abroad just as fast as the  GSG-9 (border protection police) can react at home. The FDP  chairman of the parliamentary defense committee and chairman of  the FDP faction's working group for security policy told the  MITTELRHEINISCHE MORGENPOST that the Bundeswehr's current  reaction time of three days to events such as Rwanda is  definitely too long. This would affect German hostages abroad,  who are entitled to be liberated as quickly as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, the  president of the Republic, has received a personal message from  Iraqi President Saddam Husayn concerning developments in the UN  Security Council on the question of lifting the unjust blockade  imposed on Iraq.    This was announced by Iraqi Information Minister Yusuf  Hammadi, who delivered the message to Lt. Gen. 'Umar al-Bashir,  at a news conference held this evening at the Hilton Hotel.    The Iraqi minister, who is currently visiting the country,  added that he discussed with Lt. Gen. al-Bashir the possibility  of cooperation between the friendly and brotherly states to  achieve the lifting of the blockade. Mr. Hammadi commended  Sudan's stand of solidarity with Iraq. He pointed out that Lt.  Gen. al-Bashir had assured him that the unjust blockade was not  aimed at Iraq only, but at the growth of Arab strength and its  confrontation with colonialists. It also aimed to exhaust the  resources of the Arab nation.    Mr. Hammadi added that his meeting with Lt. Gen. al-Bashir  dealt with ways of strengthening brotherly relations between the  two countries.    Concerning the UN Security Council's position on lifting the  blockade imposed on Iraq, Mr. Hammadi explained that the stand  adopted by the UN Security Council differed from what it had  held in the past, and that this was because a split had occurred  in the viewpoints of the permanent member states. France,  Russia, and China were in favor of lifting the blockade against  Iraq, whereas United States and Britain were not. On Gulf-Iraqi  relations, Mr. Hammadi affirmed a positive trend in his  country's relations with Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule is expected to affect approximately 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units in the Sacramento FIP area. As described in the technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support document, 1990 uncontrolled NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources were 0.05 tpd or 19.2 tpy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those emissions by 9.2 tpy at an average estimated annual savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of $4,600 per ton of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduced. The savings accrue from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated 10 percent reduction in fuel resulting from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of low-NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  burners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (p) Gas Turbines (Sacramento).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(o) controls NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from gas turbines. A gas turbine is an internal combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine that operates with a rotary rather than a reciprocating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motion. Compressed air and fuel are introduced to the combustor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section were the fuel is burned. Hot combustion gases then enter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the turbine section, where the gases rotate one or more shafts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which power the compressor and electric generator. Electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilities and cogenerators use gas turbines to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electricity and useful thermal energy. Gas turbines can burn a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variety of fuels including natural gas, waste process gases, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquid fuels such as distillate oils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are three generic control techniques available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from gas turbines: (1) Injection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water or steam into the combustor; (2) add-on post combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls (e.g., selective catalytic reduction); and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification to combustor designs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule applies to any owner or operator of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary gas turbine with a rated heat output capacity equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or greater than 0.3 megawatt (MW). After May 15, 1997, all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary gas turbines rated equal to or greater than 0.3 but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 2.9 MW shall meet a compliance limit based on 25 ppm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  times a demonstrated percent efficiency. Stationary gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turbines rated equal to or greater than 2.9 MW shall meet a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance limit based on 9 ppm NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  times a demonstrated percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. Peaking units and emergency standby units operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 200 hours per calendar year are exempt from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction requirements but must keep records to verify hour of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation. Additional exemptions are provided for very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialized uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule limits are based largely on SCAQMD Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1134, CARB RACT/BARCT guidance, and EPA's ACT guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are discussed in detail in EPA's technical support document. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule is expected to affect gas turbines at only one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source (i.e., Proctor and Gamble) in the Sacramento FIP area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Procter and Gamble unit is currently scheduled for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement with a newer gas turbine which will operate at 5 ppm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Although additional gas turbines are located in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, these units are already meeting the proposed FIP limits or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are exempt from the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the technical support document, 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncontrolled NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from this source was 0.43 tpd.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions by 0.2 tpd at an estimated cost of $6,700 per ton of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Regulations Imposed Statewide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Introduction_Rationale for Statewide Control._Section 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act directs states to include in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a SIP those enforceable control measures necessary to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment. This requirement extends to development of federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans. Paragraphs III.C.4.b&hyph;e of this NPRM describe a set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area source rules that EPA is proposing to implement on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statewide basis in order to assure compliance and emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions. In addition, an option for a statewide manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule is discussed for the solvents and coatings categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated under the proposed VOC cap rules (see section III.C.5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing statewide requirements for area source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories that consist of portable VOC-containing materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including architectural coatings, pesticides, aerosol paints and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other consumer products. These categories differ from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditional point source categories for which emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principally occur at a few stable locations where products are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured. In contrast, area sources are distributed widely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and emit pollutants where products are used. EPA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations for these categories will be most effective if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied uniformly throughout the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most notably, EPA cannot assure compliance for these area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source categories at the point of emissions as achieved with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point sources. This would require routine inspection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement against individual consumers for using, for example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high VOC house paints and bathroom cleansers. EPA has neither  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resources for such a program, nor the expectation that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual consumers should be responsible for monitoring the VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contents of their paints and cleansers. Instead, EPA must rely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on compliance at point of sale or manufacture such as, in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, paint and cleanser distributors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unfortunately, because there is little threat of enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against actual product users, EPA believes that regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affecting these categories would be routinely circumvented if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards varied in neighboring areas. If, for example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> architectural coating rule applied only in the narrow FIP areas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> house painters in southern Sutter County (part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonattainment area) might drive to northern Sutter (outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonattainment area) to purchase cheaper paints, or lemon growers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Ventura might cross into Santa Barbara for a pesticide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation they had used the year before.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA has not attempted to quantify the erosion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected emission reductions that would occur if these FIP rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were implemented on an area rather than statewide basis, there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much anecdotal evidence to confirm that considerable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumvention of the rules would occur. California air pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, for example, believe such circumvention routinely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> erodes the effectiveness of existing architectural coating,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automobile refinishing, and other local regulations. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumvention is an important force behind the ongoing national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory negotiation designed to establish consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> architectural coating standards. It is also a primary rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for existing California legislation requiring statewide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation of consumer products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One could extend this discussion to argue that these area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source rules should be implemented on a national basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Particularly along the northern and eastern State borders, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects some circumvention of rules affective only in California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These borders are relatively scarcely populated, however, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fairly far from the FIP areas. EPA expects, therefore, minimal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact in the FIP areas and believe that the State of California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the most appropriate area in which to implement these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the need for enforceability is the primary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independently legally sufficient justification for implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these rules on a statewide basis, several additional benefits to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this approach are discussed below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consistency.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the exception of architectural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings, all the categories proposed as statewide measures in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this NPRM are currently addressed in California on a statewide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis. <FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>  Statewide FIP measures maintain consistency with these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, minimizing unnecessary complexity for all concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pesticides are regulated statewide under the California Food and Agriculture Code, consumer products are regulated statewide under the California Code of Regulations, and aerosol paints are proposed for inclusion in the statewide consumer products regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

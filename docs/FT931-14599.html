			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / The European Market: Single market puts drugs on roundabout  -Parallel trade and distortion in the Community THE European Community's single market has generated some curious trade distortions, none more so than one in the drugs industry. The requirement for the free movement of goods has led to asituation in which UK-produced medicines, for example, are exported from the UK to Greece and imported back to Britain by wholesalers making money through the drugs' peculiar journey. The reason for parallel trade, as the practice is known, is that drug prices vary widely in EC member states. Drugs in France are, for example, nearly half the price of those in the UK, according to the German federation of pharmacists. Parallel trade works as follows: medicines originating in countries where prices are high, such as Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, are exported to EC states, including those where prices are low, such as France and Greece. Wholesalers in the low-price countries then buy the medicines at the prevailing low prices and reimport them into the originating countries to compete with higher-priced local brands. Price differences between EC states are not unusual. For example, European car manufacturers commonly set different prices for similar vehicles in different countries. But whereas automotive makers are responsible for setting vehicle prices throughout the EC, pharmaceuticals groups have little control over prices. These are set by national governments. Some, with strong indigenous drugs industries, have an interest in setting high prices, while others, anxious to control health-care costs, set lower prices. Efforts by the European Commission to harmonise drug prices have been abandoned for the moment, admitted Sir Leon Brittan, Commission vice-president formerly responsible for competition, last month. Widespread pharmaceutical price regulation together with free movement of goods, have, in effect, created distortion of trade. The situation can be exacerbated by exchange rate fluctuations. The pharmaceutical industry hates parallel importing because its producers lose revenue. 'It's really annoying. Middle-men who contribute nothing to the health-care system are making money, which is lost to the pharmaceuticals sector,' says Mr Hakan Astrom, chief executive of Kabi Pharmacia, the Swedish drugs group. The danger of such trade, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, is clear. Although the public has an interest in cheap medicines, it also has an interest in the ability of the drugs industry to create innovative products. The public is clamouring for treatments for currently incurable diseases such as Aids and Alzheimer's. The trade could inflict serious damage on research-based pharmaceuticals companies, inhibiting their ability to invest in new drugs, the ABPI argues. What is the scale of the problem? The drugs targeted by parallel importers are those with international prices that differ by more than 20 per cent, according to Mr Paul Balcombe, chairman of Spectrum group, the London-based drug importers. He estimates about 120 products are parallel-imported by his company into the UK. There are about 3,000 products on the market. Six of the world's seven top-traded drugs were parallel traded in the EC, according to a recent report* for the UK-based Institute of Economic Affairs: Glaxo's anti-ulcerant Zantac, Bristol-Myers Squibb's hypertension treatment Capoten, SmithKline Beecham's anti-ulcerant Tagamet, ICI's hypertension medicine Tenormin, Ciba-Geigy's angina product Voltaren, and Bayer's hypertension drug Adalat. As much as 30 per cent of UK sales of Zantac, Glaxo's best-selling drug, is reimported, says Mr Martyn Postle, consultant at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. He reckons parallel trade is a big problem in the Netherlands and is becoming a problem in Germany. The consequence is that sales of parallel-imported medicines in 1990 were between Pounds 250m and Pounds 305m, according to the Institute of Economic Affairs report. This suggests the problem is small, representing only 2 per cent of the EC's prescription sales. The industry's fear is that parallel trade in medicines could increase, leading to a significant collapse in revenues. The Danish government has actively encouraged parallel trade over the last two years, for example. However, although regulations designed to remove impediments to parallel trade were implemented on January 1 this year, its long-term future is uncertain. In the short term, UK and Italian parallel importers were badly hit by the devaluation of sterling, which wiped out nearly 15 per cent of their gross margin. Mr Balcombe at Spectrum believes some will have to cease trading. In the longer term, Mr Balcombe concedes the drugs groups may have found an effective strategy to counter parallel trade. Although pharmaceutical companies are incapable of converging prices for existing prices, they have proved increasingly adept at harmonising prices on new drugs. Glaxo, for example, has negotiated, with some difficulty, a common price throughout the EC for its new potential blockbuster migraine treatment Imigran. Mr Balcombe reckons that other drugs groups will follow Glaxo's example, with the result that parallel trade - in pharmaceuticals at least - will fade and die, ending one of the quirkier consequences of the single market. *Undermining Innovation: Parallel Trade in Prescription Medicines, by ML Burstall and IST Senior, Institute of Economic Affairs Health and Welfare Unit, 2, Lord North Street, London SW1P 3LB, 071 799 37 45, Pounds 12.95.</p>

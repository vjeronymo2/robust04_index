			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Factions struggle over candidacy in Mexico The race to succeed Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio as the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling party reached fever pitch at the weekend, even as the party sought to quash rumours that the nomination was imminent. Members of the Institutional Revolutionary party's (PRI) old guard seemed set on a desperate and probably futile effort to block the candidacy of the favourite, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the campaign manager of Mr Colosio, who was assassinated on Wednesday. Mr Zedillo, a former budget minister with an economics doctorate from Yale University in the US, represents the modern, pro-reform wing of the party. Mr Fernando Ortiz Arana, party president, tried to quell speculation, saying no one in the party was authorised to comment on possible candidates: 'The PRI, like all of Mexico, is in mourning. This is a time of reflection for all of us. In due time we will initiate internal processes to select our new candidate.' Mr Ramiro de la Rosa, head of Democracy 2000, a faction in the PRI, urged President Carlos Salinas to let the party choose its candidate without presidential interference. Mr de la Rosa's group backed Mr Ortiz Arana, presumed favourite of the party rank and file, as candidate. A government official said it had still not decided how the candidate would be chosen. But the expectation is that Mr Salinas will select the candidate, after consultation with party officials and ministers. As Mr Colosio's campaign manager, Mr Zedillo is likely to be projected as the legitimate heir of the slain candidate. The PRI still maintains that the candidate could be chosen as late as next week. However, if speculation increases it may have to be more quickly. Meanwhile, Mr Porfirio Munoz Ledo, president of the main leftist opposition party, has demanded an independent investigation into the murder of Mr Colosio. He believes Mr Mario Aburto, who has confessed to killing Mr Colosio, may have been paid by organised groups in the country. Mr Aburto initially told investigators that he had links with such organised groups, but refused to name them. He also said that he would not talk unless tortured, indicating that he might have been part of a wider organisation, or wanted investigators to believe he was. A government official said: 'At this point there is no indication Mr Aburto was working for anyone else'. Police say they found a drawing in Mr Aburto's home depicting his soul entering the body of Mr Colosio, and another of the two floating up to heaven. In the view of the police, this suggested mental instability.</p>

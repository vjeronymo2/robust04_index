			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Adding fuel to the waste debate - A look at a fierce battle to dominate EC policy on the disposal of household rubbish From the outside, the Saint Ouen waste incineration plant on the outskirts of Paris resembles a newly built museum with shiny metal walls, sloping roofs and elegantly circling approach roads at the back. Inside, the computerised control room resembles a research laboratory, well endowed with high technology. Only the faint smell of garbage betrays the fact that this is the place where the community's rubbish ends up each day. Built two years ago, the Saint Ouen plant incorporates the latest technology for household waste incineration. It is run on a 24-hour basis by a crew of eight and has the capacity to burn 630,000 tonnes of garbage a year. The energy gained from the burning process is then used to heat 70,000 flats in Paris. In the view of the Brussels-based Association of Plastic Manufacturers in Europe, the modern French waste incinerator shows that burning household waste in order to produce energy is far more economical and ecological than recycling the accumulated waste. APME has been fighting a rearguard battle to promote incineration technology in Europe. Its lobbying efforts have increased recently as the European Commission debates a packaging directive which would force the member countries to adopt similar parameters in the disposal of household waste. The Commission is due this autumn to adopt a directive which will set the recycling quotas for all EC member countries. Plastics make up only a small portion of the packaging found in household bins, but they have become a testing ground for legislators across Europe. Lightweight plastics especially, such as yoghurt pots or cheese wrappers, are at the centre of a growing battle between French and German legislators who hold opposing views on the recycling -versus-incineration issue. France argues that household waste can be incinerated before it is put on landfills. And it has developed modern waste technology which enables the incineration to be conducted without toxic emissions. But Germany wants the EC directive to follow its own national legislation. Under the influence of the strongest pro-environment lobbies in Europe, Germany has adopted strict recycling laws for waste packaging which prevent incineration - this is in spite of the fact that the modern incinerators are environmentally friendly. The headache for ministers in Brussels is how to reconcile both views in its directive. It must also set the limits for the recycling quotas and decide what pressure should be applied to meet them. The aim of the EC directive is to curb the growing mountains of household waste which are at present dumped on landfills across Europe. As space for landfills has become scarce, awareness of its environmental impact has increased. But the directive must also harmonise existing household waste recycling laws in Europe to ensure that different national waste packaging laws do not prevent particular packaging forms from being sold throughout the community. The issues have become more urgent recently amid problems with Germany's strict waste packaging law, which sets high recycling targets and forbids incineration. Flaws in Germany's waste management scheme surfaced when the much-vaunted national recycling scheme, Duales System Deutschland, recently announced it was on the verge of bankruptcy. German law states that only 100,000 tonnes of plastics can be recycled this year, but the diligence of Germans in separating their rubbish and the efficiency of DSD in collecting it means that 400,000 tonnes of plastic packaging is likely for collection. The excess rubbish has increasingly resulted in waste paper and glass being exported to neighbouring countries. In the case of plastics, Germany's insufficient domestic recycling capacity has led either to yet more controversial exports or to the equally disliked local storage of waste plastic. This inability of DSD to recycle the small household plastic waste packagings has also intensified the debate on whether recycling should be compulsory in member countries. According to APME, the problem with the German law is that it attempts to recycle all forms of packaging, including those containing mixed materials which are often difficult to sort from other rubbish forms. APME says that lightweight plastic packaging should be incinerated. In the Saint Ouen plant, for example, small plastics, which are not separately collected as in Germany, are used as fuel to burn the household waste. But the German government is locked in an awkward position. The public perceives incineration as detrimental to the environment, even when energy is recovered. 'More than any country in Europe, Germany is suffering from the nimby syndrome - the not-in-my-backyard syndrome,' says Franz Fraundorfer, a consultant in the German-based office of Arthur D. Little, the US management consultancy. Helmut Schnurer, state secretary at the German federal environment ministry explains: 'We need new incinerators but we are meeting enormous local resistance.' The government is aware, however, that modern incinerators are environmentally friendly and can make more economic sense. Incineration will, in fact, be allowed as an alternative to recycling in its forthcoming law on recycling consumer durables. This will mean the building of new incinerators. 'Local politicians will no longer be under the influence of local pressure groups because they will be able to say they are simply obeying a federal requirement,' says Schnurer. But in the case of the controversial two-year-old packaging law, there is no turning back. Any change would represent loss of face for the government and for Klaus Topfer, federal environment minister and architect of Germany's waste management laws. Meanwhile, the Commission's solution for the waste packaging directive could be to allow both recycling and incineration. But this solution is unlikely to please either France or Germany.</p>

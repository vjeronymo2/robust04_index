			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Royal hit hard by results COMPOSITE insurer Royal Insurance plunged following results described variously in the market as 'disastrous' and 'appalling'. The decision to pass the final dividend hit hardest at a share price which dropped 49 at one stage, although it recovered later to 190p, a final loss of 36 on the day. Turnover was very heavy at 20m shares. The group's executives also failed to turn in a convincing performance at the post-results meeting with analysts. 'They did nothing to remove the uncertainty surrounding future trading prospects, or to give any guidance on dividend expectations,' said Mr Steven Bird at County NatWest. Other analysts complained that the lack of information given at the meeting meant that putting any value on the stock was extremely difficult. Improvement in the group's US operations was more than offset by the worsening situation in the UK insurance business. Many observers believe that Royal will have to consider the sale or flotation of its life assurance operation, which made profits of around Pounds 47m and is valued at some Pounds 540m. Analysts' forecasts for 1992 are mostly in the range of losses of Pounds 150m to Pounds 200m, with the group edging into profitability by 1993. Worries about mortgage indemnity losses, borne out by Royal's results, depressed the other composites. Commercial Union lost 8 to 458p, General Accident 10 to 426p, Guardian Royal Exchange 9 to 110p, Sun Alliance 13 to 271p and BAT Industries, with its Eagle Star subsidiary, 11 to 649p. Midland pleases Surprise and relief greeted Midland Bank's small profit and its decision to pay a final dividend. The shares gained 21 to 260p in very large turnover of 17m. The bank's cost control measures and the improvement in distributable reserves pleased the market. However, questions still remain over the bank's management of bad debts and the level of provisions. 'I am concerned about the general quality of Midland's loan portfolio and its judgment on provisions,' said Mr Tim Clarke at Panmure Gordon. Yield worries were also voiced by a number of observers. Mr Mike Fesemeyer at Nomura said: 'A current yield of 2.6 per cent puts the share price under pressure and could threaten the dividend next year.' For 1992, analysts' forecasts range from Pounds 200m to Pounds 280m, with recovery in 1993 to the region of Pounds 500m to Pounds 580m. BA above worst The share price of British Airways was down 18p at one stage, after it emerged - and was later confirmed by the company - that merger talks with KLM, the Dutch airline, had been terminated. The news led to heavy selling and turnover reached 8m shares by mid-morning. Bargain hunters, however, came in at the lower levels, and dealers reported good two-way business by the afternoon, helping the stock to recover some ground to end 11 off at 265p after heavy volume of 17m. Light US selling was noted and the American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) fell by Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 46 3/8 in early trading. Mr Clive Anderson, at Smith New Court, said: 'The prospects of the KLM deal added froth to the share price. In the short term, the fundamentals are encouraging, hence the recovery in the share price. However, in the long term, there is a prospect of greater competition on the north Atlantic routes.' Miss Yasmin Harrison, at James Capel, added: 'It is a good thing that BA can walk away from a deal it does not feel is right for shareholders.' ICI results were in line with forecasts but the statement from chairman Sir Denys Henderson steered analysts away from premature enthusiasm. Most observers cut their estimates back after the meeting and the range of profit forecasts widened as a result of diverging views regarding the chances of a recovery in the global economy. Smith New Court moved its 1992 figure back by Pounds 50m to Pounds 950m but suggested the stock should be bought on weakness. Nikko came back by Pounds 100m to Pounds 1bn and took a more negative view on the shares, arguing that their rating, in 1993 terms, was too demanding for a chemicals stock. ICI fell 23 to 1284p. British Gas eased  1/2 to 258p as analysts suggested that while the results were difficult to judge in view of the change in year-end to December from March, the overall impression was disappointing. Criticism over its drug pricing weighed on Glaxo again yesterday and the shares weakened 20 to 774p on hefty turnover of 4.3m, following very busy dealing in New York overnight where the equivalent of 8.6m shares were traded. News that the Danish Office of Fair Trading had asked the European Commission to look into Glaxo's pricing reached the London market late on Wednesday afternoon, when marketmakers had only a short time to react. However, some felt the reaction was overdone. Mr Andrew Porter of Nikko Securities said: 'In the recent six-month figures only 1 per cent of the growth was the result of price increases. This is an industry-wide issue and it is unfair to single Glaxo out.' Nikko is a strong buyer and believes the shares will touch Pounds 10 by the end of the year. Fisons moved ahead 9 to 389p on renewed talk that a bid might emerge soon for the healthcare group. Almost every company with a vague link has been cited. Good two-way business in British Telecom saw 13m traded in the partly-paid shares, the price edging up 1 1/4 to 122 3/4 p. Cable and Wireless rose 10 to 603p as recent buy notes from a couple of brokers and a series of presentations over the past week by Charterhouse Tilney lifted the stock. An upbeat trend was maintained by BP, following recent optimistic comments from New York. The stock put on 2 1/2 to 267p on reduced, but still strong, turnover of 18m shares. The depressed construction sector saw a ray of hope in Alfred McAlpine's forecast that full results for the current financial year will show a modest improvement over 1991. The shares advanced 12 to 205p in spite of a warning that the first half is likely to be poor. The appointment of Mr Tim Howden as chief executive Europe for Albert Fisher lifted the stock 3 to 65p. Ranks Hovis McDougall, where Mr Howden is currently managing director, relinquished 7 to 207p. A buy recommendation for Iceland from BZW pushed the shares up 16 to 454p. Mr Bill Currie, at BZW, said: 'We think trading is extremely buoyant and the figures (for 1991) will be good.' BZW is forecasting Pounds 46.5m, against Pounds 40.35m previously. Brewer Allied-Lyons gained 4 to 637p in a generally firm sector. Allied has sold its brandy and distribution interests in Spain to the privately-owned Pedro Domecq for Pounds 50m. Full-year results from Courtaulds Textiles pleased the market and the shares continued recent strength to set an all-time high of 463p, up 19 on turnover of 1.1m. SG Warburg, the company's broker, increased its 1992 profits estimate by Pounds 3m to Pounds 48m. Reappraisal of potential BSkyB profits was said to be behind another strong performance from Pearson, which rose 6 to 813p, a 2 1/2 -year high. One analyst argued that, assuming the satellite television channel is floated, Pearson's 16 per cent stake will translate into some Pounds 400m, which compares very favourably with the Pounds 107m the publisher invested. The market once again took a somewhat negative view of the way Williams Holdings reports its accounts and the shares fell 12 to 313p in spite of news of full-year figures in line with market forecasts. The prospect of a better outlook following the current analysts' visit to British Aerospace lifted the stock 12 to 308p, while a squeeze in Siebe saw the shares add 14 at 394p.

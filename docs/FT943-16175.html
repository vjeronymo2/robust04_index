			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Big Argentine protest today to protect jobs Argentine President Carlos Menem has promised strict security measures for a demonstration today by trade unions and opposition parties in the centre of the capital, Buenos Aires. Organisers say this will be the largest demonstration against Mr Menem's free market economic policies since he took office in mid-1989. They hope to mobilise more than 40,000 people. Mr Menem, concerned there could be violence, has ordered 6,000 police, backed by helicopters and riot police, to patrol the city centre. The demonstration will occur in the context of rising industrial unrest, fuelled by stagnant wages and worsening unemployment. Discontent is also increasing in the provinces, where most local economies are in deep recession. The march today is to be led by a new breed of union bosses, mainly leaders of public sector workers from the provinces fighting to protect jobs under threatened local government reforms. A younger generation of more aggressive union leaders is out-flanking more cautious union bosses prominent in the old guard of the Peronist movement which also spawned Mr Menem. Branch members of the powerful UOM metalworkers' union have swept aside their leaders' remonstrations and called a series of one-day strikes for this month to press for a 30 per cent wage increase. Previous anti-government protests and strikes in Argentina have failed because of apathy and skilful counters by Mr Menem's Peronist government, which has co-opted labour leaders while reducing traditional union privileges.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAYING ON TOP OF THE SHAKE-UP;  </P> <P> MOTHER NATURE'S RUMBLINGS PUNCTUATE SOUTHLAND SHOWS  </P> <P> Near the epicenter of the quake, The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu reported no  damage from Wednesday's temblor. "Objects are installed to mitigate effects of  an earthquake," a museum spokesperson said.  </P> <P> Sculptures and decorative objects are secured to pedestals and tables, and the  bases of sculptures are equipped with ball bearings, a movable system similar  to that employed in the foundation of earthquake-proof buildings.  </P> <P> The "Kouros," the Greek figure that is one of the museum's major pieces, is  held together under spring tension, a new technique, that allows the statue to  flex rather than jolt under the force of a temblor. Broken in seven pieces, the  statue, thought to be damaged during a quake in antiquity, is threaded with  springs rather than the usual method of using metal posts.  </P> <P> A 1984 engineering study found that the museum could withstand a 6.5 quake on  the Malibu-Santa Monica fault, likely to cause the most damage in the vicinity,  with no structural damage.

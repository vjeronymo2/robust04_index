			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DEADLINE FOR QUAKE REPAIR IS EXTENDED  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council voted unanimously to extend by two months a deadline  for obtaining building permits for renovation of pre-1933 masonry buildings to  meet new earthquake codes.  </P> <P> The extension, which was approved with little discussion Tuesday, gives owners  of older brick and wood buildings until Sept. 1 to take out the building  permits.  </P> <P> City officials said the extension also gives the city time to create a board of  appeals to review applications for further deadline extensions. The board will  be made up of one representative of the city Redevelopment Agency, the fire  marshal and the city manager's office.  </P> <P> As a result of the Whittier-Narrows Earthquake in October, 1987, the City  Council in December, 1987, passed an ordinance requiring owners of pre-1933  buildings to reinforce walls and ceilings with steel bolts.  </P> <P> It required that property owners complete all repairs by July, 1991.  </P> <P> About 14 landlords have requested an extension of the deadline, saying they  could not find engineers to design renovation plans in time to meet the July 1  cut-off date, city officials said. Some landlords have said the new  requirements brought a backlog of contracts to many builders and engineers.  </P> <P> There are 50 buildings, mostly in Old Downtown Torrance, that need  earthquake-safety improvements. Renovations have been completed on six of those  buildings, city officials said.  </P> <P> An estimated 200 to 300 people occupy those buildings during the day and as  many as 500 people live in them at night, city officials said. Most of them are  apartments or restaurants.  </P></p>

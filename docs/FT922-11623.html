			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alcan chairman calls for more smelter closures A CALL went out yesterday from Mr David Morton, chairman of Alcan of Canada, for more high-cost western aluminium smelters to close to redress the imbalance in supply caused mainly by Russian exports to the west. At the same time the European Commission ruled out any immediate action to protect its hard-pressed producers from the flood of aluminium from the former Soviet Union. However, the commission is to monitor imports to provide better statistical information. It published a regulation requiring member states to give details of primary aluminium imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States every month from May 1. But an EC official suggested a clear statistical picture would not emerge until the end of 1992. He pointed out that, while the commission's action would not restrict imports, it would provide better statistics to help it assess whether measures to safeguard the European producers were needed. But he admitted such measures would be difficult to apply. The official held out the possibility that Russia, the biggest CIS aluminium producer, would probably be cautious about its exports to the EC this year because it would not want to undermine a market that provided an assured source of desperately-needed hard currency. In its preamble to the regulation the commission said aluminium imports from the CIS to the EC had jumped from 12,586 tonnes in 1990 to 122,957 tonnes last year. But imports from the CIS by the former East Germany, a big buyer in the past, were included in the 1991 total. Meanwhile, Alcan's Mr Morton used his annual meeting in Montreal to point out that the closure of nearly 1m tonnes of western primary aluminium capacity had already been announced, although not all had yet taken effect. Included in the total was a 50,000 tonnes cut by Alcan, representing 8.5 per cent of its world-wide capacity. Mr Morton said recovery in aluminium demand would be slow and more western capacity was coming into operation this year. 'We have seen the bottom of the market but prices will have to struggle to sustain current levels for the remainder of the first half of the year,' he added. 'I believe further production cutbacks in the industry, particularly of older, higher-cost and less environmentally satisfactory smelters, must form part of the solution,' said Mr Morton. According to the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy group, the western world's highest-cost smelters are in Italy, with production costs averaging 76 US cents a lb, Spain, 72 cents, Germany, 65 cents and the UK, 62 cents. This compares with Venezuela, the lowest-cost country with an average of 47 cents, Canada, 49 cents, and Australia 50 cents. Europe already is bearing the brunt of cuts so far. The European Aluminium Association estimates that production by its members fell by 2.4 per cent from the 1990 level to 3.533m tonnes last year. The fall in output has been accelerating. It was 5.7 per cent in the last quarter of 1991 and more than 8 per cent last month. The World Bureau of Metal Statistics estimates that aluminium imports from the CIS to the west last year reached at least 935,000 tonnes of which 700,000 tonnes was consumed, leaving 300,000 tonnes in London Metal Exchange warehouses at the end of last year. Russia has allocated 615,000 tonnes of production for export this year but in view of the chaotic conditions in the CIS many analysts believe exports are more likely to be between 500,000 and 600,000 tonnes, or roughly half the 1991 level.</p>

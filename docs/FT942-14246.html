			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Piglets in paradise - SCA Nutrition / Normal feed fails to produce textures necessary for young animals. Acceptability, digestibility and palatability are crucial SCA Nutrition, founded in 1973, has grown into Britain's leading manufacturer of food for piglets and other young farm animals. The Yorkshire-based company has a significant share of the UK milk replacer and free access mineral market and is the market leader in piglet diets producing over 50,000 tonnes annually. Piglet feed accounts for roughly 85 per cent of turnover although the company also produces specialist food for calves and lambs and its own dog food - SCA Dog Diet - which is favoured by sheep dog owners. Total turnover grew from Pounds 14.7m in 1990/91 to Pounds 23.5m in 1992/93 while exports increased almost sevenfold over the same period jumping from Pounds 784,000 to Pounds 5.35m. Outside the UK the company now claims a 20 per cent market share in Denmark. Other export markets include Ireland and Spain, where SCA has subsidiaries, Portugal, Italy, Germany, France and Poland. SCA was founded by Mr Stephen Clements and remained a small privately owned company until the 1980s when it was acquired by NuTec. Early last year it was bought by Eridania Beghin-Say, a French group. The number of employees has grown from 61 in 1990/91 to 84 today. The company's success in the young animal feed market reflects its accumulated experience and expertise in animal feed technology. SCA claims that conventional feed manufacturing techniques cannot produce the finished product textures which are so necessary for young animal diets. The company says: 'Acceptability, digestibility and palatability are crucial.' All products are manufactured using specialist plant at Thirsk, North Yorkshire. Heat sensitive milk products are carefully blended in the manufacture of milk replacers while other specialist processing equipment is used to produce piglet diets. The company's commitment to quality was recognised last year when its gained BS 5750 accreditation on its first attempt. SCA products are distributed throughout the UK through a network of merchants and compounders. Product support is provided to distributors and their customers through practical, on-farm specialists who offer advice not only on feeding regimes, but also on environmental and disease control, housing and general management. Reflecting its confidence in the future SCA has already commissioned the design and building of a new production mill which will open shortly and will double production capacity to more than 100,000 tonnes per annum. The company also recognises the need to consolidate its market position though an extensive programme of product development. Accordingly a dedicated team of nutritionists continuously monitor the world's research papers. All product developments are thoroughly tried and tested on farms under controlled conditions before being incorporated into the product range.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Investors dismiss setbacks to Peruvian privatisations - Lima shrugs off US rate rises Interest both from foreign direct and portfolio investors in Peruvian assets continues to be significant in spite of recent setbacks. Lima's stock market has held up well, in spite of rises in US interest rates which have dented the enthusiasm of stock and bond investors for Latin American markets. However, after a successful telephone company privatisation in February, the government failed in its attempt last week to sell the mining and refining giant, Centromin. The sale in February of Peru's two state-controlled telecommunications companies, CPT and Entel, to Telefonica of Spain yielded more than USDollars 2bn - well above most expectations and setting a pace which may have been impossible to match. However, the inability to sell Centromin at the first attempt is not being seen by foreign bankers as a body-blow to Peru's privatisation plans. Interest in the country's mining sector remains high - some 800 people are attending a three-day gold mining conference in Lima. The auction's failure was, it is said, more a reflection of the mining company's specific problems, in particular its possible future environmental liabilities. Still to be sold in the next few months are a series of fishmeal plants owned by Pescaperu; the distribution and generation systems of Electrolima and Electroperu; and Interbanc, the first of two state-owned banks to come to market. The privatisation list also includes cement producers Lima and Norte Pacasmayo, and the Cajarmaquilla zinc smelter and refinery Mr Efrain Goldenberg, the Peruvian prime minister, said the government expected to raise more than Dollars 3bn this year from its privatisation programme - and noted some private estimates are even higher. The sale of the telephone companies was an indication of the distance Peru has come since President Alberto Fujimori came to power in 1990, Mr Goldenberg said in an interview in London. 'Ten years ago you couldn't have given these companies away.' Part of the success was due, he said, to expectations of growth. 'Our economy grew last year by 7 per cent. The official forecast for this year is 5 per cent, but we are pretty sure it will be more than that.' GDP in the first quarter is reported to have been 8 1/2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Investors in general may have been further heartened by rises in the prices of some raw materials. 'With the world economic cycle becoming more favourably disposed towards the providers of raw materials, and with corporate profits rising at 30 per cent per annum, the expectation has to be that the stock market in Lima will continue to do better than most,' said investment strategist Mr Roger Nightingale of London-based LatInvest Securities. This year has also seen Peruvian companies raise foreign finance for the first time in decades - although the environment has become more difficult in recent months. In mid-March, Peru's Gloria group, in association with VestcorPartners, a Miami investment bank, launched a Dollars 40m Eurobond issue - the first from Peru in more than 20 years. A privately-owned telecommunications company, Tele 2000, notched up another first - a Dollars 40m issue of convertible three-year Euronotes through Barings Securities and Bankers Trust - even though it paid a higher interest rate than originally expected. Bankers Trust, in a joint venture with stockbrokers Peruval, is also co-ordinating the first fully-fledged American depositary receipt placement of shares in a Peruvian company. The state has agreed to offer its 38 per cent holding in Cementos Lima simultaneously on the stock exchanges of Lima and New York. No date for the issue has yet been set. At the same time, Peruvian companies are seeing growing opportunities for financing themselves domestically - through the growth of private pension funds, or AFPs. Launched in June last year, the AFPs have signed up more than 800,000 salaried workers out of an initial target group of 1.2m who are expected to switch from the moribund pension scheme provided by Peru's social security institute (IPSS). Eight companies are vying for the pension funds market - almost all have international backers, including Aetna, Citibank, ING Bank of the Netherlands as well as Chilean counterpart funds like Provida, Habitat and Cruz Blanca. The total fund size is small, around an estimated Dollars 95m. But once the state starts meeting its contributions for public sector workers, around Dollars 25m a month, money will be flowing into the AFP coffers, amounting to some Dollars 300m by the end of the year and a possible total fund of Dollars 4bn within five years. 'Peru has had the advantage of not being the first-comer,' says Mr Carlos Bolona, economy minister from 1991 to 1993 and architect of the structural reform programme. 'We did in two years what took six in Chile, and we've gone further in many reforms than Chile or Bolivia.' Additional reporting by Stephen Fidler and Ken Warn.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: Growth options for 'minnows' of the quoted sector FEW COMPANIES, however small, regret having a quotation. The ability to issue paper is bound to open avenues down which private companies are unlikely to travel. However, small companies are increasingly constrained. With stockbrokers drawing back from following, let alone making, markets in the shares of smaller companies, there is pressure for the minnows of the quoted sector to do something or risk further deterioration of the liquidity in their stocks. A case in point is Umeco, the USM-quoted maker of aircraft refuelling equipment and distributor of seals and components to the aerospace industry. Recession in the world economy, and in particular in the aerospace industry, partly explains a less than distinguished share price performance since it came to the USM in 1989. But the slide in its market capitalisation, from about Pounds 7m to Pounds 1.75m today, may have been exaggerated because the company is so small. Mr George Metcalfe, Umeco chairman, says the company is capable of growing its markets and will be well positioned to do so when recovery comes. But size remains one of his principle concerns. 'You have to do something,' he says. 'The possibility of doing nothing is not an option.' 'Organic growth will not take you along the road far enough or fast enough. You have to combine organic and acquisition-led growth. It is the only way to grow sufficiently to attain critical mass,' he says. For companies such as Umeco, Mr Metcalfe says there are limited options if they want to retain a quote. The first is to find a dormant, or semi-dormant, shell into which to reverse; this vehicle would most probably already have a full listing. Another option is a straightforward merger. The problem here lies with potential personality clashes. If the existing management is to have a say in running the enlarged group the two companies will probably have to be of a similar size. As a result, the enlarged company would only double or triple the size of the original company. In Umeco's case, for example, this would lead to a merged company with a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 6m. A third option is that a private company might seek to reverse into a company such as Umeco. In an enlarged form, the two companies would progress to a full listing that would be out of reach for each on its own. Not surprisingly, Mr Metcalfe's immediate concern, apart from the low share price, is the lack of liquidity in the company's stock; a Pounds 5,000 trade is capable of moving the share price. But he dismisses some of the more usual complaints from very small companies. Umeco pays no more for auditing or non-executive directors now that it is quoted. Such costs are an essential part of running a company properly, quoted or unquoted. And despite Umeco's less than illustrious stock market career, it did successfully raise Pounds 55,000 in 1991 to make a part paper acquisition of an aviation supply company.</p>

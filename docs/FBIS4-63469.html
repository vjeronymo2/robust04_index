			<p>BFN     [Text] Thirty minutes ago we made contact with Yevgeniy  Saburov, the Crimean head of government, to get his views on  what is going on in Simferopol.    [Begin Saburov recording] The reaction by Kravchuk was  completely uncalled for. When you ask for the law to be  observed, you cannot then introduce a state of emergency. That  is true, unless you have some ulterior motives, so to speak. As  for ulterior motives, I do not know who thinks they are  ulterior. They are all out in the open, completely open to view.    Here we are talking about the Ukrainian presidential  election. Everything that is happening in Crimea is linked to  this issue alone. It is the only way for Leonid Makarevich  Kravchuk to call off the presidential election. Therefore,  strictly speaking, it will be completely inaccurate to talk  about Ukraine here. Here we should be talking about a number of  characters in the Kiev leadership who are prepared to risk a lot  in pursuit of their own goals.    So, how far are they prepared to go? This, incidentally, is  a matter for their consciences. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Five Tube lines miss targets FIVE OF London Underground's 11 lines have failed to meet the performance targets announced by the government last month. On the system as a whole, on average, 97.5 per cent of scheduled rush-hour trains were run. The worst performer was the Victoria Line, which failed to run nearly 20 per cent of scheduled rush-hour trains in the four weeks to May 22. Top performer was the East London Line, which ran all its rush-hour trains. London Underground blamed a long-standing matter of irregular wear on trains' wheels, which was probably caused by faulty lubrication.</p>

Smirnyagin, a permanent expert on regional policies, told  ITAR-TASS that under the Russian Constitution subjects of the  federation have no right to alter a region's status  unilaterally. Moreover, such acts by republics' politicians  destroy the federation.    If such a step were taken, this would mean violation of the  principles of state structure of Russian Federaion, Smirnyagin  said. He said he is amazed at Ilyumzhinov's intention to  implement his idea without discussing it with Kalmykia's  population and without holding a referendum.    Commenting on possible political motives of the Kalmykian  leader, the member of the Presidential Council recalled  Ilyumzhinov's unsavoury role in the autumn in last year when he  virtually backed those who unleashed bloody events in Moscow.  "Probably the Kalmykian leader by his awkward initiative now  tries to please Moscow and get absolved of his sin," Smirnyagin  notes.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ASC'S POSITION  </P> <P> The American Society of Cinematographers wishes to comment on Don Shannon's  Oct. 25 article, "Panel Weighs Moral Rights of Film Alteration." The report of  our position on moral-rights issues in copyright protection could easily be  misread, leaving one with the impression that our members have no objections to  coloring black-and-white films or altering motion pictures in any way for  television exhibition.  </P> <P> We do not favor alterations made to accommodate the limitations of television  formats and videocassette markets. On the other hand, we do not oppose  alterations that have been supervised by the principal contributors of the  original film.  </P> <P> As stated by our representative before a Senate subcommittee Oct. 24, we are  opposed to coloring productions that were intended to be seen in  black-and-white, to the panning and scanning of pictures that were shot for  wide-screen presentations and to changing the pace of a motion picture in order  to meet the schedules of networks, independent stations or advertisers.  </P> <P> We are especially against arbitrary decisions made by strangers to the  collaborative effort.  </P> <P> When the American Society of Cinematographers discussed the ownership of a  motion picture vis-a-vis the artistic endeavors that films contain, the ASC  concluded that the owner has copyright protection. If Congress should declare  that the contributing artists of a motion picture do deserve to have their work  protected, then all principal contributors should be protected equally. In the  meantime, the ASC feels that any materially altered film should be labeled  accordingly to protect the integrity of all of the creators.  </P> <P> LEONARD J. SOUTH  </P> <P> President, American  </P> <P> Society of Cinematographers  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 20. Non-commercial Samples of Skins  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 21. Marking of Crocodilian Specimens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At COP8, the United States advocated adoption of a resolution that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted jointly with Australia, to require the skins of all crocodilian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species to be tagged before being allowed to be traded by CITES Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (whether or not a reservation has been entered by a Party).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resolution Conf. 8.14, submitted by both the United States and Australia,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established the framework for a system of universal marking for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crocodilian skins in trade, as a response to serious problems of illegal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade in crocodilian skins, parts, and products. The Animals Committee was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged with setting up the system for the Parties. The Animals Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has prepared a revision of Resolution Conf. 8.14 on this topic, due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems with implementation of portions of the resolution. The draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution of the Animals Committee has not yet been received from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CITES Secretariat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 22. Transport of Live Specimens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Support the adoption by the COP of the report of the Chair of the Working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Group on the Transport of Live Specimens (TWG). The United States will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain an active participant in the TWG, and with all aspects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transport of live wild animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Susan Lieberman of the Service's Office of Management Authority has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> served as Chair of the TWG since COP8. Copies of all reports of the Chair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the TWG to the Standing Committee are available on request, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Terms of Reference of the TWG. The Chair submitted a report to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standing Committee Chair and to the Secretariat, for transmission to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties and discussion at COP9. That report makes recommendations for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future of the TWG. The Service fully supports the report, and recommends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its adoption, with the exception of reserving its position on adoption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budgetary and personal recommendations of the Chair contained therein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those budgetary recommendations would facilitate increased training efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and greater involvement of exporting Parties in TWG activities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliberations, which the Service supports. The Service also supports the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of time near the beginning of the first week of COP9 for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested in the TWG to meet and discuss transport issues, prior to full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion in Committee II. Several past participants in TWG activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have inquired as to whether such a meeting of the TWG would be possible;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Service believes that it would be in the best interest of CITES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation and of the transport of live animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The humane transport of live wild animals remains a significant concern of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States. The TWG's Terms of Reference with the Standing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee include working to improve implementation of the Convention and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant resolutions, training, improvement of international standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordination with the International Air Transport Association Live Animals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board, and the transport of live wild birds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 23. Implementation of Article XIV, Paragraphs 4 and 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Support adoption of the resolution submitted by the United States, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deals with the implementation of Article XIV, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Convention. The U.S. goal in submitting this resolution is to clarify how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an Appendix II listing could be implemented expeditiously for a marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species whose management is under the competency of a pre-existing treaty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of CITES apply to all species of wild fauna and flora,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including marine species. The management of many marine species comes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the jurisdiction or competence of another international treaty,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convention, or agreement. International trade in any species of marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fauna or flora is also within the purview and competence of CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, even if a marine species is subject to management under another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international treaty, convention, or agreement, if it is listed in any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CITES Appendix, international trade and introduction from the sea in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species is regulated by CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CITES made preparation for such situations when the treaty was written.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article XIV, paragraph 4, of the Convention provides that a State party to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CITES, which is also a party to any other treaty, convention, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international agreement which was in force at the time of the coming into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> force of CITES and under the provisions of which protection is afforded to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine species included in Appendix II, is relieved of the obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed on it under CITES with respect to trade in specimens included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix II that are taken by ships registered in that State and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the provisions of such other treaty, convention, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This relief from CITES obligations does not apply to specimens of species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in Appendix I. For example, several whale species are managed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the competence of the International Convention for the Regulation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whaling, but all those species are listed in Appendix I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently no marine species whose management is under the competence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another treaty, convention, or agreement is listed in Appendix II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this provision of the Convention in Article XIV has never been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used, and standards for its implementation have not been developed. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States has determined that it would be wise to plan for the need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement Article XIV, by specifying requirements for certificates issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to Article XIV, paragraph 5, of the Convention, even if its use is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not necessary at this time. The Service notes that Appendix II allows for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international commercial trade. The resolution provides for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilization as a valid certificate under Article XIV, paragraph 5, of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate of origin or statistical document issued on the authority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other treaty, convention, or international agreement, with certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stipulations of minimum information and validation as required by CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Confederation Life to dispose of UK operation Confederation Life, Canada's fifth largest insurer, is to sell off its entire UK operation. The financially troubled insurer said talks were under way with a 'financial services company of significant financial strength' for the sale of Confederation UK Holdings, which made pre-tax profits in 1993 of Pounds 27.9m (USDollars 43.24m) against Pounds 14.2m in 1992. Premium income last year was Pounds 629m, compared with Pounds 715m. Mr Alec Wright, communications manager for the UK operation, said the sale would be used to restore the parent company's capital base which had suffered as a result of falls in property values since the late 1980s. Confederation's UK arm, which began trading in 1906, is one of the leading providers of pooled pension products for medium-sized companies.</p>

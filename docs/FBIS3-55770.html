			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau, 11 Jan -- The Supreme Soviet of the  unrecognized Dniester republic has today adopted an appeal to  deputies of the Russian Federal Assembly, asking for support for  the Dniester region and hoping for understanding of its  proposals on the creation of a confederation in Moldova. In  their message the Dniester deputies accuse the leadership of  Moldova of "persistently not wanting to tackle the Dniester  problem and pursuing a policy of endless veering between  threats, military conflict, and political blackmail." If  Chisinau does not want to "find a mutually- acceptable  settlement" of the conflict, Tiraspol asks the Russian  parliamentarians "to recognize the Dniester Moldavian republic  as an independent and sovereign state friendly to Russia". The  document also contains a request not to withdraw the Russian  14th Army from the Dniester region.    Moldavian Parliament Deputy Chairman Victor Puscas told the  ITAR- TASS correspondent that the appeal from the Tiraspol  authorities to the Russian parliamentarians bore witness to the  fact that they were unwilling and unable to settle the Dniester  region problem around the negotiating table. "There can be no  question of any confederation," he said. "The Dniester region  problem can and should be resolved within the framework of a  united Moldova by means of granting the left-bank districts  special juridical status."</p>

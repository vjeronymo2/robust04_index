			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, SALINAS TRY TO PUT TRADE PACT ON FAST TRACK;  </P> <P> ECONOMICS: THE PRESIDENTS SHIFT FOCUS FROM DRUGS AND IMMIGRATION. BOTH HOPE TO  HEAD OFF PROTECTIONISTS.  </P> <P> President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Monday opened  two days of meetings intended to put approaching negotiations for a free-trade  agreement on a fast track and to lay the groundwork to head off potential  opposition from special interest groups.  </P> <P> Recognizing the possible roadblocks facing an agreement, Salinas said in an  interview with the Monterrey newspaper El Norte that he is concerned "with some  protectionist attitudes that are arising in the United States," which, he said,  could grow worse if the U.S. economy weakens in a recession.  </P> <P> The two met at the Salinas family's expansive home in the desert ranching  community of Agualeguas, about 40 miles south of the Texas border, before  returning to Monterrey for the night.  </P> <P> Monterrey, Mexico's third-largest city, is an industrial center that was chosen  as the site for the talks to highlight the expectation that U.S.-Mexican trade  will expand beyond its current level of $52 billion a year if an agreement is  reached to drop nearly all tariffs and other trade barriers.  </P> <P> For the 42-year-old Harvard-educated Salinas, the visit by Bush offers an  opportunity to "show he has a special relationship" with the U.S. President --  suddenly a political plus in Mexico after generations of politicians sought to  demonstrate their independence from Washington, a White House official said.  </P> <P> But White House officials made clear that in the view of the Bush  Administration, the journey -- coming right after Bush's exhausting tour of  Europe and the Middle East and one week before a long excursion to South  America -- is little more than a courtesy call demonstrating support for what  they are calling "a new-generation leader."  </P> <P> By turning the spotlight on trade, the visit reflects a recent shift -- perhaps  on the surface, perhaps deeper -- in the political dialogue between the United  States and Mexico. Previous presidential meetings, which occur as often as  every six months, have focused more on such sore points as unchecked Mexican  immigration to the United States and the flow of drugs northward across the  border.  </P> <P> Salinas' surprise announcement during a visit to Washington last June that he  would push for a free-trade agreement has received a warm reception at the  White House and helped shift the focus of the U.S.-Mexican relationship away  from the perennial problems that have defied solution.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater shrugged off the suggestion that  as economic problems in the United States rise, labor unions would press the  Administration to back off a tariff-trimming agreement that would siphon jobs  to cheaper Mexican labor markets.  </P> <P> "We want a free-trade agreement that would create jobs," he said, suggesting  that it would bring long-range benefits to the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Bush is likely to encounter greater difficulties in winning  approval for such an agreement than would Salinas, who already has the support  of a Senate controlled by his Institutional Revolutionary Party.  </P> <P> Negotiations on a trade agreement are expected to begin next spring, with a  goal of wrapping them up in 1992. The agreement, similar to one that went into  effect two years ago with Canada, would be a major step toward Bush's goal of a  hemisphere free-trade zone stretching from Argentina to Canada. On Sunday, the  President will embark on a weeklong trip to Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile  and Venezuela to promote, among other things, his "Enterprise of the Americas"  initiative.  </P> <P> As seen by the White House, elimination of trade barriers would stimulate U.S.  exports, creating jobs at home by boosting production. Mexican tariffs on U.S.  goods already have been reduced from an import-discouraging 100%, in many  cases, to an average of 9%.  </P> <P> From the Mexican viewpoint, an agreement would help stimulate the flow of U.S.  capital to Mexico, bringing with it jobs, technology and management skills --  all benefits to the economy that are needed to discourage emigration. The  government also wants access to U.S. markets for such Mexican goods as  textiles, vegetables and cement.  </P> <P> Two areas that were originally thought to be obstacles to an agreement -- the  flow of Mexican workers to the United States and U.S. investment access to the  lucrative Mexican oil industry -- have been relegated to a back seat in the  negotiations. Salinas has said the trade talks would not deal with Mexican  emigration, and U.S. Special Trade Representative Carla Hills, who accompanied  Bush to Monterrey, said the United States will not demand that the state-owned  oil monopoly be opened to foreign investors.  </P> <P> Bush and Salinas started their day together in Agualeguas, where they attended  a Mexican rodeo at the Lionzo Charro Adriana Margarita arena, named for  Salinas' sister, then watched folk dancing in the town plaza.  </P> <P> They met for lunch and informal private talks at the Salinas residence before  flying by helicopter to Monterrey, where the official start of the state visit  was marked by a hail of confetti and speeches in the city's dramatically lit  main plaza just after sundown.  </P> <P> "Mexico today is the country of manana," Salinas said, "but not because we  leave for later what has to be done. Rather it is because we Mexicans now act  resolutely with our efforts, work and unity to take this great step toward our  new future."  </P> <P> Bush responded, "We want to work together toward the free and open trade so  vital to creating jobs and enterprise in your economy and our own."  </P> <P> At day's end, Fitzwater said that in addition to trade issues, Bush and Salinas  discussed increased U.S.-Mexican cooperation in anti-drug efforts, violence  along the U.S.-Mexican border and developments in El Salvador, where both  nations favor a cease-fire between the government and leftist rebels.  </P></p>

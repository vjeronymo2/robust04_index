			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Agencies strategy for Civil Service THREE QUARTERS of the Civil Service is set to become 'next steps' agencies, operating at arm's length from central government departments by mid 1995, Alison Smith writes. But the annual report on the agencies, published yesterday, makes clear that the government expects there to be little scope for creating further agencies beyond that. The most substantial - and controversial - of the 29 new candidates already identified for agency status is the prison service, which employs 38,000 staff. The planned timescale is that all candidates for agency status, perhaps a further 30 to 50 beyond those already identified, should have been agreed for change by the end of next year, and have been set up within the following 18 months.

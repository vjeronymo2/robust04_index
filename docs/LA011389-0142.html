			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAPMAN, MCFERRIN LEAD GRAMMY RACE;  </P> <P> RECORDING ACADEMY STAYS ON ITS PROGRESSIVE PATH  </P> <P> Tracy Chapman is the odds-on favorite to sweep this year's Grammy Awards  because her socially conscious music is in perfect step with the increasingly  dominant "progressive" wing of the Grammy membership.  </P> <P> Where Grammy voters (artists, musicians, songwriters, producers) once tended to  define pop achievement in a sociological vacuum, the tendency now is to  acknowledge music's role in summarizing and, to some degree, shaping the times  in which we live.  </P> <P> Chapman's folk-flavored tales about the struggles of society's underclass in  her debut album lived up to that philosophy more than any other LP in this  year's eligibility period. Her "Fast Car" was an equally significant single  record.  </P> <P> But there is strong competition in the album and single categories: Sting's ".  . . Nothing but the Sun" album and Michael Jackson's "Man in the Mirror"  single.  </P> <P> The danger is that the progressive-wing vote will split, allowing the more  traditional entries by Anita Baker, Bobby McFerrin, George Michael and Steve  Winwood to emerge the winners. However, the chances of that happening appear  slim.  </P> <P> There was a possibility of two progressive entries canceling each other out  last year when U2's inspiring "The Joshua Tree" and Prince's equally socially  minded "Sign 'O' the Times" were both nominated for best album. But "The Joshua  Tree," quite correctly, won over Prince and three more traditional entries.  </P> <P> The fact that predictions of victory for the likes of U2, the outstanding Irish  rock band, and Chapman can be made with relative confidence show just how far  the Grammy competition has progressed since it was started in 1959.  </P> <P> In the '60s and '70s, the traditionalists who dominated the Grammy balloting  ignored the rock revolution. While some distinguished pop talents (notably  Frank Sinatraand Barbra Streisand) were saluted along the way, the judges often  settled on fairly undistinguished records.  </P> <P> In doing so, they ignored in the key categories the artists who left the  greatest stamp on popular culture. Among them: Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, the  Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, the Beach Boys, James Brown, Otis Redding, the  Byrds.  </P> <P> As younger, more rock-oriented musicians joined the National Academy of  Recording Arts and Sciences (which sponsors the Grammys), the awards began in  the '70s to reflect a balance between the the traditionalists (whose standards  continued to swirl around studio polish, big sales and polite sounds) and the  progressives (who reached out to more socially aggressive and ambitious  contemporary artists).  </P> <P> The argument isn't that original vision or social observation are more  important than traditional craft, but that they are extra dimensions that add  to the power of a record.  </P> <P> There's still conservatism at work in the academy (critical favorites with  radical edges, such as rap stars Public Enemy and rock mavericks Guns N' Roses  have almost no chance in the most prestigious categories), but progress is  certainly being made.  </P> <P> By honoring Paul Simon's "Graceland" album and U2's "The Joshua Tree" in 1987  and 1988 respectively, the judges showed they are on a winning streak. "Tracy  Chapman" should make it three in a row.  </P> <P> Album of the Year: The choice here is between Chapman and Sting. Steve  Winwood's "Roll With It" is a slick, but anonymous collection of largely  undistinguished songs -- and a victory would be a major embarrassment.  </P> <P> George Michael, nominated for "Faith," is certainly a good singer, writer,  producer and arranger, but he has yet to prove he is great in any of the  categories. Bobby McFerrin's "Simple Pleasures" is an extremely likable record,  but its strengths (imaginative vocals and arrangements) should be saluted in  other Grammy categories. The novel a capella versions of mostly familiar tunes  (from the Beatles' "Drive My Car" to Cream's "Sunshine of My Love") simply  don't add up to best album credentials.  </P> <P> Sting's ". . . Nothing but the Sun" would be a worthy choice most years. In the  double-album, Sting balances seriousness of purpose and joyful musicality. But  this is the year of Chapman, a warm and inviting mix of intimate commentary and  sweeping compassion.  </P> <P> The choice here: "Tracy Chapman."  </P> <P> Record of the Year: There's a graceful aura to Anita Baker's "Giving You the  Best That I Got," a delightfully playful edge to McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be  Happy" and a seductive Motown bite to Winwood's "Roll With It," but none of the  records stands as serious competition to two excellent categories: Michael  Jackson's "Man in the Mirror" and Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car."  </P> <P> "Mirror," a dramatic statement about individual responsibility from Jackson's  "Bad" album, lives up to all the tests of a great record: excellence in the  areas of material (it was written by Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard),  arrangement, musicianship and impassioned vocal.  </P> <P> But "Fast Car" -- a magnificently detailed account of a woman, caught in a  poverty cycle, struggling to take control of her own -- offered an even more  compelling and original vision. It's victory should be an inspiring signal to  songwriters everywhere that there is room in the pop world for artists with a  strong, distinctive point of view.  </P> <P> The choice here: "Fast Car."  </P></p>

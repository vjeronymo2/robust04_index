			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Apr (DPA) -- Argentine President  Carlos Menem highlighted tonight (local time) the victory of the  ruling Justicialist Party (PJ-Peronism) in the Constituent  Assembly elections and forecast that the official party and its  allies would have their own majority in the assembly, which will  amend the Constitution during the middle of the year. During a  news conference the president highlighted the PJ victory in 15  of the country's 23 provinces.    The Radical Civic Union (UCR), the main opposition party,  which Peronism signed a pact with to reform the Constitution in  common agreement, won in three districts. The other districts  were won by provincial parties and the Great Front [Frente  Grande -- FG], a center-left coalition that rejected the pact.    Menem stressed that the agreement with the UCR will be  "strictly adhered to" and that "there is not the slightest"  danger, despite the force's low performance [preceding word in  English]. To his way of thinking, the UCR did well in the  elections.    Regarding FG's victory strategy in the federal capital,  Menem  considers that this coalition "correctly interpreted" the  message of the people of Buenos Aires. "We will attempt to make  certain corrections, because this serves democracy," Menem said.    Nevertheless, Menem stressed that Argentina is "not the  federal capital. [sentence as received] It is a victory that  can be overcome and I want to congratulate them, but we have to  reckon with it." Menem said that the FG, which he described as  "Marxist and Trotskyite" in mid-campaign, can become an  important force at the national level. He did not rule out  dialogue with this sector of the opposition.    According to the president, the reports of alleged illegal  dealings by the official Buenos Aires candidate Matilde Menendez  did not affect results in the capital. "Argentines do not vote  out of spite," he said.    Menem asked himself: "How are we, the winners, going to make  self-criticism?" Menem was replying to a question about the  bitter election experience, wherein the ruling party won 42  percent of the votes, an amount similar to what was attained in  the October 1993 elections to renew parliament. In this  connection Menem recalled that Peronism won in the provinces  that suffered social outbreaks in 1993, such as Santiago del  Estero or San Luis, where Governor Adolfo Rodriguez Saa was  involved in a sexual scandal.    Regarding the 6 percent who cast blank votes, Menem said  that  this made no sense in a country where there is freedom and no  restrictions.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Bankruptcies in Japan rise by 3.9% JAPANESE corporate bankruptcies in April rose 3.9 per cent year-on-year, but the amount of outstanding debt was 55.9 per cent lower than a year earlier and property- related bankruptcies fell sharply. Bankruptcies linked to the downturn in the Japanese economy, as distinct from speculative failures, accounted for 61 per cent of the 1,154 cases last month, according to Teikoku Data Bank, a private research agency. Another sign of the continuing downturn was a 10.3 per cent fall last month in Tokyo department store sales, with weakening demand for most lines and, in particular, for luxury goods and more expensive household products. The Japan Department Stores Association said the sales fall in April was the 14th consecutive month of year-on-year decline, and reflects the lack of confidence of Japanese consumers, whose spending has fallen as overtime hours have been reduced and job security threatened. Bankruptcies of retailers were also 23.7 per cent higher than in the same month last year, and a fall in sales was identified as the cause of 47.7 per cent of last month's failures, which left liabilities of Y337.67bn (Pounds 1.99bn) down 55.9 per cent. Property company bankruptcies, at 56 cases, were at their lowest level since January 1991 and, by value at Y54.7bn, the lowest since November 1990, when the collapse in property prices began to take a toll on the country's more aggressive developers. Teikoku Data Bank suggested that the recent appreciation of the yen was likely to lead to increasing bankruptcies in currency-sensitive industries, such as suppliers of parts to exporters, while there was no sign that the slump in consumer confidence is nearing an end. In Japan's latest influence-peddling scandal, the Tokyo District Court sentenced a businessman yesterday to five years and six months in prison for giving Y90m in bribes to a former cabinet minister, AP adds. Mr Goro Moriguchi, a former vice-president of Kyowa, a steel-frame maker, admitted that he gave the cash bribes to Mr Fumio Abe, a former senior political ally of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister. Mr Masaru Suda, the presiding judge, told the court Mr Moriguchi handed over the bribes in return for favours while Mr Abe headed the Hokkaido Development Agency in 1990. Mr Suda also accused Mr Moriguchi of swindling trading companies out of Y6.9bn by tricking them into making advance payments for transactions involving Kyowa. The company is now bankrupt.</p>

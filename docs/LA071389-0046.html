			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> A company featuring American operatic artists has arrived in Beijing to present  the first prominent American cultural event there since the military crackdown  on pro-democracy demonstrators last month. Although there is a U.S. travel  advisory in effect for China, Joann Grillo, managing director of Ambassadors of  Opera and Concert Worldwide, said, "No one in our government told us not to  come. In fact, every American embassy and official along the way has encouraged  us as a step toward friendship and peace." The Ambassadors of Opera and Concert  Worldwide, an independent company, has staged operas and musicals throughout  the world since 1983. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Italian government decides bolster security forces in Sicily THE Italian government decided at the weekend to send 7,000 troops to Sicily to bolster the security forces in their operations against the Mafia on the island, writes Robert Graham. The use of the army marks a significant escalation in the fight against organised crime; it is the first time in the post-second world war era that army personnel have been deployed in this way. The troops will protect public buildings, high-risk personnel and conduct searches. The move follows the Sicilian Mafia's increasingly brazen defiance of the state. The organisation is considered responsible for the assassination of Italy's two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, along with eight of their bodyguards, in the past two months.</p>

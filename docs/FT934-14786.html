			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Benetton sells 10% stake in banking arm THE BENETTON family has agreed to let Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto) take a 10 per cent stake in 21,Investimenti, their merchant banking arm. 21,Investimenti, owned by the Benettons through their main holding, Edizone Holding, was formed two years ago with a L40bn (Dollars 25.1m) capital. Ambroveneto is expected to pay L6bn for the shareholding, which in turn will prompt a capital increase. Benetton, Italy's biggest producer of casual clothes, has used 21,Investimenti to invest in high-quality brand names that coincide with the group's sport and green life-style image. The investments include a 50 per cent stake in TWR, the UK sports car company. Ambroveneto is Italy's largest private bank. It is one of the first instances of an Italian bank taking advantage of new legislation permitting them to invest directly in businesses.</p>

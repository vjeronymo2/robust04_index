			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Prescott shifts focus to redistribution of work The Labour party will have to focus on redistribution of work as much as redistribution of wealth, Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday. He said the market was distributing work unsatisfactorily between the employed and the unemployed and between full-time and part-time workers. In recent years 3m full-time jobs had been replaced by 1.5m part-time and 1.5m self-employed. Since taking over as employment spokesman after the party conference last year, Mr Prescott has had a relatively low profile on labour market issues, with the exception of harrying the government on the issue of unemployment statistics. However, he may bring some new thinking on employment issues - likely to further his reputation as a moderniser in traditionalist clothing. The new thinking, under the title Jobs and Social Justice, will be spelt out in a formal Labour party reply to the European Commission's green paper on social policy published at the end of last year. Mr Prescott says new thinking on the Continent is coming from 'the Keyneses and Beveridges of our time'. The Labour document is likely to concentrate on establishing new links between employment and social security to take account of changes in working and family lives. Mr Prescott, in his second stint as employment spokesman, has coined the slogan 'back to principles' and has no qualms about traditional concepts such as returning to 'full employment'. But he is evidently riled by the fact that Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, who took over the employment portfolio in the late 1980s, was seen as a brave new thinker while he was regarded as the image of labourist orthodoxy. He is happy enough now to insist that 'Labour must look after the interests of all employees and potential employees not just those people in unions or with secure jobs'. He is even prepared to criticise Usdaw, the shopworkers union, for doing a deal with the big retailers over Sunday working which ensures generous overtime for existing workers at the expense of new jobs. As the mastermind behind Labour's ideas on private/public partnership, Mr Prescott is keen not to be too overshadowed by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, and Mr Robin Cook, shadow industry spokesman, on broader economic issues.</p>

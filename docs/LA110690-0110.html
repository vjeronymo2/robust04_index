			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A DEFICIT-SPENDER  </P> <P> Idon't understand what conclusion to draw from the Sept. 30 article about James  Salomon, Republican candidate for Congress running against Anthony Beilenson.  </P> <P> Are we to vote for him because we feel sorry for him? After all, he was wealthy  and made a great deal of money and now he has no income.  </P> <P> Or are we to be aghast at a man who wants to go to Congress and deal with the  national deficit who doesn't seem to be able to set his own financial house in  order:  </P> <P> * With no income he drives a $60,000 Cadillac.  </P> <P> * He seems to have reneged on child support.  </P> <P> * He failed to pay a $50,000 promissory note to a former business partner.  </P> <P> * He writes checks that bounce.  </P> <P> * And he has piddled away twice as much money as Beilenson has raised long  before the election.  </P> <P> On second thought, maybe he'll fit right in with the most of Congress. He seems  to be an expert on deficit spending and wasting other people's money.  </P> <P> ELEANOR B. GORNON, Studio City  </P></p>

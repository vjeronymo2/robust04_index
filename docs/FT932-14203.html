			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Pinning its future on launching trusts - The refocused Ivory &amp; Sime is planning to reassert itself THE past 10 years have not been easy for Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund management company whose star was once among the brightest in the investment firmament. But now the company is moving to reassert itself in the product which has been at the heart of its success, the investment trust. Yesterday, Ivory &amp; Sime launched its first investment trust in four years after having remained in the background while competitor after competitor came to the market with increasingly sophisticated products. The trust, to be known as Income and Savings Investment Schemes, is expected to raise Pounds 100m in new funds, and features an investment twist which allows investors to capitalise on the more generous treatment of capital gains tax. Mr Gordon Neilly, finance director, said the company intends to launch as many as four more trusts, one possibly as early as June, all of which will be aimed at private investors rather than institutional clients. 'We see the return of the private investor as crucial to our strategy,' said Mr Neilly, adding that he wants to increase the percentage of retail investment trust business from its current level of 30 per cent. Competition for institutional buyers of investment trusts has become much tougher since many fund managers began running their own internal products, Mr Neilly said, explaining why he wished to change the company's focus. Other products are also likely to offer tax efficiency as a selling point. Mr Neilly said the company has sat on the sidelines for so long 'because we felt the time wasn't right and we didn't have the right product'. But pension consultants say the company has also been too preoccupied with its internal difficulties to concentrate on new product development or marketing. 'Ten years ago, they were winning half of all the assignments out there,' said one pension fund consultant. But a string of well-publicised defections of senior management - who in the mid-1980s managed to take many of the company's best clients with them - had left the firm floundering. Investment performance suffered, and pension fund clients in particular deserted it, consultants said. The firm soldiered on through some tough years before refocusing its institutional business and sharpening its expertise as an equities-oriented specialist pension fund manager. By 1990, when Ivory &amp; Sime had begun to recover in the performance league tables and had set about assembling a high-quality investment team, it was hit again by defections. This time the former managing director, Mr David Ross, left with a string of five senior executives to set up a new firm, Aberforth Partners. The former chairman left as a result, and the company now has a completely new board of directors. Although the more recent defections did not appear to affect fund performance - consultants say their specialist funds have achieved top half performance over the past three or four years - new pension clients have not been knocking at the door. 'All of our new business has been from existing clients,' Mr Neilly said. In addition to broadening its product range, Ivory &amp; Sime has taken the unusual step of acquiring a telemarketing distribution company. The company answers inquiries from potential clients who have responded to the company's targetted newspaper advertising campaign. Mr Neilly said he believes that up to 25 per cent of all sales of Ivory &amp; Sime's new ISIS product will come through the distribution company, saving considerable costs. Ivory &amp; Sime, according to one pension consultant, is living proof of the axiom that no one investment star is likely to shine in the firmament indefinitely. The question for the company is whether it can make its star shine once again.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 110(m), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  provides the Administrator with discretion to impose sanctions at any time on any portion of the State that she determines is reasonable and appropriate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 42 U.S.C. section 7410(m).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 179(a) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requires the Administrator to impose sanctions after specific timeframes if the deficiencies on which the sanctions are based are not corrected. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 42 U.S.C. section 7509(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It is necessary, for clarity's sake, to understand that section 179(a) performs two very distinct functions: it defines several types of findings, and requires EPA to impose sanctions if one of these findings has been made. Section 179(a) (1) through (4) sets forth the four types of findings which may lead to the imposition of a sanction. The introduction and latter part of section 179(a) mandate that at least one sanction must be imposed 18 months after a finding has been made with respect to certain types of plans if the deficiency is not corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking considers the application of sanctions under section 110(m). However, because section 110(m) and section 179 are interrelated, the preamble to the proposed rulemaking discussed sanctions under section 179 (a) and (b) in order to clarify what is required by section 110(m).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The specific types of sanctions which may be imposed under section 110(m), or must be imposed under section 179(a), are listed in section 179(b). The two sanctions provided are a highway funding sanction and a 2:1 offset sanction. These two sanctions are described in more detail in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 57 FR 44535).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 179(b) sanctions may be applied pursuant to section 110(m) when the Administrator makes a finding under section 179(a) (1) through (4), provided that the Agency has followed all procedural requirements for imposing a sanction. The Administrator has no authority under section 110(m), nor any mandatory duty under section 179(a), to impose sanctions until she has made a finding. The types of findings provided under section 179(a) are discussed in more detail in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 57 FR 44535).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 110(m) may be divided into two distinct parts (see 57 FR 44535). The first part of section 110(m) contains four distinct elements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The timing of the imposition of section 110(m) sanctions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The availability under section 110(m) of the sanctions listed in section 179(b);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The reference to a finding, disapproval, or determination under section 179(a) (1) through (4); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The geographic scope of application of sanctions under section 110(m).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The second part requires the Administrator to propose criteria to be used when considering the application of sanctions on a statewide basis under section 110(m) within 24 months of a section 179(a) finding. Although not central to the purpose of this rulemaking, EPA presented a detailed discussion of the four elements referred to in the first part of section 110(m) in the proposed rule. The purpose was to explain how sections 110(m) and 179 provisions are interrelated. As shall be evident in the ``Response to Comments'' section, the preamble language discussing these four elements was the basis for numerous comments. The criteria, which are the basis of this action, seemed to generate significantly fewer comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Development of Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second sentence of section 110(m) requires the Agency to establish criteria that EPA must apply if the Agency considers applying sanctions under section 110(m) on a statewide basis within 24 months of a section 179(a) finding. These criteria should enable EPA to determine when a political subdivision, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  rather than the entire State, is principally responsible for a section 179(a) deficiency. Where the political subdivision is principally responsible, EPA may not impose sanctions on a statewide basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;52.30(a)(1), EPA defines the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> political subdivision <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  as ``*&blank;*&blank;* the representative body that is responsible for adopting and/or implementing air pollution controls for one, or any combination of one or more of the following: city, town, borough, county, parish, district, or any other geographical subdivision created by, or pursuant to, Federal or State law. This will include any agency designated under section 174, 42 U.S.C., section 7504, by the State to carry out the air planning responsibilities under part D.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA recognizes that an understanding of the term ``principal responsibility'' was integral to the development of the criteria. The preamble to the proposed rule contains a detailed discussion on how a political subdivision may be held ``principally responsible'' for a section 179(a) failure when the EPA recognizes that the States have primary responsibility for meeting the requirements of the Act (see 57 FR 44535&hyph;36). The EPA believes that the criteria promulgated today will clearly indicate when the political subdivision carries the principal burden of carrying out an activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is promulgating five criteria (summarized below) that it believes will enable a determination of when a State has relinquished its primary control over an activity to a political subdivision and the political subdivision has failed to perform that required activity. The EPA believes that the political subdivision is principally responsible when the political subdivision:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Has the legal authority to perform the required activity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform, the required activity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Has received, where appropriate, adequate funding or authority to obtain funding from the State to perform the required activity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Has agreed to perform (and has not revoked that agreement) or is required to accept responsibility for performing the required activity; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dagenham Motors ahead 16% to Pounds 1.3m DESPITE extremely tough market conditions in all sectors of the business, Dagenham Motors Group increased pre-tax profit by 16 per cent, from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.3m, in the first half of 1993. This London and south-east Ford main dealer saw new car sales volume rise 9 per cent, used car sales 7 per cent and commercial vehicles 69 per cent. Backed up by after-sales activities ahead 15 per cent, total turnover advanced 12 per cent to Pounds 84.9m (Pounds 75.6m). Mr David Philip, chairman, said heavy price reductions, lower interest rates, and an improvement in the market place contributed to the increase in new car sales. The loss-making dealerships in 1992 at Enfield and Stevenage made a positive contribution and continued to show encouraging signs of improved profitability, the company said. The security division again increased its contribution but that was partly offset by lower profits at Brownings as a result of more pressure on margins. On the outlook, Mr Philip said the group had the opportunity to achieve substantially better results than in the same period last year, provided there was no repeat of the difficult trading conditions experienced in the latter part of 1992. Earnings per share came to 5p (4.4p) and the interim dividend is again 1.75p.</p>

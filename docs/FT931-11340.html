			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Dam takes root Vetiver, a coarse tropical grass, is the most practical solution to the global problem of soil erosion, which destroys millions of hectares of farmland every year, the US National Research Council said last week. That conclusion vindicates a campaign by a small group of agriculturalists in the World Bank's Asia division, who have been extolling the virtues of vetiver for more than 10 years, in face of widespread scientific scepticism. Vetiver, a native of India, is best known for the fragrance extracted from its roots for use in soaps and perfumes. But, according to the NRC, a hedge of vetiver planted across a hillside makes a superb 'botanical dam' that can hold soil in place and withstand the run-off from torrential downpours over a period of decades. Its roots go more than two metres into the ground and the tough blade-like leaves grow two metres high. One advantage of vetiver is that the grass exists in sterile forms which stay in place for decades without spreading. In contrast, some other plants used to curb erosion have rampaged out of control. Although vetiver's native habitat is hot and humid, the plant is astonishingly adaptable, says the NRC. It has performed well in poor soils in dry countries and has even withstood frost in the southern US and China. But the NRC calls for more research to breed varieties suitable for cold climates. 'I was sceptical at first,' says Norman Borlaug - winner of a Nobel Prize for his contribution to the 'green revolution' - who chaired the NRC investigation of vetiver. 'But I've seen vetiver at work. And I know that in these times of great ecological concern about what is happening to our soil because of erosion, vetiver could indeed play a very useful role in many places.' The NRC calls for vetiver to be put into widespread use without delay. Field trials should test a variety of new applications, including protecting roads and railways from flooding and landslides. The grass is already being planted in the Philippines to help re-stabilise roads destroyed by the 1990 earthquake in northern Luzon.</p>

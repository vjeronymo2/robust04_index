			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Germany The natural assumption is that yesterday's German rate cut must be driven by developments on the foreign exchanges. It is difficult to see anything on the domestic horizon which would have suggested any particular urgency. The Bundesbank still had leeway to continue cutting its repurchase rate; M3 money supply is growing at an annualised rate of 15.4 per cent; inflation is above 3 per cent and there is a whiff of recovery in the air. Curiously the Bundesbank is now adopting an argument, which it ignored last year, that high short-term interest rates are deterring investors from moving out along the yield curve and so keeping bond yields up. A desire to underpin the dollar after last week's intervention looks an altogether more plausible motivation. That has some relevance to the domestic scene. The strength of the D-mark and rise in bond yields since the start of the year amount to an effective monetary tightening, while a weak dollar could choke off an export-led recovery. It is less clear whether the markets will be convinced, or that investors will be keen to buy German bonds while the uncertainty in the US market continues. Perhaps a generous German rate cut will hasten the return of calm by reducing the scope of US monetary tightening required to stabilise the dollar. But that is a pretty tenuous argument, and not necessarily one for the Bundesbank to risk its anti-inflation credibility on.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Menvier-Swain signals interest in Scantronic Menvier-Swain Group, the emergency lighting and alarms manufacturer, yesterday signalled its interest in bidding for Scantronic Holdings, a competitor. Menvier-Swain purchased 550,000 ordinary shares in Scantronic, raising its stake to 1.64m shares, or 4.49 per cent of the security components company. Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said: 'Menvier-Swain has taken this stake in good faith to demonstrate our genuine interest as a potential bidder for Scantronic. 'At present we are seeking a serious dialogue with Scantronic's board and we believe that both sets of shareholders would welcome such a dialogue.' Scantronic is hoping to raise Pounds 2.8m via borrowings and a placing and open offer of 16.1m new shares. Last week it forecast pre-tax losses of about Pounds 2.4m for the half-year to September 30, against Pounds 1.4m profits previously. The company has been saddled with increasing debt from acquisitions. At the end of June it had Pounds 11.2m of debt, against Pounds 3.5m in March 1993. Scantronic announced the resignation of Mr Ray Dias, finance director, the following month. The directors do not expect to make any dividend payments, including preference payments, this year. The shares rose 2 1/2 p to 20p yesterday. Menvier-Swain increased pre-tax profits by 23 per cent to Pounds 9.36m in the year to April, on sales of Pounds 70.3m. Its shares closed down 2p at 260p.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> OUT &amp; ABOUT;  </P> <P> TAHITI IN SILVER LAKE  </P> <P> TAKE A TINY SHACK. Add a bar, a few stools and some tables.  </P> <P> Mix in an outrageous assortment of authentic Polynesian artifacts and a  sprinkling of such '60s-abilia as a lava lamp and a wave machine and what have  you got? Silver Lake's Tiki-Ti. Four nights a week, Ray and Mike (the heralded  father-and-son team) tend bar, creating unique tropical drinks (no beer or  wine) with names as colorful as the decor. Order a Ray's Mistake (named after  Ray, of course, who started the bar in 1961 and created most of the recipes) or  a coconutty Bayanihan -- a popular selection that's the closest thing to  paradise east of Tahiti.  </P> <P>  Tiki-Ti, 4427 Sunset Blvd., Silver Lake; (213) 669-9381.

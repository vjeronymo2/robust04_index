			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Growth forecasts pass 4% mark Two leading City securities houses have increased their forecasts for UK economic growth next year to more than 4 per cent. If the forecasts are proved correct the UK will enjoy economic growth on a scale not seen since the 'Lawson boom' of the mid-1980s. SG Warburg's research team has increased its forecast for 1995 growth from 3.8 per cent to 4.5 per cent - the highest prediction from the City - after a rate of just over 4 per cent this year. The main reason for the higher forecast is a better export performance. The long-term trend growth rate of the economy is normally believed to be between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent. Economists say a long period of above-trend growth - such as from 1985 to 1988, when growth was 4 per cent or above in every year - eventually brings inflation. That has certainly been the view of the team at UBS, led by Mr Bill Martin. UBS has increased its 1995 GDP growth forecast to 4.25 per cent. But while UBS previously felt that the economy would overheat next year, it now predicts this problem will not occur until 1996. 'This forecast change therefore offers postponment rather than absolution from a day of reckoning,' said Mr Martin. The SG Warburg team thinks that underlying inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) will be 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of next year and 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1996. Such a modest acceleration would still mean that the government failed to achieve its aim of reducing inflation to the lower half of its 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range by the end of this parliament. Meanwhile, a third securities house, Kleinwort Benson, has also increased its GDP forecast for next year, but only to 2.7 per cent from 2.2 per cent.</p>

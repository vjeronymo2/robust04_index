			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Teleworking gets muted response Top managers like the idea of the 'information superhighway' but are far from enthusiastic about some of the services that it is expected to pioneer, a survey by James R Adams and Associates, a London-based consultancy, shows. There was little enthusiasm for teleworking - working from home using a personal computer connected by telephone to the office - in the survey of 100 managers chosen from the UK's top 1,000 companies. Two-thirds of the sample said they would not be able to do their jobs from home. 'Nor would they want to, even if they could,' the survey says. 'Most of these attitudes stemmed from benevolent feelings towards the workplace, largely of a social nature. The most attractive aspect of working from home was to avoid commuting.' Most of the respondents believed that the superhighway would be beneficial for their companies. A quarter of those answering thought it would do a 'great deal of good' and a third 'some good'. Home shopping received a muted response because of the perceived costs of distribution.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Deal in the air ALTHOUGH British Airways yesterday secured one big advance in its global strategy, the purchase of a stake in Qantas, the prospects are not bright for its plan to buy 44 per cent of USAir, the sixth largest American carrier. The proposed deal is on Mr John Major's agenda for his talks this weekend with President George Bush, but the signs are that insufficient progress has been made at lower levels to permit the two leaders to provide the final push. BA and USAir have said the bid will lapse on December 24 if it is not approved by then. If the bid falls, it will be a pity. Opportunities to shift the logjam preventing Britain and the US from securing what they both say they want - a liberal agreement on transatlantic air services - do not present themselves every day. The UK government's desire to see BA establish itself in the US market should have been and perhaps still can be the occasion for Washington to prise open the British air market to the advantage of consumers in both countries. The three largest American airlines have led resistance to the deal because they fear that BA, which is gaining increasing freedom to operate within the EC, is skilfully aiming to establish itself, from its powerful Heathrow base, as the world's leading airline. This, they say, is not fair since US airlines are restricted in Britain and the rest of the EC. They also argue that the BA-USAir deal would be illegal in allowing effective control of a US carrier to pass into the hands of foreigners. This latter issue is of the type which makes lawyers rich, since both sides have a plausible case. The UK's latest bid to advance the argument is to offer a three-stage liberalisation, first involving immediate access for US carriers to Britain's regional airports, conditional only upon approval of the BA-USAir deal. This would be followed by the opening up of transatlantic routes to Gatwick and Stansted airports, in return for the US easing its rules on foreign ownership of US airlines. Finally, at an unspecified date, the two countries would complete an 'open skies' agreement, in which US carriers would have unrestricted access to Heathrow. Although the US airlines have overstated their argument, there is no doubt that they have a case on the most crucial issue, access to Heathrow, where congestion is so great and BA's grip so firm that even a formal lifting of restrictions would not guarantee access to adequate take-off and landing slots. Although BA regards its Heathrow position as non-negotiable, Mr Major should not hesitate to place it on the table. If the BA-USAir deal can be the trigger for a big bang in liberalising transatlantic air services, it is worth fighting for. If not, not.</p>

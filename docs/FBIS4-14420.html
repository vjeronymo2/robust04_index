			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking at the Russian State Duma today, Polish  Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said that different approaches to the  NATO Partnership for Peace [PFP] program should not lead to  disagreements between the two countries.    In Oleksy's words, Poland is against any security concept  that does not take account of Russia's interests. A policy of  isolating Moscow is irrational. At the same time the Sejm  speaker emphasized that Poland wants NATO membership, in which  it sees a basis for strategic security. Duma Defense Committee  Chairman Sergey Yushenkov in his turn thinks that the NATO PFP  plan pushes the European CSCE security system into the  background. In theory, Yushenkov noted, all European countries  should have equal rights in building collective security.</p>

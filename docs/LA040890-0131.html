			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMRADE SMIRNOFF, BACK IN THE U.S.S.R.;  </P> <P> AN AMERICAN COMEDIAN RETURNS TO HIS NATIVE LAND -- THE BUTT OF HIS JOKES -- TO  TAPE A TV SPECIAL  </P> <P> Sporting fluorescent-Hawaiian-flowered swim trunks, black-framed sunglasses on  cords, blue sun-block and a plastic fluorescent orange peaked cap, Yakov  Smirnoff does not look like a man on a mission.  </P> <P> In fact, the former Soviet citizen-turned-American comedian looks downright out  of place at Moscow's all-season outdoor swimming pool.  </P> <P> Surrounded by pensioners in make-do swim suits, Smirnoff is setting a new high  in conspicuous consumption. To the comrades' further annoyance, Smirnoff has  toys: a fluorescent-orange Frisbee and a multicolor skateboard.  </P> <P> These are just a few of the tools Smirnoff has in his diplomatic handbag on his  first trip to his homeland since he and his parents immigrated to the United  States in 1977. While in the Soviet Union, he has taped location pieces in  Moscow and in Odessa for a Showtime special to be shown later this year in the  United States.  </P> <P> Among the purposes of his mission: introduce Soviets to the real American  culture. Not the stuff of orchestra exchange programs, but the real stuff.  Among the tools at hand: stuffed slippers adorned with Ronald Reagans; dancing  flowers, Hula Hoops, footballs, Frisbees, Slinkys, skateboards, miniature  airplanes, Twinkies and Juicy Fruit.  </P> <P> Smirnoff hopes the candid conversations he is holding with Soviets will give  Americans a new view. "Americans think Soviets are so grim. I want them to see  that they can smile."  </P> <P> Smirnoff's film crew follows him around in his escapades with everyday Soviets  -- standing in line at McDonald's, playing football with militiamen in Red  Square and talking to students. In the TV program, Smirnoff will narrate in  English over the Russian conversations.  </P> <P> "I want it to be funny. The deepness in the message will still come through.  The message is there's a flower of free enterprise here. This is our Berlin  Wall, if you will. It's small and weak still, but it's there."  </P> <P> It's been 12 years since Smirnoff left his native Odessa on the Black Sea and  landed in New York. Since then he has gone from busing at restaurants to  starring in Miller Lite commercials, a syndicated television series ("What a  Country!") and a movie ("Moscow on the Hudson").  </P> <P> Is it easy to return as every would-be immigrant's dream-come-true? Considering  he's made a living off taking digs at Soviets, there was the question of  whether he would be welcome. "It wasn't hard to get in. Now we just have to see  if I'll get out," he says.  </P> <P> He admits to having had knots in his stomach when he was taking off from  Kennedy Airport in New York. "All of a sudden all of these things you left  behind are (emotionally) coming back."  </P> <P> And a lot of "these things" aren't pretty. The day he applied for a Soviet exit  visa, Smirnoff lost his job as a comedian on Black Sea cruise ships. He waited  two years to get out.  </P> <P> For 26 years, Smirnoff lived in a communal apartment building, in one room  shared with his parents ("I guess that's why I'm an only child"). Now he owns a  Hollywood mansion with swimming pool and live peacocks roaming the grounds. "I  bought it as a fixer-upper under the five-year plan. To my real estate agent,  Chernobyl is a fixer-upper."  </P> <P> He was on the waiting list for a Soviet car for 13 years. Now he drives a Rolls  Royce with vanity plates that read "Comrade." And he was on a waiting list for  a phone for 12 years. "I never got that either."  </P> <P> But it wasn't the tough economics that Smirnoff hated most. "It was not being  able to say what I wanted to say."  </P> <P> Once a year Smirnoff turned in the script for his show to the censors at the  Department of Jokes, under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture. You had to  stick with whatever came out of there, he says. You couldn't take a chance on  ad-libbing. "People have been taken away for less than a joke here," he points  out. "At least that was what the fear was."  </P> <P> Smirnoff remembers his last comedy show in Odessa at the 6,000-seat Green  Theatre. It was April 1, 1977, just before he was to get permission to leave  for New York. "I had started working again, and they were risking their jobs  and paying me under the table. The system is so big. It sounds like they're  watching every move you make, but a lot of times they don't know what they're  doing. So I got away with it."  </P> <P> He says he has mixed feelings about returning to Odessa. "I came to America to  make it my home, and I did. So it's not like I'm returning home. I'm not sure  of what I'm looking forward to about going back to Odessa. Most people will be  looking for what things I can give them," he says sadly. "I know I used to when  people came back from the West."  </P> <P> What does he think about Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the man who made  such visits as Smirnoff's possible with his policies of glasnost and  perestroika?  </P> <P> "He's changed a lot of things. In his anti-alcohol campaign he raised the legal  drinking age from 2 to 4. You know there are 100,000 alcohol-related collisions  a year here, and they don't even have cars."  </P> <P> But now Smirnoff is serious. He thinks Lithuania is pushing Gorbachev to the  wall and should slow down. "No matter what happens, he gave Soviets a taste of  freedom, and now they can never go back. But the Lithuanians have got to watch  out. You can't push. Look at what happened to the students in China. Ten years  of improvements were lost."  </P> <P> What kind of jokes is he telling here? Certainly not anti-Russian ones.  </P> <P> "No one could tell political jokes. No one could tell government jokes. No one  could tell TV evangelical jokes. You had to be funny without dirty language,  political, religious or bodily function humor."  </P> <P> What's left? Mother-in-law and animal jokes. You know: "A little ant got  married to a female elephant and she died on their wedding night. And the ant  says: 'I only enjoyed myself for one night and now I have to spend the rest of  my life digging this grave.' "  </P> <P> Smirnoff can't believe the changes in the U.S.S.R. "Some things are the same.  There's still no food in the stores. But other things . . . you know we used to  have to put pillows over our phones (where the microphones are hidden) before  we would tell a joke in a house. Now they're selling matryoshka dolls (the kind  where one fits inside another) . . . with Stalin inside of Lenin and so on,  down to Yeltsin inside of Gorbachev. And comedians here are making fun of the  Communist Party.  </P> <P> "You know there's so much humor here. I asked for an apple the other day and  our Soviet crew members laughed. I said what's so funny. They said the Soviet  Union is the only place where one word can make you laugh -- because those  things aren't available here. You can't get them."  </P> <P> Smirnoff is trying to flag down a taxi. He waves and waves and they keep  whizzing by. He runs out onto the street. They still whiz by. He chases them.  They don't stop. Now he pulls out a package of Marlboros and, in a shot that is  not set up, a taxi screeches to a halt, practically running him down. There's  no Marlboros here, either.  </P> <P> In fact there's not much of anything here, but Smirnoff thinks there's material  for comedy. Maybe another 12 years' worth.  </P> <P>  Smirnoff returned to Los Angeles this past week.  </P> <P> </P></p>

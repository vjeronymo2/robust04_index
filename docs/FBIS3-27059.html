			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference held by Taiwan President Li Teng-hui with </F> unidentified correspondents at Taoyuan Chiang Kai-shek  International Airport on 16 February]    [Summary From Poor Reception] In his opening speech,  President Li Teng-hui says the main purpose of his informal  visit was to gain a true understanding of the international  situation, in particular the international economic situation  following the end of the Cold War. The Republic of China [ROC]  must further strengthen regional economic cooperation with other  countries, and this is the true way to promote China's economy  to a new level of development. Therefore, he believes it  necessary to spend his holidays in relevant countries with which  the ROC has no diplomatic relations, discussing regional  economic cooperation. Li adds: "The visit produced fairly good  results. I think it is very important for establishing  all-directional economic cooperation in Asia in the future." Li  goes on to state that he learned by his visit that the respect  shown by these three countries toward the Republic of China in  Taiwan is "more than we can imagine at home." He also thanks  the leaders of the three countries for their hospitality during  his visit. The president expresses regret over not being able  to visit the overseas Chinese in these countries, saying he had  to "respect the host countries' arrangements." Li states that  "China's further development must be separated from ideology,"  pointing out the orientation -- "peace, cooperation, and  prosperity" -- for efforts to be made. Li concludes: "We  helped the mainland achieve development just like we helped  Southeast Asia achieve progress and development. We expect to  use Taiwan's experience to help the entire Asian region achieve  progress and development."    Commenting on a Central News Agency reporter's question  regarding the president's emphasis on "pragmatic diplomacy,"  letting other countries know about the ROC's existence, and on a  reasonable position within the international community,  President Li replies that the countries he visited adopted a  very pragmatic attitude to discussing Communist China's protest.  He says they know the ROC is a peace-loving country, and wish  to make friends with it. He calls for patience and long-term  efforts in this regard.    In response to a question on ideology raised by a reporter  from the Taiwan Television Enterprise, Ltd., President Li  Teng-hui urges all Chinese to understand that the ROC must  develop, and that the ROC is a state separate from China. He  asks people not to consider his "unofficial visit" as "creating  one China, one Taiwan, or two China's." "Quite obviously, that  is impossible," he concludes.    A reporter for the Broadcasting Corporation of China asks if  Li has any plans for a second trip abroad in the same informal  manner following his great success in the Southeast Asia visit  he just concluded. President Li replies: "I will visit  countries with which we have official diplomatic relations, and  I will visit countries with which we have unofficial relations."  He says it is still too early to say at the moment, but the  press will learn about such plans in due course once all  preparations are completed.    A reporter for TZU LI WAN PAO quotes the memoirs of Hsu  Chia-t'un [Xu Jiatun], former director of the Hong Kong Branch  of the NEW CHINA [XINHUA] NEWS AGENCY, as saying the PRC  leadership considers Taiwan's vigorous efforts to occupy  international space as aimed at gaining independence in a  disguised form, and the PRC does not agree. The attitude of the  Chinese Communist leadership will certainly affect the  president's informal visit as well as regional political and  economic activities, the reporter adds. He asks President Li if  the latter has any policy or countermeasures against such an  attitude.    In his response, President Li questions the reliability of  Hsu Chia-t'un's remarks. "It is very hard to judge future  trends on the mainland by his remarks," Li says.    Responding to a question by a CHUNG YANG JIH PAO reporter on  regional economic cooperation, President Li says he discussed  the establishment of free economic zones in the Philippines and  rural construction in Indonesia, and the ROC's experiences in  promoting development on Taiwan over the past few decades is  very valuable to these countries.    A reporter from LIEN HO PAO asks Li about protests from  Communist China against his informal visit. President Li says  every country in the world is "very practical" and attaches  importance to its own economic development. He urges people not  to treat the issue as "very serious." Li says: "The ROC is a  mature country. I do not think it is necessary for us to flinch  on account of such a minor issue as an immature statement."    In response to a question by a TAIWAN JIH PAO reporter on  the  ROC's overseas investments, President Li states the ROC still  needs to rely on foreign trade to promote economic development  as it is a country without natural resources. He points out  that there is no so-called southern or western policy, and the  ROC must work in all directions so long as they are conducive to  further development. He adds: "We want to invest in the  mainland, Indonesia, and the Philippines. All these investment  projects are different from each other." Li stresses: "We must  understand the ROC wants to develop trade. It is the most  important factor for economic development. If we want to  increase the trade volume, we must transfer our capital, which  is the most favorable condition enjoyed by the ROC now, to all  relevant countries. After our capital is transferred, the  volume of our trade will naturally increase."    A reporter asks President Li for his thoughts about the  trip.  President Li replies that during his visits to the Philippines  and Indonesia, local officials called him Doctor Li or Professor  Li. The president notes: "The main reason is quite simple.  Whether they are ministers or business leaders, they know Li  Teng-hui accomplished many things in the academic field or in  Taiwan's agricultural development, and all this proved very  successful." Li then talks about how he sent two of his books  to a foreign leader, saying: "To me, it is very significant  that other people respect my past works in the academic field  and in other areas. It is very pleasant if one can help his  country by his personal achievements or by what he has done.  [words indistinct] I am already at this age; the fire from this  candle will burn for the people of my country and for this  region so they can live in stability and so their standard of  living can improve. I think this is very [?good]. Thank you."    A reporter from CHUNG HWA JIH PAO questions President Li  about what is the biggest achievement of his informal visits,  and how he feels at the moment.    President Li responds: "It is not good for me to appraise my  own performance, for no one should appraise himself. However, I  am very happy." He continues on to say: "I think all these  problems are [words indistinct]. Currently the leaders of all  countries have a common view. What is this common view? It is  that politics should be democratic, should be free and  democratic [words indistinct]. The economy should be a  market-based free economy. No one [words indistinct] except  leaders of a few socialist countries [words indistinct]. Even  they are now inclined toward a free economy. What does this  mean? It means world leaders have this common view, and this  enables them to communicate easily with each other. Any  problems between countries can be solved right away if leaders  of those countries concerned sit down and talk. I have always  thought there would not be any world wars in the future, maybe  only minor conflicts because people have common views, and there  would not be differences between them [as heard]. Will the  civil war in Yugoslavia spread to the entire world? I don't  think it will. World War I broke out there, but now [words  indistinct]. Thus I hope everyone knows that almost all world  leaders have common views. [passage indistinct] Whether it is  the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, I think  [words indistinct]. Like the U.S. President, Japanese prime  minister, British prime minister, and French president [words  indistinct]. Although Taiwan is very small, [words indistinct]."    A reporter asks Li about Taiwan's investment plans in ASEAN  countries. President Li answers: "Now it is between us and the  Philippines, not Indonesia." He then explains Taiwan's plans to  invest in and cooperate with Indonesia, Thailand, and the  Philippines, saying: "Especially Indonesia, because Indonesia  is the largest country and has many rural problems. Actually, I  made a very sketchy proposal there and talked with them. I  think we should review this problem at home. Many experiences  in Taiwan's rural construction will be very helpful to them. We  took a special trip to see how they harvest rice, how their  irrigation system works, and what their rural organization are  like. These areas are where we can help them. The trip helped  us understand the situation."    When asked about the investment climate in the Philippines  and Indonesia, and if improving the domestic investment climate  is more important then helping local businessmen invest in  foreign countries, President Li responds: "Improving the  domestic investment climate is one thing, and investing in  foreign countries is another. There is no competition between  the two. The only competition may be on which side we should  spend more money." He then explains why Taiwan should invest in  Indonesia, saying: "How can the ROC develop without energy?  Investing in Indonesia is necessary to the country's long-term  interests. We cannot express the entire thing just by saying  making investment and encouraging our businessmen to establish  small factories there. I don't think that is the way."    Answering a reporter's question about the ROC's foreign and  PRC policies, Li Teng-hui says: "Our mainland policy and our  foreign policy can be characterized by what we now call  pragmatic diplomacy. As far as the mainland is concerned, we  are working towards promoting mutual trust between the two  sides." Li continues: "In my view, our talks with the mainland  and our relations with it on many other issues need not be  conducted in conjunction with ideological matters. The mainland  should also understand this. We need not take our ideology into  consideration and think that only our ideology is the best." As  Li concludes: "I said a while ago we should work for peace,  progress, and prosperity. These are the objectives the entire  world is looking for. Even the Chinese Communist Party wants  these things. This being the case, there should not be  conflicts between our foreign and mainland policies. Diplomacy  should be described as a very important piece of our mainland  policy.    "During my visit to the three Southeast Asian nations, the  issue about forming a collective Asian security system was not  discussed. The reason why this issue was not discussed is we  cannot simply ask people who are still strangers to become our  friends and fight alongside us. If others misunderstand us, the  outcome would be unthinkable. So we should cooperate first in  the economic field." The president adds that he feels Taiwan  should proceed step by step. "I had the economy in mind when I  proposed the establishment of a collective Asian security  system." Li concludes: "I don't think we should consider  military cooperation as an important base."    Li states his impression about the leaders of the three  countries he visited was that they, including the Thai king, are  very sagacious. "They have a profound understanding of the  issues concerning this region." Li cites as an example  Indonesian President Suharto. He has been president for 25  years, but does not enjoy life in his villas. He understands  many issues thoroughly, including small issues. "These leaders  know very clearly the situation with the ROC. This is the case  with President Ramos of the Philippines as well as the Thai  King." As Li states: "World leaders today do not simply manage  the affairs of their own countries; they are very attentive to  their relations with other countries and the situations in those  countries. They realize the strengths of the Republic of China  [words indistinct]. I admire them greatly. My talks with them  were very congenial. They understood what I said, and I  understand what they said."    Li says that among world leaders, Chinese Communist leaders  are the most stubborn. "It is quite impossible to ask the  Chinese Communists to renounce the concept of one country, two  systems."    The president states that he deeply feels Taiwan should work  even harder. "We should not evaluate ourselves too highly. We  should not think we can fool around and do things which are  improper, thinking we have several billions of dollars in our  hands. We should do something about our cultural and ethical  conduct so people will respect us in these areas. Maybe this is  more important.    "I did not invite the Thai King to visit. I do not know in  what way the invitation should be extended. But I did  officially invite the other two leaders to visit."    Hong Kong MING PAO reporter Lai Hsiu-ju asks: "Many  Southeast  Asian nations still hold conflicting views on the sovereignty  over the South China Sea. Do you think Taiwan's southern policy  can assist those countries in dealing peacefully with the  sensitive sovereignty issue, and do you think it possible for  countries in that part of the world to work together in  exploring the resources there?"    Li Teng-hui responds: "I share your view. But I just cannot  tell friends I meet for the first time what we should do. Is it  not better that we talk once we have met two or three times?  So, as I said a while ago about the collective security system,  I tried my best not to discuss sensitive issues like that when  the time available was so limited, otherwise people might be  scared to death by me and refuse to see me in the future." Li  says that after they have met two or three times, he will  certainly speak out.    An ECONOMIC DAILY reporter asks Li to comment on the  possibility of cooperation between the Republic of China and  Indonesia in the aerospace industry. Li Teng-hui replies: "I  asked a lot of questions when I visited the aircraft plant in  Bandung. I asked a lot of questions about the plant's  operations, management, and sales. But I did not suggest  cooperation. Why? I know our situation, what we should do, and  our level of development. The plant did not mention their  problems, but I understood. So bilateral cooperation is  impossible. The planes it produces are for commercial use.  Because Indonesia has over 17,000 islands, planes are badly  needed for transportation. The plant's monthly output of planes  is about 270. I said something ridiculous: Buying planes is  different from buying cars. They understand what I said. Plane  purchases require a lot of money. Where will the money come  from? Without money or loans, how are you going to pay?  Problems like these are many."    On whether his unofficial summits with leaders on the  Southeast Asian trip might help the ROC's UN membership, Li  Teng-hui says: "I think if the road to the United Nations is  100-km long, we have covered only one meter. So we have to  continue to work hard. This is not easy. We must work hard so  other countries will understand better that the United Nations  will not get anything from us if we are not a member, and then  all countries, including large countries, will help us. This is  the direction toward which we should work hard."</p>

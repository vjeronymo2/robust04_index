Chen Bangzhu said: In recent years, the vast number of  militiamen in our province as reserve forces have played a  positive role in economic construction; in fighting floods and  other natural disasters; in safeguarding public security; in  undertaking urgent, difficult, dangerous, and heavy tasks; and  in promoting a new socialist civilization and fashion.    He pointed out: Given the new situation, party committees  and governments at all levels must carry forward the fine  tradition of the party maintaining control over the armed  forces, and must further intensify leadership over the operation  of militia as military reserve forces. It is necessary to give  full play to the role of the militia as reserve forces in  carrying our in-depth reform, in promoting economic development,  and particularly in safeguarding public security and preserving  political stability, so that militiamen can make new  contributions to the economic prosperity and social stability in  this province.</p>

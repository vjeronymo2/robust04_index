			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> THE COENS -- IMPROVING ON GOOD THINGS;  </P> <P> 'MILLER'S CROSSING,' THE BROTHERS' THIRD FILM, SHOWS THEIR STEADY EVOLUTION AS  TWO OF AMERICA'S MOST DISTINCTIVE FILMMAKERS  </P> <P> If she's such an angel, why are you lookin' for her at 4 in the morning?  </P> <P>  -- Gabriel Byrne to Albert Finney in "Miller's Crossing"  </P> <P> How can we describe the Coen Brothers? Tongue-in-cheek devotees of American  sociopathology? Film noirettes? The sons of Hammett and Chandler, branded by  Cain? Or just two guys who like to make movies where the camera races around  below knee level?  </P> <P> Pigeon-hole them where you will, they're unique. In just three movies -- the  1984 "Blood Simple," the 1987 "Raising Arizona" and the current "Miller's  Crossing," the Coens, Joel and Ethan, have decisively staked out their own  weirdo, psychically charged territory. They've been praised to the skies -- and  also damned as cold-hearted copycats, derivative movie-brats, two more  Reagan-era Raiders of the Lost Arts.  </P> <P> There's something both impish and elusive about the Coens: Minnesota heirs of  the flat, cold Midwestern interior which has inspired so many other slightly  bent dreamers. They're wonderful mimics and pastiche artists. They've managed  to catch the timber and tone of writers like James M. Cain, in "Blood Simple,"  and Dashiell Hammett, in "Miller's Crossing," with eerie accuracy. And in  "Raising Arizona," they grace their suburban and low-life Southwestern rustics  with a flowery phraseology that seems to mix equal parts of Restoration Drama,  Gothic romance, redneck badinage and windy TV commercials.  </P> <P> Like Preston Sturges, they throw strange rhythms and allusions into everyday  speech: near-biblical phraseology ("Her womb was a rocky place where my seed  could find no purchase" in "Raising Arizona") and ornate colloquies (M. Emmet  Walsh's great oily wheezes of Texas cynicism in "Blood Simple"). "Miller's  Crossing," their best script, finds them particularly inspired. The whole movie  works out of several mixed rhythms, notably the gutter crackle of '30s Warners  mob talk and the Irish lilt of two of the main characters: gang boss Leo  O'Bannion (Albert Finney) and his alcoholic, sad-eyed lieutenant, Tommy Reagan  (Gabriel Byrne).  </P> <P> This slightly elevated dialogue often seems to clash with their visual style.  "Miller's Crossing," despite its jarring violence, is relatively somber and  restrained, but their first two movies were hyper-kinetic, flamboyant, full of  garish action and eye-popping angles. In "Blood Simple," they use a lot of  Hitchcockian voyeur shots; at one point they skim us down a loaded bar and hop  over a glass. In "Raising Arizona," they race their camera frenetically down  highways, supermarket aisles, through doghouses and, at one point, across a  front yard, up a ladder and into a window. They sometimes favor dog's-eye or  baby's-eye views with tracking shots that assume the flying ground-level  perspective of the creeping spirits in Sam Raimi's "Evil Dead" -- which Joel  helped edit.  </P> <P> All of their movies are highly artificial, "movies" with quotation marks, and  they're about characters that might verge on stock movie archetypes --  adulterers, detectives, cops, crooks -- but for their alarming eloquence. The  Coens helped write "Crimewave" for Raimi, and though it's a labored and unfunny  comedy, it lays out their usual strategy, a consciously comic or ironic  perspective on dark, disturbing material: infidelity and murder in "Blood  Simple," childlessness and road psychopathology in "Raising Arizona," and, in  "Miller's Crossing," the Jacobean betrayals and murders of a Prohibition-era  gangster community riven by "Titus Andronicus"-style blood feuds.  </P> <P> The Coens have a consistent motif, almost a trademark: wild, almost mirthlessly  aggressive bursts of laughter or "joy" -- Walsh's "Blood Simple" cackling, the  bozo howling of escaped cons John Goodman and William Forsyth in "Raising  Arizona." In "Miller's Crossing," the laughter has been largely replaced by a  succession of cold, deadly, viciously meaningful smiles, behind which the  speakers mercilessly calculate their interlocutor's weak spots.  </P> <P> But indicting the Coens for artful heartlessness may be a bit premature --  especially for a near-masterpiece like "Miller's Crossing." As writers, the  Coens are comic artists who like to work out of serious themes and low company;  if they're sometimes damned for cold-blooded cynicism, it's worth remembering  that most of their models once were as well. "Miller's Crossing" is a gangster  movie which owes as much to literary inspirations as cinematic ones, and uses  them with unusual wit, dramatic suppleness and emotional force.  </P> <P> It's been praised, justly, for its visual coups: the burnished, shadowy-brown  hues of Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography, the wizardly production design by  Dennis Gassner. And for its dramatic ones -- by Byrne, Finney and the whole  superb cast. But, right now, its dialogue is what makes it special. The plot  and milieu come largely from Hammett's novels, especially "The Glass Key" and  "Red Harvest," but the racy lingo, stiletto-sharp, pungent and on-the-nose,  also recalls Sturges or Ben Hecht. Scorsese's "GoodFellas" is deeper, denser  and more virtuosic -- but "Miller's Crossing" is the 1990 crime movie with the  richest, most startling characterizations, the most juicily quotable lines.  </P> <P> Incongruous eloquence was the hallmark of many '30s and '40s crime movies,  especially "The Maltese Falcon," where rumblingly orotund Sydney Greenstreet  beamed at Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and told him, "I'll tell you quite  frankly, I'm a man who likes to talk to a man who likes to talk." The "Miller's  Crossing" characters obviously like to talk and cross-talk.  </P> <P> Unlike most slightly flabby or over-profane modern pseudo-noir scripts, this  one is easy and melodic, spiked with dozens of low-life bon mots that draw  blood, in or out of context -- delivered by a cast of murderers, gamblers,  alcoholics, whores, chiselers and corrupt politicians that seem possessed with  bizarre eloquence. The Coens understand the secret of the best '30s hard-boiled  dialogue: it's a language of stylized shop talk, lightly veiled aggression,  dangerous euphemisms. Here, philosophical comedy seems to mix with Black Mask  magazine pungency and street grit.  </P> <P> The rhythms reverberate afterward -- not just the obvious zingers -- the  cynical observation that a city boss has "more hair tonic than brains" or the  shivery come-on, "The two of us, we're about bad enough to deserve each other,"  but the way the wisecracks extend into wit combats or explode into horrifying  non-comic cadenzas. The movie's high point: John Turturro, gut-wrenchingly  intense as weaselly little bookie Bernie Bernbaum, lurching awkwardly to the  ground in a poetically gray forest before the man about to kill him, shrieking  over and over, unforgettably: "I'm praying to you. Listen to your heart!"  </P> <P> The tower of all this babbling, an unnamed "eastern" metropolis -- re-created  in New Orleans, with a political structure that recalls Prohibition-era Chicago  -- is loaded with diverse immigrant strains: the main characters include  Italians, Jews and a "Dane." But the Irish lilt predominates: melodic,  harsh-edged and melancholy. It's poetry on the edge of an abyss.  </P> <P> Maybe the best way to enjoy "Miller's Crossing" is simply to listen to it: not  just to the ingenious turns of phrase, and the relish with which the cast  delivers them; not just to the blend of mournfully pretty Celtic ballads and  Jazz Age pop songs on the sound track, but to the whole, lyrically melded  cacophony of talk, song and background noise. The cold crackle of ice cubes in  a tumbler, the ship horns and hoof-clops, the cracking of tree-limbs in a windy  forest where a grim quartet have come for an execution, Frank Patterson's  soaring "Danny Boy" while Leo's Thompson machine gun routs two potential  killers. The way the song "Running Wild" starts up at the climax of a lover's  quarrel, or the way "Good Night, Sweetheart" suddenly stops when Leo delivers  the kiss-off to Tommy.  </P> <P> The Coens and sound editor Skip Lievsay meld everything into a world where  dreamy re-creations become stark and immediate: where the sound is cranked up  to a near-paranoid level, where the characters, in the midst of chaos, try  staunchly but comically to preserve their cruel cool. In the great "Danny Boy"  scene, the ecstatic refrain reflects Leo's sentimentality, but it also echoes  his exaltation at the assertion of his old mastery, dealing fiery death to new  challengers. The movie, for that wonderful, hair-raising few minutes, steps  back from exposing Leo to admire him -- and then probably chuckles at itself  for doing so.  </P> <P> But what of the vision behind this virtuosity? "Miller's Crossing" is an  entertainment, but, like Graham Greene's "entertainments," it's not empty of  moral themes, psychology or social observation. It's a dark comedy set in hell,  a fairy tale of utter moral chaos, of near absolute evil, in which the prime  instigators of that evil -- the gangsters who run the city and keep mayor and  police chief scuttling like flunkies between them -- spend their own time  absurdly ruminating over ethical and moral consequences and strategies.  </P> <P> In the first scene, obviously inspired by the opening of "The Godfather," the  Coens pit Irish mob boss Leo against the local Italian mob leader: glowering  plug ugly Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) who wants to "whack" Turturro's Bernie, a  local bookie spilling information on fixed races or fights. Curiously, in the  midst of Johnny's presentation, he launches into a discussion of ethics . . .  or, in his words, "et'ics." Most writers would have tossed this incongruity off  as a stray joke, but the Coens extend it, let it blossom. For Johnny, his  nemesis' behavior is inexcusable. ("If you can't trust a fix, what can you  trust?") The very structure and sanctity of crime itself has been sullied;  murder is the only honorable response. "Et'ics" are an obsession of Johnny  Caspar's, and also of the movie.  </P> <P> Everyone involved, even the most cold-blooded killer, dourly macho Eddie  "Dane," (J. D. Freeman) quarrels incessantly over morality, strategy and even  decorum. If, at the beginning, Johnny seems an explosive psychopath, insanely  sensitive to social slights, soon his obsessions with the moral boundaries of  power become apparent -- in between wild temper tantrums when he orders  killings or bashes in someone's head. It's a terrific comic premise, and also,  undoubtedly, a sly comment on the non-criminal world outside, where equally  abstract rationalizations and skewed observations often accompany the most  cruel and self-serving behavior.  </P> <P> The Coens -- who, in "Blood Simple" generated a chain of murderous  double-crosses out of one infidelity and, in "Raising Arizona," constructed the  plot around the intrusion of home life into the outlaw-road world -- here make  sex the secret spur to all their machinations. Underneath the dark, stolid,  heavily pillared world of "Miller's Crossing," there's a quagmire of tangled  sexual relationships: two main triangles, one heterosexual (Leo, Tommy and  Leo's "twist" Verna, who is also Bernie's sister), one homosexual (Bernie, the  Dane and Steve Buscemi's Mink). At the center, the only uninvolved party in the  roundelays, is family man Johnny Caspar: constantly extolling familial virtues  and demonstrating fatuous pride in the achievements of his idiotic son.  </P> <P> Identification is a mysterious process -- and, in "Miller's Crossing," we're  asked to follow most of this through the eye and ear of a character, Tommy,  whose motives are opaque to everyone else in the film -- even perhaps, himself.  ("I dunno. Do you always know why you do things, Leo?" he mutters.) As Tommy,  Gabriel Byrne, looking charmingly like some dissipated younger cousin of  Spencer Tracy, is incurably in the grip of three non-sexual compulsions:  alcoholism, gambling and wisecracking. He's both omnipotent and helpless:  adviser to two ganglords, yet unable to keep his creditor-bookies off his tail.  </P> <P> But though, at times, Tommy seems to have embarked on a mysterious Yojimbo-like  campaign of universal destruction, in one key shot, while he straightens his  hat, we may see the answer in his eyes; see, if only faintly, the love for Leo,  which he's masked or disavowed throughout. That hat is important: Tommy dreams  about it, talks about it, consistently loses it -- whether in dreams, beatings  or murder attempts. It's the key image of a movie where people are often  identified by their headgear or hairstyle -- including a murder victim named  "Rug," whose toupee is stolen. Perhaps the hat symbolizes the social facade  that lightly covers the gangsters: so fragile, a smack can knock it off, or the  wind blow it away.  </P> <P> In a way, when Bernie pleads for his life from Tommy, howling that they're the  same -- lovers and schemers, not killers -- he's telling a partial truth. But,  in buying Bernie's plea, Tommy commits a perversion in his own special world:  showing mercy to a man he knows has to be killed. The forest at Miller's  crossing, shot in sepulchral hues that recall the woodland execution scene in  Bertolucci's and Storaro's "The Conformist," is the site of a twisted moral  reckoning, a dream, a crisis, two near-deaths and one real one. It's the squirt  of blood and tears at the center of a machinery of murder. That, perhaps, is  the darkest, most despairing theme in "Miller's Crossing."  </P> <P> In this killer's world, love and pity are perversions. Love destroys you, saps  you, makes you pull bonehead plays. Murder is good business -- as long as it's  handled et'ically.  </P></p>

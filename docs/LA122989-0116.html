			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> BOY FACES ADDED COUNT IN MALL DEATH  </P> <P> Prosecutors in the case of a 12-year-old boy accused of shooting to death a  12-year-old girl in a crowded Orange County mall last week amended the charges  against the boy Thursday to include a misdemeanor count of exhibiting a firearm  in a threatening manner.  </P> <P> Juan Manuel Cardenas, who has already been charged with involuntary  manslaughter in the shooting of Jacalyn Calabrese and assault with a deadly  weapon for allegedly pointing a .25-caliber pistol at another girl, was charged  with the misdemeanor count as a precaution, said Deputy Dist. Atty. John D.  Conley.  </P> <P> "We just want to make sure all the bases are covered," Conley said Thursday  after a court appearance in Santa Ana at which the defense was granted a  continuance. The trial is now scheduled to begin Feb. 5 instead of Jan. 10.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Chris Hilger said the additional count has a minimal  effect on the case and will not cause him to alter his defense preparations.  </P> <P> Witnesses said Cardenas had been showing off the pistol for several weeks  before the Dec. 18 shooting of his middle-school classmate in the Mall of  Orange. They also said he held the gun to the temple of another girl, Keli  Edwards, as a joke just minutes before shooting Jacalyn, who dared him to pull  the trigger, apparently because she thought the gun was fake.  </P> <P> "The third count is a result of his pointing the firearm" at Keli Edwards,  Conley said.  </P> <P> The boy has pleaded not guilty to all counts, Conley said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article entitled: "The FLA Transport Plane </F> Runs Into Financing Difficulties"; first paragraph is AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] A parliamentary report highlights the troubles of  the military transport aircraft (FLA) program, and proposes  original financial and industrial solutions for its success.    Original reports are a specialty of Var deputy Arthur  Paecht.  Once again, the reporter for the National Assembly's Finance  Committee has shaken the defense and aeronautics world by  presenting a thorough and highly original report on "financing  the European military transport plane," aka the FLA (future  large aircraft) program. Besides providing a superb technical  description of the project and its alternatives (see AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No 1447), the document  analyzes the problems inherent in the program and, most  important, offers original financial and industrial solutions to  insure its success. The project is estimated to cost between 188  and 248 billion French francs [Fr] for 354 aircraft over 15  years. France alone, which reportedly has a 17.8 percent share  in the program, will spend between Fr33.1 and 43.5 billion.    Consequently, the difficulty of finding funds in the  shrinking military budgets (see table) of most of our European  partners threatens the program's credibility. Some of them --  such as Great Britain, which is tempted to go with the American  C-130J -- are not fervent supporters of the FLA. Hence the  recommendations in Arthur Paecht's report.    The first proposal calls for drastic cuts in the cost of  developing and mass manufacturing the European aircraft. The Var  deputy has calculated that paring the cargo's specifications  just slightly and optimizing the program's industrial  organization would cut development costs 34.6 percent, to about  Fr26 billion instead of Fr36 billion. This would also reduce the  per unit "flyaway" cost 22 percent, to about Fr380 million.  Suggested retrenchments include lowering operational  specifications, by shortening the hold 2 meters (-4 percent) and  slowing peak speed at low altitudes by 50 kt (-3 percent). Those  two modifications would save about 12.6 percent. A different  engine (propellor or THR instead of a jet) would trim 10  percent, and improved industrial organization another 12 percent.    Many think the real key to the FLA program's success is an  industrial or state organization that can insure good  management. The Paecht report recommends "very lean and more  efficient than usual state management," with "industrial  management that is at least on par with Airbus's." It also  recommends that "the aircraft's manufacturing design be based on  the armed forces' stated needs, using an essentially economic  approach." Such a strategy would involve a major shakeup in the  way weapons programs are managed in France, and "could call into  question the DGA's [General Weapons Delegation] role in this  type of program."    Thus, given the large number of participating countries  (eight), the report recommends that Airbus Industrie or an ad  hoc consortium modeled after it take the management lead.  Moreover, to ensure tight technical control, the document talks  about "a leadership team involving just two or three countries"  and including a strong Franco-German axis. The other countries  would be involved as manufacturing partners.    The difficulty of the final problem -- how to scare up  financing for the FLA -- has cast doubts on its future. The  Germans have suggested that the companies provide the funds,  which armed forces budgets can no longer do (unless those  budgets are increased two percent or unless one or more weapons  programs are eliminated). Arthur Paecht is asking governments to  show more imagination. He has proposed original solutions that  combine the use of corporate equity (backed by government  purchase pledges), private capital, budget funds, and schemes  analogous to the reimbursible loans of the civil construction  industry.    Another pervasive theme in the Paecht report is the  program's  industrial fallout in Europe and France. The construction of an  estimated 300 to 350 aircraft is the financial and industrial  equivalent of 500 Airbuses, and will create something like  20,000 industrial jobs in Europe over 15 years. "For France  alone, about 4,000 jobs are at stake over the same period," the  reporter calculates. Manufacture of the 1,500 engines -- not to  mention the engineers and technicians needed to design the new  model -- will create an equal number of positions over 10 years.  When the FLA's estimated potential market of 700 aircraft is  factored in, the number of highly-skilled jobs that are on the  line is obvious.    But more important, in the eyes of the reporter, than direct  job creation is the FLA's capacity to keep the expertise of  European design and engineering departments alive. Indeed, once  the A330/340 programs are complete, those departments have  little in the way of new projects for at least 10 years.  Consequently, the FLA program "could prove vitally important to  aeronautics industries."    Finally, the report stresses the value of the program in  fostering European defense collaboration. The FLA program fits  perfectly within the framework of a joint European defense  policy, consolidated by the WEU and the Franco-German Weapons  Agency, for which it could serve as the impetus. The FLA is even  described as an "emblematic" program, whose failure would signal  the defeat of "any attempt to put together a European defense  policy on weapons."

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Hour of reckoning for training schemes: Pressures on ministers responsible for programmes for the jobless MRS Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, will today begin receiving submissions to her wide-ranging review of government programmes for the adult unemployed. Under review is the ET scheme itself as well as Employment Action, the benefit-plus-temporary-work scheme for the long-term unemployed, and Jobclubs. Mrs Shephard is likely to be constrained by political and financial pressures. She will face calls from Tory backbenchers who want to follow the US example of Workfare under which the long-term unemployed receive benefit only if they undertake community work. Civil servants believe it would be difficult to run sufficient Workfare schemes to mop up the large numbers of people eligible. It is understood that the government has similarly been backing away from the proposal to cut entitlement to unemployment benefit from one year to six months. Training providers hope the review will concentrate on quality in order to equip the UK for any upturn in the economy. But the Department of Employment - like others in Whitehall - is likely to be subject to funding cuts in the current Public Expenditure Survey. ET will be the most vulnerable scheme because the other main training programme, Youth Training - the scheme for those aged 16 to 18 - guarantees a place to all who want one. It is politically important for the government that this is met. ET carries no such formal guarantee. ET is criticised as ripe for reform. Started in 1988, before the recession, its clients are mainly low-skill individuals, and 47 per cent are inner-city residents who worked in the old manufacturing industries. About 104,000 people are doing ET in England and Wales. The scheme's record is poor. Only 36 per cent of those completing schemes go into jobs, self employment or full - time training and about 30 per cent get a qualification. Many of its clients view ET as a government device to get them off the unemployment register, while many training providers claim they are unable to give quality training because the Pounds 800m-a-year scheme is underfunded. The Unemployment Unit, a research organisation, said that while job entry rates could be explained partly by the weakness of regional employment conditions, qualification rates reflected the poor quality of training. The 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) which administer government funded training schemes in England and Wales want a freer hand in who they can train on ET schemes. In their submission to Mrs Shephard they are expected to point to a range of alternatives, such as varying periods of training for different groups depending on their needs. Short intensive courses could assist skilled individuals recently made unemployed. More disadvantaged people could have longer training. Last week G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen who represent the views of Tecs to government, made it clear that further cuts to their training budgets were unacceptable. It is likely, however, that if asked to make funding choices they would opt to have fewer people trained, but to a higher quality. Mr Stuart Bishell, managing director of Astra Training, the largest provider of ET training, said: 'We want the focus of government spending on training to be on those people who are most likely to benefit from it most rapidly.' Such a move is being considered by the Department of Employment. Mrs Shephard could argue that the Treasury should allow Tecs greater freedom of choice in return for cash constraints, and allow her department to negotiate targets. Tecs could for example be paid varying amounts for training different groups. But the Treasury wants the rules on ET eligibility tightened, not relaxed. At present Tecs are allowed only to put other groups on ET after satisfying demand from the long-term unemployed. Another option being considered is expanding Employment Action. Set up a year ago, EA is cheaper than ET but has not been a great success. About 23,000 out of 30,000 places are filled. Whether this scheme could be expanded without some element of compulsion is debatable. Tecs would certainly like greater ability to mix and match programmes to meet the needs of their catchment areas - but not if that means less funding for training. It is a demand that government will find hard to meet.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, May 7 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa on Saturday [7 May] asked Syrian President Hafiz  Al-Asad to join multilateral talks in the Middle East peace  process, Japanese officials said.    During the 30-minute meeting, Kakizawa told Al-Asad that he  is looking forward to a positive proposal to facilitate further  Israeli steps in the peace talks, the officials said.    But they did not disclose immediately how Al-Asad responded.  On Friday, Syria's Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' told  Kakizawa that Syria is negative about joining the multilateral  talks at the present stage.    Al-Asad expressed his support for Japan's bid to obtain a  permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council, the officials said.    Al-Asad said he backs Japan's move, adding, "I expect Japan  to tackle (international) issues from a fair position," they  said. Kakizawa also asked Al-Asad to pay an early visit to  Japan. The Syrian president promised to make efforts to meet  Japan's request, the officials said.    The meeting with Al-Asad concluded Kakizawa's two-day visit  to Syria on the final leg of a weeklong Middle East tour which  took him to Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the Israeli-occupied  territories .    He will return to Tokyo on Sunday.</p>

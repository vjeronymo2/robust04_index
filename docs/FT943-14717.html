			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Personal View: Rulebook written in a modern style - Donald Brash explains the thinking behind New Zealand's planned reform of banking supervision In November 1991, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand began a review of the way in which banking supervision was being conducted. We had been formally involved in banking supervision for five years, and a review seemed a sensible course of action. More than two years later we are finally nearing the implementation of a very different approach. What took so long? The more we looked at the matter, the more complex the issues became. Why should we have a special supervisory regime for banks at all? If we retained a special regime, who should operate it - the central bank, as at present, or some other public sector agency? After a great deal of discussion, we decided that banks are 'special' for a variety of reasons, including their unique role in the payments system, and do warrant a special legislative or regulatory structure - at least until the risks in the present payments system can be resolved by moving to a real time gross settlement system (planned for 1995 in both New Zealand and the UK). We were relatively relaxed about who should run that system. We decided to stay with the status quo and continue to perform banking supervision ourselves, in part because of the cost of operating multiple, specialised agencies in a small country. The question remained - how best could this function be performed? From an early stage, we had some concerns about what we were then doing, which was a conventional approach to banking supervision based on Basle minimum capital ratios, careful assessment of confidential information and the establishment of prudential rules. We were concerned first about the efficiency and compliance costs of banking supervision. In the US, studies suggest that the costs of complying with prudential regulations can amount to as much as 14 per cent of all non-interest costs for some banks. Efficiency costs may be even larger. We were concerned also about the risk to the taxpayer. In a country where government does not guarantee bank deposits and where there is also no deposit insurance, there would nevertheless be enormous pressure on government to compensate depositors if a bank were to fail. Depositors might well argue, for example, that, since the public sector established the rules within which banks must operate, and had access to vastly more detailed information on bank financial strength than was available to the public, the public sector has a very strong moral obligation to protect depositors in the event of a bank failure. This might not have mattered, perhaps, if we could be confident that the way in which we conducted banking supervision could significantly reduce the likelihood of bank failure. But we were not confident of this. To begin with, most of our assessment of bank financial strength was based on historical information. Almost by definition, bank management had seen any problem before we received the return - and it was probably at least a year too late to forestall the problem. Second, we observed that, over the last 20 or 30 years, most banking problems which have occurred around the world have been the result of either fraud or very sharp changes in macro-economic conditions, associated with dramatic changes in asset prices. Banking supervision seemed relatively impotent in the face of fraud and not the most effective policy instrument to deal with dramatic changes in asset prices. Perhaps most serious of all, anecdotal evidence began to mount that banking supervision by a public sector agency tends to reduce the monitoring of bank behaviour by others, many of whom have primary responsibility for monitoring banks, namely bank managers and bank directors. Indeed, in many cases it seemed that the more intensive the supervision by the central bank, the less intensive was the supervision by bank directors. If that anecdotal evidence reflected an underlying reality, banking supervision might actually increase the risk of bank failure. The way in which we now propose to supervise banks has the following key features: We will continue to register banks - in other words, authorise a company to call itself a bank. We will retain the Basle risk-weighted minimum capital ratio of 8 per cent. (This is probably not strictly consistent with the philosophy underlying our new approach, but is a practical way of retaining a point of contact with the international regime in a situation where most of our banks are owned overseas.) We will require a high level of public disclosure of financial information about banks, on a quarterly basis, with six-monthly audit, and with directors required to attest to the accuracy of that information and to the adequacy of the bank's internal controls. We will require all banks to disclose any credit rating they may have in their quarterly disclosure statements - and, when they do not have a credit rating, to disclose that fact. We will monitor banks essentially on the basis of the publicly-available information (though we will retain the right to seek clarification if publicly-disclosed information is unclear or appears inaccurate). We will remove most of our existing prudential rules. (The quarterly disclosure statements will, however, include information on the extent of risk concentration in banks' portfolios.) We will continue to maintain a capacity to intervene in a banking crisis, by appointing a statutory manager if necessary, but only for systemic reasons. This approach to banking supervision will not eliminate taxpayer risk, although it should reduce it. Nor will it eliminate efficiency and compliance costs, although those too should be reduced. But the new approach should substantially increase the incentives on bank managements and boards to take full responsibility for the soundness of their own banks and indeed to improve the soundness of their own. It is easy to dismiss this approach to banking supervision in New Zealand as irrelevant to other countries because such a high proportion of our banks are owned by large international banks. I argue the reverse is the case. Given the high percentage of foreign ownership of banks in New Zealand, no system of banking supervision is going to make a huge difference to the risk of bank failure. Were more banks finally accountable to local boards the increased incentives on bank directors to behave in ways conducive to the soundness of their banks would be of even greater relevance and benefit. How have banks reacted to this new proposal? Perhaps not surprisingly, the strongest banks like it. No longer will all banks be 'made equal' by the central bank's supervision and perceived guarantee; the strongest could well be able to attract deposits at lower cost than the weaker. It is also not too surprising that some directors show signs of uneasiness about being accountable for the quality of their disclosed financial information. One bank chief executive, expressing concern at the new approach, insisted vehemently that the central bank had to continue its present mode of banking supervision because 'bank directors understand absolutely nothing about banking'. This comment is quite unfair about some bank directors, but there is an element of truth in it in some cases. The blame for this situation almost certainly lies with supervisors for assuming too much of the responsibility for the viability of banks. At this stage we are satisfied that our proposals will strengthen the New Zealand financial system, at lower efficiency cost than the present regime and with reduced taxpayer risk. We hope to finalise the proposals and implement the new approach by late 1994 or early 1995. The author is governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand</p>

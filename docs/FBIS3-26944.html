			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ma Hongbo (7456 3163 3134): "Handle Well </F> Relations Between Central Administration and Localities in  Economic Development"]    [Text] Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, our reform has been progressing along the  lines of "delegating power and yielding profits" [fang quan rang  li 2397 2938 6245 0448]. The central administration and the  localities have separated their management functions, and  localities have expanded their competence in terms of finance,  capital, investments and foreign trade. With the implementation  of the policy enabling localities to be responsible for their  finances, namely "dividing revenue and expenditure between the  central administration and localities, and holding each  responsible for balancing their budgets," the previous practice  of "eating from the same kitchen" has been changed into "eating  from separate kitchens." This has embodied the idea exactly.  The expansion of localities' economic competence has aroused  their enthusiasm for developing the economy, and has changed the  situation in which local economic development and structural  adjustment are completely controlled by the central mandatory  plans and incremental investments [zeng liang tou zi 1073 6852  2121 6327]. This has changed the passive state of localities  having to wait for, rely on and look to the central  administration to promote local construction. All this has  promoted local economic development in an unprecedented fashion,  and has set off an upsurge of construction the like of which  never occurred in the past.    However, owing to the fact that when the central  administration "delegates power and yields profits," when  macroscopic constraint mechanisms, and a system to govern  interest relationships has not been established, various  localities' responsibilities do not conform with their power and  interests. Under such circumstances, localities were prompted  to distort price signals, and maximize their interests. They  vied with one another to invest in high-price and huge-profit  processing industries. They repeatedly imported items and  carried out construction projects one after another. This  happened everywhere. As a result, the proportion of the  processing industry in the total output value of industrial  production increased from 38.1 percent in 1982 to 43.9 percent  in 1988. In recent years, although the central administration  has strengthened its regulation and control to a certain extent,  the changes in proportion have not yet proved ideal.  Consequently, areas producing resources and are separated from  processing zones, and various areas have developed the same kind  of operational setups. The local industrial structure situation  was tending toward the same pattern became increasingly serious.  This triggered off local economic frictions and coincident  market fluctuations. There occurred an "economy of feudal  princes" [zhu hou jing ji 6175 0186 4842 3444], characterized by  scrambling for natural resources and imposing trade blockades on  one another. Thus the efficiency of natural resource  disposition was greatly reduced. In addition, the central  administration had increasingly weaker capability in  concentrating its financial and material resources, but its  burdens were very heavy. It was unable to invest in basic  facilities projects, which needed huge amounts of investment and  longer periods of time for completion. The development of basic  industries and infrastructure projects -- including energy, raw  and processed materials, communications and transportation, and  so on -- lagged far behind the development of processing  industry. This aggravated the imbalanced structure of supply  and demand in the national economy. In particular, our railways,  which undertake the main transport task, were heavily overloaded  to maintain a normal transport situation.    It is obvious that the deep root of these chaotic phenomena  in the sustained development of the national economy, and the  increasingly serious conflicts among energy, raw and processed  materials, and processing industry, in particular, lies in  improper handling of the relations between the central  administration and localities. So what is to be done? Should  we return to the previous traditional system, in which the  central administration exercised rigid control over the  localities? Or take a laissez-faire attitude toward the present  situation? In his "On the Ten Major Relationships," Comrade Mao  Zedong said: To build a powerful socialist country, it is  imperative to have a strong and unified central leadership, and  unified planning and discipline throughout the country.  Disruption of this indispensable unity is impermissible. At  the same time, it is essential to bring the initiative of local  authorities into full play, and to let each locality enjoy what  is particularity suited to its local conditions. Since the  differences between various localities in China in terms of  natural, social, and cultural conditions, and the level of  economic development are so great, it is impossible to demand  conformity in everything. There is obviously a dualistic  structure in the coastal area, the interior, the southeast, the  northwest, in urban and rural areas, and developed and backward  regions. Furthermore, our commodity economy and domestic markets  are not developed, and the proportions of natural and  seminatural economies still are fairly high. This has decided  that we need a unified planning and program to organize local  economic operations effectively. In the meantime, we must not  neglect regional differences that objectively exist, or the  local interests caused by such differences.    Therefore, in the process of deepening our reforms in the  future, we must handle well the relationship between the central  administration and the localities. On the one hand, we must  continue to arouse the enthusiasm of localities for economic  development and must maintain their economic vigor. On the  other hand, while further transforming enterprise operational  mechanisms and cultivating the market system in order to  strengthen local economic capabilities, the central  administration will increase the weight of macroeconomic  regulation and control, with emphasis on finance, tax, monetary  matters, investments, the planning system, and so on, so as to  prevent anarchy in economic operations, or an economy of feudal  princes.</p>

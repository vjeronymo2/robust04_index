			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Toyota plans office efficiency programme TOYOTA Motor, Japan's largest vehicle manufacturer, is seeking to raise the efficiency of its office staff by 30 per cent. The company is to set up a committee to consider how to restructure operations to do so. Toyota expects to achieve efficiency improvements of 10 per cent by reducing working hours and by a further 20 per cent by devoting office workers' time to new businesses. The move comes as the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association (JAMA) is considering applying to the ministry of labour to be designated an industry eligible for employment subsidies. The funds would be used to transfer employees to subsidiaries and re-train employees for new jobs. One condition for eligibility is that production should fall in three consecutive months by 5 per cent year-on-year. In December, motor industry production was down by 9.7 per cent, in January by 13.5 per cent and in February by 10.2 per cent. However, new car sales in Japan rose in March for the first time in 14 months. But sales cannot be directly linked to production, JAMA said. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drug company, has lowered its forecast net profits for the year to the end of March due to heavy losses at its US subsidiary, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company said non-consolidated after-tax profits for the 12 months would plunge 78.3 per cent to Y1.3bn (Dollars 11m), instead of the initial forecast of Y6.5bn announced in November. Fujisawa expects an extraordinary loss of Y6.5bn, due to appraisal losses on its stake in Fujisawa USA, which suffered net losses of Dollars 72m in the year to December 1992. But, owing to brisk domestic sales, the company upgraded non-consolidated sales and pre-tax earnings projections.</p>

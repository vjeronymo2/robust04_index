			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Simmons Won't Pursue Georgia Gulf: Investor Harold C. Simmons ended his  $1.1-billion tender offer for Georgia Gulf Corp. and ended a planned proxy  fight for control of the chemical company's board. A spokesman for Simmons' NL  Industries Inc. said he will back a Georgia-Pacific recapitalization plan at  its April 19 annual meeting. However, he said, NL -- which owns almost 10% of  Georgia Gulf's stock -- may launch a new tender offer if shareholders reject  the recapitalization plan.  </P></p>

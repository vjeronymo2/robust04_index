			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELING ARTIST HOPES CONVERTED 'SNOWMOBILE' WILL DOUBLE AS STAR VEHICLE  </P> <P> Most people write resumes to get a job. Some even make a demonstration video.  </P> <P> But Susan Daughtry is making her bid for stardom by driving a 31-year old bread  truck flocked in "snow" about 3,000 miles across the United States.  </P> <P> Daughtry, a 48-year-old sculptor from Alabama with fiery red hair and blue  eyes, hopes to get UMO, the truck she lovingly calls an Unidentified Moving  Object, into a movie or music video.  </P> <P> She began a two-year journey across the states last October from her hometown  of Dothan, Ala. She bought the 1959 snub-nosed truck, abandoned in a bread  company's lot, for $1,200 and transformed it into a moving sculpture.  </P> <P> For 10 months, she labored over the vehicle, ribbing its sides with PVC piping,  sculpting a Styrofoam-like substance over its body, and applying 13 gallons of  white paint and 321 tubes of caulking.  </P> <P> Daughtry gutted the insides, remolding the interior into bright white, living  quarters, complete with a solar shower, single bed, portable kitchen, closet  space, and zebra-patterned pillows. Instead of hauling a dresser on board, she  fastened a row of white buckets to the wall to store belts, socks, makeup and  other small items.  </P> <P> Then she took UMO on its maiden voyage. "I was a nervous wreck," she said. "I  could just see all the stuff peeling off, but everything stayed on."  </P> <P> Sleeping for safety in police station parking lots, she inched her way across  eight states, 200 miles a day. She earned her keep speaking at colleges and  teaching children free-form sculpture, she said. She arrived in La Jolla six  weeks ago to visit her daughter, and will give free sessions for children at  the Artwalk downtown today and Sunday.  </P> <P> Daughtry and more than 400 other artists will participate in a two-day festival  of music, dance, art and theater downtown on G Street between 5th Avenue and  13th Street.  </P> <P> Daughtry, who retired 10 years ago, said her journey started after she returned  from an eight-year stint as an American expatriate living in Puerto Vallarta.  </P> <P> She returned to the United States after receiving a commission from an Atlanta  museum. But she had always wanted to drive across the country, Daughtry said,  surveying her surroundings from a parking space in La Jolla Village Square this  week.  </P> <P> "I've always been a maverick," she said. "I was the oldest of three children,  and my daddy wanted a boy. So I grew up with a fishing pole in one hand and a  gun in the other."  </P> <P> Daughtry said she worked for 21 years, building up her architectural design and  renovation company in Atlanta. "But this is the most 'out there' I've ever  been. I'm vulnerable, interacting one to one with people. Riding inside my work  of art, my perspective is different from if my work were in a gallery, and  people were viewing it on a wall."  </P> <P> People who get close enough to UMO to see it either smile or laugh, said  Daughtry.  </P> <P> "I think it's bloody wondrous," said Ken Capewell, an English visitor who  happened by. "I love it. I just wish I had a camera."  </P> <P> The truck has helped break the ice with strangers, Daughtry said. And  invariably the first question is, "What is the truck about?"  </P> <P> "Then, all of a sudden, they tell me where they're from," she said. "The truck,  because of its humor and because it is so different, has just shot through all  of these barriers people have.  </P> <P> "When I first started, I really didn't know what would take place. I just  wanted to do it for the fun of it. It was also a way of reintroducing myself to  my country and introducing my country to my work."  </P> <P> Daughtry said she provides a tablet on which people can write their comments.  Then she stands back from the truck to observe their reaction. One wrote,  "Brrrr, is it cold?" Another swore it was the "Jammingest Machine Ever."  </P> <P> They don't know if a male or female owns the truck, she said.  </P> <P> Many women are not interested in the truck. "If I have 50 people -- 25 men and  25 women -- all 25 men will walk over, but probably 10, if that many, of the  women would. I think it's because a vehicle is still thought of as a masculine  object.  </P> <P> "I've identified three categories of people," she said. "There are people who  identify with the vehicle. They oooh and ah, and they want to touch it, and  they interact with it. There is no barrier and that's wonderful.  </P> <P> "Then I'll have people, when I pull up to a stop sign, they'll see it but  they're afraid. They're full of fear of anything unusual or not the norm. They  choose not to let it come into their space. I can tell they can see it, but  they're afraid to show any type of emotion.  </P> <P> "Then, there's the third category of people who don't see it at all. They look  straight at it, and they just don't see it."  </P> <P> Children react completely differently, she said: "Kids look at the truck, and  their reaction is, 'I can't believe an adult did it.'  </P> <P> "It is real childlike, and that is the fun part of it. This is a work of art  that's OK to touch."  </P> <P> Daughtry said she'll be leaving for Los Angeles in the next two weeks, but she  has already had one big break.  </P> <P> Harrod Blank, the son of producer Les Blank who has done documentaries on such  things as people with spaces between their front teeth, Cajun music, food, and  musician Lightnin' Hopkins, plans to include UMO in a film on art cars called  "Wild Wheels."  </P> <P> Usually art cars are fashioned out of Cadillacs or Volkswagen bugs, she said.  </P></p>

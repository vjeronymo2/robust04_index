			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Algerians deny Iraqi nuclear link ALGERIA'S Foreign Ministry said yesterday that there was no truth in British press reports that Iraq had supplied either experts or nuclear materials to help Algeria build a military nuclear reactor. Algeria said it had decided to submit both its nuclear reactors - at Draria and at Ain Oussera - to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Mr Lakdar Brahimi, Algerian minister of foreign affairs, said yesterday: 'As far as I know the agency is 100 per cent satisfied with the arrangements that have been or are in the process of being made.' Britain yesterday urged Algeria to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but a British official refused to confirm the report in the Sunday Times. 'We look to Algeria to abide by this undertaking and invite the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) as soon as possible' to inspect the plant, a British official said. He said China, which is helping Algeria to build the reactor, had given similar assurances. 'We also note Algeria's affirmation of a commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and we urge her to formalise this commitment by acceding to the NPT,' the official said. Meanwhile, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, Algeria's prime minister, acknowledged yesterday that last month's vote for the radical Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) reflected the population's 'profound despair'. Breaking a 10-day silence, Mr Ghozali told Algerian journalists that despite his government's best efforts, the elections had not been as fair as he had hoped. Mr Abdelkader Hachani, provisional leader of the FIS, which won 47.3 per cent of votes in the first round of polling on December 26, said that most cases of alleged fraud sent to the Constitutional Council were 'completely without foundation'. 'Other extremist parties which have been rejected by the people are trying to manipulate the media in order to frighten off these people from the choice of an Islamic state,' he said. Observers say that complaints of cheating will make little difference to the commanding lead seized by the fundamentalists in the first round of voting.</p>

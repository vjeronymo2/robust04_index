			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Haiti embargo 'leaky' The US ambassador to Haiti said yesterday that a three-day-old total trade embargo clamped on the Caribbean nation had been violated repeatedly, Reuter reports from Malpasse, Haiti. Ambassador William Swing said at the border with the Dominican Republic that oil was coming in from Haiti's neighbour and acknowledged the embargo had been broken several times since it was imposed at midnight on Saturday. He was referring to reports that boats loaded with fuel entered the southern Haitian port of Jacmel this week. Mr Swing spent about 15 minutes at the Malpasse crossing, through which much of the smuggled fuel and other contraband goods pass. Minutes before he arrived, Haitian entrepeneurs in rowboats docked on Lake Saumatre's shore with illegally imported fuel. The UN imposed the embargo on Haiti to try to force intransigent military leaders to allow democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to power. The military toppled Aristide in a bloody coup 32 months ago.</p>

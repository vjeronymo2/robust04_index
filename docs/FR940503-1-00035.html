			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the hearing, the Agency has the burden of going forward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and proving that the violation occurred and that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty is appropriate. After a prima facie case is established,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Respondent has the burden of presenting and going forward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any defense to the allegations in the citation. The matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in controversy are determined by the Presiding Officer upon a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preponderance of evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearing must be transcribed. Within twenty days after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transcript is available, the parties may submit proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings of fact and conclusions of law with supporting briefs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reply briefs are also authorized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Presiding Officer issues the initial decision, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consists of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil penalty. In reaching an initial decision, the Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer is required to consider the statutory penalty assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria listed in section 113(e), section 205(c) or section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(d) of the Act, as appropriate. For section 113(e), these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria include: The size of the business; the economic impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the penalty on the business; the Respondent's full compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history; the Respondent's good faith efforts to comply; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration of the violation as established by any credible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence; payment by the Respondent of penalties previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed for the same violation; the economic benefit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance; the seriousness of the violation; and such other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors as justice may require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Presiding Officer recommends a penalty different from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the one proposed by the citation, the initial decision must set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth the specific reasons for the increase or decrease. Either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party may file a motion to reopen the hearing within twenty (20)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days of service of the initial decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unless a party appeals to the Environmental Appeals Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the Board) within twenty (20) days of service, or unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board elects to review it  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sua sponte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Presiding Officer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial decision becomes a final order of the Board within forty-five (45) days after service. A final order of the Board shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt, modify or set aside the findings and conclusions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial decision. The Board is authorized to increase or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease the assessed penalty, except in the case of a default  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order. A motion for reconsideration of the final order may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed with the Board within ten (10) days after service of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural Due Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA analyzed the issue of procedural due process with its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidated APA rules of practice when they were promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See 52 FR 2922 (August 6, 1987) (NPRM) and 57 FR 4316  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (February 4, 1992) (FRM). In that analysis EPA evaluated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balanced the three factors specified by the Supreme Court in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mathews  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eldridge <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 424 U.S. 319 (1976) for determining whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the administrative procedure provided to an individual prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deprivation of a property interest meets the due process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the Fifth Amendment: the magnitude and nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the individual interest at stake, the risk of an erroneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deprivation of that interest and the benefit of additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures in reducing that risk, and the governmental interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in not providing such additional procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's APA style hearing procedures would certainly satisfy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedural due process considerations as well as statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements if employed for hearings on field citations. By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute APA adjudication procedures are not required. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations are by definition minor in nature and should involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simple and straightforward factual and legal situations. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact, EPA believes these procedures provide significantly more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process than required by the Fifth Amendment for hearings on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field citations, and are proposed as an option not because of due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process considerations but because of the expected benefits of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having a single set of procedures governing all administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty proceedings under the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also considering certain revisions to the Part 22  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures to account for the minor nature of the violations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue under the field citation program. First, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering using presiding officers that are not administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law judges. As with other non-APA situations, the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presiding officers would conduct the hearings and take other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions. This would help to conserve the agency's administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law judge resources for APA hearings, with no expected reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the accuracy of the hearing process. The Agency is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering such revisions as making the prehearing conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optional and changing the deadline for default from twenty to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thirty days following service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

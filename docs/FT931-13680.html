			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: Mortgage relief alternative Sir, Re your article 'The threat to interest relief on mortgages' (January 16) and current speculation on budget requirements prompts me to suggest a simple approach limiting relief to earlier years of home ownership, namely: relief to be available only for 10 years after first purchase, (or for five years after April 1 1993 for existing qualifying mortgages). future first-time buyers after April 1 1993 to be eligible for relief on Pounds 40,000; this level to be open for budget revision every four years. relief to be available on subsequent qualifying house purchases within the time period defined above, but only at the level initially allowed.

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOWER INTEREST RATES 'ARE JUSTIFIED,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS  </P> <P> The White House, breaking with its usual no-comment stance on activities of the  Federal Reserve Board, said today that "lower interest rates are justified."  </P> <P> Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said recent economic reports show that  the economy could benefit from an easier monetary policy.  </P> <P> "We had a recent drop in the prime (rate). That hasn't been totally passed  through. But we nevertheless remain hopeful that it will be," Fitzwater told  reporters.  </P> <P> Major banks lowered the prime interest rate Jan. 8 to 10%, down from 10.5%. The  independent Federal Reserve, however, has not lowered its bellwether 7%  discount rate, the rate it charges other banks, for nearly a year.  </P> <P> Asked whether sending a message to the central bank from the White House  briefing room ran counter to the Administration's general policy of not  commenting on matters before the Fed, Fitzwater said:  </P> <P> "This is not a new message. But it's important occasionally to point out that  lower interest rates are normally good for the economy."  </P></p>

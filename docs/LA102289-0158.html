			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BUILDING UP STEAM;  </P> <P> THE FRESHMAN-LADEN CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS TOROS ARE LOOKING TO THE FUTURE  </P> <P> Dan Guerrero, the athletic director at Cal State Dominguez Hills, was strolling  through the Toro gymnasium recently when a loose basketball rolled past his  feet.  </P> <P> What Guerrero saw after that amazed him. Two freshman basketball players  hustled after the ambling orb on its path through a door and into the athletic  training room, all the while jostling for position, each intent on getting  control of the ball first.  </P> <P> Athletes trying to impress coaches in early season basketball practices is  nothing new, but Guerrero, who wants Dominguez Hills to become a perennial  national Division II power by the early 1990s, was excited to see the extent to  which the newcomers carried their enthusiasm for Coach Dave Yanai conducting  practice nearby.  </P> <P> "Dave had a great recruiting class and I look for him to have another good one  next year," said Guerrero.  </P> <P> True, Yanai had a very good recruiting season, thanks in part of a cash influx  on the part of Guerrero's administration. Some of the money helped Yanai make  increased scholarship offers. Three newcomers on this year's team were selected  to The Times' All-South Bay high school team and one of those was an All-City  Section selection.  </P> <P> But, as with many new things, this team will take time to develop. In the  meantime, maybe a year or two, its performances are expected to be uneven at  best. Yet, there are people like Guerrero who believe that a few more key  additions next year will help the Toros mature into a very good basketball team  in the next decade.  </P> <P> With nine new players and only one bona fide starter returning, Yanai admitted  that this year may be "an adventure." Hustle, then, is a quality Yanai is  looking for this season in his freshman-laden club, which follows a group that  went 20-10 and advanced to the Western Regionals. Yanai brings a 186-137 record  into the season.  </P> <P> Without 6-foot-7 center Anthony Blackmon, now playing in Japan, the Toros  figure to be a much different-looking team, shorter and perhaps quicker. How  quickly they can adapt to the loss of a big man in the middle who produced 20  points and 10 rebounds a game will determine their fate.  </P> <P> "We have so many young players. They've got to buckle up and get better," Yanai  said. "We'll be slower starting in terms of winning in the early going. Our  concern is progress and getting ready for the conference."  </P> <P> Still, Yanai bristles at the thought of a "rebuilding year."  </P> <P> "I don't ever like to use that term. This is not a rebuilding year. Every year  we prepare our players to compete for the championship."  </P> <P> A rugged preseason schedule that includes games with sectional powers Cal State  Hayward, Sonoma State, Washburn U., West Texas State, North Central Illinois,  Grand Canyon College, Quincy College and a pair of games with Biola University  all but guarantees a not so hot won-loss record going into California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. play in January. In fact, this may be the toughest  preseason slate Dominguez Hills has had, all part of Guerrero's wishes to  upgrade the Toro schedule.  </P> <P> "This schedule is very, very tough for this club," Yanai said. "It's tough for  any club in any given year."  </P> <P> Yanai said the Toros will run a bit more than last year, because, without  Blackmon, the CCAA's Athlete of the Year, a half-court offense might not be as  effective.  </P> <P> Look for junior guard Robert Barksdale from Hawthorne to spur the fast-breaking  Toros from the point. Last year he averaged 13.4 points and 3.5 assists per  game. From the free throw line he made 84% of his attempts. He also made 40% of  his three-point tries. A streaky shooter, he seldom misses when he is on a  roll.  </P> <P> "Robert has to give us a great deal of leadership," Yanai said. "From a scoring  standpoint, the loss of Blackmon will hurt, but Robert is very capable."  </P> <P> Six-foot-2 sophomore Mike Bell (2.6 points per game), a strong defensive player  in a substitute role last year, figures to get the initial start at the  off-guard spot, but look for freshman Raymond Bennett, who averaged 16.5 points  a game at Carson High School, to see plenty of playing time. Senior swing Kevin  Shaw will probably see more time off the bench at the guard spot, although  newcomers John Brown (Montebello), Anthony Gonzales (Garfield), Shelton Hill  (Bishop Montgomery) and Eddie Wilson (Manual Arts) have a shot.  </P> <P> The front line is "in limbo," according to Yanai. Freshmen Vincent Washington  from Carson, the Pacific League's Most Valuable Player last spring, will play a  role. He averaged 17 points a game. Shaw, who grabbed 11 rebounds in the  consolation game of the Western Regional, could move up front if he has too,  but more likely look for newcomers Joseph Janney from Ghana and walk-on Norman  Francis from Fairfax, on-again, off-again starters Segaro Bozart (6.4 points  per game) and Brian Johnson (3.9) and red-shirt junior Michael Rudberg (1.9) to  battle for front-line jobs. Curtis Wright, a 6-foot-8 freshman from Modesto,  hopes to walk on. In the wings is Damon Estelle, also of Carson, who did not  qualify academically according to NCAA rules (Proposition 48), will be eligible  to play in December if he finishes 12 units in the fall semester. In 1988 at  Carson he averaged 12.3 points and 8.9 rebounds a game.  </P> <P> "We're basically starting with two guards and everything else is up for grabs,"  Yanai said. "This is a nice group of kids, a hard-working bunch."  </P> <P> Derrick Clark, last year's point guard, is finishing his quest for a college  degree, now that his playing days are over. He will assist Yanai this season,  as will Bart Yamachika. Those are familiar faces for Yanai, who hopes desire  and hustle from a new group of players will counter inexperience.  </P> <P> "They don't want for competition," he said with a smile. "They don't know what  they are doing yet, but they are trying very, very hard."  </P></p>

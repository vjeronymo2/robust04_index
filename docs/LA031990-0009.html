			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAY THE MONEY, BUY THE LAND AND NAME IT HOPE  </P> <P> Whereas in the 1960s Mr. Bob Hope made substantial investments in land in the  Santa Monica Mountains,  </P> <P> Whereas much of these lands are sought after by the National Park Service by  virtue of their ecological, wildlife and recreational value, and have been  scheduled for acquisition and inclusion in the Santa Monica Mountains National  Recreation Area,  </P> <P> Whereas due to recent budget restraints few funds have been available to  purchase these lands,  </P> <P> Whereas Mr. Hope at 86 understandably wishes to sell these lands by way of  organizing his estate,  </P> <P> Whereas these lands, if sold for development, would be lost forever to future  generations for parkland use,  </P> <P> Whereas Mr. Hope has charitable inclinations in other directions and is  reluctant to simply donate his land as parkland,  </P> <P> Whereas recent calls by environmentalists and others have cast an unreasonable  slur on Mr. Hope's good name,  </P> <P> Whereas Mr. Hope has provided valuable service to the Nation as an entertainer,  particularly in his travels abroad during wartime to entertain the troops, and  we recognize that the time has come to recognize this service,  </P> <P> Therefore let all join in urging Congress to make a special appropriation from  the Land and Water Conservation Fund with which to purchase for the Nation  these Hope properties, and that some appropriate part of the land be named  after Mr. Bob Hope.  </P></p>

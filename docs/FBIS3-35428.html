'Udayy, the failure,  said in an article published in his own paper, BABIL, that his  father's regime should not rely on its current foreign policy to  lift or ease the international sanctions, saying that the regime  did not obtain anything from the United Nations in exchange for  the [word indistinct] overflights over Iraq and the imposition  of long-term monitoring of its installations.    Observers think that 'Udayy is trying to hold the Foreign  Ministry responsible for Saddam's follies. He also attributed  the slump in the Iraqi dinar to the [word indistinct] ministry.    'Udayy's criticism comes in the wake of rumors that Muhammad  Sa'id al-Sahhaf will be dismissed from the Foreign Minister's  post in a new cabinet reshuffle.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Midsummer Blair-mania Mr John Major is still prime minister of the United Kingdom. It is probable that he will remain in the post until the next general election, which need not be held until spring 1997. The outcome is unpredictable: the Conservatives are capable, given the will, of winning again. These statements of the obvious should serve as reminders that the upsurge of sympathetic interest in the Labour party under Mr Tony Blair, its new leader, could be a midsummer bubble. Even if that is not so, Blair-mania is out of proportion. Mr Rupert Murdoch has famously said that he could imagine circumstances in which he, and presumably by extension some of his newspapers, might support Mr Blair. The polls register improbable leads for Labour. Some business leaders are looking afresh at the opposition. In consequence, there is a sense that the period of Conservative rule that began in 1979 is drawing to a close. The electorate is disenchanted with the Tories. There is no need to draw on anecdote or the polls to demonstrate this. It has been shown in successive by-elections, local council contests and the poor performance of Conservative candidates for the European parliament. The government's ill-fortune persists, as shown by Mr Michael Portillo's imprudent and hasty acceptance of legal advice that European Union legislation on subsidised public procurement contracts necessarily excludes favourable treatment for disabled workers. The just-promoted employment secretary may be correct in law, and a doughty Eurosceptic, but he is wrong in politics. The administration is still walking on banana-skins. What is questionable is the degree of lasting, solid support for Labour. The hard evidence - votes cast in recent elections - is that the party is not doing any better than might be expected of it in mid-term, and rather worse, considering the level of unemployment and the contempt in which the Conservatives are held, than it should. The Labour leader is untried. He is a telegenic, well-spoken politician whose first appearances have held out much promise. That is all. He has many tests ahead. He must manage, and survive, his party's autumn conference. He has yet to appear in parliament as leader of his party. The voters will want to see how he performs under fire. In the longer run the electorate will need to be convinced that the Labour party itself has changed. There are already left-wing rumblings against Mr Blair's non-socialist precepts. These can be ignored, provided the mainstream of party thinking is running in the right direction. The new leader's unique selling point, that the support of the community strengthens the individual, has to be translated into a programme. The election manifesto, when it comes, must be costed, the tax implications worked out, and the whole sold to a public that is wearily sceptical of all political blandishments. Then, and only then, will a change of government be likely.</p>

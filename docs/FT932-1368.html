			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / US durables orders down 1.6% in May: Decline raises new doubts about momentum of growth NEW orders for durable goods fell 1.6 per cent between April and May, raising fresh doubts about the momentum of US growth, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The decline was the third setback in three months and was broadly based, indicating a distinct softening of the industrial sector - even allowing for the notorious volatility of the figures. The consensus forecast on Wall Street had been for an increase in orders of about 1 per cent. The recent decline, however, has only erased a portion of earlier gains: orders are still nearly 9 per cent higher than in May last year. Business activity is set to expand sluggishly in most parts of the country, according to the Federal Reserve's latest 'beige book' survey of regional economic trends, also published yesterday. It says manufacturing was 'steady or improving' in most districts in May and June; retail sales were 'generally higher'. However, businesses surveyed by the Fed said uncertainty about federal tax increases and healthcare reform was causing delays in investment and the hiring of new workers. Reports from retailers indicated that fears about higher taxes could also be inhibiting a more vigorous revival of consumer spending. In a separate report, the Commerce Department revised down gross domestic product for the first quarter to show growth at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent rather than 0.9 per cent previously estimated. This compared with growth at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent in the final quarter of last year. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the figures were disappointing and showed that the economy was 'still performing under capacity'. Most forecasters continue to predict a modest rebound of the economy this quarter with GDP growing at an annual rate of at least 2 per cent. In the second half, growth is expected to rise to an annual rate of closer to 3 per cent. But the weak tone of some recent data and gloomy reports from many corporate chief executives have raised doubts about the plausibility of these relatively optimistic forecasts. 'Most of our sectoral analysts are telling us that the economy is not that firm,' said Mr Ed McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. Retail analysts were especially gloomy because recent advances in sales seemed to depend on promotions and discounts. Residential housing was one of the few sectors showing definite signs of improvement. Speculation about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy plans continued yesterday. The New York Times said the Fed was still considering a small increase in short-term rates despite improved inflation figures in May. Many analysts, however, predict that the Fed will not move in the near future unless the economy shows more definite signs of strength.</p>

It can be  explained by the absence of the Azerbaijani leaders' desire to  take the bodies of the soldiers and officers to conceal the true  quantity of losses they have in the clashes.    According to the data received from the Staff of the  Karabakh  Defense Army, the great number unburied bodies -- about 350 --  are at the suburbs of the Madagiz village, Mardakertskiy region.  During the period of last 20 days about 800 soldiers and  officers of the Azerbaijani Army were killed there. They were  the 18-19 years old, the residents of Baku and Sumgait.    Recently at the border of the Martuninskiy (Karabakh) and  Agdamskiy (Azerbaijan) regions more than 200 lost Azeris  militaries were buried in the common tomb. Their documents  witness the fact -- they were within the Mingechaur infantry  battalion.</p>

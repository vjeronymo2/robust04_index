			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Observer: Short-changed Well, it's one way to add names to the shareholder register. When Hendon fruiterer Harold Isaaman recently went into the Midland branch opposite his shop to change a tenner into one pound coins, the cashier offered him just eight pounds. She explained that she was deducting a fee of two pounds for this simple little service. 'Oh, Mr Isaaman,' sighed a bank spokesman, when Observer rang to discuss the policy on small change. 'He's not even a customer of the bank.' Midland then explained that, if you don't bank there, you can expect a charge of 2 per cent, with a Pounds 2 minimum - levied at the discretion of the local manager. Nor is it just the listening bank. Lloyds says that for non-customers changing money on a regular basis it will expect to collect Pounds 3 per transaction. Barclays goes one better and explains: 'We'd rather they (non customers) didn't come to us at all. We might suggest they go somewhere else.' So an incensed Isaaman went out this week and bought two shares in Midland's new owners, the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. Now he can turn up at the next agm to see if his fellow shareholders think this is the way for recession-bound institutions to create goodwill and expand their customer base.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Rated A: The New York Times has accepted an ad for a movie that carries an  adults-only rating assigned to it by its own distributor.  </P> <P> Wayne Wang's "Life Is Cheap . . . But Toilet Paper Is Expensive" was rated X by  the Motion Picture Assn. of America, but Silverlight Entertainment, arguing  that the X creates an undue economic hardship on films, put its own "A" label  -- for adults only -- on the ad and submitted it to the New York Times. The  newspaper has in recent years rejected ads for X-rated movies, but has run ads  for films that went out unrated. "Life Is Cheap" opens in New York on Aug. 24  and in Los Angeles in September.

The need for such tours has been occasioned by several  circumstances. There is, above all, the pressing need to verify  locally the possibility of the practical implementation of the  military doctrine's new ideas. In addition, the defense  minister and the generals and officers accompanying him will get  a good opportunity to familiarize themselves with the  organization and course of combat training under the present far  from simple conditions and to gain a clearer idea of the  prospects for the organizational development of Russia's highly  mobile Armed Forces.    Such tours will also provide an opportunity for personal  talks with the administration heads of the oblasts, krays,  cities, and rayons where Army units and combined units are  stationed -- which will undoubtedly contribute to resolving the  existing social problems in practice locally.    Army General Pavel Grachev cited familiarization with the  organization and course of combat training and with the  provision of facilities for the personnel of the tank army  withdrawn from Germany and the airborne division withdrawn from  the Transcaucasus as the priority area of his work in the Volga  Military District. It was no coincidence that right after  arriving in Samara 7 February the representatives of the  Ministry of Defense listened to what the district command's had  to say about these problems.    As the defense minister pointed out, on the whole the tasks  set the district in terms of combat and mobilization readiness,  operational and combat training, and strengthening military  discipline are being fulfilled. Today the district's troops are  capable of fulfilling the tasks facing them. Pavel Grachev  emphasized, however, that in the very near future it will be  necessary to improve considerably the quality of the combat  training of individual units and combined units, a list of  which, incidentally, has been drawn up separately and which will  become, as the new military doctrine requires, airmobile and  capable of being moved great distances very quickly and  fulfilling the set combat tasks under very complex conditions.    In the course of the hearing the question of the urgent need  to go over to a territorial system of troop control was also  raised. It is abnormal when the commander of a particular  military district is not the sole master of, let us assume, the  units of central subordination stationed on this district's  territory. As Army General Pavel Grachev pointed out, the  elimination of this gap is a task for the very near future.    When speaking today of enhancing combat readiness, the  problem of the troops' undermanning cannot be overlooked. This,  in particular, was discussed at the defense minister's meeting  with officers of Samara Garrison, which was held in the District  Officers' House. For the first time in two years the latest  draft into the Army proceeded in an organized manner. As the  result of joint efforts by all the structures involved, the  military commissariats were able to ensure that the Armed Forces  today are almost 60-percent manned. If you compare this figure  with the indicators for the fall of 1993, when manning stood at  just 42.8 percent, it is clear that things are on the mend.    As for the Volga Military District, here the plan for the  draft was fulfilled by 95 percent. This indicator in itself is  quite high. Something else is of concern. Whereas some  military commissariats managed to cope excellently with the task  of the draft (the Bashkir Republic Military Commissariat  achieved a 100-percent draft, and the Perm and Orenburg Oblast  Military Commissariats had indicators just a little lower), the  defense minister called the work of the Tatar Republic Military  Commissariat and the Samara and Kirov Oblast Military  Commissariats unsatisfactory. The draft for service under  contract does not arouse concern. In the Middle Volga Region it  stood at 125 percent of the planned level.    The Army's further reduction was also discussed at the  meeting with officers. According to a statement by Army General  Pavel Grachev, by 1 January 1995 the organization and  establishment and the actual strength of the Armed Forces are to  be comparable and stand at 2 million men. Colonel General  Anatoliy Sergeyev, commander of the Volga Military District,  reported that not one officer or ensign without an apartment  will be discharged in the district. But if this does happen,  that person will retain his place in the line to obtain housing  in the unit where he completed his service.    During the meeting the defense minister presented valuable  gifts to the district's officers who had distinguished  themselves. Late in the evening of 7 February Army General  Pavel Grachev had talks with representatives of the Samara  Oblast Administration.</p>

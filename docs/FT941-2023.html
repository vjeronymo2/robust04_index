			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / MPs 'nowhere near' decision on CrossRail The chairman of a Commons committee considering the Pounds 2bn CrossRail plan for an east-west underground railway link across London yesterday dismissed claims that the project is doomed. Mr Tony Marlow, chairman of a committee of MPs considering a bill providing for the link between British Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street stations, said the committee was 'nowhere near reaching any decision on anything'. Mr Marlow, the Conservative MP for Northampton North, spoke after reports that the committee had accepted evidence that the link would be uneconomic. His assurance was welcomed by London Transport and British Rail, the promoters of the bill, which was tabled after Mr John Major, prime minister, overruled a Treasury attempt to block the project. The link is regarded as essential by British Rail but Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, argued that the benefits would not justify the proposed public investment of Pounds 1bn. Observers of the committee, which has been sitting for several weeks, say members have, however, taken a sceptical approach to the project. The main critic of the bill, Tower Hamlets council in east London, says the link would cause more congestion than it would relieve. The council argues that the link should join the proposed high-speed rail line from London to the Channel tunnel at Stratford, in east London. The committee is expected to take a decision on the Tower Hamlets argument after Easter, after further evidence from British Rail and London Transport. But Mr Marlow told Mr Steven Norris, the London Transport minister, last Wednesday that the project might not 'stand up' unless this link was agreed. The bill's promoters yesterday argued that CrossRail would provide greater benefits than projects such as London's Victoria Line and the Newcastle Metro. Tower Hamlets disputed the promoters' figures.</p>

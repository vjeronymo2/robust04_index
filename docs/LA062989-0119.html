			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Joseph Remiro, the Symbionese Liberation Army member jailed for killing  Oakland's school superintendent, has been denied parole, authorities said.  Remiro, 42, did not attend the Board of Prison Terms hearing at Corcoran State  Prison. A three-member panel voted unanimously to deny a release date and  recommended another hearing in two years. Remiro was convicted in 1973 of  killing Oakland Schools Supt. Marcus Foster with cyanide-tipped bullets. Two  months later, the SLA, a band of self-described revolutionaries, kidnaped  newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.  </P></p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Strong-arm tactics: The managed trade camp in the US is gaining revisionist adherents It used to be said that nothing is certain except death and taxes. Japanese bureaucrats would probably add a third certainty to the list: US demands for a reduction of trade barriers. Whatever the character of the new Japanese government, it can count on unrelenting pressure from the Clinton administration, not just to respect the letter of trade agreements, but to bring the share of Japanese imports in sensitive sectors into line with global norms. Washington's determination to make Japan change its ways is reflected not just in the speeches of administration officials, but in revisionist thinking on the part of its think-tanks. In a book * on US-Japan economic relations published today, Fred Bergsten and Marcus Noland of the Institute for International Economics join the managed trade camp, arguing that traditional strong-arm tactics are essential if the US is to gain reasonable access to many Japanese markets. They claim that Japanese trade barriers are reducing US exports by up to Dollars 18bn a year. It is a volte face for Bergsten, the institute's director, who championed liberal trade policies throughout the 1980s. A few years ago, for the sake of intellectual balance, he invited Ms Laura Tyson, then a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, to write a book on managed trade. Now he is echoing her arguments, and Noland has left the institute to join her staff at the Council of Economic Advisers. Bergsten and Noland claim they remain free traders at heart. Their preferred course is to identify specific trade barriers and demand their removal. But, they say, restrictive practices are often so entrenched and opaque that this is impracticable: 'In such cases the US has to choose. It can try to induce Japan (through governmental action or changes in the behaviour of Japanese companies) to accept one or two American firms into an existing cartel, (the 'co-optation strategy'), or it can seek a voluntary import expansion that would benefit a much larger number of outsiders', they write. The co-opting of American companies into a cartel is tantamount to an admission of defeat. It can be justified only on political grounds. As Bergsten and Noland admit, it will often backfire because once US companies begin to earn monopoly profits in Japanese markets, they lose interest in trade liberalisation. Voluntary import expansion orders (VIEs) are another name for the quantitative market share targets that the Clinton administration has already signalled it favours. As in the notorious 1986 semiconductor agreement, Japanese bureaucrats, in effect, would be asked to reserve a portion of the home market for foreign companies. There is no rational means of determining what that share should be. The authors say such deals are a 'second best' solution but proceed to recommend them, for example in supercomputers and fibre optics. This explicit stamp of approval for managed trade from a respected, centrist research institute is quite a coup for the Clinton administration, which can now claim that its policies reflect the 'mainstream' views of US academia. Yet much of the Bergsten/Noland analysis hardly supports their own conclusions. They start by pointing out that the US's bilateral trade deficit with Japan has barely risen in recent years and is anyway 'not a proper focus for policy'. The significant imbalance is Japan's Dollars 130bn overall current account surplus, and this can best be influenced by macroeconomic levers, such as fiscal policy and currency appreciation. They argue, correctly, that the US and Japan are converging economically (meaning they are becoming more, rather than less, alike) and that Japanese trade barriers have fallen markedly in the past decade. They point out that corporate America has begun to put its house in order and that loss of US competitiveness largely reflects domestic failings such as low savings, and poor education and training. If Japan is changing anyway, why throw in the towel on free trade? With the Clinton administration lurching towards bureaucratically managed trade with Japan, should not the institute be emphasising the classic arguments for multilateral, rule-based trade? Bergsten is obviously sensitive to such arguments. Indeed, he says he was on a knife edge when writing the book. He might easily have come down against even limited forms of managed trade. What caused him to change his mind, he says, was detailed analysis of individual Japanese sectors. Bergsten and Noland looked at the whole gamut of economic activity from agriculture to cars, computers and financial services. In virtually every case they claim to find a profusion of barriers, albeit often of subtle forms. The book, says Bergsten, 'is a damning indictment of a closed, exclusionary system'. Some of the evidence is summarised in the table. The import penetration ratio in Japanese manufacturing is below 6 per cent compared with more than 15 per cent in both Germany and the US. The extraordinarily low level of foreign direct investment in Japan is reflected in foreign companies' minuscule 1 per cent share of all domestic sales; comparable figures are 10 per cent in the US and 18 per cent in Germany. Nobody disputes that Japan should take steps to open domestic markets. The argument is over the means to this end. Bergsten has joined the growing camp that argues that Japanese restrictions are so egregious that unorthodox methods must now be tried. He also believes that gaiatsu - strong pressure from outsiders - is the only way to bring about changes that are ultimately in Japan's own interests. Like the Clinton administration, the book makes a strong case. Turning up the heat on Japan may produce wonderful results. With luck, VIEs would lead rapidly to genuinely liberal trade with gains for all concerned. But by focusing on the short-run impact of policies on Japan, Bergsten and Noland understate the longer-term risks inherent in government bargaining over trade shares. VIEs could easily spread just as voluntary export restraints did in the 1980s, in the process progressively undermining the global trading system. Since their own analysis suggests no vital American economic interest is at stake, it is not clear this is a risk worth taking. Why not be more patient, seek remedies through established multilateral channels, such as the Gatt, and rely on the common sense of young Japanese consumers to force change at home? * Reconcilable Differences?

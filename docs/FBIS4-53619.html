			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Cut Corners of Deregulation Package"] </F>   [Text] Although the government is scheduled to work out  deregulation measures by the end of June, it's stand of carrying  out deregulation is still questionable. This is because certain  ministries and agencies seem to have turned to be negative about  deregulations following the inauguration of the minority  government. We cannot allow them to take such negative  attitudes. On 13 May, the Federation of Economic Organizations  of Japan [Keidanren] handed over to Prime Minister Hata a  request calling for carrying out drastic deregulations for 196  items in seven areas of business such as land and housing,  information and communications, goods distribution, and  agriculture. We believe Keidanren must have perceived such a  negative atmosphere within ministries and agencies.    The government sets deregulation measures as a main pillar  of  its market-opening package -- aimed at stimulating the sluggish  Japanese economy and its appetite for imports -- scheduled to be  worked out in June. Deregulatory steps are preconditions for  rectifying trade imbalance; creating more transparent, open  markets; and maintaining domestic demand-led economic growth.  The prime minister, after a meeting with Keidanren on 13 May,  in which he was strongly urged to take deregulatory steps,  called a first meeting with his select ministers including  foreign and finance ministers and confirmed with them a stand of  positively coming to grips with the issue. As reflected in this  issue, politicians are required to take leadership also in the  area of deregulations. It is expected that deregulation can  help create new business chances, thus leading to stimulating  the nation's economy. On the other hand, it is painful for  certain business circles which have long enjoyed their vested  right and for authoritative ministries and agencies to promote  deregulation. It is statesmen's role to promote deregulation  while breaking down the resistance of bureaucrats.    Foreign nations are taking increasing interest in Japan's  deregulatory steps. At the meeting of select cabinet members,  Foreign Minister Kakizawa said European nations and the United  States are calling for various deregulation measures including  the easing of the Building Standards Act and the Large-Scale  Retail Stores Law and the expediting of customs services at  airports. At an Office of Trade Investment Ombudsmen meeting  held on the same day, a deregulation proposal was presented  calling for easing 21 regulations, including one that limits  driving licenses for large motorcycles -- which is very  difficult to obtain -- to help foreign-made products get access  the Japanese market. The proposal also says the time required  for obtaining import permission for cosmetics and perfumes  should be shortened.    If the government fails to come up with full deregulatory  steps in spite of growing calls for deregulation, Japan will be  exposed to foreign nations' harsh criticism.    Of course, deregulation is not meant only to meet requests  of  foreign nations. In fact, more emphasis should be placed on  boosting Japan's economy. Deregulation is a prerequisite to  boosting the domestic demand in Japan, which is required to  reform its economic structure. It is unavoidable for Japan to  carry out deregulation no matter what the political situation is.    When handing over its written deregulation request to the  prime minister, Keidanren asked the government to adopt three  principles: 1) "zero-base principle" -- that requires the review  of all existing regulations; 2) "sunset principle" -- that  requires the abolishment or review of newly introduced  regulations at least five years after introduction; and 3)  "openness principle" -- that requires the holding of open  hearings when new regulations are introduced.    We believe these are very important. It is hoped that the  government will come up with a deregulation package in light of  Keidanren's requests.    For example, the demand for mobile phones has drastically  increased recently, thus leading to a short supply of products.  In addition, there is a plan afoot by some local towns to brew  their own beer. It is apparent deregulation on mobile phones  and brewing businesses are contributing to boosting the demand  for mobile phones and local towns' brewing plans.    There is a lot of business chances in the Japanese market.  The government should not nip such business chances in the bud.  Carrying out deregulation is also urgently required in view of  encouraging the private sector to stand by itself.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRACKDOWN IN MEXICO  </P> <P> The arrest of a man said to be Mexico's narcotics kingpin is one more  indication that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is serious about  eliminating corruption in the Mexican legal and political system.  </P> <P> Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, who was arrested by Mexican federal agents this  week in the Pacific Coast state of Sinaloa, is considered that nation's top  trafficker in cocaine, heroin and marijuana, not just by Mexican officials but  by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. U.S. officials are so overjoyed at  the seizure of a man they suspect ordered the brutal murder of DEA Agent  Enrique Camarena in 1985 that a DEA spokesman called the arrest a "landmark" in  the history of cooperation between Mexican and U.S. law enforcement.  </P> <P> But if Felix Gallardo is convicted of the myriad of charges filed against him,  his downfall could be an even more important landmark for Mexico. For officials  in Salinas' government have admitted that Felix Gallardo could not have been so  successful in his illicit enterprises without protection from corrupt Mexican  police, the first time high-level Mexican officials have publicly conceded the  existence of police corruption.  </P> <P> One indication of the scope of Felix Gallardo's influence is that six top  Mexican lawmen were arrested in the wake of the suspected drug kingpin's  detention and accused of providing him with weapons, radio equipment and  information about drug investigations. Even more sobering is the fact that,  when federal agents moved against Felix Gallardo, they used Mexican army troops  to detain the entire police force in the city where he lived, Culiacan, until  he was in custody.  </P> <P> The pervasiveness of corruption linked to Felix Gallardo is breathtaking. Yet  it jibes with the cynical feeling that many Mexicans have about their system --  that anyone with enough money and gall can have his way, no matter what the law  says. One great challenge facing the new generation of young Mexican political  leaders epitomized by Salinas is to find a way to restore the peoples'  confidence in the nation's legal and political system. That is why the new  president moved so forcefully in his first few months in office to arrest the  man widely regarded as Mexico's most corrupt union leader, Joaquin Hernandez  Gailicia, and to prosecute a leading businessman, Eduardo Lagoretta, for  illegal activities on Mexico's stock market. Now, Salinas is out to prove that  even the underworld is not beyond the reach of his reformist government.  </P> <P> For the moment, most Mexicans seem to approve of Salinas' actions and are  impressed with their new president's resolve. Given the terrible effect illegal  drugs have in this country and the fact that a third of the cocaine entering  the United States is shipped through Mexico, people in this country should be  pulling for Salinas to succeed, too.  </P></p>

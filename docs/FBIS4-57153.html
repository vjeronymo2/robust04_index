			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister </F> and foreign minister, by Carmen Vrljicak-Espain; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Vrljicak-Espain] What does the cultural agreement  you have just reached with Argentina include; is it satisfactory  and what to you expect in the future?    [Granic] We have decided to begin cooperation but we have  not  specified details. Among other things, we have agreed to  recognize diplomas in a cultural agreement. We are waiting for  the signing of another five agreements in the economic sector.  We believe they will be signed within a month. They pertain to  the peaceful use of nuclear energy and matters in the veterinary  sector -- the most important agreement being the one pertaining  to legal security and the protection of investments -- and we  will also sign an agreement to prevent double taxation. We  already have exemplary relations with Argentina from the  political viewpoint; Argentina was one of the first countries to  recognize us. We also have Argentine Blue Helmets in our  territory, and we recently received the visit of President  Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. We are now  entering into the economic and trade phases.    [Vrljicak-Espain] How will you undertake relations with the  rest of Latin America?    [Granic] We are interested mainly in Argentina, Chile, and  Brazil.    [Vrljicak-Espain] Argentina does not have an embassy in  Croatia. What will be done in this respect?    [Granic] For the time being we will manage through Vienna  because it is just a budget matter.    [Vrljicak-Espain] Regarding your relations with Russia and  the conflict with the Serbs, why was the recent cease-fire  agreement signed at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb?    [Granic] It is true Russia is favorably disposed toward  Serbia, but the Russian Federation also recognizes Croatian  sovereignty and territorial integrity. They organized these  negotiations and as such proposed that the agreement should be  signed at their embassy where representatives of the United  States and United Nations were present.    [Vrljicak-Espain] How would you define Croatian-Russian  relations?    [Granic] They can be considered as correct relations because  Russia recognizes us. It must not be forgotten that Russia  wants a role in the geopolitics of Southeast Europe and  influence over Serbia.    [Vrljicak-Espain] Is Vladimir Zhirinovsky's proposal  regarding Pan-Slavism disquieting because it excludes Croatians  and because it presumably counts on Russian hegemony, especially  if we take into account rumors on Boris Yeltsin's health?    [Granic] We are closely following Russian policies. But for  the time being, we are managing with official relations and  positions. This does not mean current relations with Russia will  remain the same if Zhirinovsky comes to power. This matter not  only concerns Croatia, it also concerns the United States and  the international community.    [Vrljical-Espain] What is your evaluation of the  international community's attitude during the past 2 years, its  current attitude, and what are the prospects?    [Granic] I believe it should have been much more active.  Croatia said this from the beginning. Today, Croatia considers  relations are very good, especially with the United States  following the Washington Agreements. For the first time, a  four-member contact group has been created that includes the  United States, the Russian Federation, the United Nations, and  the EU [European Union] seeking solutions to the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and the UN protected zones.    [Vrljicak-Espain] Many people ask why is there so much hate  between Serbs and Croatians, is it an atavistic conflict or are  there other reasons?    [Granic] They are different peoples. In the 9th century,  Croatia was a kingdom with its own language, culture, and  influence. Croatia was part of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy  for 500 years, while it has only lived beside the Serbs for a  mere 75 years. In 1989, the presidents of Slovenia and Croatia  submitted a proposal to transform what had once been Yugoslavia  into a modern confederation. Serbia said it wanted a centralized  federation, in other words, a Greater Serbia. When it saw that  it could not achieve its objective through negotiations, it  resorted to arms.    [Vrljicak-Espain] What relations does Croatia have with  Serbia?    [Granic] We do not have diplomatic relations, and there will  be no relations until they recognize our sovereignty and  territorial integrity. We maintain a contact office which was  opened within the framework of the Geneva Conference through  intermediaries. We want to normalize relations with them, but  only through recognition.    [Vrljicak-Espain] We know Croatia had an enormous number of  refugees inside and outside its borders. What is the current  situation and what measures are being taken?    [Granic] Croatia is currently looking after 250,000 of its  own people and 280,000 refugees from Bosnia. More than 600,000  people have crossed the territory (from Bosnia) who went to  Germany, Switzerland, Slovenia, and Austria. It is estimated  that there are still 80,000 to 100,000 displaced persons for  which Croatia wishes to care. It is our desire that all these  people return. Of those that left, more than half have returned.    [Vrljicak-Espain] What can you tell us about relations  between Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy, especially over the  irredeemable statements of the neo-fascists?    [Granic] Regarding Italy, it is a question of individual  statements. We are closely following what is happening there.  We want good relations with Italy, but we will not accept  changes in the current agreements regarding the borders. We have  a few minor matters that are still pending with Slovenia that do  not affect our good relations.    [Vrljicak-Espain] Moving to another topic, we have heard  that  you are successfully fighting inflation.    [Granic] Inflation reached 30 percent per month in 1993 and  now we have reduced it to 0.1 percent.    [Vrljicak-Espain] How did you achieve this?    [Granic] Through a balanced budget and a restriction in  public spending.    [Vrljicak-Espain] Could it be said that you copied Argentine  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo?    [Granic] We are closely observing Argentina's economic  program.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / The strongest candidate Choosing a Man or Woman of the Year can be tricky and, by definition, subjective - the more so in a year as sombre and confused as 1992 has proved in many parts of the world. Amid the encircling gloom, few international figures stand out as having made distinctive achievements or having left a potentially durable impression on our lives as with some previous choices - Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher or Mikhail Gorbachev. Deng Xiaoping - frail, octogenarian, not occupying any formal office, and decidedly politically incorrect - may be a controversial choice, but he is one man who arguably has. To understand this conclusion, consider the alternatives. The strongest also-ran was Bill Clinton, his achievement in defeating George Bush against what seemed insuperable odds being outweighed only by the fact that he has yet to show what kind of president he will be - and by the unusually successful challenge of Ross Perot. Another strong candidate was Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger. His exertions against the scourge of inflation and the perceived fiscal profligacy of the German government have had an undoubted impact on millions of individuals and businesses over the past year in Europe and beyond. The story, however, is far from over. So far the Bundesbank has failed, despite high real German interest rates, to reduce inflation and bring the money supply within its target range. Other runners were disqualified on various grounds. Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao of India made a strong early showing as a result of his government's courageous economic reforms, but fell down over his mishandling of the Ayodhya controversy. Elsewhere, European farm commissioner Ray MacSharry appears to have secured two remarkable agreements - on reforming the EC's Common Agricultural Policy and bringing farm trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - but they may yet be torpedoed. That leaves us with Deng, who launched China's opening to the world in 1978 and gave another hefty boost to economic reform this year. His claim to the title Man of the Year rests on the hypothesis that in 1992, the flowering of Chinese capitalism that he fostered became irreversible; that, despite the manifest flaws of its political system and the worries about its stability, China is becoming a political, economic and commercial force with which the world will increasingly have to reckon.</p>

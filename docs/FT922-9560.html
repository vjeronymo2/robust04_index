			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME plans recycled aluminium contract THE LONDON Metal Exchange is to launch a contract in secondary (recycled) aluminium alloy in early October. The contract - the first totally new product since the launch of the nickel contract in 1979 - has been the subject of hot debate in both the industry and the exchange for nearly two years. During metals week last October some LME members put the chances of getting the contract off the ground at only 50-50. But the odds shortened considerably earlier this year when a special LME committee recommended its introduction. In a short statement yesterday the LME said trading in three month secondary aluminium will begin on October 6, and trading in cash metal on January 4. The exchange has not confirmed the grades of metal to be traded, but they are likely to be the Japanese ADC12, the German DIN 226 and the US 380. The contract is expected to be in US dollars, cover lots of 20 tonnes and be traded 15 months forward. Secondary aluminium was an obvious choice for the LME as it searches for ways to expand its business. Secondary production is a large industry, with output of about 4.5m tonnes a year, mainly of automotive grade alloy. The motor industry uses more than 70 per cent of production. The secondary industry has been growing at 5 per cent a year, compared with only 1 per cent for the primary industry. Mr Angus MacMillan, of Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the contract would be good for both the LME and the secondary aluminium market. 'It's another example of how the LME has started to drag itself into the 20th century since the tin crisis.' Mr Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, also welcomed the contract. Hedging secondary metal against the primary contract was difficult, he said. In theory the two should move in parallel, but in practice they do not.</p>

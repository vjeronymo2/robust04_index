			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Letter: Exercising right to mourn comrades Sir, With reference to the Mayor of Cologne's article, 'Bomber Harris: 'a tactless choice'' (May 2), I have already stated, and repeat, that the statue of Sir Arthur Harris is a memorial to 55,000 of our dead comrades and their commander, erected in our own Royal Air Force church precincts, in our own country, alongside a memorial to the achievements of colleagues in Fighter Command. It is a belated tribute to the dead of a prolonged and bitter battle, immensely important to the ground forces which finally defeated the Germany of Hitler and is intended in part to redress the official neglect of their achievement. The publicity has all come from German sources and the effort to portray Sir Arthur Harris as a war criminal is deeply resented. Churchill, Roosevelt and other allied leaders ordered the strike at the heart of the Third Reich and knew its value to the ultimate defeat of that monstrous regime. The surviving members of Bomber Command deeply regret the loss of civilian life, unfortunately unavoidable in a desperate combat, but simply assert our right to mourn and commemorate our dead comrades. Mackie, House of Lords, London SW1</p>

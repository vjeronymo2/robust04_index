			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CAESAR, WHITFIELD CAN'T SAVE THE MUSICAL 'GOD'S TRYING'  </P> <P> The production of Delilah Rashell Williams' gospel theatrical musical "God's  Trying to Tell You Something" is touted as beginning a new era of theater  presentations at the Palladium Hollywood. Before that can happen, some changes  have to be made.  </P> <P> Though the existing sound system may be perfectly acceptable for big dance  bands and audiences who are primarily interested in moving to the beat, it is  totally unacceptable for much of a theatrical presentation. There's a painful  degree of distortion at any kind of volume, it fades to nothing below a shout,  and both instrumental and vocal overtones constantly crash into each other in  this acoustic wilderness.  </P> <P> It also all but cancels out most of the effectiveness of the only two reasons  for seeing this production -- gospel great and multiple Grammy winner Shirley  Caesar and entertainer David Whitfield. The system can't begin to handle the  subtle shadings and explosions of energy of these two performers. They try  valiantly to surmount the sonic obstacles, but the system and its operators are  against them. Caesar lights up the room whenever she walks onstage, and  Whitfield keeps the crowd jumping; it would be nice to hear them other than  through a pillow darkly.  </P> <P> The opening night performance began an hour late, and the show -- apart from  its technical difficulties -- wasn't worth the wait. Seen six months ago under  the title "Black Folk in Song" at the Westwood Playhouse, it also bears a  striking resemblance to "Voices," which played the Embassy Theatre earlier this  year.  </P> <P> Tied together by a narration that sounds mostly out of a textbook, the first  act is a pageant of black history from pre-slavery up to the beginnings of the  civil rights movement. The second act is a mishmash of pointless comic  sketches, including carryings-on in church and at a Sunday picnic, and a kid  who wants his mother to pay him for doing chores.  </P> <P> It culminates in a lengthy series of middling impressions of memorable black  performers, a stirring tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s memory, and  a stomping if loosely produced gospel finale. It's already been done, and  better.  </P> <P> At 6215 Sunset Blvd., today and Thursday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m.; $26;  213-962-7600.T.H. McCULLOH  </P></p>

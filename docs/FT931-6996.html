			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Dixons enters computers superstores business DIXONS, the UK's largest electricals retailer, has entered the computer superstores business with the Pounds 8.5m purchase of Vision Technology Group. VTG operates four PC World superstores in outer London at Croydon, Staples Corner, Brentford and West Thurrock. In the year to last August it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 400,000 on sales of Pounds 49.3m, after a charge of Pounds 400,000 relating to the cost of launching PC World. A fifth store is due to open in Cardiff, south Wales, later this year. Dixons said PC World represented the UK's first chain of specialist out-of-town computer superstores - a concept widely developed in the US. 'We are very excited about it,' said Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman. 'It gives us a running leap into this business and we are buying out a competitor who is doing very well.' Mr Kalms said PC World catered for more sophisticated customers looking to replace and upgrade existing systems, rather than the families and first-time computer buyers served by Dixons and Currys. He said Dixons hoped quickly to establish market dominance in this sector, and planned to open up to 30 PC World stores within 3 years. Each store was likely to cost about Pounds 1m.</p>

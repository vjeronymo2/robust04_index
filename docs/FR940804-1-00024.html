			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Activities that May Impact Essential Habitat and Features <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A wide range of activities funded, authorized or carried out by Federal agencies may affect the essential habitat requirements of Johnson's seagrass. These include authorization by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for beach nourishment, dredging and related activities including construction of docks and marinas; actions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to manage freshwater discharges into waterways; regulation of vessel traffic by the U.S. Coast Guard; authorization of oil and gas exploration by the Minerals Management Service; management of national refuges and protected species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; management of vessel traffic and other activities by the U.S. Navy; authorization of state coastal zone management plans by NOAA's National Ocean Service, and management of commercial fishing and protected species by NMFS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Expected Impacts of Designating Critical Habitat <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 7 of the ESA, Federal agencies are required to ensure that actions that they authorize, fund or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or to result in the destruction or adverse modification of listed species' critical habitat. Also, takings of Johnson's seagrass will be prohibited under the proposed regulations issued to list the species as threatened. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This designation will identify specific habitat areas that have been determined to be essential for the conservation of Johnson's seagrass and that may be in need of special management considerations or protection. It will require Federal agencies to evaluate their activities with respect to the critical habitat of this species and to consult with NMFS pursuant to section 7 of the ESA before engaging in any action that may affect the critical habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if Johnson's seagrass is listed as proposed, Federal agencies active within the range of the species will be required to consult with NMFS if projects and activities they authorize, fund or otherwise carry out may affect the species, regardless of whether critical habitat is designated. Therefore, it is unlikely that additional consultations will result from designating critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, it is not likely that designation of critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass will have any additional adverse economic impacts on Federal, state or private activities beyond those that would occur as a result of listing the species. As discussed in the section on activities that may impact essential habitat and features, the Federal activities that may affect critical habitat are the same activities that may affect the species itself. For plants, this is particularly true when analyzing the impacts of designating critical habitat. For example, the activities that affect water quality, an essential feature of critical habitat, also will be considered in terms of how they affect the species itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should this proposed designation of critical habitat be adopted, Federal agencies will continue to engage in section 7 consultations to determine if the actions they authorize, fund or carry out are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of Johnson's seagrass; however, with designation, they would also need to address explicitly impacts to the species' critical habitat. This is not expected to affect materially the scope of future consultations or result in greater economic impacts, since the impacts to Johnson's seagrass habitat will already be considered in section 7 consultations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic costs to be considered in a critical habitat designation are the incremental costs of designation above the economic impacts attributable to listing or attributable to authorities other that the ESA. NMFS has determined that there are no incremental net costs for areas within the species' current distribution, and no areas outside the current range are proposed for critical habitat designation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Critical Habitat <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on available information, NMFS proposes to designate critical habitat that is considered essential for the survival and recovery of Johnson's seagrass and that may require special management consideration or protection. The critical habitat designation proposed by this rule includes the largest contiguous areas that are currently utilized by Johnson's seagrass. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Johnson's seagrass is found throughout the Indian River Lagoon, Lake Worth and in some areas of Biscayne Bay, NMFS is not proposing to include these areas in the proposed designation until more information is available and the areas are delineated, and it can be determined that these areas meet the requirements for designation as critical habitat. For the same reason, NMFS is not including in the proposed designation any areas outside the species' currently known geographical area. NMFS has concluded that, at this time, proper management of the essential features of the areas in proximity to the five inlets will be sufficient to provide for the survival and recovery of this species. If the species is listed as proposed, Federal activities in any area occupied by Johnson's seagrass would be subject to the section 7 consultation process whether or not the area has been designated as critical habitat. In addition, NMFS may reconsider this evaluation and propose additional areas for critical habitat at any time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The five areas proposed for critical habitat designation include the intertidal and subtidal areas in proximity to five inlets on the east coast of Florida. These areas are within 3 to 5 kilometers of the inlet and experience regular tidal flushing with salinity greater than 15 ppt. Maps are provided for reference purposes to guide Federal agencies and other interested parties in locating the general boundaries of the proposed critical habitat. They do not constitute the definition of the boundaries of critical habitat. Persons must refer to the regulations at 50 CFR 226.91 for the actual boundaries of the designated critical habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

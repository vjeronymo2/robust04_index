			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television The third of the Young Musician Of The Year Masterclasses is given by horn player Michael Thompson who, at 21, was chosen by Riccardo Muti to play principal horn in the Philharmonia. His three pupils today are playing Haydn, Horovitz and Cherubini on trumpet, euphonium, and French horn (7.30 BBC2). That is followed (8.10) by a Horizon on Alan Turing, described as a brilliant mathematician and a key figure in the breaking of the Nazis' Enigma codes. Prof IJ Good says it is as well that British security was unaware of Turing's homosexuality, otherwise he might have been fired 'and we might have lost the war'. In 1950 Turing wrote the seminal paper 'Computing Machinery And Intelligence', but in 1954 killed himself. The world is still waiting for a machine to pass the 'Turing Test' and be pronounced truly intelligent, but some believe we shall not have to wait much longer. In C4's documentary slot Cutting Edge (9.00) cameras are taken inside Princess Anne's old school, Benenden. Joseph Heller, author of 'Catch 22', presents the first of five nightly programmes called Catch Five, examining favourite Rembrandts (10.55 C4).</p>

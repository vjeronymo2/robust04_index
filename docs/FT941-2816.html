			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Dairy Farm profit up 11% Dairy Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine Matheson group, yesterday reported an 11 per cent rise in net profits to USDollars 197.5m for 1993, up from Dollars 177.8m the year before. Mr Tim Westinghouse, finance director, said earnings were hit by currency fluctuations, especially in Australia and the UK, combined with a competitive retail climate and low inflation in many of the countries in which the group operates. Nonetheless, he said, the results were ahead of market expectations. Earnings per share climbed just 4 per cent to 11.28 cents, following last year's Dollars 202m rights issue of convertible preference shares. Ordinary shareholders will receive a final dividend of 4.1 cents, up from 3.9 cents a year ago.</p>

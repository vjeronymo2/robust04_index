			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (2): Business more confident than for 22 years - Nikki Tait reviews the economy Taken at face-value, the New Zealand economy is going great guns. Growth is reckoned to have reached 4.6 per cent in 1993, one of the fastest rates clocked up by any western economy - and nicely exceeding the 4 per cent registered by Australia, the country's nearest neighbour and largest trading partner. Economic activity in the final quarter of 1993 alone was estimated to have been 5.1 per cent higher than in the same three months a year earlier. Most analysts expect some further progress, perhaps taking the year-on-year growth rate to over 5 per cent later in 1994, and then several years of sustainable growth at around 3.5 per cent. Business confidence, according to the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research, is at its highest since 1972, with a net 64 per cent of companies questioned in the latest April survey expecting an improvement in the general business situation over the next six months. Even unemployment, a more problematic marker, has shown some improvement recently. It remains painfully high at around 9.1 per cent, but has at least fallen fairly sharply from rates of over 11 per cent seen in early-1992. Finally, New Zealand has low inflation locked in for the immediate future by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act, which guarantees the bank's independence from political machinations, and requires it to administer monetary policy to achieve a specified inflation target - currently from zero to 2 per cent. While nobody quibbles about this rosy short-term situation, opinions become more divided when pundits are required to look ahead. On the minus side, there are worries stemming from New Zealand's fluid political situation, and from some niggling economic question-marks. On the plus side, there could be some significant bullish factors influencing the economy in the medium term  -not least, the consequences flowing from the recent conclusion of the Uruguay Round in the Gatt negotiations late last year. Most of the pessimists' anxieties centre on the external accounts. A current account deficit of NZDollars 969m in the final quarter of 1993 took the figure for the calendar year to NZDollars 1.65bn - some NZDollars 22m worse than in 1992. This means that the current account deficit is running at around 2 per cent of gross domestic product, a number which the Reserve Bank, for one, thinks will persist for the next few years. Combined with New Zealand's heavy, lingering net external debt, the lack of speedy improvement on this score causes some concern. Last month, for example, Standard &amp; Poor's decided against an upgrading of New Zealand's 'AA-' foreign currency debt rating. 'Good news on the growth, unemployment and fiscal fronts does not, of itself, constitute a case for re-rating the country,' commented the ratings agency. 'In New Zealand's case, much depends upon progress in improving the country's external accounts beyond the improvement already factored into the current rating. . . New Zealand's current account deficit and external accounts have only slowly improved in recent years. . . Most notably, the country's net external debt is still currently of the order of 175 per cent of exports, only fractionally down from the 180 per cent figure at the time of the last downgrade (January 1990).' A second, and much more speculative worry, is the political one. It is impossible to predict that this stage what kind of government the new electoral system, based on a form of proportional representation, will produce. But if a coalition government with a more 'left-leaning' bent were to come into office, two possible institutional changes could affect New Zealand's inflation record - or, at least, cause financial markets to fear such an impact. The first would be a repeal of - or major amendments to - the 1991 Employment Contracts Act (ECA), NZ's controversial labour market legislation which opened the way for individual employee contracts, overthrowing the previous centralised, award-based system. The second would be any tinkering with the Reserve Bank targets. At present, it should be stressed, these doubts do not appear to weigh heavily in investors' minds. Although there was some temporary upheaval to both share and bond markets and to the NZ dollar after the November election result, the dust settled quickly. And while some analysts scent a slight upturn in inflationary pressures, which could push the inflation rate closer to the upper end of the 0-2 per cent range, New Zealand's 10-year bond rates are well below those of Australia and roughly in line with those of the US. Moreover, Mr Donald Brash, the Reserve Bank governor is quick to stress that the Labour party's suggested amendment to the inflation target - from zero to two, to minus one to three - could have a limited effect. 'That quite explicitly leaves the median unchanged, so it isn't obvious that one would run monetary policy very differently,' he comments. 'If the median of the target remains at one, which our best understanding of what price stability is, allowing for biases in the (consumer prices) index, then the debate about whether its 1 per cent either side of 1, or 2 per cent, is to some extent a debate about what excuses are allowed for in the contract.' By this, he means external price shocks - a hike in energy prices, say  - or a temporary domestically-induced increase through a rise in indirect taxes, for example. As Mr Brash points out, 'It's a pretty technical argument.' But whether the markets would interpret any widening of the target range in such a kindly light, remains to be seen. Again, with the ECA, it is hard to anticipate the impact of any changes, without seeing details of the alterations proposed. Groups like the New Zealand Employers' Federation remained firmly opposed to any tinkering with the act, warning of the impact on business confidence. Privately, however, some executives suggest that modest - and probably largely cosmetic - changes now might be acceptable, if this ensured the act's long-term survival. In contrast to these minus points, there are a couple of potential factors which could play in New Zealand's favour. For a start, there is the apparent strength of the Australian economy - which grew at around 4 per cent in 1993 and is tipped to go higher still. Despite the two countries' traditional rivalry and common desire to develop links with Asia, Australia is still New Zealand's biggest trading partner, accounting for about one-fifth of exports. If Australian consumer spending continues to rebound, and government forecasts of a strong revival in business investment are correct, New Zealand manufacturers stand to benefit. Finally, the impact of the Gatt talks should not be overlooked. Economists at ANZ Bank in Wellington, for example, have noted that the settlement should underpin agricultural commodity prices over the coming year, and improve market access. While they warn that no simplistic conclusions should be drawn from the GATT deal, and note that much depends on how the details of the agreement pan out, they also point out that almost two-thirds of New Zealand's exports are still agriculture-based. 'Consequently, New Zealand stands to benefit substantially from the successful Gatt outcome,' they conclude. 'It is suggested that the gains for New Zealand could include increases averaging 17 per cent in the prices our exporters receive for meat and dairy products. Optimistic estimates hint at gains for New Zealand totalling NZDollars 1.5bn a year in additional export revenues'.</p>

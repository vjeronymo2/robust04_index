			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Trading in cash government bonds is expected to remain subdued this week due to expectations of higher short-term interest rates. However, the bond futures market is likely to see a continued increase in activity as dealers and investors buy back the December contract ahead of an expected change-over in futures contracts at the end of the week. A further rise in futures prices could support the cash market. However, increasing funding needs at banks due to the high level of maturing certificate of deposits may put upward pressure on short-term interest rates, which are already gradually rising, and weigh on the bond market. Some Y10,000bn of three-month CDs are expected to mature as commercial banks are choosing other methods of capital raising to avoid a rise in three-month CD rates, which are the basis for short-term prime rates, or lending rates for first-tier customers. The banks do not want to have to raise short-term prime rates when demand for funds among corporations is already low. Most banks have been refraining from issuing CDs since August, resorting to short-term money markets for funds. At the end of October, outstanding CDs totalled Y14,980bn, of which 70 per cent are expected to mature this month.</p>

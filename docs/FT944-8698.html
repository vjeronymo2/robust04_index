			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: National Power drops to Pounds 211m after exceptional National Power, the electricity generator, reported pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 down from Pounds 256m to Pounds 211m. However, this included a Pounds 30m exceptional write-off, representing the premium paid from the redemption of a Pounds 350m debt issue. The 1993 figure was also boosted by a Pounds 45m write-back of provisions. Before exceptional items profits rose by 14 per cent, from Pounds 211m to Pounds 241m, on a 7 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 1.67bn (Pounds 1.56bn). The company said that continued reductions in staff and maintenance costs were responsible for the growth despite a continuing decline in market share. Increasing competition from the independent power companies and Nuclear Electric led to a fall in market share from 35 per cent in the year to March 1994, to 32 per cent in the half year. The dividend is increased by 16 per cent to 4.35p (3.75p), disappointing some analysts who had seen PowerGen increase its dividend by 27 per cent, on a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. Earnings per share amounted to 12p (16.1p). Increasing revenues came from direct sales to large consumers, which more than doubled to Pounds 276m. Sales to the regional electricity companies, via the pool, showed a marginal decline. The company continued its cut-back programme, reducing staff by 22 per cent to 5,667 during the past year, and staff costs fell from Pounds 109m to Pounds 93m. Mr John Baker, chief executive, expects the head count to fall to 5,200 by next March. Maintenance costs should also continue to decline, from the switch towards more modern and efficient power stations. National Power benefited from a further running down of its coal stocks, towards a year-end figure of less than 5m tonnes, compared with the current 9m tonnes. However, there was a 37 per cent increase in depreciation charges to Pounds 132m, following the commissioning of a new gas power station and de-sulpherisation plant. Mr Baker reckoned National Power could halve its rail costs for transporting coal, currently amounting to about Pounds 130m a year. It has invested in its own locomotive, and has started discussions with Railtrack. The international operations, in the US and Portugal, contributed Pounds 4m profit, with Portugal making a maiden contribution.</p>

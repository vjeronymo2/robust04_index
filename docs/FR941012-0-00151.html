			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is adding this new provision to the final rule in large part because it is allowing prior training to be accepted in place of a new round of training. OSHA recognizes, given the transient nature of the workforce in this industry, that in many cases an employer will be unable to identify the date on which previous training was provided by another employer. In those cases, OSHA believes that knowing the date of the prior training is not as important as the employer's determination as to whether the prior training is adequate. As such, OSHA is requiring employers to certify on what date they determine the prior training to be adequate. In the final rule OSHA has included a measurable way to determine when and whether prior training had been adequate. The final rule requires that each new employee work under close supervision of a designated person until the employee demonstrates the ability to safely perform the job independently. In most cases, therefore, this demonstration date will constitute the certification date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i)(10)(ii) of the final rule requires that the most recent training certification be maintained. This provision has been included to limit the number of records that the employer is required to maintain on training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i)(11) of the final rule requires that the employer hold safety and health meetings as necessary and at least each month for each employee. This provision allows safety and health meetings to be conducted individually, in crew meetings, in larger groups, or as part of other staff meetings. The proposed rule did not contain a safety and health meeting requirement. Many State logging standards also require regular safety and health meetings in the logging industry (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 36, 38K). For example, the State of Washington logging standard requires safety meetings to be held monthly and whenever work is started at a new work site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters supported the need for regular and ongoing safety and health meetings for both inexperienced and experienced workers (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28; Tr. W1 93&hyph;95, 163, OR 92, 110, 137, 197, 204, 276, 335, 374, 643&hyph;44, 691&hyph;92). Several of these commenters indicated that many establishments in the industry already hold safety and health meetings on a regular basis. Several commenters said safety and health meetings were an effective way of informing employees about hazards and keeping their safety awareness high (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28; Tr. W1 93&hyph;95, 163, 189&hyph;90, OR 92, 110, 137, 204, 276, 374, 643&hyph;44). One commenter said that documented monthly safety and health meetings were necessary on all logging operations ``to instill the necessary safe work attitude in all logging employees'' (Ex. 5&hyph;28). Commenters also said safety and health meetings were good for providing targeted information (Tr. W1 94, 164, 189, OR 110, 204&hyph;05, 373, 643). For example, they said safety and health meetings were a way of informing employees about recent accidents and about lapses in safe work practices, and to alert employees about conditions and hazards peculiar to the job to be performed or the site to be logged that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also said that safety and health meetings were necessary for both inexperienced and experienced loggers (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;45; Tr. OR 335). One of these commenters said:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We don't feel that just new employees or green men ought to be sitting in safety and health meetings. Repetition increases retention, and everyone can benefit if they've heard it a hundred times. Maybe they forgot it 99 [times] and it might save their life or their buddy's life the next day (Tr. OR 335).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA agrees with these commenters that safety and health meetings are necessary to reinforce proper work practices and to alert employees to particular hazards which are present in the workplace. OSHA believes that regular safety and health meetings will provide adequate retraining for employees in the logging industry, and that these meetings are necessary in lieu of requiring annual retraining of experienced workers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

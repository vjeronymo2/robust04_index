			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by the signatories of the Stability, </F> Competitiveness, and Employment Pact, PECE, including Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari; Labor Secretary Arsenio  Farell; Fidel Valasquez, president of the Confederation of  Mexican Workers; and Hugo Andres Araujo, secretary general of  the National Peasant Confederation, following a meeting at Los  Pinos Presidential Palace in Mexico City on 24 March -- live or  recorded]    [Text] [Farrell] Mr. President: In view of the deplorable  violence that took place yesterday in Tijuana, Baja California  State and which led to the unfortunate death of Luis Donaldo  Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate for the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI], the signatories of the Stability,  Competitiveness, and Employment Pact [PECE], in keeping with the  sincere dismay of the Mexican people and in view of the need to  redouble the efforts of all sectors to overcome this unhappy  moment the nation is experiencing, have decided to reinforce the  agreements currently in effect.    Whereas:    1. All Mexicans, above any legitimate aspiration and  objective of each sector, give priority to social peace and are  unwilling to allow it to be altered. We have much to do for the  Mexico we want for ourselves and for our children within the  pluralism and mutual respect that has always prevailed in this  forum for concerted effort. The signatories of the PECE will  forcefully defend the results we have achieved as peasants,  workers, businessmen, and government representatives. With the  strength of unity, we are going to redouble our efforts to  achieve the goals we have set for ourselves.    2. The unity within the framework of the law in a climate of  harmony and full respect for the freedoms established by our  country's political Constitution is a fundamental and  indispensable element for moving toward the consolidation of our  economy, the strengthening of our national sovereignty, and the  improvement of the quality of life of all Mexicans.    3. One of the most important achievements of these  agreements is the Mexican people's increased confidence in the  future of the nation's economy. Thanks to this increased level  of confidence, the difficulties that inevitably arise from time  to time and that could affect our economic activity have been  overcome without any major disruption of the country's economy.  Yesterday's tragic events, therefore, did not trigger any  crises in Mexican financial instruments today. On the contrary,  the exchange rate at banks and currency exchanges abroad, as  well as at unregulated currency exchange agencies operating in  the country, showed considerable stability throughout the day.  Such was the case for stocks, bonds, and other instruments  issued by Mexican agencies and offered on many markets abroad,  especially in New York.    4. Mexico's economic policies over the last few years, of  which this pact is an essential element, have warranted not only  the confidence of the domestic public and praise from  international financial market players, but they have also  elicited support from international organizations and the  authorities of friendly nations. One outstanding example of this  is that the U.S. Government has stated today that it is willing  to allow U.S. financial authorities to assist our country's  economic leaders in controlling currency exchange markets. To  this end, they have offered a substantial increase in reciprocal  lines of credit from $1 billion to $6 billion. The U.S.  Government has kept these lines in effect for many years to  promote the good performance of currency markets in each country.    5. The consolidation of the means of production, economic  stability, and the promotion of competitiveness and job creation  continue to be the main purpose of the sectors that signed this  agreement. In light of this, the labor, peasant and business  organizations -- which represent the overwhelming majority of  the country's productive force -- and the Federal Government  have agreed:    1. To uphold all commitments signed on 3 October 1993 as  ratified on 12 January 1994 and ensure full compliance with each  and every agreement therein.    2. To express our strongest condemnation of violence and  attempts to destabilize the institutions we have managed to  build over several generations, thanks to the efforts of all  Mexicans.    This agreement is signed at Los Pinos Presidential Residence  on 24 March 1994 in the presence of the president of the United  States of Mexico. Thank you.    [Valasquez] The labor movement, which the Labor Congress  represents, has approved without further discussion the  statements made by Arsenio Farell, labor and social welfare  secretary. We [words indistinct] needed to ratify this pact  because it guarantees us social peace among productive sectors.  We also agree with the [word indistinct] condemnation made by  the [word indistinct] assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio  Murrieta, our presidential candidate and the presidential  candidate of the PRI.    At times like these, it is impossible to say much, but we  must condemn this crime and ask the government to work from now  on against those who use violence as a method to solve their  problems with other sectors. In cases like this, the labor  movement wants no more tolerance for these criminals. They must  be treated as they deserve to be treated: harshly. We must  condemn their actions, and they must be punished as the law  stipulates. Thank you.    [Luis German Carcova Garcia, president of the Business  Coordinating Council] Mr. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,  Mr. Fidel Valasquez Sanchez, Labor Congress president [as  heard]; Deputy Hugo Andres Araujo, secretary general of the  National Peasant Confederation; Messrs. Secretaries of State;  Ladies and Gentlemen: The national business sector is deeply  concerned and firmly condemns the tragic event of 23 March,  which ended the life of a brilliant Mexican who was committed to  his country. This event also symbolizes an attack against  Mexico and its institutions. Violence, in all its forms, is  always objectionable and will never be the path to solve  problems and to meet the legitimate demands of the Mexican  people. The breach of peace and social order, which are  necessary conditions for guaranteeing the welfare of our people,  is unacceptable under any circumstances.    Throughout the last few years, Mexicans have proven that  through dialogue and consensus, we can overcome problems and  difficult situations by reconciling different opinions and by  always seeking the welfare of the nation as a whole. We have  added and multiplied [as heard]. We cannot let events such as  this, which has submerged Mexico in mourning, divide and  diminish us. We Mexicans are committed to a plan that, with the  strong leadership of President Salinas, has helped us overcome  the deep macroeconomic imbalances that darkened our future. By  overcoming them, we have been placed at the threshold of healthy  and sustainable growth that will reverberate in a higher  standard of living for all our compatriots.    We must not change the original plan. Our goal is very  close. The latest events seem to indicate that there are forces  interested in steering away from the course and making us turn  back. This goes against all Mexicans. We will not be defeated.  We Mexicans, united within the framework of consensus, will  always be able to find answers peacefully and objectively, as we  have in the last few years. The path we have traveled is  already longer that the one we have yet to climb. We reiterate  that together we will be able to move on.    We Mexican businessmen reiterate our commitment to the  country, our belief that we chose the right path, and our  commitment to work harmoniously with all sectors of society. We  express our full support for the government and institutions  headed by President Salinas. We emphatically reject the path of  violence, the breach of peace, and lawlessness. We demand  justice and strict law enforcement. Society demands it. The  future of Mexico and of our children lies in the institutions,  laws, unity, and intense and productive efforts of all Mexicans.  Each of us, especially we businessmen, must be clear about what  we are doing for Mexico. We must assume our responsibilities  tactfully. Let us behave with perseverance and affection for  our country. Let us defend those accomplishments that cost us  so much work with the law on our side and with unity,  equanimity, determination, energy, and intelligence. Thank you.    [Araujo] Mr. President: The country is going through a  difficult time. The unfortunate incidents that occurred  yesterday in Tijuana, where our friend and companion Luis  Donaldo Colosio Murrieta was slain, attempt to sow discord and  disunity among Mexicans. Our response must serve to strengthen  the institutions of the country, to unite the productive  sectors, as has been manifested here, and to reject provocation  and violence. To ratify the pact is also a manifestation of  agreement among producers, workers, businessmen, and the  government. It clearly establishes before the country that the  key sectors of our economy are disposed to persevering in our  work to build a strong, growing economy, more equitably  distributed and capable of facing the international market.    The diverse interests that are permanently expressed in this  body are part of the intense reality that exists in our country.  Through a concerted effort, we have shown that it is possible  to harmonize different viewpoints so long as the general  interest prevails over private interests. We see that calm and  reason prevail in the face of difficulties. Let us maintain  this trend. Let us strengthen calm and reason to prevent  situations that hurt everyone but which have more of an impact  on those with lower incomes because of their diminished capacity  to fight in the face of crisis and instability.    As producers of the countryside -- cattlemen, rural property  owners, farm owners -- let us assume fully the continuation of  the pact, Mr. President. Our expectation is to build a more  productive, profitable sector in keeping with national  priorities. We flatly reject violence and its consequences of  instability. We are not disposed to leaving to the forces of  instability the future of our economy and, within it, of the  Mexican countryside. In this overall concerted effort formula,  the diverse sectors that come together in the course of our  activities in the Mexican countryside reiterate our commitment  to continue the necessary efforts to strengthen our relations  and our productive association and to defend the rural sector in  a climate of tolerance and mutual respect.    Mr. President, you have the total support of the country's  agricultural and livestock sector, as well as of the rest of the  members of this vast table of concerted action, without  distinction. Today we understand that strengthening the  instruments of economic concerted effort is indispensable, as is  closing ranks around you. Your policy of national modernization,  your proposal of democratic advancement, and your commitment to  the poor people of Mexico demonstrates this. Let no one be  deceived. We maintain a great capability to move forward as a  nation within a framework of differences but with unity on  fundamental aspects. Thank you very much.    [Salinas] Ladies and gentlemen: In view of the unacceptable  violent act that led to the sad and outrageous death of Luis  Donaldo Colosio, the representatives of laborers, peasants,  businessmen, and the government are here today to ratify the  main terms of the pact.    This reflects our full commitment to implement its terms on  time and shows serenity, a vision of the future, and unity of  the nation. This unity is based on giving priority to those  things we value most: sovereignty, liberty, democracy, and  justice in an atmosphere of legality and harmony.    When developments that are incompatible with our values and  goals occur in the nation's life, Mexicans unite, strengthen the  ties that bring us closer, and reject with a single voice any  attempt to make us lose direction and divert our efforts and any  idea that violence can discourage Mexico. Unity is the most  powerful of our virtues, and legality represents the full  validity of our Constitution, our single guiding principle for  social life.    Today, you are ratifying the 3 October commitments to reduce  inflation, to improve productivity and salaries, and to clearly  speak out against violence in favor of law and national unity.  The dedicated work of Mexicans is recognized abroad today.  This work has allowed us to face the unexpected circumstances  of life at home and abroad. This recognition is reflected in  the support mentioned today in the financial area.    Also, and this is important, today Mexico joined one of the  world's most important economic organizations, the OECD.  Through it, our country will have a much greater presence in  industrialized countries, especially in Europe. [applause]  [five-second break in reception] that we will defend the efforts  made and the opportunities created [three-second break in  reception] legality that we will not allow impunity to take away  our serenity. We must continue to advance.    Ladies and gentlemen, we will enforce the country's  Constitution and law because that is the civil thing to do. We  will comply with peace agreements, because peace and harmony are  our strongest convictions. We will honor the pact because it is  an instrument of our solidarity to progress with more justice.    We will remain true to ourselves despite the painful  circumstances, because that is what is demanded by the justified  indignation of Mexicans in the face of insults. Unity,  consensus, and unrestricted respect for the law have helped us  advance and achieve all our goals. Unity will continue to  guarantee us a better future. That is why we must maintain and  reaffirm our pride as Mexicans. Thank you very much.</p>

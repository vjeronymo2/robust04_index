			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Birmingham set to levy lower tax Birmingham's Labour-controlled city council yesterday proposed a cut in the council tax for 1994-95. The cut, of Pounds 17 to Pounds 421 a year in the lowest property valuation band and of Pounds 50 to Pounds 1,264 a year in the highest band, comes despite an unsuccessful attempt by the council to win extra government funding. Its 1994-95 budget is provisionally set at Pounds 938.86m compared with the 1992-93 budget of Pounds 901.47m.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: British Steel in east Asian expansion British Steel is continuing its expansion in east Asia, destined to be the main growth market for steel over the next decade, through the signing of a joint venture to establish a steel roll forming facility in Kuala Lumpur. European Profiles, a British Steel subsidiary, is linking with Zelleco Holdings, a large Malaysian construction company. It brings the number of operations in British Steel's Asia-Pacific network to 12. It recently opened an office in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and exports to the region are continuing to grow. European Profiles, based near Swansea, is one of two profiling companies bought by British Steel from RTZ earlier this year. It has been exporting profiled steel cladding to the east Asia for 12 years. The new company, to be called European Profiles (Malaysia), will use steel from South Wales as its raw material. Profiled steel cladding is used in the construction of power stations, and the new company's first order will be to supply 85,000 sq m of cladding to a power station project in Surabaya, Indon-esia. Financial details of the joint venture were not disclosed. It comes less than a week after British Steel announced a restructuring of its profiling operations in the UK in response to overcapacity problems. A profiling plant at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, will close with the loss of 56 jobs, and production will be concentrated at the two former RTZ plants.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--Minister of Finance Sami Qammuh on Saturday  [30 April] credited the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)  with enhancing the symbolism of Palestinian authority through  the signing of the PLO-Israeli economic agreement without  negating the economic accord that the Palestinians signed with  Jordan in January.    Mr. Qammuh, in an interview with the JORDAN TIMES , said the  government's initial reading of the Paris agreement "shows that  the PLO has gained more than anticipated...it is a step  achieved."    The documents, of which only excerpts were made available to  the press, is reportedly 15 pages long and deal with the  different aspects of the Palestinian economy in detail.    "There are new areas and new grounds for Palestinian  authority in the agreement," Mr. Qammuh said in reference to the  accord, which was signed by Israeli Finance Minister Avraham  Shohat and PLO negotiator Ahmad Quray' in a ceremony attended by  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe at his ministry's  headquarters in Paris.    Mr. Qammuh pointed especially to the Palestinians gaining  independent economic decisions over taxation, banks and  currency, stamps and customs.    He said the economic pact does not negate an economic  agreement between Jordan and the PLO which was signed here in  January. "The PLO-Israeli agreement is not in contradiction  with the Jordan-PLO agreement," he said.    He said Jordan views positively any improvement which  promotes the independent economic decision of the Palestinians.    But the minister's positive reaction was not shared by  economists and other officials who said that the agreement  amounted to the PLO sanctioning the holding of the Palestinian  economy "hostage to the Israeli economy."    The points which were positively received by Mr. Qammuh  appeared to be the same as those that the critics picked up on  to indicate a new Palestinian tilt away from Jordan and towards  Israel.    Critics of the agreement said its different articles were  geared to the benefit of the Israeli economy creating an  "economic integration between the Palestinian entity and Israel"  and treating Jordan like any other Arab country dealing with the  new Palestinian entity.    Conceding that the agreement holds symbols of authority for  the emerging Palestinian entity, the critics maintain that while  the Israelis "are spend thrift with symbolism, they are stingy  when it comes to the actual implementation."    "There is not a single positive element in this agreement,"  one economist contended.    The agreement, he argued, has singled out the Israeli shekel  as the legal tender in the areas under Palestinian authority and  "has dumped the Jordanian dinar with other currencies."    According to the agreement, pending final arrangements, the  Israeli shekel "will continue to constitute a legal means for  payment in the autonomy's areas side by side with other  currencies."    Banks which were initially expected to come under the  authority of the Central Bank of Jordan "are now going to be run  by the Palestinian monetary authority which is still under an  Israeli authority," the economist said.    Where Jordan hoped to have an advantage, trade between the  East and West Bank, Israel and the PLO had agreed to free  movement of goods at what appears to be the same prices as those  offered in Israel while placing Jordan in a situation where its  exports to the territories will be taxed.    "Jordan will be dealt with as if it is exporting to Israel,"  another economist said.    A senior official defending the agreement said that the  critics were looking at the agreement only from one angle and  forgetting that this agreement is between Israel and the PLO and  that that is "only one front" of the over all picture.    "It is not a zero sum theory," said the official, who asked  for anonymity. "Any improvement on the living and work  conditions of Palestinians is good for us," the official said.    He said that the opening up of trade between Jordan and the  Palestinian entity, at any level, is an improvement on the  current situation where "there is almost no trade."    He said that the agreement provides for a favoured trade  status for Jordan and Egypt ahead of other Islamic and Arab  countries.    "What is happening is that a new market is opening up across  the border," the official said. "Instead of being fearful and  criticising the situation from afar we should be ready to take  advantage of the situation."    "There can be no progress or success when we are crippled by  fear," the senior official said.    Under the Jordan-PLO agreement, the senior official said, it  was expected that the Jordanian dinar was not going to be the  main currency in the occupied territories and that the Central  Bank of Jordan was only going to supervise the banks "until the  time the Palestinians were able to establish their own monetary  authority."    "The agreement never said that Jordan will take over the  monetary affairs of the Palestinian entity... It is still going  to take some time before the Palestinans establish a monetary  authority and the Jordan-PLO agreement stands until that time,"  he added.    Critics, the official said, have to understand that "we in  Jordan want them (the PLO) to have authority and to supervise  their own affairs."</p>

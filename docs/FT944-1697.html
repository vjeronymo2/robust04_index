			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Saatchi isn't working Shareholders in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi have not merely deposed an advertising icon; they have introduced a striking new dimension to corporate governance in the UK. It is common in the US, but rare in Britain, for minority shareholders to band together in pursuit of limited but specific changes - as they did in this case to seek the scrapping of Mr Maurice Saatchi's options package. But such moves are a less clumsy mechanism for effecting change or correcting poor performance than hostile takeovers. All too often UK institutional shareholders berate management performance in private, while doing and saying nothing in public. Fund managers' generally lily-livered stance on executive pay - PosTel excepted - is but one example, creating the suspicion that institutions will go out of their way not to offend the directors who dole out lucrative asset management contracts. Mr Saatchi's departure, the by-product but not the objective of the shareholder pressure, should not be regretted if the group ends up being better managed. The risk remains, of course, that, by removing a personality who not only gave the business its name but also commanded fierce personal loyalty from some big clients, Harris Associates, M &amp; G and their allies have seriously wounded the company they were trying to improve. An advertising agency is a more fragile organism than some underperforming industrial conglomerate. Nevertheless, it is also arguable that the more austere advertising market of the 1990s needs unglamorous professional management more than a cult of personality.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Australian ICI sheds 200 jobs ICI Australia, a subsidiary of the UK chemicals group, yesterday blamed reduced tariff protection for the closure of part of an industrial site in Sydney, with the loss of 200 jobs. The company said the closure had been forced because of reduced domestic demand, 'dumping' of imported chemicals by overseas competitors, low international prices and higher government charges. It said six of the eight plants at the site would cease production over the next few months. Products from overseas plants will be imported to meet orders. ICI's action follows earlier warnings that parts of its Australian manufacturing operations were at risk from tariff reduction, which is being pursued by the federal Labor government under its policy to open the economy to international markets. The announcement was criticised by the Construction Forestry and Mining Employees Union.</p>

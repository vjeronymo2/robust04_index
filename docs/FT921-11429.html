			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Algeria's new rulers take the offensive BULLDOZERS and builders are to move into Algeria's teeming slums in an offensive against misery and Islamic fundamentalism, Reuter reports from Algiers. Algeria's new rulers announced a crash programme aimed both at pushing aside the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), their main opponents, and attracting support from ordinary Algerians. The interior minister, Mr Larbi Belkheir, unveiled the programme on Wednesday evening after an emergency meeting of officials from all 48 provinces. 'The absence of the state in the last three years brought a situation of anarchy essentially due to negligence . . . towards the worries of some citizens and the application of the laws,' the Algerian news agency quoted him as saying. The FIS, denied victory at the polls by the halting of Algeria's general election this month, has built up a strong following among the poor - particularly the young. This week it appealed for money to help the homeless. The authorities promptly ruled the move illegal.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Japanese airlines to scrap limit on liability for victims JAPAN'S airlines are set to become the first in the world to remove the ceiling on compensation paid to victims of international air disasters. In a move which could transform international agreements on airline liability for the death and injury of passengers, 10 Japanese airlines - led by Japan Air Lines - will tomorrow abandon the ceiling of about Dollars 140,000 (Pounds 90,000) adopted under the 1929 Warsaw Convention. The scheme should reduce the delay in obtaining compensation for victims of air disasters by cutting out the need to litigate in most cases. Victims and their families will be able to negotiate settlements directly with airlines which will take responsibility for recovering money from aircraft and engine manufacturers where appropriate. The initiative follows 21 years of failed industry attempts to raise compensation limits under the convention and the 1966 Montreal Agreement, which sets a limit of Dollars 75,000 per passenger for flights to and from the US. Warsaw Convention limits which range from Dollars 10,000 to nearly Dollars 140,000 are widely regarded as too low and an embarrassment to most airlines and their insurers in the event of a crash. JAL was also under pressure to break the international compensation ceilings following average settlements believed to be in the region of Dollars 850,000 per passenger paid to victims of the 1985 JAL Boeing 747 crash. Jap-an lifted the compensation ceiling on domestic flights in 1982. Mr Peter Martin, an aviation lawyer with London solicitors Frere Cholmeley, which pioneered the special revised conditions of carriage for JAL, predicted yesterday that all major airlines would be forced to follow suit. Once the JAL scheme became widely known, resentment among travellers not receiving the same compensation terms as passengers on Japanese airlines could build up, he said. British Airways is believed to be working on a similar scheme under which the airline would waive limits on liability if the passenger or his family could prove airline negligence by the airline in the English courts which would entitle him to English levels of damages. Aviation experts say the BA scheme is flawed and unattractive to US passengers, the biggest sector of the market. In situations such as the Pan Am Lock-erbie crash, they would rather sue aircraft manufacturers and engine makers in the US where damages awards are higher. Mr Mervyn Walker, BA's general counsel, denied yesterday that the airline had firm plans to follow JAL's lead. 'I'm sure others will follow suit, but we were reviewing our position before JAL announced its move and we will continue to do so. It may result in a change in our position and it may not,' he said. The biggest question surrounding the Japanese move, however, is the effect on insurance premiums. JAL approached the world insurance market with its proposal and was well received. Japanese airlines concede that they were able to bring in unlimited liability at an acceptable cost because most of their carriage is domestic. The cost of additional cover for international flights was not significant. Decision born of embarrassment, Page 5</p>

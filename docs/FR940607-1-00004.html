A request to reopen or reconsider any case in which a decision has been made by the Board, which request is made by the Commissioner or any other duly authorized officer of the Service, or by the party affected by the decision, must be in the form of a written motion to the Board. The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion of the Board, subject to the restrictions of this section. The Board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> prima facie <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  case for relief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Motion to reconsider.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A motion to reconsider a decision must be filed within 20 days after the mailing of the decision or the stating of the oral decision for which reconsideration is being sought, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. When service of the decision is made by mail, 3 days shall be added to the period prescribed for filing of the motion. A party may file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion and shall be supported by pertinent authority. A motion to reconsider a decision rendered by an Immigration Judge or Service Officer that is pending when an appeal is filed with the Board, or that is filed subsequent to the filing with the Board of an appeal from the decision sought to be reconsidered, shall be deemed a motion to remand the decision for further proceedings before the Immigration Judge or the Service Officer from whose decision the appeal was taken. Such motion, which shall be consolidated with and considered by the Board in connection with any appeal to the Board, is subject to the time and numerical limitations of this paragraph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Motion to reopen.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. A motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation. A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing; nor shall any motion to reopen for the purpose of affording the alien an opportunity to apply for any form of discretionary relief be granted if it appears that the alien's right to apply for such relief was fully explained to him or her and an opportunity to apply therefor was afforded at the former hearing, unless the relief is sought on the basis of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the hearing. Subject to the other requirements and restrictions of this section, a motion to reopen proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an application for relief under section 212(c) of the Act may be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final order of deportation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3), a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings and that motion must be filed not later than 20 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (c)(2) shall not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Filed pursuant to the provisions of &sect;3.23(b)(5) of this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) To apply or reapply for asylum, or withholding of deportation, based on changed circumstances arising subsequent to the commencement of proceedings in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Agreed upon by all parties and jointly filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A motion to reopen a decision rendered by an Immigration Judge or Service Officer that is pending when an appeal is filed, or that is filed subsequent to the filing of an appeal to the Board from the proceedings sought to be reopened, shall be deemed a motion to remand for further proceedings before the Immigration Judge or the Service Officer from whose decision the appeal was taken. Such motion, which shall be consolidated with, and considered by the Board in connection with, the appeal to the Board, is subject to the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) and the time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (c)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Departure or deportation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of deportation or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States. Any departure from the United States, including the deportation of a person who is the subject of deportation or exclusion proceedings, occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Judicial proceedings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Motions to reopen or reconsider shall state whether the validity of the deportation order has been or is the subject of any judicial proceeding and, if so, the nature and date thereof, the court in which such proceeding took place or is pending, and its result or status. In any case in which a deportation order is in effect, any motion to reopen or reconsider such order shall include a statement by or on behalf of the moving party declaring whether the subject of the deportation order is also the subject of any pending criminal proceeding under section 242(e) of the Act, and, if so, the current status of that proceeding. If a motion to reopen or reconsider seeks discretionary relief, the motion shall include a statement by or on behalf of the moving party declaring whether the alien for whose relief the motion is being filed is subject to any pending criminal prosecution and, if so, the nature and current status of that prosecution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Stay of deportation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except where a motion is filed pursuant to the provisions of &sect;3.23(b)(5) of this part, the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not stay the execution of any decision made in the case. Execution of such decision shall proceed unless a stay of execution is specifically granted by the Board, the Immigration Judge, or an authorized officer of the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

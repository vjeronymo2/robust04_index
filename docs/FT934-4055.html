			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: British Coal The bill to privatise British Coal is complex, but no more so than the job in hand. By the time the over-arching legislation has been passed and the detailed business propositions for the five regions written, the snows will have melted. It will be next summer before the tenders can be invited. Those thinking of buying mines will thus have little more than three years of firm coal contracts left by the nearest feasible handover date. That makes bids from management buy-outs difficult to mount, since they will only have reliable cash flow for a short period. The relative inexperience of many British Coal managers in running commercial enterprises may also deter banks from lending to MBOs. A shortage of bidders at high prices may force the government to lower its sights over the amount it can hope to raise from the sale. Since there is a price for everything, there must also be a level at which international coalmining groups would overcome their qualms and bid. That may, however, be closer to Pounds 300m for the total industry rather than the Pounds 800m or so which has been touted. At the lower figure companies could hope to have written the mines down and earned an acceptable return on capital before 1998. After that any mine owner faces the unenviable prospect of negotiating new contracts with generators which own deep water ports. They showed just how tough they could be when they saw off the government last spring.</p>

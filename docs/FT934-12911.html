			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Rowland attacks Bock over Lonrho changes MR Roland 'Tiny' Rowland, who has effectively run Lonrho for more than 30 years yesterday warned Mr Dieter Bock, his joint chief executive, they were on the verge of a fight that could tear the company apart. Mr Rowland, alternately poured scorn and vitriol on Mr Bock while insisting he wanted to avoid conflict. Mr Bock wants to turn the secretive international conglomerate into a more conventional company, initially by bringing in the first non-executive directors for two decades. Mr Bock, who owns 18.8 per cent of Lonrho, believes its 16 man board should be slimmed down, which would probably start with the removal of executive directors of pensionable age. These include Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert Dunlop, supporters of Mr Rowland. Mr Rowland said: 'If Mr Bock says the pensionable directors have to go, my answer to that would be 'over my dead body' . . . I would say to him 'you must be stark staring mad'.' The 75 year-old entrepreneur said the removal of some of the oldest directors would give Mr Bock unfettered control of the group. Mr Rowland said: 'If he got rid of four or five people, Mr Bock would sell everything for cash; there would be nothing left. He would get rid of everyone, including the tea ladies.' He compared relations with Mr Bock to his long-running feud with the Fayeds over the 1985 takeover of the House of Fraser. After Friday's sudden end to the eight-year legal battle between Lonrho and the Fayeds, Mr Rowland said he would also like to put his disagreements with Mr Bock behind him. 'I do not want it tearing Lonrho apart.' He said he had not tried to find another investor to buy the German financier's 18.8 per cent shareholding. But he said good relations between the two men depended on Mr Bock accepting the status quo on the board. An adviser to Mr Bock said: 'There are no immediate plans to change the board. The main objective was to get non-executive directors appointed and that has been achieved.' Mr Bock is understood to be delighted that the feud with the Fayeds has been ended. 'Now that the legal action has been terminated Lonrho can concentrate all its resources on continuing to improve its businesses' said Mr Bock's adviser. Mr Bock has taken heart from the shareholder research by Lonrho's stockbrokers, James Capel, showing that he and institutional shareholders command more than 60 per cent of the stock. Mr Rowland cast doubt on his colleague's ability to run Lonrho's businesses. He said: 'Mr Bock has sold assets in which we were in the process of selling. It was all agreed before he arrived.' The only deal he has done is with Peter Palumbo (over redeveloping the Mansion House site) and that was not with us.' Lex, Page 20 In ring with Bock, Page 21</p>

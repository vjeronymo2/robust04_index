			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Letter: Analysis without sentimentality in the coal mining debate Sir, In the great energy debate the FT will wish to make the case that sound economics must not be swamped by latter-day sentimentality about British coal mining. Neither is it easy to determine the truth in the swirl of rival prices and costs. But the 'Grimy face of coal' (December 29) does not help FT readers to a sound analysis of the environmental issues in the energy debate. It is remarkably misleading. For example: The issue is not about increasing coal burn, but the size of the reduction. The 'additional' tonnages now being mooted will not affect the environmental issues one way or another. Coal-fired power stations contribute about 8 per cent of the world's greenhouse gases. CO emissions by UK power stations are falling; It is CO emissions from transport that are rising. The UK did not obtain lenient targets under the EC large combustion plant directive by promising to burn more gas in power stations. Gas burn for power stations was not even considered. The targets were lenient because the electricity industry argued that it needed time because it had fitted flue-gas de-sulphurisation (FGD) and British power stations were very large. FGD reduces sulphur and nitrous oxides to very low levels. Twelve gw of FGD were agreed to enable the 80m tonnes of coal then being burnt at UK power stations to comply with the directive. This was reduced to 8gw to make the sale of the generators easier but now only 6gw are being built. Germany has 50gw installed at its privately-owned power stations. One year of the British nuclear levy would fund 10gw of FGD and the power would still be cheaper than nuclear. Nevertheless, sulphur and nitrous oxide emissions from British power stations are falling and will continue to fall. It is again transport that is causing nitrous oxide emissions to rise and this is responsible for the reports of 'poor air quality'. Any government initiative that can now be detected is likely to make open-cast emissions more difficult to get, not less. The article is redeemed by its last sentence. Coal burnt in combined cycle would reduce sulphur and nitrous oxide to minimal levels and CO by at least 20 per cent and produce cheap power. Any grime there is can be cleaned from the face of coal if today's technology is fully utilised; the new coal technology combined with vigorous conservation will clean it cheaply. The antithesis in the article is not real. Malcolm Edwards, Edwards Energy, London SE14</p>

It strayed off course and exploded in  mid-air last Saturday due to unknown causes," Adbat Aminian,  head of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's legal department, told  ITAR-TASS here.    Mr. Aminian leads an official Iranian commission taking part  in the investigation of the circumstances of the crash of the  Iranian in Nagorno-Karabakh. [sentence as received]    Iranian civil aviation and air force experts are now at the  site of the crash near Stepanakert. Conclusions are to be drawn  after they return from there and analyse the collected data, the  diplomat said.    "The flight was not of reconnaissance nature and the C-130  plane had no photographic equipment," the Iranian spokesman  emphasised. "The plane carried members of the families of  Iranian diplomats who work in Moscow and several Iranian  students. Regular flights from Moscow to Tehran are made once a  week. Therefore they decided to take the plane to fly home for  lunar new year's holidays."    According to the diplomat, the authorities of Russia,  Georgia, and Armenia were notified in advance about the flight,  and issued appropriate permissions.    "We requested the Armenian authorities to provide the  recording of radio traffic between the Yerevan air traffic  controllers and the Russian airliner on a flight from Sharja to  Mineralnyye Vody, via which contact was maintained with the  Iranian plane in question," the Iranian spokesman said.    "We hope that the Armenian side will comply with regulations  provided for by international law and investigate all the  circumstances of the tragedy," the Iranian diplomat said.</p>

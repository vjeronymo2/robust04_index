			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Playing the game will be more important than winning IT WAS not always easy to appreciate that a week of sporting trial by strength and skill lay ahead for the competitors registering in London yesterday for the World Corporate Games. Some were in peak physical shape in their track suits and trainers, but others were way past retirement age, and a few clearly had a weight problem. These are no ordinary games, however, and the height of skill and fitness is not the main requirement. Unlike the pretence at the Olympic Games, taking part rather than winning really is what matters. About 6,000 people from a dozen countries will be competing in 22 sports at venues in the London area, including tennis at Wimbledon and Queen's Club, golf at Wentworth and soccer, basketball and track events at Crystal Palace. The largest corporate entries come from British Airways - one of the event's main sponsors - IBM and Midland Bank. But among the 450 teams are also one from a London restaurant entering three Bangladeshi badminton internationals and a group of warders from Brixton prison. Competitors are arranged in age categories from the under-30s to the over-60s, (there are 150 of those), with an open class for athletes of any age who wish to compete at the top level. There are no qualifying standards  -the system of age categories is intended to give sportsmen and women the chance to compete against others of similar ability. Teams are split into championship divisions based on the number of participants, from Division 1 for teams of between one and five athletes to Division 8 for those with more than 200. The games started in San Francisco in 1988 as a way of involving organisations in team events, and were held there again in 1989, in Hawaii in 1990 and Lille, northern France, last year. They will be held in Malaysia next year and South Africa in 1994. There have been grants to the games of Pounds 100,000 from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts and Pounds 50,000 from the Sports Council. Some companies, including British Airways, the official carrier for the games, give substantial support to their teams, and others including IBM, Merrill Lynch and Abbey National provide kit and tracksuits with the company logo. The majority of companies are meeting half the cost, with participants funding the rest. So what is in it for the organisations that enter? Most say the games are an excellent way of building company morale and team spirit, and they also generate visibility for companies competing in their corporate liveries. Competition for the most striking kit at the opening and closing ceremonies can be as fierce as any contest on the sports field. As well as sport, the games will provide a business forum next Wednesday when a conference on the management of change in the 1990s, led by Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of ICI, will be held in the City.  ---------------------------------------------------------- WORLD CORPORATE GAMES  ---------------------------------------------------------- Entries             6,000 Company teams         400 Number of sports       22 Sponsors               50  ---------------------------------------------------------- Biggest Teams: British Airways       448 IBM                   250 Midland Bank          213 Wellcome Foundation   142 Securicor             102 Touche Ross            98 Chemical Bank          98 Abbey National         93 Jazz FM Listeners      91 Texas Instruments      90 Morgan Stanley         86 Norwich Union          74 Queen's Moat Leisure   74 John Lelliott          74 Ernst &amp; Young          70  ---------------------------------------------------------- Opening ceremony: Spitalfields Market, London, tomorrow Closing ceremony: Spitalfields, October 4  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

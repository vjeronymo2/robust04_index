			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> LIFE IMITATES PATHOLOGIES OF CULTURE;  </P> <P> IF GOOD ART IS ELEVATING, WHY DENY THAT BAD ART DEGRADES?  </P> <P> According to a jury of its peers, 2 Live Crew meets the community standards of  Broward County, Fla. After listening to "He'll tear the (vagina) open 'cause  it's satisfaction" and "Grabbed one by the hair, threw her on the floor, opened  up her thighs and guess what I saw," jury foreman David Garsow of the Key  Biscayne Presbyterian Church choir was unfazed. "Representing a cross-section  of the community as we do," he declared, "we did not feel it was obscene."  </P> <P> Broward County has thus confirmed what most of us know. Community standards,  having adjusted to fit the culture, have reached a new low. Standards in  publishing, for example, have hit so low that at Simon &amp; Schuster, reports  Time, the publication of "American Psycho," Bret Easton Ellis's new novel, has  left some editorial staff outraged.  </P> <P> It is filled with such degrading violence and torture, particularly of women,  that Ellis' past cover artist has refused to design this one. "I felt disgusted  with myself for reading it," he said. Simon &amp; Schuster, unfazed, plans to  "market it aggressively."  </P> <P> That American popular culture is drenched in sex and violence and a degrading  combination of the two is a truism. But it is then hard to understand the  surprise that greets the resulting degradation and depravity of real life:  savage "wilding" attacks by conscienceless kids, a quadrupling of rapes in 30  years, random shootings of children in our cities (four in one eight-day period  in New York), a doubling of the number of youths shot to death in the last six  years alone.  </P> <P> What happened to innocence? The number of 14- to 17-year-olds arrested today is  30 times what it was in 1950. Every year, one in 10 teen-age girls gets  pregnant. Teen suicides, now the second leading cause of death among  adolescents, are double what they were 20 years ago.  </P> <P> These signs of decay produce a general puzzlement. How did we get to such a  pass? How? Well, culture has consequences. Life imitates art. Is it so hard to  make a connection between culture and society? Most people, and in particular 2  Live Crew's intellectual defenders, fervently believe in the connection between  good art and the good society. If they did not think that good art is  elevating, artists would not make it and the people would not support it. And  yet the corollary -- if good art can elevate, then bad art can degrade -- is a  proposition they refuse to grasp.  </P> <P> Kids see 10,000 killings on TV by age 18. Is it any wonder that a growing  number might like to commit just one? Sexual aggression and misogyny are a  staple of rap. Is it any wonder that "wilders" should decide to try both out in  Central Park? MTV is a nonstop masturbation fantasy. Is it any wonder that a  generation of teens raised on it produces a million pregnancies every year?  </P> <P> In order to deny the obvious, the social pathologies of American life are  ascribed not to culture but to government: to spending cuts, lack of health  care, insufficient sex education. As Bill Bennett said recently of a report  cataloguing the growing agony of American adolescents: "The Code Blue report  says the problem is behavior, not health . . . . Yet its major recommendations  are health-service related (guaranteed access to health services and health  instruction for teen-age students, for example). In other words, Code Blue  identifies a crisis of the spirit, a sickness in the soul, and it recommends  (in effect) aspirin, Band-Aids, and a hall pass to see the nurse."  </P> <P> As a psychiatrist, I used to see psychotic patients who, urged on by voices  inside their heads, did crazy and terrible things, like immolating themselves.  Now we have legions of kids walking around with the technological equivalent: 2  Live Crew wired by Walkman directly into their brains, proposing to "bust your  (vagina) then break your backbone . . . . I wanna see you bleed." Surprised  that a whole generation is busting and breaking and bleeding? Culture has  consequences.  </P> <P> But hasn't mass culture always settled on the lowest common denominator? Yes,  but the lowest common denominator is not what it used to be. There is no  comparing the brutality and cynicism of today's pop culture to that of 40 years  ago. From "High Noon" to "Robocop" is a long descent.  </P> <P> And it is not just that we have never had a denominator so low. We have never  had a culture so mass. In the past, a libertarianism that permitted everything  to be said and done could at worst corrupt the intellectuals, a rather  dispensable class. Today, no child escapes the assault of an omnivorous and  omnipresent culture.  </P> <P> Until now, no society had combined total liberty with mass culture, let alone  with technology that hard-wires the stuff into the brain. History is therefore  no guide as to what happens next. The mayhem in the streets, however, tells the  story.  </P></p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Appleby Westward drops 28% SHARES IN Appleby Westward Group dived 20p to 178p after the USM-quoted grocery distributor reported a 28 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 730,000 for the 28 weeks to September 11. Sales for the period were down 8 per cent to Pounds 38.2m, while earnings per share fell to 8.5p (11.9p). However, an unchanged interim dividend of 3.2p is declared. Mr Roger Harvey, the chairman, explained that the shortfall partly reflected the planned reduction in gross margin necessary to help the company's retailers. Additional costs were also incurred in reducing the workforce and re-aligning the productivity payment scheme to its warehouse and transport staff. Following an agreement with Watson &amp; Philip, its distribution network now covers Wiltshire, Dorset, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Although the initial transition had gone smoothly, Mr Harvey said commission payments to Watson would affect profits, especially in the first two years of the six-year agreement.</p>

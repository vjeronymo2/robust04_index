In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Foreign Minister Mock  backed  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Defense Minister Werner  Fasslabend, who have both rejected Austria's participation in  NATO's "Partnership for Peace." Vice Chancellor Busek, however,  has repeatedly stressed in recent days that such a partnership  would also be of interest to Austria.    Mock: "I do not see any specific need for action regarding  Austria's direct cooperation." He added that Austria's  pragmatic function as an observer on security policy problems  was growing anyway. "In any case, prior to membership in the  European Union, we cannot act as observers with NATO or the  Western European Union." The foreign minister concluded:  "First things first."    The minister also stressed that his opinion on such a  partnership was "basically favorable," but he connects this  above all with the "great importance it will have for the  Central and Eastern European countries." To that extent,  Partnership for Peace is also significant for Austria.    Vice Chancellor Busek reiterated to DIE PRESSE his desire  for  Austria to come closer to a partnership with NATO. He  formulated his proposal more specifically: "The point is the  flow of information. We should have a military officer  permanently and officially accredited to NATO as an observer."  Busek also hinted that he had pledges from NATO saying this  would be possible.</p>

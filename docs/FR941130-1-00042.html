			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After determining that an application package is complete, MSHA would initiate a technical review to ensure that the NRTL testing and evaluation results were both reasonable and appropriate for the particular product. If technical review of the package indicates deficiencies resulting from inadequate data, illogical or unreasonable testing or evaluation results, or the omission of required information, the applicant would be notified of the discrepancy and given a reasonable period of time to provide the needed information and/or explain the apparent deficiency. Failure to respond to the MSHA notification of a discrepant application with the required information and/or satisfactory explanations within a reasonable period would result in cancellation of the application and forfeiture of the application fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the administrative and technical review of the product application package, MSHA would issue an approval, or notice denying approval, to the applicant. A notice denying approval would state the reasons upon which the denial was based. If an approval is issued, the approval holder is authorized and required to place an MSHA marking on the product which signifies to the user of the product that the product is approved for use in gassy underground mines. The product drawings and specifications, the NRTL testing and evaluation results, and the NRTL statement of product compliance with the applicable approval requirements would be retained in an approval file. The MSHA approval constitutes a license which authorizes the approval holder to manufacture, distribute, and sell the product constructed in exact accordance with the approval documentation on file with MSHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;6.10(b) would require that NRTL testing and evaluation of products for MSHA approval be performed only by NRTLs accredited by OSHA to perform the specific MSHA tests and evaluations. Because of the critical nature of the testing and evaluation of products to be used in the underground mining environment, where hazards such as flammable methane gas may exist, the proposal would not permit the NRTL to contract out any portion of the testing and evaluation conducted for applicants seeking MSHA approval. Additionally, the proposed rule would require the testing and evaluation to be performed in-house at the facilities of the NRTL specifically accredited by OSHA to perform the MSHA tests and evaluations required. In this way, MSHA could continue to ensure that the NRTL accredited by OSHA as having the capability, including the necessary equipment and trained personnel, to perform the specific MSHA tests and evaluations is, in fact, the laboratory conducting the testing and evaluation work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposal, the specific NRTL receiving recognition to perform MSHA testing and evaluation would be required to perform all tests and evaluations in strict accordance with MSHA regulations, including the procedures and protocol used by MSHA in conducting such testing and evaluation. The proposed rule would not permit an NRTL to change a testing standard or any elements incorporated in the standard. Therefore, the provisions of ``II. Supplementary Procedures, A. Test Standard Changes'' of Appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.7 would not be a part of the MSHA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;6.10(c) would reserve the right of MSHA to observe or verify the testing and evaluation conducted for products approved by MSHA. This is to ensure that the OSHA-recognized NRTLs continue to perform tests and evaluations to MSHA requirements in an appropriate manner. This safeguard would supplement the existing NRTL quality control program which includes the performance of internal audits as required by the OSHA recognition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;6.10(d) would require that the manufacturer of the MSHA-approved product affix a durable NRTL mark as well as a durable MSHA mark to the product. The test standard used in testing and evaluating the product for MSHA approval also would be required to be referenced on the NRTL's marking. This would allow the role of the NRTL participating in the MSHA approval program to be clearly identified in the field, both to the user of the approved product and to MSHA inspection personnel. In addition, this inclusion would protect the product user from unknowingly using a product bearing the MSHA and NRTL's marks in an environment for which the product has not been tested, evaluated, and approved. In this way, product defects discovered in the field by users or reported to and confirmed by MSHA could be addressed without delay. MSHA would promptly notify the manufacturer and associated NRTL of product defects identified or confirmed by MSHA, so that coordinated corrective action could be initiated to protect the safety of the miners and ensure the integrity of the MSHA and NRTL's marks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman explained here this afternoon why China has  abstained from voting on the UN Security Council bill  authorizing France dispatching troops for humanitarian  intervention in Rwanda.    "The action authorized by the UN Security Council resolution  at present is not guaranteed of cooperation and consent by the  parties to the conflict in Rwanda," the spokesman said in the  weekly news conference.    "In view of this, China has abstained on the vote."    He said that since the Rwanda crisis occurred, China has  constantly followed the development of the events in that  country.    "At present the situation in Rwanda is continuing to  aggravate and the humanitarian conditions in that country are  becoming increasingly grim, and we support efforts of the  international community to help end the crisis in Rwanda and  remove the miserable plight of the Rwanda people as soon as  possible.    "In the meantime, it is our belief that it is an  indispensable condition for the success of UN Peace-keeping  operation to obtain the consent of the parties concerned, and to  obtain the cooperation of the countries and regional  organizations concerned," he said.</p>

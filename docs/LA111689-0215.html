			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: HEALTH/MEDICINE  </P> <P> Seeing Ahead: Allergan Inc. recently told analysts in New York that it expects  a rough 1990 in part because of public warnings about the adverse side effects  of extended-wear contact lenses. The Food and Drug Administration recently  recommended that those using such lenses wear them for no longer than seven  days before removing them for a night because studies indicate that wearing  them continuously for longer periods could be harmful.  </P> <P> The Irvine-based eye care company is also facing an increased competition. "The  trends in the eye care market and the continuing impact of competitive lens  care systems have led to difficulties during 1989 which will likely continue  into 1990," Gavin Herbert, Allergan chairman and chief executive officer, told  analysts.  </P> <P> Allergan stock has been sliding since Nov. 9, when Herbert made his remarks. On  Wednesday, the company's stock closed at $15.875, down 25 cents. On the day  before Herbert's presentation to analysts, by contrast, Allergan closed at  $18.625.  </P> <P> Earnings for the third quarter rose 14% to $29.4 million; revenue was up 9% to  $206.4 million.  </P></p>

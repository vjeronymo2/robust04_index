			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Bonn prepares a new round of defence cuts MR Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, will announce a new round of defence cuts this week, including reductions in garrison strengths and a delay in building new barracks in east Germany, as a first step in his planned defence review. A reconsideration of contracts for arms and equipment, promised for the end of March, is likely to be an open-ended process without a firm deadline, defence officials say. Meanwhile, a freeze on new contracts ordered by Mr Ruhe last week, will remain in force. As for a review of manning levels in the Bundeswehr, confirmed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the weekend, it will be completed in the course of the year. The aim is to see what personnel cuts can be made beyond the current target of reducing to 370,000 men by 1995, without abolishing conscription. Mr Kohl yesterday sought to head off rising criticism from defence experts, and from Nato, about the government's plan to find further urgent savings as part of its 'solidarity pact' for east Germany. Savings of DM860m (Pounds 358.3m) this year, and DM700m a year for the next three years, have been ordered. Mr Kohl said the Bundeswehr and its soldiers 'will receive all the necessary equipment and support they need to fulfil their new tasks'. He also promised that all cuts would be carried out in close consultation with Nato, in order to maintain all Germany's commitments to the alliance. His reassurance followed criticism from Mr Manfred Worner, the secretary-general of Nato and former German defence minister, who warned that planned defence cuts were in danger of undermining the alliance's basic defence capability. In a weekend television interview, Mr Ruhe also attacked the extent of the cuts in his budget, saying that defence was having to bear an unequal share of the burden of savings needed to finance subsidies for the east German economy. He announced his defence review last week, while at the same time cancelling a DM3bn contract with the US for a high-altitude electronic reconnaissance system known as Lapas. Defence Ministry officials said that all contracts would be reviewed to see where savings could be made without suffering penalty clauses. If the cuts have to be made by the end of March, they fear that the result will be a haphazard, rather than carefully structured, savings programme.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Smaller companies trusts to raise Pounds 70m TWO SMALLER companies investment trusts announced plans to raise up to Pounds 70m of new capital yesterday. Both Foreign &amp; Colonial Smaller Companies and Amicable Smaller Enterprises are issuing C shares in a combination of a placing and open offer. F&amp;C Smaller Companies was ranked fourth among 29 smaller companies trusts in the year to November 1, according to Micropal, a performance ranking service; Amicable Smaller Enterprises was ranked fifth. UK smaller company shares have outperformed their larger brethren this year, after four successive calendar years of underperformance. The F&amp;C fund is international in scope, and buys shares in emerging markets. It says it will use the capital raised to 'look at nearly new issues which have come to the market within the last two years and have achieved solid, but unexciting share prices.' F&amp;C will issue up to 40m C shares at 100p, via a combination of a placing, open offer to existing shareholders on a 1-for-6 basis, and an offer-for-subscription. The C shares will convert into ordinary shares before March 25, 1994; issuing shares is a common device used by trusts when raising new capital, and is designed to avoid dilution of the net asset value of existing shares. Amicable Smaller Enterprises is placing 25.15m C shares and making an open offer of a further 5m C shares at 100p each. The directors believe 'there are currently favourable opportunities for investment in UK smaller companies and therefore that it is an appropriate time to expand the capital base of the company.' The Amicable C shares will convert before December 31. Both issues will need to be approved at extraordinary meetings - on November 29 for Amicable Smaller and on December 2 for F&amp;C Smaller. Shares in F&amp;C Smaller fell  1/2 p to 168p yesterday; Amicable Smaller shares were unchanged at 121p.</p>

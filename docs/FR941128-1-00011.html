The rate shall be negotiated and agreed upon in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;21. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The amount of cash, in-kind contributions and indirect costs for the Lead Center and all sub-contracted SBDC service providers shall be indicated in accordance with OMB financial requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Expenses.

All proposed travel by the SBDC Director and the SBDC staff must be reasonable, justified in writing, and included in the SBDC's proposed annual budget. Such justification must indicate the estimated cost, number of persons traveling, and the benefit to be derived by the small business community from the proposed travel. A specific projected amount, based on past experience where appropriate, must also be included in the budget for any unplanned travel. A justification in greater detail shall be required for unplanned out-of-State travel. Any proposed unplanned out-of-State travel that exceeds the approved budgeted amount for travel must be submitted to the Project Officer for approval on a case-by-case basis.

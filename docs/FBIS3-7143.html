This is an open agitation of "unification through march  northward" which must not go unnoticed.    The "retaliation" threatened by the warmaniac meant a war  and  "linking to a chance of unification" meant "achieving  unification through march northward" with the help of the United  States. Yi Pyong-tae did not trouble himself to conceal that  his clique was working out a "strategy" to attain this  aggressive aim.    This vividly shows to what extent the Kim Yong-sam traitor  group has gone in its adventurous war provocation moves against  the North.    Facts fully prove that the Kim Yong-sam group is obsessed  with a wild ambition to achieve "unification by invading the  North", "unification by prevailing over communism" with the  backing of the U.S. imperialists, and its aggravation of  tension under the pretext of the non- existent "nuclear problem"  of the North was a premeditated provocation to pave the way for  a war against the North.    But it must not act rashly.    The Kim Yong-sam traitor clique must clearly know that those  who dare attempt to harm our socialist system centred on the  masses will only suffer a miserable destruction.</p>

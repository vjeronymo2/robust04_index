			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Firm stand must be made to 'open skies' Sir, Your excellent editorial on the EC's programme of air liberalisation correctly points out that it is consumers who stand to lose most if the Community's laudable 'open skies' policy is stalled ('Clouds in EC open skies', September 28). Three waves of deregulation over the last six years have hardly stirred the web of air cartels which, with the blessing of the majority of EC governments, criss-crosses the European skies. Such cartels, operated mainly by state-owned or dominant airlines and those to whom governments granted monopoly or special rights, amount to little more than institutionalised plunder of passengers' pockets. This state of affairs must not be allowed to continue. The prospect of true competition terrifies the likes of Air France and the Belgian national air line, Sabena; but in the face of massively funded vested interests, and a common front challenged (to their credit) only by the UK and Netherlands governments, consumers have historically had little opportunity, except through the vociferous clamour of national, European and international groups, to object. And while consumers have been, to use the vernacular, 'stitched up', airlines and governments have together, irritatingly and erroneously, claimed that they have been 'acting in the consumer's best interests'. Sir Leon Brittan has publicly stated that 'competition must continue to be the driving force (in the promotion of airborne free enterprise)' and that the whole effort to open up the skies and relax government restrictions on airlines 'would have little effect if we were to allow airlines to reintroduce these restrictions by private action'. He is right. The EC must stand firm against those vested interests within industry and government which would undo half a decade's progress - what little there has been - towards a free market in the air. If Brussels loses its nerve at this critical point, the benefits for consumers could be lost for ever.

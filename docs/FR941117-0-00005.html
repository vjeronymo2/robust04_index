			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provision was narrowed because of the criticism that prohibiting sharing of employees and resources with leagues or other organizations would put small corporate credit unions out of existence. It was argued that small corporate credit unions have a place in the future of the credit union system because large, regional or national corporate credit unions may not devote as much time and resources to providing service to small natural person credit unions. To address this concern, the final rule does not prohibit sharing of employees below the level of the chief executive officer of the corporate credit union. The CEO of the corporate credit union, who may not be an employee of a trade association, must report to the corporate board, which cannot be dominated by persons associated with any given trade association. With those restrictions in place, a corporate credit union should be allowed, based on its business judgment, to share employees and other resources with any other organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To clarify that the provision applies to the top paid employee of the corporate credit union, not the chair of the board, the final rule substitutes ``chief executive officer'' for ``management official.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed earlier, Section 704.12(e), the definition of ``credit union-related organization,'' has been deleted from the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> D. Applicability to State Chartered Corporate Credit Unions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule applies to all federally insured corporate credit unions. (Non federally insured corporate credit unions must comply with the rule in order to receive funds from federal credit unions.) The Board acknowledges the strong sentiment against NCUA applying this rule to state chartered corporate credit unions. The Board's rationale for applying this rule to such credit unions is provided in the analysis of Executive Order 12612, set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E. Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule will not take effect until January 1, 1996. Board members in the midst of their terms on that date need not leave the board, even if that means the corporate credit union does not meet Section 704.12(a) of the rule. Elections held after the effective date, however, must be conducted so as to bring the corporate credit union into compliance with the regulation. For example, on a nine-person board where each member serves as a director of Trade Association A, members serve three-year terms, and three members are elected each year, the three individuals elected in 1996 must not serve as officers, directors, or employees of Trade Association A or its affiliates. Two of the individuals elected in 1997 also must not serve in those capacities for the trade association. At that time, the majority of the board will not be serving as officers, directors, or employees of the same or affiliated trade association, a condition which must be maintained in subsequent elections. The requirement for an independent chair of the board would have to be met at the earliest possible date, the 1996 election in this example. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporate credit unions must come into compliance with the other provisions of the rule on the effective date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> F. Regulatory Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NCUA Board certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on small credit unions (those under $1 million in assets). The rule applies only to corporate credit unions, all of which have assets well in excess of $1 million. Accordingly, the NCUA Board has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule does not impose any paperwork requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. It states, ``Federal action limiting the policy-making discretion of the states should be taken only where constitutional authority for the action is clear and certain, and the national activity is necessitated by the presence of a problem of national scope.'' The risk of loss to federally insured credit unions and the NCUSIF caused by actions of corporate credit unions are concerns of national scope. The final rule will help ensure that proper safeguards are in place to ensure the safety and soundness of corporate credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule applies to all federally insured corporate credit unions, including those that are state-chartered. State-chartered corporate credit unions enjoy the same benefits provided by the NCUSIF as do federally chartered corporate credit unions. The benefits are provided through a federal system, the responsibility for which lies with the NCUA Board. The Board believes that those who benefit from the system should bear its burdens equally. The rule also affects, indirectly, non federally insured state-chartered corporate credit unions, which, pursuant to 12 CFR Part 703, must comply with the rule in order to receive funds from federally chartered credit unions. The final rule does not impose additional costs or burdens on the states or affect the states' ability to discharge traditional state government functions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

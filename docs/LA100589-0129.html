			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPARABLE WORTH LAWSUIT AGAINST STATE DEALT SETBACK  </P> <P> A federal judge Wednesday dismissed the heart of the nation's largest  comparable worth lawsuit, setting back a union's claim that California  deliberately underpaid thousands of women in female-dominated state jobs.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel -- who once served as legal counsel for  the National Organization for Women -- ruled in San Francisco that the  California State Employees' Assn. had failed to prove deliberate sex  discrimination in state salaries.  </P> <P> She allowed the association to submit new arguments on a claim that state  policies had the effect of illegally holding down the salaries of female state  employees. But Ellen Eggers, staff attorney for the CSEA, said the association  was undecided about whether to pursue the lawsuit in light of Wednesday's  ruling because, without proof of intent, such suits have been made much more  difficult to prove by a recent Supreme Court ruling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Significant'  </P> <P> "We are very pleased," said Christopher Waddell, chief counsel for the  California Department of Personnel Administration. Although the case is only  partially resolved, Waddell called Wednesday's ruling "very significant."  </P> <P> Filed in 1984, the lawsuit is the nation's largest case brought under Title 7  of the Civil Rights Acts. More than 60,000 current and former secretaries,  clerks and other workers in mostly female state jobs stood to share in back  pay, interest and wage increases that could have cost California taxpayers as  much as $1 billion, according to calculations made by the state employees'  association.  </P> <P> Although the association attempted to paint its case as a sex discrimination  suit, it had been generally referred to as a comparable worth action because it  is based on pay disparities between different types of jobs, rather than a  claim that women were paid less than men in the same job.  </P> <P> Still, the ruling shocked labor and women's rights groups who had been hopeful  for a more positive outcome in the hands of Patel, who was appointed to the  bench in 1980 by then-President Jimmy Carter after her stint as legal counsel  for NOW.  </P> <P> "This decision means you have to virtually find the smoking gun that shows  (discriminatory) intent," said Martin Morgenstern, a former state personnel  director who is chairman of the center for labor research and education at UC  Berkeley. "I think this decision is a significant setback."  </P> <P> "We are very disappointed," said Gail Kaufman, associate director of Equal  Rights Advocates, a San Francisco-based public interest law firm. "The stakes  were very high in this case."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Difficult Case to Prove'  </P> <P> "In the political climate that we are dealing with right now I don't think  Judge Patel was willing to go out on a limb in any way," said CSEA's Eggers.  "But in fairness to the judge, it was a very, very difficult case to prove  because there were no live witnesses from the 1930s."  </P> <P> A key issue in Wednesday's ruling was whether the state has deliberately  discriminated against women since the 1930s, when state pay scales were  revised. The association, relying on documents issued by state officials in the  1930s, contended that the effects of unequal pay levels for men and women in  those revisions persists.  </P> <P> The state denied bias and said any differences in pay levels reflected rates  being charged by other employers. Lower pay for female-dominated jobs based on  prevailing market levels was declared legal in 1985 by the U.S. 9th Circuit  Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> But Patel ruled that documents from a 1931 salary revision, containing staff  comments suggesting lower pay for some female-dominated jobs, failed to prove  deliberate discrimination, and that the effects of any bias were mostly  eliminated in a state reclassification in 1937-38.  </P> <P> Contributing to this story was Times staff writer Virginia Ellis.  </P></p>

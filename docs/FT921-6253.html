			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Australian mine groups turn in big losses COMALCO and Pasminco, two of Australia's biggest mining companies, yesterday reported big losses caused by falling metal prices and provisions against falling asset values. Pasminco shares were also hit by an announcement that North Broken Hill Peko and CRA each plan to reduce their 40 per cent shareholdings in the company to 19 per cent. There was better news for the mining sector from Renison Goldfields, the world's largest mineral sands producer, which announced a 20 per cent rise in first-half net profits to ADollars 33m (USDollars 25m), due to higher production at the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea. However, Renison said second-half earnings would be 'well below' the first half because of lower gold grades at Porgera and losses on sales of stockpiled mineral sands. Comalco, a 67 per cent subsidiary of CRA, blamed lower aluminium prices for an 87 per cent fall in net profits to ADollars 21.5m for the year to December. Sales revenue was down from ADollars 2.1bn to ADollars 2bn. The company made a net loss of ADollars 72.2m after accounting for a net extraordinary loss of ADollars 25.7m, comprising a write-off of ADollars 200m against the carrying value of downstream businesses, offset by a transfer of ADollars 174.3m from the superannuation fund. Mr Nick Stump, chief executive, said aluminium prices had fallen to their lowest-ever level in real terms during the period. Prices had risen recently, but the company was not confident that the improvement could be sustained. Mr Stump said Comalco was still considering expansion of its operations at Bell Bay and Boyne Island in Australia, and Tiwai Point in New Zealand, but would go ahead only if market conditions and power costs allowed. Comalco declared a final dividend of 2 cents, fully franked, compared with 10 cents last year. The total dividend is 4 cents, compared with 18 cents in the previous period. Pasminco said it lost ADollars 34.2m after tax in the six months to December, compared with a profit of ADollars 6.4m in the corresponding period of 1990. Turnover was down from ADollars 877m to ADollars 625m. It said the loss increased to ADollars 118m after including abnormal losses of ADollars 2.3m relating to redundancy costs and an extraordinary loss of ADollars 81.5m relating to a write-down of its Elura mine, which is to be sold. Pasminco shares closed 13 cents lower at ADollars 1.41 on the Australian Stock Exchange. The sale of shares was triggered by North Broken Hill Peko, which wants to free capital for investment in projects such as its Kanowna Belle gold mine in Western Australia. CRA said it had followed North Broken Hill's lead because it did not want to be forced to consolidate Pasminco in its accounts. The group said it also wanted to concentrate on its iron ore, coal and aluminium operations. Pasminco did not declare an interim dividend. The company was formed in 1988 when North Broken Hill and CRA pooled their zinc and lead mines, and smelters. CRA is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK. See Commodities</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Turks in Uzbekistan telecoms venture TELETAS, Turkey's second largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in which Alcatel of France has a 39 per cent stake, has formed a joint venture to install digital public exchanges in Uzbekistan, the latest move by Turkish telecom companies into the Turkic-speaking former Soviet republics. The joint venture between Teletas and Algorithim, a local Uzbek company, will start delivering Alcatel's System-12 public exchange, which Teletas makes under licence in Turkey. The project will initially install 70,000 lines in eight Uzbek cities, eventually leading to full manufacture of the exchange by Altel, the joint venture company. The deal follows similar moves by Netas, Northern Telecom of Canada's majority-owned Turkish subsidiary, and Simtel the local Siemens operation. Progress has been spurred by a Dollars 25m (Pounds 17.6m) Turkish government aid project to provide digital public exchanges in all five Turkish-speaking former Soviet republics. Teletas installed a 2,500 line exchange in both Tashkent,the Uzbek capital and Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan. Teletas say they hope also to manufacture the Levent, a small rural switching system, designed in the company's Istanbul laboratory.</p>

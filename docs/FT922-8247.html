			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Opening up the post FOR THE citizens of Europe's prospective single market, communicating with one another is a business that is changing with breathtaking speed. But amid the seismic upheavals in telecommunications markets and technologies, one sector has thus far remained relatively impervious to change: the post. Now, at last, a dose of market discipline seems to be coming to the mail too, with the publication yesterday of the European Commission's green paper on postal services. The paper, which proposes the opening of a range of mail services currently carried out exclusively by national postal monopolies to a modicum of competition, has been a long time in arriving, and is still worryingly short on detail. Stiff opposition among the postal administrations and some EC governments to earlier drafts helped to delay it, and to blunt some of the Commission's ideas. But its delivery is no less welcome for that. In the process of consultation that now begins, it will be up to users of postal services to make sure that the Commission hears their case for enhanced competition and improved efficiency at least as clearly as it will hear the postal monopolies' objections. How this debate unfolds should be of interest to business everywhere in the Community. Companies need efficient postal services at affordable costs as much as ordinary citizens do. The fact that the quality of such services varies significantly between EC member states is a distortion to the European market and a serious handicap for businesses and consumers in those countries with poor postal administrations. Critically, companies and individuals also depend on the existence of a universal service - one that ensures next-day delivery to a remote farmstead in Brittany as readily as to the Rue de la Bourse. Balancing requirements Yesterday's green paper - the result, among other things, of a tussle between Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi's communications directorate and the Commission's competition czars under Sir Leon Brittan - is an attempt to strike a balance between these various requirements. Sensibly, the Commission has shied away from complete liberalisation of the postal market, which almost everybody agrees would lead to the loss of a universal service, at least of one at affordable prices. Equally wisely, it has shunned the opposite course: complete harmonisation of services, which would essentially entail the establishment of a single, monster postal administration for the entire Community. Extended competition The proposal is, rather, that existing national postal administrations should retain their monopoly over domestic letter services up to a certain (as yet undetermined) price and weight level, and that competition - currently allowed, for example, in parcel services - be extended to other areas, such as express, direct mail and cross-border services. Any restrictions on competition, it argues, should be aimed solely at preserving universal services. The benefits of such a gradualist approach can already be seen in Britain, where the Post Office has taken advantage of modest increases in competition to improve its services and management practices. This is one British experience worth investigation by other EC countries. As always, the devil will lie in the detail of the Community's eventual regulations, and in their implementation. And in this respect the green paper does give some cause for concern. Compared with earlier drafts, for example, the Commission has watered down its commitment to opening up cross-border services and direct mail. It has also introduced a clause which would allow governments worried about eroding their universal mail services to apply more restrictive measures - a sizeable potential loophole. Hence the importance of regulation. To prevent cheating by the postal monopolies, any eventual EC postal directive must contain provisions for a tight, and transparent, regulatory regime. And any exemptions to competition should be as tightly drawn as possible. Only under these conditions will Europe's state owned postal services achieve higher efficiency, while allowing private sector competitors to develop the new services a healthy economy needs.</p>

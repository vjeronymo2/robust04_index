			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rights cash boost for Independent Insurance INDEPENDENT INSURANCE Group, the medium-sized general insurer which is planning a stock market flotation in the spring, has completed a Pounds 10m rights issue. Mr Robert McCracken, director and general manager, said the new money gave the group 'a stronger capital base to go forward in 1993,' taking advantage of recent rises in premium rates in the UK market. Independent, the former UK operations of Allstate of the US, has grown rapidly since it was bought in 1987 by the New Scotland Group. New Scotland was formed for the deal by Scottish businessmen and backed by institutional investors including 3i, Foreign &amp; Colonial and County NatWest. Mr McCracken said the company was strong in the provincial commercial property and the London insurance market, which together provide 64 per cent of its premium income. It had diversified away from its original focus on personal lines insurance. But following recent growth in annual premium income to more than Pounds 100m, solvency - which measures net assets as a percentage of premium income  -had fallen to about 40 per cent, and fresh capital was needed to support further expansion. Investors have been encouraged by the group's strong profitability, bucking the industry trend. Independent made profits of Pounds 8.5m in 1990 and Pounds 2.1m in 1991, when the UK general insurance industry lost more than Pounds 2bn. During the first nine months of 1992 Independent's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 3.8m, with premiums up from Pounds 70m to Pounds 100m. Mr McCracken said the company's success was due to the fact that its underwriting policy was tighter than many of its competitors. It had also been more selective about the brokers with which it traded on a regular basis. Independent's management and some staff own about 8 per cent of the company.</p>

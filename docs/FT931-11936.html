			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fixed-rate Tessas - At a Glance TWO building societies are offering fixed-rate Tessas. Britannia's new Tessa guarantees 8 per cent gross. However, Pounds 8,300 is required in a feeder account, which also pays a fixed but taxable 8 per cent gross. The maximum will be transferred into the Tessa each year. Britannia will not allow transfers into the fixed-rate Tessa from existing Tessa-holders. National &amp; Provincial building society's guaranteed Tessa will pay 7.5 per cent gross but allows a minimum investment of Pounds 100. Those who can afford Pounds 8,400 up front can put this in a feeder account, also fixed at 7.5 per cent gross for annual transfers. Abbey National has replaced its Tessa with a second edition, paying tiered rates of interest. If your total capital was for the maximum - Pounds 6,600  -you will see no difference in the 7.5 per cent being paid on this tier. Those with with balances of up to Pounds 3,000 will only get 7.1 per cent. Interest on Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,799 is 7.3 per cent and from Pounds 4,800-Pounds 6,599, 7.4 per cent. The first edition has been withdrawn but existing Abbey Tessa-holders do not have to switch.</p>

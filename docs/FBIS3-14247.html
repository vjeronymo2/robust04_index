The talks dealt with the latest developments in  the Arab arena and the developments in the Middle East peace  process.    Afterward, the Russian official stated that he and the Arab  League secretary general discussed the peace process and the  direct practical steps that must be taken to advance the peace  process. They also discussed the situation in Iraq and the  Libyan-Western crisis.    Pasuvalyuk said that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid welcomed an increase  in the Russian role in the area, considering that Russia is a  big power, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a  cosponsor of the peace process, and has interests and friends in  the Middle East.    The Russian envoy said that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid explained that  the Russian role in the Middle East need not necessarily repeat  or compete with the role of any other party. But it should be a  constructive role working for the benefit of peace and stability  in the region.    The Russian official affirmed that his country wants to  confer with all the parties concerned to achieve stability in  the Middle East. He also affirmed that Russia wants to resume  the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.    He said that Moscow has made enormous efforts to convince  all  the parties of the need to resume the peace process despite the  difficulties facing it after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in  Hebron.</p>

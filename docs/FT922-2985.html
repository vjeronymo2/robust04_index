			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Arts: United front falls apart - Susan Moore finds discord at the Grosvenor House fair THE Grosvenor House antiques fair is supposed to be an event at which the British art and antiques trades unite to wow the world. It is as much a showcase as a marketplace, a triumphant annual display of excellence that confirms London's position as the centre of the international art market. Traditionally, it is where top dealers unveil sensational stock to the world's richest and most serious collectors, who queue around the block for the privilege of buying it. The fair is also the dealers' trump card played against the auction houses which have been whittling away their business for years. In these lean times, it is more important than ever that the dealers stand together and that Grosvenor House fields the top names and the finest pieces. That is what makes this year's charade over the object judged Artefact of the Year so lamentably self-destructive. The object so honoured by five independent and academic judges of the annual award - which is supported by The Burlington Magazine - is a small Franco-Burgundian pendant jewel of around 1400. It belongs to Wartski, a firm distinguished by its scholarship as well as its extraordinary number of royal warrants. The jewel takes the form of a triptych, its rock crystal ogee-arched doors opening to reveal a free-standing gold and enamel relief of the Madonna and Child above a double reliquary compartment. Only 30 Burgundian jewels of the period are recorded, and this much-published piece is one of the few outside public collections. Its recent fate is also remarkable. This Artefact of the Year initially was rejected by members of the fair's vetting committee. Stranger still, the same vetting group had raised no objection when it was exhibited at Grosvenor House last year. These vets, predominantly other exhibiting jewellers, now felt it was a composite piece. Wartski, and others, felt the presence of the green-eyed monster. Director Kenneth Snowman contacted the council of the British antique dealers' association (BADA). A group of museum experts was called in and, unanimously, accepted the authenticity of the piece. It is thought to be the first instance of an appeal being upheld at Grosvenor House. The result was that the jewel came to the fair and won an award, but Wartski will never exhibit there again. For three years, the firm has asked for independent scholars on the vetting committee in equal proportion to the exhibiting dealers. Perhaps it is about time BADA put its house in order. Does the fact that the Artefact of the Year was also exhibited last year mean there are too few blue-chip works of art fresh to this year's fair? Certainly, it seems that most dealers are playing safe, hoping to sell in the middle range. Wednesday's opening day did see all the big money but there was activity only on works bearing price tags with a moderate number of zeros, from jades at Spink and clocks at Anthony Woodburn to Leger's small Hogarth and Ackermann &amp; Johnson's Herring. The following day, however, Johnny van Haeften sold his exotic Brazilian landscape by Frans Post to a new client for around Pounds 400,000. It also revealed the dealers who cannot but make a splash. Jonathan Harris again revealed his distinctive, idiosyncratic taste for all that is bold and quirky in English furniture. He shows a swagger pair of sculptural gilt-wood armchairs designed by John Vardy for Spencer House around 1758. Commissioned by the 1st Earl Spencer, and more recently in the possession of Henry Ford II, the chairs seem to represent perfectly the fair's theme of Anglo-American patronage. Their price: Pounds 360,000. Alongside architectural Mayhew &amp; Ince, we also find a pair of monumental 19th century Anglo-Indian stools - even an Indonesian zither in the form of a crocodile. Peter Tillou presents another wonderful, richly-varied stand. In pride of place hangs Ammi Phillips' portrait of the 18-month old Andrew Jackson Ten Broeck of 1834, resplendent in his scarlet dress, and among the four or five masterpieces of American folk painting (Dollars 1.4m or Pounds 850,000). Of museum quality again is his exceptional pair of flintlock, silver-mounted duelling pistols by Samuel Brunn of around 1800, believed traditionally to have been made for the Prince Regent (Pounds 85,000). Other goodies also are less obviously displayed. Note Alex Wengraf's School of Fontainebleu statuette of a stag, and Bill Drummond's small gem of Dahl clouds by moonlight. Good pictures are sprinkled liberally throughout the fair. Newhouse offers a delightful pair of Boucher landscapes for Pounds 1.95m. The prize for the strangest - and most erotic - painting on show must go to the David and Goliath at Richard Feigen. In this self-portrait, Zoffany depicts himself not as the vanquished Goliath like Caravaggio but as a cool, smiling David.</p>

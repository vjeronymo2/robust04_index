			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Consumer credit side boosts Cattle's A strong performance from its consumer credit division enabled Cattle's (Holdings) to achieve a 28 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 15.8m. The Pounds 13.7m comparative figure was adjusted to take in a Pounds 1.4m exceptional gain from the flotation of Rosebys, previously treated as extraordinary. The 1993 figure was in line with expectations, with profit struck on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 217m (Pounds 210m). Consumer credit, the main contributor, made profits of Pounds 14.9m, a 21 per cent increase on 1992's Pounds 12.29m. The division's bad debt charges remained unchanged despite a 3.5 per cent increase in its customer base. The group's corporate finance operations, which include hire purchase and asset leasing to businesses, turned round from a Pounds 1.1m deficit to a Pounds 280,0000 profit following restructuring in 1992. Outstanding balances on customer accounts were reduced from Pounds 42m two years ago to Pounds 20m. Mr Eddie Cran, chief executive, expected a further improvement in the current year. Insurance services, through the Swinton CIB franchise, made a profit of Pounds 493,000 (Pounds 769,000) in an increasingly competitive market. It is currently reviewing its market strategy. Cattle's chains of video libraries and travel agencies, however, incurred small losses. Unless there is a marked recovery, these businesses will be wound down. Net assets amounted to Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 38.83m) at year-end, but the company's 43 per cent stake in Rosebys, the textile retailing company, is carrying a book value of Pounds 5.6m, against its current market value of Pounds 16m. Basic earnings per share emerged at 9.8p (7.8p, or 9p adjusted to include the Pounds 1.4m exceptional gain) A recommend final dividend of 3.1p makes a 5p (4.2p) total.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hazardous waste is defined at Section 1004(5) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6903(5). There are two types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of hazardous waste. First, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may cause or significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute to an increase in mortality, serious irreversible illness, or incapacitating reversible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illness. In addition, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may pose a substantial present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's regulations establishing criteria for listing hazardous wastes are codified at Title 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) &sect;261.11 (40 CFR 261.11). Section 261.11  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states three criteria for identifying characteristics and for listing wastes as hazardous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, wastes may be classified as ``characteristic'' wastes if they have the properties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described at 40 CFR 261.21&hyph;24 which would cause them to be classified as having the characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity or toxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, wastes may be classified as acutely hazardous if they are fatal to humans at low doses,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lethal in animal studies at particular doses designated in the regulation, or otherwise capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> causing or significantly contributing to an increase in serious illness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, wastes may be listed as hazardous if they contain hazardous constituents identified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 and the Agency concludes, after considering eleven factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enumerated in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3), that the waste is capable of posing a substantial present or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed. Such wastes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated as toxic wastes. A substance is listed in Appendix VIII if it has been shown in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic effects on humans or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wastes listed as hazardous are subject to federal requirements under RCRA for persons who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generate, transport, treat, store or dispose of such waste. Facilities that must meet the hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste management requirements, including the need to obtain permits to operate, commonly are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to as Subtitle C facilities. Subtitle C is Congress' original statutory designation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that part of RCRA that directs EPA to issue those regulations for hazardous wastes as may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to protect human health or the environment. Thus, facilities like incinerators or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landfills that are required to comply with RCRA requirements for hazardous waste are referred to as Subtitle C incinerators or landfills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle C is codified as Subchapter III of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 6921 through 6939(e)). EPA standards and procedural regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing Subtitle C are found generally at 40 CFR parts 260 through 272.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Solid wastes that are not hazardous wastes may be disposed of at facilities that are overseen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by state and local governments. These are the so-called Subtitle D facilities. Subtitle D is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress' original statutory designation for that part of RCRA that deals with federal assistance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state and regional planning efforts for disposal of solid waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle D is codified as Subchapter IV of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 6941 through 6949(a)). EPA regulations affecting Subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities are found generally at 40 CFR parts 240 thru 247, and 255 thru 258.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6921(e)(2)) requires EPA to determine whether to list as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous wastes generated by various chemical production processes, including the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dyes and pigments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In June of 1991, EPA entered into a proposed consent decree in a lawsuit filed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Defense Fund,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EDF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reilly, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Civ. No. 89&hyph;0598 (D.D.C.), hereinafter referred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to as the settlement agreement), in which the Agency agreed to publish a proposed determination as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to whether or not to list as hazardous certain wastes from the production of dyes and pigments by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 30, 1994 and to promulgate a final decision by November 30, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are three major classes of dyes and pigments: Azo/benzidine, anthraquinone, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane. The settlement agreement specifies that the listing is to address the azo, monoazo,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diazo, triazo, polyazo, azoic, and benzidine categories of the azo/benzidine dye and pigment class;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the anthraquinone and perylene categories of the anthraquinone dye and pigment class; and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane, triphenylmethane, and pyrazolone categories of the triarylmethane dye and pigment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class. The settlement agreement also specifies that the listing is to address the following types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of wastes where they are found: spent catalysts, reactor still overheads, vacuum system condensate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process waters, spent adsorbent, equipment cleaning sludge, product mother liquor, product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardization filter cake, dust collector filter fines, recovery still bottoms, treated wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effluent, and wastewater treatment sludge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of its regulations implementing Section 3001(e) of RCRA, EPA published a list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous wastes that includes hazardous wastes generated from non-specific sources and a list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous wastes from specific sources. These lists have been amended several times, and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 40 CFR 261.32, respectively. In this action, EPA is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend 40 CFR 261.32 to add five wastes from specific sources generated during the production of dyes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pigments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those hazardous constituents that are proposed to be included in Appendix VII to part 261,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Basis for Listing Hazardous Waste, also are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII of Part 261, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list of Hazardous Constituents, if not already included in this list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All hazardous wastes listed under RCRA and codified in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any solid waste that exhibits one or more of the characteristics of a RCRA hazardous waste (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.24), are also hazardous substances under the Comprehensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. See CERCLA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 101(14)(C). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40 CFR 302.4 along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with their reportable quantities (RQs). Accordingly, the Agency is proposing to list the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes in this action as CERCLA hazardous substances in Table 302.4 of 40 CFR 302.4. EPA is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking action at this time to adjust the one-pound statutory RQs for these substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. EPA's Hazardous Waste Listing Determination Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that it should provide the public with a better understanding of the basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's listing decisions. Accordingly, EPA presents here the general approach the Agency uses for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether to list a waste as hazardous pursuant to 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3). This presentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focuses on selection of waste management scenarios used in assessing risk and the use of information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on risk levels in making listing determinations. These elements are an important part of EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general listing policy and critical aspects to the dyes and pigments listing determination. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important to note that this discussion presents EPA's general listing policy and is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking. The Agency may take action at variance with this general policy. The Agency is seeking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on its policy in order to get input from the public, not in order to promulgate binding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules for listing determinations. The Agency will review any comments received and may revise its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy based on such comments. However, the Agency does not intend to respond to comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The listing criteria described here focus on several aspects of the Agency's listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination process. The discussion is not intended to cover all potential aspects of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations. For example, analyzing population risk is not included in this presentation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency solicits comment on how population risks could be included as a factor in listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations. The Agency's approach to calculating distributions of individual risk values when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining ``high end'' risk and the Agency's position on how far into the future it will consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk are not covered in today's notice. The Agency solicits comment on these factors and their use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in listing determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gonzalo Aguirre, leader of the Victory and Renewal  Movement (MRV), has been elected a presidential candidate. The  speech announcing his election was followed by shouts of "viva  Gonzalo" and the singing of the "Three Trees" march. Aguirre  spoke for almost an hour. He placed special emphasis in his  Wilsonist roots [late Blanco Party leader Wilson Ferreira  Aldunate], expressing support for a liberal economic policy and  a future coalition government.    The ceremony to announce his candidacy was held on 16 April  and attended by 4,000 people. There were flags, placards, and  signs of the List 97.70 headed by former Deputy Carlos  Rodriguez--the strongest candidate to be Aguirre's running  mate--and List 4 headed by Senator Julio Grenno and his  Canelones colleague Bari Gonzalez.    Several telegrams congratulating the candidate arrived  during  the ceremony. They were sent by Herreraist [Blanco Party  faction] candidate Juan Andres Ramirez, Senator Walter Santoro,  former Minister Alvaro Ramos, former Senator Enrique Veltran,  Maldonado Mayor Domingo Burgueno, and former law school dean  Adolfo Gelsi Bidart, among others.    Aguirre said Wilson Ferreira was "the most important  national  and National Party figure in the past decades." He cited  Ferreira several times in his speech when mentioning  "decentralization, the main problem the country has to solve."  He recalled that "this was the last great job" undertaken by the  late National Party leader.    Aguirre said his option is "not a third option or an  intermediate one (...). It is not a third option because in  electoral times citizens and their votes determine who is first.  It is not an intermediate option because it is not located  between other party forces. Our option is located in a space  determined by our definitions and the personality of our  candidates."    Aguirre said that during his campaign "they will not indulge  in personal attacks" or the "systematic criticism of other  parties' governments, at the national or departmental level."    He said: "No matter who wins, we will help the creation of a  coalition government with all our strength. A true coalition  supposes a political alliance to exercise government duties  based on guidelines agreed upon by coalition members and not  unilaterally imposed by the president of the Republic."    The elected candidate said his government will not be "a  copy" of the present administration, although he will continue  "its work" of "maintaining a healthy economy and fighting  inflation and the fiscal deficit" in a "distinct way and with  our own style and image," because "for us economic policy must  not be dogmatic (...) or constitute an end in itself."    During the speech that was frequently interrupted by  applause, Aguirre mentioned the topics that in his opinion will  be the main campaign issues: decentralization, education reform,  the state's role's definition, social security reform, an  analysis of the tax system and its eventual reform, and the  creation of new jobs.    Aguirre expressed support for a liberal economic policy. "We  will support liberalism, but social liberalism (...) a policy  where the state does not suffocate private initiative with  regulations, its presence, and state monopolies. A policy where  the state does not neglect the basic needs of the people or stop  giving priority attention to education, housing, and health."</p>

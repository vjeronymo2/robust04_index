This is the central  point made in a strategy paper that Research Minister Paul  Krueger presented in Bonn. In developing future priorities of  environmental research, politicians want to cooperate with  science and technology and the users of the research findings.  In Krueger's view, activities must be better coordinated to  achieve a more user-oriented environmental research. The  Christian Democratic Union politician admitted that there are  shortcomings in adjusting activities among the ministries, the  research establishments, and industry. This is due to the surge  in environmental research. Annual government subsidies,  excluding environment-oriented energy, transport, and  construction research, have been increased from 250 to 720  million German marks since 1982. Of these, 50 percent each are  used for projects and as subsidies for research organizations.    Instead of a number of small projects, pilot projects are to  be established where various fields of science will deal with  model environmental problems. Institutes shall increasingly  cooperate with science and producers or users of environmental  technologies. Germany is the world leader in environmental  research and technology, Krueger said. He mentioned sewage  treatment and waste incineration as examples. Over the past few  years, 1 million jobs were created in environmental  technology-related industries, and 21 percent of world exports  came from Germany.    In a new environmental research program for 1995 to 1999,  the  environment minister wants to set priorities in the fields of  water circulation and climate as well as environment-friendly  use of land. In addition, solutions are to be found for avoiding  problem substances as early as at the research stage and for  establishing closed circulations of substances. This way  pollution is to be avoided at the source.</p>

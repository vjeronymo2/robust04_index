Speaking at the launch of the UK Government's "Response to  Rio" documents, Mr Gummer said:    "Do we have to wait until disaster overwhelms us before we  make the radical changes necessary to protect our world for  future generations? That is the vital challenge of sustainable  development. If we act now there is much that can be saved which  will otherwise disappear forever. Yet we cannot allow our proper  concern to blind us to mankind's need to change and develop. A  society which does not grow is one which cannot satisfy some of  our basic human needs. Economic development is just as important  a concept as environmental protection, and we must find ways of  achieving both together.''    Mr Gummer outlined two new initiatives designed to stimulate  lifestyle change. He said:    "In addition to the Panel which the Prime Minister announced  today, I propose to set up a UK Round Table on Sustainable  Development. This Round Table will bring together  representatives of the main sectors and groups to discuss major  issues of sustainable development with Government Ministers.  And we must not forget the key part to be played by individuals  in developing a more sustainable world. The Government will  stimulate a new citizen's environment initiative to encourage  the growth of interest in these issues, with full consultation  with voluntary bodies, local authorities, churches and other  community groups".    Mr Gummer went on to outline the three plans launched by the  Prime Minister today as a result of commitments he made at Rio.  <H5>  He Said: </H5>   "'Sustainable Development: The UK Strategy' sets out, by  environmental resource and by economic sector, our position  today and projections of where we might be in twenty years on  current policies. It looks at the principles of sustainable  development, at the problems and opportunities which we face in  the UK and internationally, and at the processes we have, or  which we could develop, for implementing these principles and  for monitoring progress.''    "With the publication of 'Climate Change: A UK Strategy',  Britain is giving a lead in showing what can and must be done to  tackle the threat of global warming. The Climate Change  Convention places a number of obligations on countries. Chief  among these for developed countries is to take measures aimed at  returning emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000.  I believe Britain is the first country in the world to  demonstrate under the Convention how it will do this for each of  the main greenhouse gases.''    "The programme also looks ahead beyond 2000 and sets out  some  of the longer term options for action that may need to be  considered in the light of the emerging scientific evidence and  the further development of the Convention. New and difficult  choices, affecting every one of us, may have to be made if we  are to avoid the risk of altering the climate of our planet in  ways which could have serious implications for future  generations.''    "This is the first time that a UK Government has produced a  document drawing together programmes and targets for the  conservation of wildlife and habitats. The publication of  'Biodiversity: The UK Action Plan' demonstrates our commitment  to the Biodiversity Convention. The central tenet of the  Convention is that action must be taken to halt the world wide  loss of animal and plant species and genetic resources.''    "To accelerate progress, we will set up a Steering Group,  with representatives from central and local government,  agencies, collections, academic bodies and other  non-governmental organisations. This Steering Group will oversee  the development of a range of targets for biodiversity. The UK  has a real contribution to make to the richness of the world's  wildlife; this Action Plan sets out a strategy for the next 20  years, challenging us to take action now to enable our children  and future generations to enjoy the countryside and landscapes  which are the natural heritage of this country.''    "We need a sense of urgency as well as a realisation of the  need for global involvement. Urgency because time is running  out. And global involvement because without it the efforts of  individual nations will be undermined by those who refuse to  shoulder their proper burdens. The United Kingdom is determined  to make sustainable development the touchstone of its policies.  We recognise that this means a change of attitudes throughout  the nation. That change cannot be achieved overnight, but that  gives no grounds for defeatism -- it should instead act as a  spur to action. These documents are only the beginning. Year by  year we shall need to revise and refine our policies so that our  economy can grown in a way which does not cheat on our children."  <H5>  Notes for Editors </H5>   The Prime Minister made a commitment on his return from the  United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED  or the Earth Summit) held in Rio in June 1992 that the UK would  prepare a national plan on sustainable development by the end of  1993 and submit a report to the new UN Commission on Sustainable  Development. The other EC and G7 countries subsequently made a  similar commitment. These commitment follow on from Agenda 21,  the action programme agreed at UNCED, which called for national  sustainable development strategies to be adopted and for reports  on the implementation of Agenda 21 to be made to the new UN  Commission on Sustainable Development.    The most widely accepted definition of sustainable  development is that given in the report of the 1987 World  Commission on Environment and Development (the "Bruntland"  report):    "Humanity has the ability to make development sustainable -  development that meets the needs of the present without  compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own  needs."    The Strategy contains an examination of environmental media  and resources, both now and projected forwards over 20 years on  current policies (air, atmosphere, water, land, soil, minerals,  wildlife and population); a consideration of economic  development and sustainability (including transport,  agriculture, energy, business, waste development and  construction, and leisure); and a discussion on putting  sustainability into practice (ways in which different sectors of  society can contribute to achieving sustainable development,  including fundamental instruments such as science and research,  the planning system, and the three new measures for encouraging  participation and discussion on sustainable development).    The Strategy follows a year of consultation between central  government Departments, local authorities, businesses, voluntary  groups, academics, scientists and the general public in the UK.  This has included:    -- a seminar in Oxford in March 1993, with over 100  attendees  of whom around 70 were from outside central government;    -- a wide range of meetings between government officials  from  a number of Departments and representatives of other  organisations;    -- a consultation paper issued in July 1993 and sent to over  6,000 groups and individuals, to which more than 500 responses  were received.    Free summaries of the Sustainable Development Strategy are  available from Department of the Environment, PO Box 151, London  E15 2HF. The full strategy (Cm 2426) is available from HMSO  bookshops and agents, priced at (22 pounds) (ISBN  0-10-124262-x).

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Australia's banks reveal diverse results - The ripples from Westpac's property write-offs are spreading Seldom has an Australian bank reporting season produced such a diversity of results. In the space of a few days, six-month results have cast Westpac as the poor relation, ANZ as the battling improver and the National Australia Bank as a comfortable top performer. The banks' experiences with Australia's crop of failed entrepreneurs have been well-chronicled. The big banks, including the 70 per cent federal government-controlled Commonwealth Bank, were naturally the most injured by corporate failures and falling asset values. But the stock market did not begin to suspect until a few months ago that one bank out of the big four had performed substantially worse than its rivals. Its worst fears were confirmed last week when Westpac reported a thumping ADollars 2.65bn (USDollars 2bn) bad debt write-off. That pushed Westpac into the first loss in its 175-year history, a ADollars 2.3bn pre-tax deficit and forced the bank to turn to shareholders with potentially Australia's largest share issue, aimed at raising ADollars 1.2bn. Worse still, it appears the bank needs the funds to avoid falling below the Reserve Bank's prescribed capital adequacy ratios later this year when about ADollars 700m in future tax benefits can no longer be counted as assets for prudential purposes. The drama of Westpac's losses, which mainly reflected an overhaul of its extensive property portfolio, is likely to place the bank at a competitive disadvantage against its peers for some time to come. It was a drama singularly lacking from the National and ANZ earnings reports, which had a strong 'business as usual' flavour. The ANZ and the National did however appear to react to the Westpac shocks by making a point of detailing their own more modest property exposures. The ripples have spread quickly from Westpac's property write-offs, with Australia's biggest home builder Jennings Industries effectively placing itself at the mercy of its bankers earlier this week following a total write-off of its stake in a ADollars 650m Melbourne property development. Ownership of the project has reverted 100 per cent to Westpac, but the Jennings write-offs, among other factors have caused its major shareholder, New Zealand's biggest company Fletcher Challenge, to foreshadow a NZDollars 400m (USDollars 215m) property write-down in the current year. And yesterday, Australia's second biggest life office, the National Mutual, had the long-term rating of its finance company lowered from A1 to A3 by Moody's Investor Services, the US credit rating agency. 'The oversupply of commercial real estate throughout Australia will likely result in additional property write-downs, further affecting National Mutual's reserve position,' Moody's analysts said. While Westpac remains Australia's biggest bank measured by total assets, the accompanying table indicates its position is far inferior to its rivals on almost all important counts. Most notably, the bank's large ADollars 8.19bn problem loan portfolio - more than the ANZ and the National combined - poses the danger that its write-offs will remain larger for the next few years. The National's superior position has resulted largely from its ability to control its finance offshoot. The National was the only bank whose finance arm was in the black for the half-year, with its Custom Credit operation turning a ADollars 68m loss into a ADollars 6.4m profit. Finance offshoots are where much of the big banks' problems have resided. Witness Westpac's ADollars 850m capital injection into its Australian Guarantee Corporation subsidiary which lost ADollars 719m. ANZ's Esanda operation lost almost ADollars 34m.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                         HOW THE BANKS COMPARE  -------------------------------------------------------------------                               Westpac        NAB         ANZ  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Total assets at end-March   ADollars bn  ADollars bn  ADollars bn                               107.4         95.2        99.2bn                            (ADollars bn    ADollars m  ADollars m First-half net profit           1.67)      405.6       135.5                             ADollars bn    ADollars m  ADollars m Bad debt write-offs            2.65       412.6       382.6                             ADollars bn    ADollars m  Dollars bn Problem loans                  8.19         4.25        3.53 Problem loans as % of risk weighted assets       10.6          5.4         4.5 Capital adequacy ratio (%)     8.4         11.7        10.8  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

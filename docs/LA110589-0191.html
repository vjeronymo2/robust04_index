			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MOST WANTED' FELON CAUGHT IN WEST COVINA  </P> <P> A dangerous prison escapee from Massachusetts, who was recently featured on the  television show "America's Most Wanted," was captured early Saturday in a West  Covina hotel by police and the FBI.  </P> <P> Christopher Rambert, 23, was arrested without incident as he slept at the  Comfort Inn on Garvey Avenue, said FBI spokesman Jim Neilson. The fugitive was  with a woman, who was later released. A loaded semiautomatic pistol was found  in his room, Neilson said.  </P> <P> Rambert, who was serving a life sentence for rapes and other crimes, escaped  Oct. 1 from the Bridgewater Treatment Center for violent sexual criminals in  Massachusetts. Two other inmates who escaped along with him have been captured.  </P> <P> The FBI and the West Covina police were informed that the fugitive was in the  area by Massachusetts officials who said that Rambert had been seen driving a  stolen pickup truck with Georgia license plates. Officials were unable to say  whether the tip came as a result of the national exposure the case received  last month on television.  </P> <P> Deodato Arruda, spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Correction, said  that it was possible a phone call came from a viewer.  </P> <P> Rambert, who received a life sentence as a juvenile, was considered "one of the  most violent criminals in the state," Arruda said. "He has been in and out of  prison all his life."  </P></p>

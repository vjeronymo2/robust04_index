			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (AFP) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  left here Monday for a tour of Central Asian states, firmly  denying that the trip would pose any threat to Sino-Russian  ties. The tour, taking in the former Soviet republics of  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan as well as  Mongolia, will be Li's first foreign trip since heart problems  in April last year removed him from the political scene for some  six months.    "I don't think there is any negative impact for Sino-Russian  relations," Li told reporters at the Great Hall of the People  prior to his departure. "China is ready to maintain good  relations with Central Asian republics and Mongolia, and at the  same time we also hope to see the maintenance of good relations  between these countries and Russia," he said.    However, diplomats here say that China, in its bid to to set  itself up as the major power in Asia, is keen to counter Russian  influence in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).  Beijing is also anxious to ensure that political instability in  some CIS states does not spill over into neighbouring Xinjiang,  China's predominantly Muslim province in the far northwest.    "The purpose of my visit is to enhance mutual understanding,  promote cooperation and strengthen friendship," Li said, laying  special emphasis on the mutual importance of strengthening  economic links. "It is true that at present these countries are  encountering economic difficulties, but I think that these  difficulties are temporary and that they will be overcome," he  said.    Diplomats point out that China's economic boom has given  Beijing the chance to boost its influence in Central Asia at the  expense of cash-strapped Moscow.    The highlight of Li's trip to Mongolia will be the signing  of  a new friendship and cooperation treaty to replace the one  signed in 1960, when China was essentially a Russian puppet. "I  hope that through my visit the two sides will further promote  and extend trade and economic cooperation," Li said, adding that  that more than 1,000 kilometer (600-mile) Sino-Mongolian  frontier should become a "border of friendship."    During Li's absence, Vice-Premier in charge of the economy  Zhu Rongji will take the role of acting premier.</p>

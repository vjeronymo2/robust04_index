			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Falling prices hit Thyssen Stahl Losses at Thyssen Stahl, Germany's largest steelmaker, quadrupled in the year to September, to DM1.23bn (Dollars 703m). The company blamed declining steel prices and falling domestic orders. Turnover for the year fell by 15 per cent, to DM10.6bn. The company said the fall in steel prices accounted for DM500m of its losses. Weak demand, especially from the automotive industry, also contributed to the company's heavy losses, with deliveries decreasing by 10 per cent for the fiscal year. Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman, said he did not expect marked improvements in 1994, as domestic demand is expected to remain weak. However, he said the company's drastic cost-cutting measures should allow it to return to the black in the 1994-1995 financial year. Turnover for the first quarter of the year continued to fall, dropping 7 per cent to DM2.5bn against the same period the previous year. Crude steel production stood at 2.4m tonnes in the first quarter, an 11 per cent increase over the previous year. Thyssen Stahl's total crude steel production in 1993 stood at 8.3m tonnes. 'We expect the coming year to remain as unsatisfactory as the year before,' Mr Schulz said. 'But we think that the bottom has been reached, and that business will at least not deteriorate further. A pick-up in demand for steel products cannot, however, be expected before the second half of 1994.' Meanwhile, he said Thyssen Stahl had no alternative but to continue laying off workers to cut costs and reduces losses. The company announced earlier this week an additional 1,250 workers would go by the year end. A two-year restructuring programme already plans to axe 30 per cent of its 40,000 workforce by October 1994. Mr Schulz said the restructuring programme would allow for productivity increases of between 4 and 5 per cent in coming years. Restructuring measures have also included the merging of the company's steel and special steel divisions, which took effect at the beginning of the 1992-1993 business year. Economies of scale are also expected in the divisions producing tin plates and non-corrosive steels, which are due to be merged with Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's second-largest steelmaker.</p>

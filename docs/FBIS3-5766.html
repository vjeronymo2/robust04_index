The permission was granted on condition that they close  their  existing representative offices in the nation, the ministry said.    When the insurance companies obtain approval from the  government after completing the procedure of investment by  foreigners, they will be able to establish agents who are  allowed to sell policies issued by domestic insurance companies.    The agents are required to conclude contracts with domestic  insurance companies to sell policies on their behalf. But the  agents are not allowed to sell policies issued by foreign  insurance companies, the ministry said.</p>

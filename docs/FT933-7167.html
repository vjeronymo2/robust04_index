			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / UN tries to open way to Mostar for aid convoys UNITED Nations officials yesterday were trying to persuade besieging Bosnian Croat forces to let through convoys carrying food to tens of thousands of Moslems trapped in Mostar, in southwestern Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the Bosnian Croat army, has prevented relief supplies reaching some 55,000 people in the east of the city who have little food and water. Eleven lorries were waiting yesterday for HVO clearance to deliver 120 tonnes of food. Conditions in the area were described as 'alarming' by Miss Lyndall Sachs of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, who added that people could starve within five days. In order to gain access to the heavily damaged eastern part of Mostar, relief officials said they would have to give an equal amount of aid to the mainly Croat inhabitants of the western side of the city. One HVO official told BBC Radio that UN aid would be allowed into the town tomorrow, but only if Moslems laid down their arms and let aid reach some 190,000 Croats cut off in central Bosnia. Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday appealed in a letter to the UN Security Council for urgent help in order to avert a 'true catastrophe' in Mostar. His parliament was due to meet on Friday to consider a compromise plan to divide Bosnia put forward by the international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg. In an apparent sign that parliament might reject the proposal, Radio Sarajevo yesterday broadcast statements from officials of several Bosnian towns opposing it. Mr Izetbegovic has already said he could not 'recommend' acceptance. For their part, Bosnia's Croat and Serb leaders have welcomed the proposal, calling it a compromise which could end the 17-month war. Under the plan Serbs would get about 54 per cent of Bosnia, Croats about 17.5 per cent, while 28 per cent would be reserved for the Moslems. The latter were the biggest pre-war ethnic group, comprising 44 per cent of the 4.35m population. Reporting to the Security Council yesterday, Mr Stoltenberg warned that without a negotiated settlement soon the war would intensify and expand 'with severe consequences'. Next winter, he said 'could be an utter nightmare'. In Zagreb, site of the UN headquarters in the former Yugoslavia, Mr Kofi Annan, UN undersecretary for peacekeeping operations, yesterday met officials of countries which have supplied peacekeeping troops. A UN spokesman there refused to say whether Mr Annan was seeking commitments to increase contributions if a settlement were agreed in Bosnia. Mr Stoltenberg has said the plan would require about 40,000 troops. In the third such resignation this month, a US State Department specialist on eastern Europe resigned yesterday, saying he could not carry out US policy on the former Yugoslavia, Reuter reports from Washington.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: FATHER'S STORY MAY HOLD GRAIN OF TRUTH  </P> <P> Question: My father told the story about four Prevatte brothers who left  England and came to America, landing at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts.  </P> <P> He claimed that two brothers went to Lumberton, N.C., one to Waycross, Ga., and  one to St. Augustine, Fla. He also said his grandfather did not like the e on  Prevatte and paid the court $10 to drop it.  </P> <P> From what I've picked up over the years I believe the Prevatte family was  French Huguenot. Can you point me in the right direction to research my family?  </P> <P> Answer: The name as you spell it does not appear in early New England records  that I consulted, throwing some doubt on the family story of landing at  Plymouth Rock. Possibly the name originally was Privett, Privette or Privott,  in which case it is English, meaning one who came from Privett (copse of  privet, an ornamental shrub) in Hampshire.  </P> <P> However, many family traditions claim their name's spelling was officially  changed, when it fact it was done informally.  </P> <P> The best thing to do is begin your research in censuses, marriage, probate and  land records in the states and counties where your ancestors lived and trace  them backward, generation by generation, until you find the immigrant. You'll  find your name has been spelled many ways in the records, but pay attention to  how the name was spelled when signatures of your ancestors were required.  </P> <P> Start at your local library by reading any of the several good, basic how-to  books on genealogy -- "Shaking Your Family Tree" by Dr. Ralph Crandall is one  of the best.  </P> <P> Q: My ancestor, Heinrich (John Henry) Anderson, emigrated from Baden-Baden,  Germany, in 1870 when he was 14 to New York. According to the 1910 Hugo  (Choctaw County), Okla., census, he became a naturalized citizen upon his  arrival in New York. How can I obtain a copy of his naturalization papers?  </P> <P> A: The 1910 census asked the "year of immigration" and whether one was  "naturalized or alien," so your ancestor may have arrived in New York in 1870  but was not likely naturalized that year as residency requirement was five  years at that time.  </P> <P> If you can determine where your ancestor was living between 1870-1877, that  would be the logical place where he filed a declaration. Aliens could go before  any court of record and declare their intent to become a citizen after they had  resided in the United States for at least three years.  </P> <P> The county courthouse in the vicinity of an immigrant's residence is the best  place to begin. The LDS (Mormon) Family History Library in Salt Lake City has  filmed many naturalization records -- check its card catalogue in a branch  library near you to learn if the records you need have been microfilmed.  </P> <P> For more tips on how to locate naturalization records, read the chapter on  "Tracking Immigrant Origins" in "The Source," edited by Arlene Eakle and Johni  Cerny.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS AND BRIEFS;  </P> <P> AIR TRAFFIC IN EUROPE FACES CROWDED SKIES  </P> <P> A "radical reorganization" of the way in which Western Europe manages its air  space is "urgent and essential" if the region's air transport system is not to  be brought to a near standstill in the late 1990s because of congestion,  according to a report released this month.  </P> <P> The study, commissioned by the International Air Transport Assn., said the  number of airline passengers carried each year in Europe will almost double,  from 267 million in 1988 to 500 million by the year 2000. By 2010 that figure  could reach 740 million.  </P> <P> The IATA report called for a unified Europe-wide air traffic control system  instead of the 22 or 23 systems operating now, as well as reorganization of air  corridors, expansion of airports and other changes.  </P> <P> Unless improvements are made, 16 of 27 major airports in Western Europe will  not be able to meet forecast demand by the year 2000, the study predicted.  These airports, in order of worst potential problems, are: Madrid, Frankfurt,  London Gatwick, London Heathrow, Barcelona, Milan Linate, Duesseldorf, Dublin,  Stockholm Arlanda, Athens, Palma de Majorca, Geneva, Manchester, Marseilles,  Copenhagen and Hamburg.  </P> <P> Luxury rail travel is being offered between Los Angeles and the San Francisco  Bay Area on board the privately owned California Sun Express double-decker dome  cars of Amtrak's Coast Starlight trains.  </P> <P> The new service operates daily between Los Angeles and Oakland. Organized  sightseeing tours with an overnight stay at San Luis Obispo and Morro Bay are  also available.  </P> <P> The upper level on each of the cars seats 64 passengers in upholstered seats  with brass handrails, oak tables and plush carpeting. All passengers have seats  in the full-length upper dome, with unobstructed 360-degree views.  </P> <P> The lower level features a 22-seat dining salon with white linens, imported  china, French stemware and silver flatware. All meals are prepared from scratch  by a chef in the stainless steel electric kitchen. Brunch and dinner, featuring  a California-style menu, are served on the train.  </P> <P> The one-way fare between Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo is $99.50; from Los  Angeles to Oakland without a stopover, the one-way fare is $179. Two-day,  one-night packages are available starting at $379.  </P> <P> For more information, contact Princess Railtours, 2815 2nd Ave., Suite 400,  Seattle, Wash. 98121, toll-free (800) 835-8907.  </P> <P> Parisians and visitors to the city in a few years will be able to ride the  "boa."  </P> <P> Transport officials in Paris this month unveiled the Metro of the future, a  46-meter experimental prototype that will start test runs in June.  </P> <P> The new train has none of the old separations between cars but, like its  namesake the boa constrictor, is one long, continuous train that can hold up to  890 passengers -- 5% more than those now in use.  </P> <P> If tests prove successful, the city will order enough to replace the current  1,400 metro trains between the years 1998 and 2010, when the present cars will  average 30 years old.  </P> <P> A California company's proposed "Third World in America" tour has tourism  promoters in Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky hopping mad.  </P> <P> For $500, Global Exchange of San Francisco, a nonprofit research ands action  center specializing in "awareness" tours to such countries as Haiti, the  Dominican Republic, South Africa and Brazil, will take participants on an  excursion through Appalachia June 17-25 to see impoverished families, crumbling  coal mining towns and appliance-strewn streams.  </P> <P> "I suggest that those folks could save a lot of money and get a great dose of  Third World reality simply by walking through the barrio in Los Angeles," West  Virginia Commerce Commissioner John Brown said.  </P> <P> "If you're looking for poverty and environmental problems, yes, you can find  them in our three states," said Cindy Ford, spokeswoman for the Nashville  Chamber of Commerce. "But I don't think we have any more problems than any  other state.  </P> <P> "If they want to visit West Virginia, they can come for the white-water rafting  or to visit one of our state parks. It might be a chance for them to breathe  clean air."  </P> <P> Ironically, the criticisms have actually helped promote the tour, with Good  Morning America, Cable Network News and several major newspapers calling for  more information.  </P> <P> According to Laurie Adams, tour coordinator for Global Exchange, the name of  the tour alone "raised some flags" among people who have a stereotypical view  of the Third World.  </P> <P> "We've been really surprised at the response," she said. "It (the Appalachia  tour) is just one aspect of the program we have, which is to meet with people  in different countries and different communities and share ideas on (such  matters as) the environment, unemployment, women's issues and so on."  </P> <P> Global Exchange's programs are intended to be educational and to help break  through stereotypes and prejudices, she said.  </P></p>

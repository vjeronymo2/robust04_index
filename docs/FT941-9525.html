			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Turkish currency crisis takes toll in car industry Turkey's two largest car manufacturers yesterday announced lay-offs and production cuts following a sharp drop in sales, in the first signs of the fallout from the recent currency crisis. The sales slowdown follows a month of money market turbulence, and reflects more costly consumer credit. The government has raised interest rates to bolster the currency after a 12 per cent devaluation. Turkey's economy grew by 8 per cent last year, but with output now expected to fall across a range of sectors, growth forecasts for this year are being cut sharply. Tofas, the local subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, confirmed plans to cut output by 33 per cent, by reducing factory shifts and sending 2,500 workers home on compulsory leave. The French-Turkish venture, Oyak Renault, is to shut its Bursa plant for a week. Tofas, with 25 per cent of the market, reported a 30 per cent fall in sales in January. The company is cutting output to reduce costly stock levels. Tofas raised car prices twice in January by a total of 20 per cent in response to the devaluation. Union officials warned yesterday that a sustained slowdown could result in large-scale job shedding. In 1993, the car sector was one of the star performers with production up 33 per cent in 1993 and demand fuelled by easy credit terms. However the recent currency crisis is particularly painful for an industry investing an estimated Dollars 1bn (Pounds 684m) to introduce new lines to prepare for the competition which will follow the customs union with the European Union. In Turkey last week, Sir Leon Brittan, the EU commissioner, urged the government to introduce a stabilisation package, warning that without improvements in the economy, Turkey would not benefit from a customs union. The customs union is currently set to be implemented in 1995. However the latest crisis could derail the timetable. Turkish car producers are already calling for a five-year reprieve of the deadline, according to a recent study by Mckinseys, the US management consultants.</p>

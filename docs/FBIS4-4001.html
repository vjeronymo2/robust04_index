			<p>BFN     [Text] Ningbo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. expedition  arrived in Xiangshan County, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province,  yesterday in search of the wreckage of an American Air Force  B-25 bomber that crashed 52 years ago.    The 19-strong expedition, headed by Bryan Moon, former vice-  president of the Northwest Airline Company of the United States,  includes divers, pilots, photographers and other members.    Commanded by General Doolittle, a squadron of U.S. bombers  launched America's first air strike during World War Two on  Tokyo on April 18, 1942.    The bombers were scheduled to land at the airport in Quzhou,  Zhejiang Province, but lost contact with the airport while  returning from their mission.    The airmen had to abandon their planes by parachute after  they ran out of fuel.    It has been verified that six bombers crashed in Zhejiang  Province and that 27 airmen were rescued by local residents and  returned home, while three died.    The bombers were believed to have crashed in the sea off  Zhejiang Province or in its mountains, with the exception of the  No. 15 bomber.    Griffith Williams, a co-navigator of the No. 15 bomber, one  of the airmen who survived the crash, recalled that the bomber  floated for about eight minutes on the sea before sinking, just  giving the crew time to get into their inflatable life-boat.    Later, the pilot of the bomber was rescued by Zhao Xiaobao,  wife of a local fisherman. Zhao provided the pilot with food,  shelter and clothing, and hid him to avoid search by Japanese  soldiers.    In March 1993, the Chinese Government agreed to Bryan Moon's  request that his expedition enter islands off-limits in Zhejiang  to search for the wreckage of the bomber.    During the expedition Moon and his assistants enlisted help  from Zhao Xiaobao's family. Zhao's son, a fisherman, took Moon  to where he netted an aluminum plate.    Moon found that the place where the plate was found was  identical with that where the bomber sank, as shown by Williams  on a map.    In September 1993 the Chinese Government agreed to Moon's  request that a Sino-American joint expedition be organized in  search of the wreckage of the bomber.    Henry Potter, 76, a pilot in the squadron commanded by  General Doolittle, is one of the members of the joint  expedition, which is set to begin operations off Tantoushan  Island in Xiangshan County.    He said that to search for the wreckage of the sunken bomber  is his long-cherished wish.    If the wreckage is found, that would be the happiest thing  in  his life, said Potter, who was rescued by Zhejiang rural  residents 52 years ago.    "Without the help of the Chinese people, I would not have  been what I am today," he said.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (4): When Daimler is ill - Regional focus / Baden-Wurttemberg BADEN-WURTTEMBERG in the south-west of Germany has traditionally been the Land with the highest income in Germany, the lowest unemployment, the highest innovation and a greater proportion of exports than Germany as a whole. But Baden-Wurttemberg's fortunes have turned since the beginning of the German recession in the second half of last year. Far from proving resilient to the downturn, it has turned out to be more vulnerable than the country as a whole. Within a year unemployment has risen from 4.6 to 6.7 per cent and in the first six months of the current year the state's GDP fell by 4 per cent compared with a downturn of 2.6 per cent for western Germany. This sudden swing reflects the fact that Baden-Wurttemberg's former strengths have become weaknesses. The Land is dominated by 'old' industries such as machine-tool manufacturing, the automobile sector and its suppliers, areas of the economy which are particularly badly hit in the current downturn. Baden-Wurttemberg used to export more than the average for western Germany - now its manufacturers are suffering from the double impact of a strong currency and a decline in world demand for investment goods. Another former strength which has evolved into a weakness is the predominance of family-owned businesses, the so-called 'Mittelstand' of small to medium-sized companies which constitutes the backbone of the regional economy. Baden-Wurtemmberg prides itself on being the home of the so-called 'Tuftler', the person who refuses to stop trying to solve apparently unsolvable problems. Combine this technical bent with a fierce streak of independence and you have the classic Swabian Mittelstandler (Swabia is the former Wurttemberg in the eastern part of the state). Of course Baden-Wurttemberg is home to some of the giants of German industry  -for example Daimler-Benz and Bosch. Less big but just as famous is the Porsche luxury car company. Even these large and well-known enterprises grew from Mittelstand roots: they were founded by technically-minded entrepreneurs such as Claudius Dornier, Gottlieb Daimler, Carl Benz, Ferdinand Porsche or Robert Bosch - all typical 'Tuftlers'. The bigger companies have traditionally shared the Mittelstand ethos - 'a unique combination of the traditional and the innovative' as researchers from the University of Wales College of Cardiff recently described it (*). Clustered around Stuttgart, in towns such as Ludwigsburg, Boblingen, Sindelfingen, Esslingen and Gopingen , smaller companies have prospered from supplying their larger neighbours. But when Daimler sneezes, the state of Baden-Wurttemberg catches a cold. Gripped by a massive recession in the European car industry, Daimler has more than sneezed - it is suffering from a form of corporate double pneumonia. It has reacted by chopping its workforce (in 1992-94 the group will shed 60,000 jobs) and putting pressure on its suppliers. The prognosis for Mittelstand suppliers to Daimler and to Volkswagen, the other beleaguered giant of the German automobile industry, is bleak. In a recent study, the accountancy firm Price Waterhouse predicts that only 500 out of the 3,000 German components suppliers will survive the current shake-out. The outlook for the machinery manufacturing sector is hardly brighter. Baden-Wurttemberg has the largest number of machine-building and tool-making firms, employees and per capita turnover anywhere in Germany, with 43 per cent of the firms based in and around Stuttgart. Orders for the sector are down by 70 per cent from three years ago, reflecting the disappearance of traditional export markets in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere in eastern Europe as well as world recession and the strength of the D-mark. The result is that manufacturers are obliged to join forces in order to survive. For example Friedrich Deckel and Maho, two of Germany's best-known machine-tool manufacturers which between them have 40 per cent of the German market in milling and boring machines, have merged outright. Others have embarked on cooperation strategies which bring an end to individual companies' highly-prized independence. This would have been unthinkable even two years ago. So what does the future hold for Standort Baden-Wurttemberg? Will it be able to regain its status as a 'Musterlandle' - the model little Land of the local dialect? Or will it sink further into difficulties? Pessimists point to the region's heavy dependence on old-fashioned manufacturing industry and a comparative lack of service sector businesses. Optimists herald the virtues of the hard-working, highly educated workforce, the adaptability and resilience of the state's entrepreneurs, and the matchless educational and scientific infrastructure (nine universities, 23 polytechnics, three large-scale research facilities, 11 Max Planck Institutes, 14 Fraunhofer Society facilities  ....and so on). In Baden-Wurttemberg as in the rest of Germany, companies have responded to the recession by cutting costs. This is reflected in the climbing unemployment statistics and in the decision of numerous companies - starting with Daimler-Benz itself - to establish cheaper production locations abroad. For all its enviable tradition as a manufacturing centre, Baden-Wurttemberg will have to fight hard for its future. *The Future of the Mittelstand: Collaboration versus Competition, by Philip Cooke, Kevin Morgan and Adam Price: A Regional Industrial report from the Department of City &amp; Regional Planning, University of Wales College of Cardiff, PO Box 906.

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Management: Streetwise in the inner city - Poor urban areas pose special problems for businesses, and managers will need new skills if they are to meet the challenge An international company decides to open a subsidiary in a country where it has had no previous presence. The expatriate manager has no experience in the country, does not speak the language and has no knowledge of the local culture or way of doing business. Daft? Not as daft as a domestic company which opens an outlet in an inner city with an ethnically-diverse population and then appoints a manager from the suburbs to run it without the right training or experience, says Joanna Howard, research director at Roffey Park Management Centre*. Howard is conducting research into the skills needed by inner city managers. She argues that urban renewal programmes conducted by government agencies, local industry and community associations in many of Britain's worst-affected inner cities are undertaken without proper consideration of the skills needed to run the initiatives. The characteristics of these urban areas - broad cultural mix, pockets of gentrification, housing difficulties, dense population and a high potential for the entrepreneurial spirit - impose distinct demands on managers, regardless of their business. 'It's in inner cities that our major black communities live, and other communities with rich and different cultural backgrounds,' she says. 'The model of management that relies on everyone working from the same cultural assumptions may well fall down in this kind of setting. The manager who pays attention to 'what matters here' at an everyday, as well as at a deeper, level has a better chance of succeeding.' This may mean being able to manage large numbers of part-time and casual workers, or being aware of how the experience of long-term poverty, unemployment or racial harassment affects people. Being more sensitive to the safety and security of employees is one example. 'Simple things like putting lighting in company car parks or arranging transport for your female managers if they work late will do wonders for your staff turnover,' says one personnel manager. The security of employees is a particular problem for Colin Allies, district general manager of British Gas in Southwark, a south London borough with a high crime rate in its many high-rise housing estates. Maintenance engineers are now accompanied by less-skilled colleagues and meter inspectors are equipped with radios. Both measures were introduced following the establishment of working parties between management and staff to consider safety issues. Allies says teamwork and employee communication are particularly important in inner city settings. 'I'm not saying they aren't important in other parts of the country,' he says. 'However the need to use these skills more effectively is more acute in areas where there is this high ethnic tension and distrust between communities.' Much the same could be said of involvement in community projects. Community work is generally regarded as good corporate behaviour, but the networks it provides for managers in inner city communities could be vital in attracting and retaining good staff. Managers might also gain a greater understanding of the local demand for their organisations' services or products or the need for special credit or loan arrangements. Philip Morris was manager of the Brixton branch of the Marks and Spencer clothing and food chain when riots erupted in the south London borough in 1981. He found his involvement in community affairs played a critical role in maintaining the standing of the company locally. 'During the turmoil, people turned to M and S as an oasis of calm. They felt safe inside our doors. It really drove home how important it is for businesses to take an interest in the people around them. I still feel a sense of pride in the fact that the M and S name I placed on the 'We're backing Brixton' sign over the railway bridge is still up there after 10 years.' Employee recruitment, training and appraisal are another challenge. Corning Glass in the US, for example, introduced reforms to their personnel policies in the wake of internal surveys that suggested female and black employees were leaving the company at twice the rate of their white male counterparts. The reforms included weeding out hidden biases in selection and appraisal procedures and introducing workshops to give employees a chance to air their concerns. The team responsible for improving the opportunities for black workers went further, working with local chambers of commerce to persuade grocery stores to place black hair products on their shelves and talking local TV stations into adding black entertainment programmes to the line up. 'Corning's example shows how important it is for inner city managers to think outside their immediate mindset and see how employment policies need to be linked to reforms in the local culture, networks and amenities,' says Beatrice Young, founder of the culture change practice of Harbridge House, the US consultancy that has pioneered human resources strategies. 'This requires lateral thinking on a scale that would not be needed in other environmental circumstances,' she says. lain Vallance, British Telecom's chairman, recently said the ability of UK industry to trade profitably in inner cities depended 'very considerably' on the health of the local community. 'If that health is adversely affected by deprivation, crime, vandalism, racial tension, inner city decay, homelessness or pollution, so too is our own business health. Our opportunities are reduced, our problems increase, our costs rise,' he said. The scale of inner city regeneration in Britain means that companies need more managers who understand other cultures. But Howard argues that inner city workers rarely win promotion to middle management. The question facing employers is how to support and foster inner city managers who can 'match' the organisational culture of middle and senior management with the values that make them effective in their work. It means, says Howard, 'helping a person value what they bring to their role as managers because of their differing background, rather than in spite of it.' *Roffey Park Management College.

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FILM PROMOTER PLEADS NO CONTEST IN SEX CASE  </P> <P> Dale Normand, accused by two teenage girls of sexual misconduct after promising  them movie roles, pleaded no contest Wednesday to one misdemeanor count of  having unlawful sex with a minor.  </P> <P> Normand, 35, entered the plea before Superior Court Judge Andrew Wagner, who  set an Oct. 4 sentencing date, said Normand's attorney, Robert Grimes.  </P> <P> Normand, who was facing multiple criminal counts, agreed to a plea bargain on a  single charge and could receive up to one year in County Jail and a $1,000  fine. The remaining counts were dismissed, and he remains free on bond.  </P> <P> The criminal charges against Normand were brought by a Michigan teen-ager who  was 17 when he invited her to San Diego last year to appear in a movie. The  girl said Normand, who had an office in Mission Valley, promised her modeling  jobs in addition to the movie role. She told local authorities that Normand had  sex with her.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain said the charge of unlawful sex was brought  against Normand because the young woman was a minor at the time.  </P> <P> Last August, an 18-year-old San Carlos woman obtained a restraining order  against Normand, and in court documents alleged that "he used lies and  deception to have sex with me." However, no charges were brought against him in  this case.  </P> <P> Both teen-agers said they were hired by Normand to appear in a movie and  eventually moved in with him.  </P> <P> San Diego vice officers began investigating Normand in April, 1988, when they  received several complaints about Normand from parents and young women. Lt. Dan  Johnson, head of the department's vice unit, said the complaints arose during a  talent search conducted by Normand and involved girls as young as 16.  </P> <P> In a 1988 interview, Normand said he was making a spy thriller that would  feature a group of young, "beautiful female Rambos" who were "articulate and  sophisticated." During the interview he acknowledged that he had no previous  movie-making experience.  </P></p>

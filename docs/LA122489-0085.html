			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAST NORIEGA TROOPS SURRENDER;  </P> <P> PANAMA: BUT SOME VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS CONTINUES. ENDARA BEGINS TO ORGANIZE  HIS GOVERNMENT.  </P> <P> The last organized military support for deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A.  Noriega collapsed Saturday, and Panama's new U.S.-approved leaders began  efforts to form and run an actual government.  </P> <P> According to European diplomats involved in the negotiations, the garrisons at  five important provincial capitals have pledged their allegiance to the  constitution and the new government sworn in after thousands of American troops  invaded early Wednesday.  </P> <P> However, it was clear that the optimism caused by the surrenders and the  announcement of army reorganization had not brought all violence in the nation  to an end.  </P> <P> Shots continued to ring out in Panama City on Saturday night, and there were no  reports of sizable surrenders, captures or suppression of the so-called Dignity  Battalions, paramilitary units formed by Noriega last year to terrorize his  political opposition.  </P> <P> Noriega remained at large.  </P> <P> The vast majority of the estimated 15,000 officers and enlisted men of the old  Panama Defense Forces, commonly called the PDF, agreed to give their allegiance  to the new, U.S.-installed civilian government and to restore order in their  areas. But small numbers refused.  </P> <P> Both the diplomatic sources and Panamanian military officers say the newly  loyal troops already are searching for members of Dignity Battalions and others  still supporting Noriega, once the "maximum leader of Panama."  </P> <P> The agreements were reached between the five unit commanders and Vice President  Ricardo Arias Calderon and U.S. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of the U.S. Army  South, which is based at Ft. Clayton near the Panama Canal.  </P> <P> The diplomats said that the Roman Catholic Church mediated the pact and will  act as its guarantor, particularly concerning a pledge by Cisneros not to  attack or otherwise molest the Panamanian forces.  </P> <P> "The PDF wasn't so much against the new government," said one European  diplomat, "as it was afraid of the American forces. Once it was clear the  Americans wouldn't attack them, they were willing to support the new leaders."  </P> <P> Particularly important was the surrender of the garrison in the city of David  in the northern jungle province of Chiriqui, considered a Noriega stronghold  and the likely place for him to hide and direct any anti-U.S. guerrilla action.  </P> <P> Interestingly, the unit commander, Col. Luis A. del Cid, is one of those who  was indicted, along with Noriega, in a U.S. federal court in Florida on drug  trafficking charges.  </P> <P> Del Cid told a news conference Saturday in David that he only wanted assurances  of fair treatment and already had begun operations against irregular forces in  the jungle. No one would discuss the possibility of his extradition to the  United States on the drug charges, a major concern in the case of Noriega.  </P> <P> The other units switching are in Santiago, Los Santos, Boca del Toro and  Chitre.  </P> <P> In spite of this generally optimistic turn, and in the face of misleading  assurances Friday afternoon by Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, commander of the U.S.  Southern Command here, that there had been no battles in the previous 24 hours  in Panama City, other American officers and eyewitnesses reported constant  fire-fights between the invading army and resisting Panamanian units.  </P> <P> Mortar Attacks  </P> <P> American troops Saturday morning launched several mortars against forces of the  Dignity Battalions entrenched in a jungle preserve on the edge of Ft. Clayton,  which is about six miles from the Panama City limits.  </P> <P> U.S. units also came under fire early during the day near the U.S. Embassy and  the residence of American Ambassador Arthur Davis. Residents of Via Espana, a  well-to-do neighborhood, watched as Dignity Battalion members exchanged gunfire  with a hovering U.S. helicopter gunship.  </P> <P> The fighting has caused the deaths of 25 American soldiers and the wounding of  238, with one still missing. On the Panamanian side, at least 139 PDF members  have died in action, 95 are reported wounded and 2,250 have been captured.  </P> <P> Gen. Thurman said in a news conference that 15,500 weapons have been seized by  his troops.  </P> <P> Further weakening Noriega's ability to carry out a sustained resistance was the  surrender Saturday of the so-called Palace Guard, a PDF unit that protected the  presidential residence and offices in downtown Panama City.  </P> <P> The building was occupied by U.S. troops in the afternoon.  </P> <P> And to prevent the military institution that was the Panama Defense Forces from  reconstituting itself as a danger to his government, President Endara on  Saturday announced the official dismantling of the PDF, which was the nation's  sole military, police and security organization before its defeat by the  Americans.  </P> <P> He said it would be replaced by a smaller organization called the Public Forces  of Panama and will be limited essentially to police and other public order  functions.  </P> <P> Force Reduction  </P> <P> The new organization ultimately will be reduced in size to about 3,500,  according to diplomatic sources, and will be headed by Col. Roberto Armijo, a  troop commander in the old PDF.  </P> <P> Guillermo (Billy) Ford, the second of Panama's two vice presidents, said in an  interview that Armijo was not associated with the corruption, violence and  mismanagement of the PDF. "He was the senior officer among the decent officers"  in the old military, Ford said.  </P> <P> The second in command is another controversial ex-PDF officer, Col. Eduardo  Herrera Hassan. He was dismissed by Noriega in 1987, allegedly because his  popularity among the rank and file was a challenge to the dictator.  </P> <P> Hassan was brought back to the PDF in 1988 to head special corps of riot troops  called the Dobermans to suppress rising anti-Noriega civil unrest. Although he  succeeded in that mission with bloody efficiency, Hassan was again fired and  has been living in Miami.  </P> <P> Ford insisted that for the first time since the American invasion and the  resulting anarchy, looting and vandalism have eased.  </P> <P> Indeed, travels Saturday through Panama City neighborhoods from the almost  unbelievably poor sections of the inner city to the opulent areas of Altos de  Gulf showed that at least in daylight people were behaving civilly.  </P> <P> But the shattered store windows, the burned-out buildings, the hulks of wrecked  vehicles blocking intersections and the stomach-turning smell of smoldering  debris were all reminders of the utter chaos and lawlessness that have ruled  the streets since the American invasion.  </P> <P> No accurate figures are available, but prominent businessmen said the damage  will run in the tens of millions of dollars.  </P> <P> Street Interviews  </P> <P> It was unclear from interviews with people on the streets whether law and order  were being restored -- there were occasional American military patrols seen and  some U.S. soldiers guarded key intersections and food stores -- or that there  was simply nothing left to loot.  </P> <P> Gen. Thurman emphasized that many Panamanians had been awaiting the arrival of  the American troops and had welcomed them. Moreover, he said, in many cases  they had identified members of the Dignity Battalions so that U.S. troops could  capture them.  </P> <P> Saturday saw the evident spontaneous creation of pro-government vigilante  groups in the streets, armed men who established barricades and were actively  seeking out Dignity Battalion members.  </P> <P> Ironically, American military patrols were disarming the vigilantes but not  replacing them in any strength. The leader of one vigilante group that captured  four Noriega followers and found three machine guns in the trunk of their car  said he called the U.S. military and was promised an immediate patrol. Six  hours later, no American personnel had arrived.  </P> <P> The existing danger also was underlined by the new government's refusal to  publicly identify the members of the new Cabinet appointed to administer  affairs of state. "We can't announce them because of security reasons," Vice  President Ford said.  </P> <P> Careful Handling  </P> <P> Although Endara, Arias Calderon and Ford have been extreme critics of Noriega  and overwhelmingly defeated the general's handpicked candidate in last May's  presidential election, they are handling the matter of his military followers  as if it were a fragile egg.  </P> <P> "We're screening (the military) for loyalty," Ford said, "and the loyal and  decent military will remain." But even those culled will not be punished, the  vice president said.  </P> <P> "There will be no revenge against the military who fought against the takeover.  They will not be shot, jailed nor persecuted. But they will be required to lay  down their arms," he added.  </P> <P> He even indicated a sense of mercy for the usually despised Dignity Battalions,  members of which nearly beat him to death with iron bars last May.  </P> <P> "We don't want repression nor reprisals," Ford said. "But we have to have them  turn in their weapons."  </P> <P> Times Washington Bureau Chief Jack Nelson contributed to this story.  </P> <P> U.S. Sees Long Pull  </P> <P> U.S. forces face "weeks and months" in Panama.

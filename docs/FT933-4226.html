			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Blenheim drops The recession in continental Europe lay behind a sharp fall in the share price of Blenheim, the conference and exhibitions organiser, which dropped 43 to 355p, a two-year low. Blenheim announced an 18 per cent rise in first-half profits to Pounds 15.4m, but the company generates much of its profits from France. It said yesterday: 'There have been some signs of revival in the economies of the US and UK but those of France and Germany have continued to deteriorate.' The statement upset a number of analysts' forecasts, and Blenheim's broker BZW cut its 1994 prediction by Pounds 11m to Pounds 43m. Reed International, which is also heavily exposed to European exhibitions, fell 11 to 700p.</p>

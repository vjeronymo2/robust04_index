			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO HOLDS OFF PESKY PASADENA, 74-71  </P> <P> The last time El Camino played Pasadena, Warrior forward Zlatco Josic had a bad  foot. Coach Ron McClurkin said shortly before that game that his team wouldn't  have bothered making the trip for the South Coast Conference opener if Josic  couldn't play.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Josic, the Warriors' second-leading scorer, missed the first half  because he had the flu, but the 6-foot-5 sophomore sealed the Warriors' 74-71  victory over Pasadena with a pair of free throws and ended the night with eight  points.  </P> <P> The victory secured first place for El Camino (19-6, 4-1) in the SCC and kept  Pasadena (15-5, 3-2) in second.  </P> <P> "It was the most important win ever," said an emotional Josic after the game.  "God, we knew we had to win this one."  </P> <P> With 37 seconds left in the game, El Camino trailed 70-71. Then Van Myers stole  the ball and passed it to Kevin Mixon, who drove the lane for a layup. That  made the score 72-71 in favor of El Camino.  </P> <P> Then, with eight seconds left, Josic went to the line and sank both free  throws.  </P> <P> "We're back in first place now," McClurkin said, "and fortunately we don't have  to see those guys again."  </P> <P> The first time the two clubs met this season, El Camino walked away with a  12-point vicotry. But this time an eager and determined Pasadena team was not  about to let that happen.  </P> <P> Neither team dominated the first half. The Warriors scored seven unanswered  points in less than a minute but couldn't hold on to the lead.  </P> <P> Pasadena tied the game with 3:44 left in the half when Jeff Samuel grabbed his  own rebound and converted it into two points. The Lancers trailed by only one  at the break, 39-38.  </P> <P> So the Warriors' earlier run, which put them up, 22-16, with 9:26 remaining in  the half, didn't do much lasting good. The streak started with David Keeter's  jump shot, followed by Kelvin Harris' breakaway dunk and Keeter's 3-point shot.  </P> <P> Keeter, a 6-foot-4 freshman forward, led the Warriors with 21 points and Myers  added 13. Mixon, the team's leading scorer, was limited to eight points.  </P> <P> The No. 9 Warriors, who have lost their only SCC game to Long Beach, will  travel to Mt.San Antonio College on Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "Iraqi </F> Cooperation and U.S. Hostility"]    [Text] The international community represented by the UN  Security Council is expected to declare that Iraq has fulfilled  all its obligations under Resolution 687 and that it is  essential to implement Clause 22 of the resolution permitting  Iraq to export its oil, now that Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN  Special Commission [UNSCOM], has submitted his report in which  he affirmed Iraq's full cooperation with the commission and  fulfillment of all of its obligations. However, it seems that  the United States is waging a fierce campaign through its  secretary of state, Warren Christopher, to block the  international community's will and continue the unjust blockade  against Iraq.    The Chinese representative to the Security Council has  called  on the Council to recognize the very positive developments  represented by Iraq's implementation of the resolutions. He  proposed passing a resolution on a partial lifting of the  blockade. The Russian representative also spoke about the need  to give Iraq the chance for further cooperation. For his part,  the British representative admitted that progress is taking  place and that the report which Ekeus submitted to the Council  two days ago was encouraging.    According to political observers, China, France, and Russia  are exerting pressure toward lifting the blockade for  "humanitarian and commercial" reasons. If we also add the  British admission that Iraq is cooperating with the Security  Council, it becomes clear that the United States has been left  alone and is completely isolated. The international community  is surrounding it from all sides to make it lift the unfair  blockade on Iraq.    A quick review of what has happened, recalls to memory the  odious hostility which has characterized U.S. policy.  Washington has secured resolutions from the Security Council to  impose a blockade on Iraq and to carry out its criminal military  aggression. It has done all that in the name of the  international community and international legitimacy. And now  that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations under Resolution 687 and  approved permanent monitoring under Resolution 715 and now that  Rolf Ekeus has acknowledged Iraq's full cooperation with UNSCOM,  Washington cannot continue resisting the will of the  international community, refusing to implement Clause 22 of  Resolution 687 and calling "for the need to continue the  blockade against Iraq." This U.S. double standard has been  exposed. It must be said that the international community  cannot continue forever following this reckless U.S. policy.  The international community is inclined toward adopting a  rational policy that acknowledges the interests of its nations,  including those of Iraq, and takes into consideration the  question of international peace and stability.    The world understands that Iraq is the difficult figure in  the region and that it is essential to deal with it with  rationality, consideration, and good will. Any form of  aggression or threat of aggression against Iraq will be useless.  Iraq is strong by its symbol leader Saddam Husayn, its brave  people, its experience, and great history.    In view of all that, it must be said that the United States  must adopt a different policy toward Iraq, taking into  consideration the will of the international community and the  lessons of past experiences. Armies and fleets will not scare  Iraq, and the blockade will not weaken its will.    Warren Christopher will see how the blockade will be  defeated  and how the will of good forces -- the will of Iraq and the  freedom and peace-loving peoples -- will triumph.</p>

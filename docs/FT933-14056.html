			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japanese prepare ction on fabrics JAPANESE cotton spinners have begun to collect information for an anti-dumping action against Chinese cotton fabric exporters, creating potential embarrassment for the Japanese government, which has condemned the use of anti-dumping measures to protect markets. The Japan Spinners' Association indicated yesterday that a formal complaint will be filed with the Tokyo government within months, as Chinese makers are selling fabrics for shirts and sheets at 30-40 per cent less than the Japanese-made product. Japanese spinners say the cheap materials are damaging their industry, but they have not yet shown evidence that Chinese producers are doing more than take advantage of cheaper raw materials and production facilities. In January the Japanese government imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese exporters of ferrosilicon manganese, used by the steel industry. Japan's imports of clothing from China rose 17.5 per cent in the first half, compared to the equivalent period of 1992, but one cause of the greater penetration is a flurry of Japanese joint ventures in China.</p>

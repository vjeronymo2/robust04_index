			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Inspec pays Dollars 17.3m for US foam maker Inspec Group, the speciality chemicals company which came to the market earlier this year, yesterday announced plans to expand in North America with the Dollars 17.3m (Pounds 11m) acquisition of Imitech, the US foam manufacturer. The deal, the first since Inspec's Pounds 49.5m flotation in March, will be funded from cash reserves and new borrowing facilities totalling Dollars 17.5m. 'It will increase turnover by about 14 per cent and boost the level of earnings,' said Mr Jim Ratcliffe, managing director. Although the acquisition will push gearing beyond 100 per cent on net borrowings of Pounds 18m, Mr Ratcliffe said strong cash generation would ensure interest cover of at least 12 times. Imitech, a subsidiary of Albemarle, the US chemicals business, claims to be the only global producer of polyimide foam, used mostly in insulating naval vessels and aircraft fuselages. In the 12 months to last December it made pre-exceptional operating profits of Dollars 2.7m on sales of Dollars 15.2m. The deal follows five months of talks with Albemarle - the former speciality chemicals arm of Ethyl - which first came to Inspec's attention as a supplier to Allco, its US speciality acids business.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by DELOVOY MIR correspondent Nikolay Seregin under </F> the rubric "Details": "Russian Export-Import Bank Created"]    [Text] We have already reported on the creation of  Roseximbank [Russian Export-Import Bank]. This is a state bank,  in which the controlling share of stock belongs to state  structures. Roseximbank has been set up in the form of a  privately held joint-stock company with charter capital of 51  billion rubles. Its stockholders are the Central Bank, the  Federal Property Fund, the Bank for Foreign Trade, and the  foreign trade associations Tekhnopromeksport, Tekhstroyeksport,  Machinoeksport, and Selkhozpromeksport. According to Viktor  Shilin, deputy minister of foreign economic relations, who  became the bank's chairman of the board, the need for its  creation became evident as much as a year ago; however, the road  from the idea's conception to its implementation proved long.  The main task of the new bank is to extend credit to Russian  producers of machinery and technical products and stimulate  exports. Statistical data show that the share of machinery and  equipment in the total volume of exports continues to decline.  At the same time there has been and still is a stable demand for  many varieties of domestically produced machine-building and  technical products in foreign markets. Quite often, however,  producers find themselves in a situation of being simply unable  to tend to production, since its financing through commercial  banks, given the current rate of inflation, is becoming simply  impossible. The Roseximbank will finance real export contracts  and, judging by all signs, the terms for producers will be very  favorable. At the same time the Roseximbank will insure export  credits. In the opinion of the Roseximbank president, the new  financial structure will occupy its own, quite well-defined,  niche and will not compete with other banks.</p>

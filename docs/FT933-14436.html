			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Medco confirms merger talks with drugs groups A REALIGNMENT of drug distribution in the US, giving pharmaceutical companies greater control over sales to their biggest buyers, could be under way following news of merger talks involving one of the country's largest distributors. Medco Containment Services, a fast-growing mail-order supplier, said it was in talks with several pharmaceutical companies which could lead to strategic relationships, partnerships, joint ventures or business combination. Mr Martin Wygod, chairman and chief executive, said the statement was prompted by a report yesterday that Medco had been in talks about a Dollars 4.5bn merger with Merck, the largest US drugs company. Merck's recently-appointed president, Mr Richard Markham, resigned unexpectedly on Friday. Medco supplies pharmaceuticals to the employees of many of the largest US companies, including General Motors and General Electric, under their company health plans. The company is the largest mail order company for pharmaceuticals in the US and last year controlled more than half of the US mail order market, worth about Dollars 3.8bn a year. Its closest competitor, Baxter Prescriptions, a division of Baxter International, has about 10 per cent of the market. Medco represents 1,550 companies and public agencies, covering 33m employees and by buying in bulk it claims to achieve discounts from pharmaceutical companies of between 20 per cent and 40 per cent. Mr Wygod estimated that it would account for drug purchases worth Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn this year, or 12 per cent of drug sales in the US. He refused to comment on whether Medco had been in talks with Merck, or whether a tie-up with one pharmaceutical company was the most likely outcome. 'We're trying to make the right types of relationships with manufacturers to help cut back healthcare bills,' he said. However, consultants questioned the strategy of pharmaceuticals companies buying their customers. 'This makes little sense. If Merck acquired Medco, they would be buying only 2 per cent of the non-hospital market at a huge cost,' said Mr Eran Broshy, head of the Boston Consulting Group's healthcare practice. The growth of bulk buying by Medco and other institutional purchasers of pharmaceuticals has contributed to pressure on drug companies' profits, and put control of distribution into the hands of a group of intermediaries who have grown up between the drug companies and the users of their products. A tie-up with a distributor such as Medco would give a company greater control over sales of its drugs. However, Medco's relationships with its customers could suffer if it became a sales channel for the products of one company. Medco, based in Montvale, New Jersey, had achieved compound sales growth of more than 35 per cent a year in the past eight years, said Mr Wygod. In early trading, its shares rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/4 but slipped to Dollars 30 1/8 by the close.</p>

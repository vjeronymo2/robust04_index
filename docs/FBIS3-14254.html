Addressing a darbar [meeting]  of the Punjab Regiment in Mardan today, the prime minister said  we do not cherish aggressive designs against anyone. However,  we cannot remain oblivious to our defense which will be  strengthened within our limited resources. Our neighbors must  not dream to establish hegemony because we can neither be  provoked nor submit, she said, adding the people of Jammu and  Kashmir must be given the right of self-determination and the  Kashmir issue should be solved in a manner that it leads to  laying a solid foundation for peace in the region. A  neighboring country is dreaming to bring us under its hegemony,  she said, adding we will not be cowed down by anybody.    Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the government is making every  endeavor for the welfare of the people. The task is stupendous  and the problems are many, which need cooperation from every  segment of society. She said the prime objective before the  political parties should be to ensure that the country is put on  the road to progress and prosperity and its image enhanced in  the community of nations. She, therefore, appealed to the  people, including political leaders, ulema [religious scholars],  and students to cooperate with the government in its efforts to  solve socioeconomic problems.    The prime minister commended the Punjab Regiment for its  glorious services and said the martyrs of the regiment have  carved out a prominent place in the nation's history by having  laid down their lives in the defense of the motherland. On this  occasion, the prime minister announced a grant of 8 million  rupees for various welfare projects being carried out by the  regiment. Governor of Punjab retired Lieutenant General  Mohammad Iqbal Khan, Governor of NWFP [North-West Frontier  Province] retired Major Gen. Khurshid Ali Khan, Defense Minister  Mr. Aftab Shaban Mirani, Chief of Army Staff Gen. Abdul Waheed,  and other high civil and military officials were present on the  occasion.    Earlier, the colonel commandant of the Punjab Regimental  Center, Lt. Gen. Nasir Akhtar, and Commandant of the center  Brigadier Qamar Zaman, in their speeches, gave a resume of the  regiment's historic achievements and its role both in times of  peace and war.

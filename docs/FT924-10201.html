			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Three copier suppliers face suspension of credit licences THE OFFICE of Fair Trading will this week be asked to revoke the consumer credit licences of three companies offering controversial 'copy plan' schemes to users of office photocopier machines. Similar action is expected against other companies. The use of copy plans, under which the capital cost of photocopying equipment is merged with the running costs to produce a charge-per-copy agreement, is coming under increasing scrutiny following customer complaints about alleged misrepresentation. Customers allege that high-pressure sales techniques have misled them into signing contracts with a life well in excess of that of the equipment and which conceal several onerous and unfair conditions. Some of the leasing companies offering copy plans are owned by leading banks and institutions. which could be embarrassed if the activities of any of their subsidiary operations were subject to OFT action. On Wednesday, members of the Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts, and Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, will tell the OFT that sufficient evidence has been assembled to justify the withdrawal of consumer credit licences from three companies. They will also offer to compile evidence of alleged contract abuse against several other leasing specialists. The campaign, started earlier this year by companies claiming to have been misled into signing expensive copy plan agreements, says it has received nearly 2,300 complaints. It is demanding a two-week cooling-off period to enable customers to cancel agreements, and wants changes in the law to extend to companies and other organisations the same protection available to individuals under the consumer credit acts. A campaign spokesman said yesterday: 'The photocopier industry is trying to suggest that the abuses surrounding copy plan contracts have been stamped out. Our evidence suggests the contrary and we will keep up pressure to ensure malpractice is identified and stopped.' The OFT, which is discussing the copy plan with the Department of Trade and Industry, has warned that it will revoke the consumer credit licences of photocopier leasing companies if contract malpractice is confirmed.

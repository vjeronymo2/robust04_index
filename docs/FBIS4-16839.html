			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation  from the post of Japanese prime minister and the expected  formation of a new government in the near future will not lead  to changes in Tokyo's policies toward Russia. This was clearly  stated by the Japanese ambassador in Moscow, Koji Watanabe, in  an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "Policy  toward Russia is one of the most important elements of Japanese  diplomacy," he stressed.    The ambassador said that the Tokyo declaration, adopted by  the leaders of the two countries during the visit by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin to Japan last October had created "a new  basis for further progress in Russo-Japanese relations." The  diplomat said that "the continuation of constant efforts to  develop relations, on the basis of this declaration, is the  consistent and immutable policy of our country."    Koji Watanabe recalled that during the visit to Moscow last  month by Tsutomu Hata, Japan's deputy prime minister and foreign  minister -- who is regarded as the principal contender for the  post of head of the new government -- the parties agreed to  advance steadily toward a settlement of the territorial problem,  based on the Tokyo declaration. The Russian side stressed its  commitment to the policy of deepening reform, and the Japanese  side emphasized that there would be no change in its policy of  assisting these reforms.    The ambassador indirectly confirmed that the change in the  Japanese cabinet would not remove from the agenda the question  of a visit to Russia by the Japanese prime minister this year.  He recalled that the invitation to make the visit, which  Yeltsin conveyed to the Japanese prime minister last October,  was confirmed by Viktor Chernomyrdin, the head of the Russian  government, and Andrey Kozyrev, the foreign minister, during  their recent meetings with Hata. "I think that when Japan has a  new prime minister, a specific date for his visit to Russia will  be agreed along diplomatic channels," the ambassador said.    ITAR-TASS has learned from diplomatic sources that the  Japanese premier's visit to Moscow this year may be preceded by  a visit to Tokyo by Andrey Kozyrev in order to prepare for the  summit meeting.</p>

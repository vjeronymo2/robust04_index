			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["uj"-signed report: "The Nourishment of Children in </F> Socially Weak Families Is Very Poor"]    [Text] Bratislava -- Since the first wave of food price  increases in 1991, in the wake of the liberalization of prices,  milk consumption in Slovakia has declined 12.7 percent.    According to data of the Research Institute of Nutrition  (VUV), which monitored in this period the state of nourishment  of the population in economically high-risk regions [ekonomicky  rizikove regiony] (Orava, Kysuce), the daily consumption of milk  should be at least half a liter. The consumption of dairy  products has declined here 17.3 percent, consumption of cheese  13.3 percent, and consumption of fish more than 20 percent. The  consumption of fruit has declined 19 percent in these regions  and vegetable consumption as much as 22.1 percent. According to  A. Bederova, MD, head of the Epidemiology Department,  surprisingly negative findings have been ascertained with regard  to children and youth from poorer regions. The deteriorated  spectrum of fat substances in blood is alarming. The high level  of cholesterol in the blood of school-age children and  adolescents has gone up from 15-17 percent to 22-29 percent. The  number of obese children has gone up by 2 to 6 percent. Almost  one in three adolescents had a reduced level of selen (an  important protective substance against tumorous diseases). The  intake of calcium has declined 51 percent and intake of vitamin  C 61 percent.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Arts: In and out of love - Radio YESTERDAY was St. Valentine's Day, though the Vatican no longer regards him (whoever he is) as a saint. He is at least the authorised patron of February 14, as each network conceded in its way. Radio 2's Gloria Hanniford dealt with him in her afternoon programme, and in the evening there was a programme of 'anti-love songs', Not Saint Valentine. On Tuesday (St. Saturninus) Radio 4 told of the odd gifts given to celebrate Friday in My Funny Valentine. Anti-love was the feeling in Radio 3's tribute too, also on Tuesday, John Clifford's The Price of Everything. This traces an affair from pick-up to fade-out, the talk between Jill (Hetty Baynes) and Harry (Timothy Spall) given a contrapuntal commentary by Cupid (Harold Innocent). Perhaps this casting was itself an anti-love comment, for Innocent, despite his talent and his surname, is not easy to think of in that part, especially with that dialogue. The romance begins in a dance-hall ('I just want to talk') and is pursued via a pub, a restaurant, a cinema, a hotel bedroom, to ultimate disillusion (though there is talk of 'beginning again'). Jill denies being a tart, she just wants to be paid for her time and her talk. Everything women do costs money; she works out her dance-hall allure at Pounds 288. What men do costs money too; Harry says he is a City man, a successful dealer in futures, but proves to be something very much less. The play is as wise as it is funny, and was very well done under Marilyn Imrie's direction. The first of the Radio 4 Debates was not quite so wise nor so funny. The motion was that 'The House of Lords is an anachronism and should not continue in its present form,' a proposition unlikely to engender much novel thought, even debated by Their Lordships. Lord Mishcon, proposing, reminded us that the House was a reforming, a revising chamber; he asked if it were really in touch, and was the hereditary principle justified: everyday ideas. Lady Seear, seconding, called more excitingly for a radical constitutional reform, with chambers for Scotland and Wales, and a senate, all elected by PR. Lord St. John of Fawsley, opposing, insisted that the House actually works, much hard work was done in revision; no party dominated; heredity offered youth. Lord Allen of Abbeydale reminded us that that the Lords initiated some worthwhile Bills, such as the Charities Bill. From the floor there were denigrations of other nations' second chambers, praise for cross-benchers, sneers for backwoodsmen. Yet the motion was defeated by 39 to 34. Tomorrow, 'The only way to save the planet is for the West to adopt a lower standard of living.' The Chairman is Brian Redhead, who also wakes us up in Today at 6.30, and is presenting a good ten-part series on the progress of the Church, Protestors for Paradise. On Thursday, Radio 4 began a new series of Soundtrack, in which events are made to sound as if overheard, though behaviour is seldom quite spontaneous when recorded in stereo. In The Road to Barlad, well-intentioned but inexperienced folk decided to visit Romania and give some help - painting, plumbing, goods, a few songs with the guitar. Work was indeed done, toilets repaired, shoes distributed to thousands of children, who were trained to cry 'Yes, please, Eddie]' when asked if they would like a song. But mere good intentions were not enough. There was friction among the party; and the inevitable irrelevance of child-adoption came up. 'We now know what's to be done,' someone said at the end. Lovely people as they were, they should have known before they set off. A new series of Words on Radio 3, by Naomi Lightman, began with five minutes on the word 'extra-mural'. Though in its way it decribes the programme, it's hardly interesting enough to entice listeners to hear Lightman's subsequent talks, examining varieties of the word 'tourism'.</p>

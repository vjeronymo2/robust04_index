			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh arrived in Tehran  yesterday at the head of a high-level delegation and was  received by our country's officials. In the course of this  visit, the first by a Vietnamese president to Tehran, bilateral  relations, regional and international issues are to be discussed.    Vietnam is one of the southeastern countries and it has a  population of 70 million and rich, abundant resources. This  country has endured two major crises; that is, a war with the  United States and its 19-year-long embargo, as well as intense  differences with the PRC on Cambodia. Hanoi has now entered a  new phase of reconstruction since the Cold War has ended and the  nature of its international relations has metamorphosed from  military to economic one.    Vietnam's basic strategy is to strengthen its reconstruction  process by favoring regional cooperation. That is why the Hanoi  government's declared program is to base its foreign policy on  broadening and expanding international relations. Regional and  neighboring countries are given special preference in this  regard.    The Islamic Republic of Iran has certain similar  characteristics, as Iran inherited a prolonged period of  backwardness, which is a remnant of the previous regime. The  Iranian nation also initiated extensive struggles against U.S.  intervention in Iran's internal affairs and continues to do so.  Similarly, Iran fought an eight-year-long war with an  aggressor, Iraq, which resulted in immense loss of life and  property for Iran.    Now that Iran has put these crises behind it, effective  steps  have been taken for the country's reconstruction and the basic  strategy is to carry out this reconstruction successfully with  the assistance and cooperation of friendly countries. Thus,  tasting the bitterness of foreign intervention, enduring an  unjust war, being in the orbit of the developing countries of  the south, embarking on basic reconstruction, and favoring  regional closeness, are the common denominators which motivate  these two countries to adopt a joint strategy.    Most important of all, Iran and Vietnam are at that juncture  of their development when their cooperation can address most of  their respective needs. Vietnam has a developing economy and in  the opinion of political and economic analysts, this country  needs a foreign investment of $12 to $15 billion to boost its  economic and industrial structure in order to reach an  eight-percent level of growth by the year 2000.    Iran can have effective cooperation with Vietnam in the  field  of investment, and in particular, in gas and oil. In addition,  in view of its proximity to the Central Asian countries, Iran  can play an important role in the transit of Vietnamese products  to those republics. Reciprocally, Vietnam can prove of benefit  to Iran by the transfer of its technological experience in  various fields, especially in agriculture and industry.    However, it appears that despite the actual and potential  capability of the two countries and the broadening of their  political relations, the volume of their exchanges is not very  satisfactory. Therefore, Iran and Vietnam should expand their  joint economic commissions and sign trade accords especially on  a quid pro quo basis, and thus take effective steps to improve  their relations.</p>

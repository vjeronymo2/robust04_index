			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / PM hits at Euro-critics and rejects referendum MR JOHN MAJOR confronted his Euro-sceptic critics in the Tory party yesterday with a strong defence of the Maastricht treaty and a blunt rejection of their calls for a British referendum. The prime minister's support for a Yes vote in the French referendum on September 20 came as the British EC presidency started work on a list of options to persuade the Danish electorate to reverse its rejection of the agreement on European Union. Those options may include a British-style escape clause from monetary union and qualification of the treaty's defence and social provisions, as well as attempts to define closely the powers of Brussels through the concept of 'subsidiarity' - devolving decisions back to national level. In a speech to a London conference billed as a centrepiece of the British presidency, Mr Major said the path for Europe mapped out by the Maastricht treaty would not submerge the national identities of member states. His comments brought an angry reaction from Tory Euro-sceptics, who renewed their demand for a referendum, but won praise from Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the strongly pro-European Liberal Democrats. Mr William Cash, a leading sceptic on the Tory backbenches, said it was a 'disgrace' that there would be no British referendum. Mr Michael Spicer, another anti-Maastricht campaigner, accused Mr Major of becoming 'increasingly out of touch with what the people want on this matter'. Recognising that the British bill to ratify Maastricht would have a 'bruising passage' through the House of Commons, Mr Major acknowledged the anxieties of those who feared that the EC would 'ride roughshod' over national identities. But he dismissed the 'phantom' of a centralised superstate conjured up by Euro-sceptics. He said: 'The reality is that no nation's identity will ever be lost. Whatever happens in the Community, the French will be no less French, the Germans no less German, the Danes no less Danish and - I promise you - the British no less British.' Maastricht was part of a larger EC agenda which included completion of the single market, enlargement and closer political co-operation in responding to crises such as that in the former Yugoslavia. Nor was the treaty - the result of a series of tough compromises - perfect. But in setting out a vision of Europe designed to undercut the arguments of Lady Thatcher, his predecessor, Mr Major declared that the treaty represented a 'vitally important step in a new direction for the Community'. Its provision for intergovernmental co-operation outside the Treaty of Rome had reversed the centralism of previous agreements: 'It is the key to progress . . . . a turning point'. If France or Denmark could not ratify the treaty it would be dead. But the pressures for closer co-operation would not go away: 'We shall work in ever closer union not because the Treaty of Rome tells us to but because the Treaty of Rome describes what it is in our interests to do'. If the French vote Yes, Mr Major plans to meet Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, in London at the end of the month.

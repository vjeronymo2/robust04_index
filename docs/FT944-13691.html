			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (2): Statistics gap delays plans - Western groups see opportunities in Russia When the mayor of Tursunzade fired several pistol shots at the general manager of Tajikistan's aluminium smelter, the news ricocheted around the global industry. For the Tursunzade smelter is one of the world's biggest, and its output was already falling because of civil warfare and shortages of raw materials and electricity. For Mr Mikhail Sinani, the man sent from Russia with a team of technicians to help the Tajiks keep this vital source of foreign earnings up and running, the murder attempt was the last straw. Even though the smelter is now being protected by Russian paratroopers, Mr Sinani decided not to return to Tajikstan when his holiday in Russia ended recently. Tursunzade's mayor, Mr Ibodullah Boymatov, had asked for a large consignment of aluminium for delivery to a foreign trader, but did not have proper documentation. When Mr Sinani refused to provide the metal, the mayor pulled out his pistol. Some local reports suggest that Mr Sinani returned his fire. Fortunately, neither man was hurt but the damage to the future of the smelter - the largest single enterprise in the southernmost former Soviet republic - is incalculable. Without Russian help the smelter's output, already down to only 252,000 tonnes in 1993 compared with its annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes, is expected to fall steeply - some informed estimates suggest to only 100,000 tonnes. Whether the former Soviet Union industry will ever supply more than 'informed estimates' remains to be seen. Soviet aluminium production statistics were a state secret for so long that even a reformed Russia seems reluctant to give them. 'Now that Russia is being absorbed into the global aluminium industry, we are desperately trying to get some statistics, some facts, that will let us get on with some proper planning,' one senior western executive complained recently. Russia has agreed to supply production and export statistics to the International Primary Aluminium Institute, the London-based organisation which collects data for the western producers. However, the Institute is still waiting for the go-ahead by for a fact-finding visit to the Russian smelters to collect necessary background information. Western executives complain that, since the Russian smelters were privatised, the situation has become even more chaotic. The central authorities have no control - and no statistics - while anyone wanting to do deals with the smelters has no clear idea who to talk to. The chaos is amply illustrated by the present situation surrounding Krasnoyarsk, Russia's second-largest smelter. Pechiney, Europe's biggest aluminium group, announced in July that it had won Russian government support for a scheme to modernise gradually the Siberian aluminium smelters  -Krasnoyarsk, Bratsk and Novokuznetsk - which between them account for about half of Russia's aluminium production capacity, but are among the world's heaviest polluters. Mr Bernard Legrand, head of Pechiney's aluminium activities, said that a start would be made at Krasnoyarsk with a 'module' of 250,000 tonnes of annual capacity to replace outdated existing equipment. Arranging finance for this, an estimated USDollars 400m to Dollars 500m, and completing detailed engineering studies would take 18 months to two years, and construction another two years. But at the same time Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium producer, has been talking to the Krasnoyarsk smelter management. According to local sources, Alcoa wants to join forces with the hydro-electric company that supplies Krasnoyarsk, to take over the entire plant and its production. Similar ideas are being mulled over by Russian investment companies which, together with western aluminium producers (Alussuise is rumoured to be among them), might soon be putting them to the Krasnoyarsk management and the Russian government. In the meantime, Trans-World Metals, a London-based international trading company which has been the biggest supplier of raw materials to Krasnoyarsk and possibly its biggest customer for aluminium for export, is protecting its commercial interest. Trans-World has organised consortia to acquire large shareholdings, at least one-third, in Krasnoyarsk and three other Russian smelters. The position of trading houses like Trans-World is less secure following a recent international trade agreement between some of the big aluminium-producing nations which promised funds to help modernise the Russian industry - and reduce its dreadful pollution - if it joined in a worldwide cut in production. But all this jockeying for position suggests that some western aluminium groups see a unique opportunity to move in to a potentially huge new market. Russia's smelters are being gradually absorbed into the global aluminium industry. The Russian smelters that survive can also be expected to become more like their western rivals and develop downstream fabricating operations, because Russia eventually will consume more of its own aluminium. Mr Horst Peters, managing director of VAW Aluminium-Technologie, the German group that is helping the Novokuznetsk smelter to modernise, suggests that this battle for ownership of the smelters is one of the most important issues in Russia today. 'It is a question of who will supply the raw materials and who will take the metal in future.' However, in the meantime, says Mr Peters, the physical condition of some of the smelters is deteriorating rapidly. Consequently production will be down by 10 to 15 per cent this year from the 1993 level, not because of the trade agreement but because equipment is breaking and not being repaired. Russian production is therefore likely to be about 2.5m tonnes compared with the industry capacity of about 3.3m. One third of the former Soviet Union's 3.6m tonnes of aluminium-smelting capacity could be expected to disappear in the next five years, driven out of production by high costs and obsolete equipment, according to Mr Peters. He pointed out that, if they are to meet present Russian emission standards, Russia's aluminium smelters needed total investment of USDollars 3.5bn. Money for this purpose was presently not available in the former Soviet Union, nor in the western financial markets, Mr Peters insisted. So those smelters not worth modernising will be phased out. He suggests that some heavily-polluting smelters could be modernised gradually. This could be financed out of cash flows and some help from international financial institutions or export credits. Mr Peters insists that the Russian smelters are no longer low-cost producers. They are having to pay world prices for alumina (an intermediate material), and electricity and transport costs have been rising rapidly - including the cost of security to protect the valuable metal on its travels over vast distances. 'Some smelters say that, if they paid all their bills they would be bankrupt.' The projected fall in output should have the effect of stabilising Russia's aluminium exports, Mr Peters suggests, because 'domestic demand is at rock-bottom.' Aluminium sales in Russia, which fell to only 600,000 tonnes in 1993, are now running below an annual rate of 400,000 tonnes. Yet there is demand for aluminium products there - for example, all the aluminium windows needed for the damaged parliament building in Moscow were imported from the west.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Yugoslav army re-enters fighting in Bosnia THE Yugoslav army re-joined the war in Bosnia at the weekend, shelling Moslem forces in Bosnia after they had fired across the border into Serbia, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. It was the first time the army has acknowledged involvement since May 19 when Bosnia formally withdrew from the republic. The artillery exchange coincided with fierce clashes around Skelani, a village on the Bosnia-Serbia frontier. Peace talks are due to resume in Geneva this week. A UN relief convoy finally arrived yesterday at the besieged Moslem enclave of Zepa, where inhabitants are reported to be dying from starvation and cold, Reuter adds. Right: surrounded by new grave markers in a Sarajevo cemetery yesterday, a woman mourns a dead relative.</p>

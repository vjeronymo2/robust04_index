			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA CENTER ZIMMERMAN MIGHT NEED SURGERY ON KNEE  </P> <P> The UCLA basketball team, which already has lost Ed O'Bannon to a season-ending  knee injury, is also concerned about freshman Rodney Zimmerman, Coach Jim  Harrick said Sunday.  </P> <P> Zimmerman, a 6-foot-9 center from Colorado Springs, Colo., is suffering from  tendinitis in his right knee and could face arthroscopic surgery, or even major  surgery, trainer Tony Spino said.  </P> <P> Zimmerman's knee has locked on him twice, the first time during a drill on the  first day of practice Oct. 15.  </P> <P> Tests have revealed no damage, but Harrick said that exploratory surgery has  been recommended. Both Harrick and Zimmerman, however, prefer to wait.  </P> <P> Zimmerman has not practiced since Tuesday. He will be held out for at least  another three days, Harrick said, and probably will not play Thursday night in  the Bruins' annual intra-squad game at Pauley Pavilion.  </P> <P> A decision on possible surgery will be made next week.  </P> <P> Spino said that in 20 years as a trainer he had never seen a more acute case of  patella tendinitis. "I took care of Bill Walton when he was here, and Bill was  never that bad," Spino said.  </P> <P> If surgery were to be required on the patella, Spino said, Zimmerman would be  sidelined for about 4 1/2 months. If the problem is the meniscus, Spino said,  the cartilage could be repaired arthroscopically and Zimmerman would be  sidelined for only about three or four weeks.  </P> <P> Of the more serious procedure, Harrick said: "We're not going to do that this  year unless -- well, I really shouldn't say we're not going to do that. I guess  it's up in the air."  </P> <P> UCLA opens the season against UC Irvine in the first round of the Great Alaska  Shootout Nov. 23 at Anchorage, Alaska.  </P></p>

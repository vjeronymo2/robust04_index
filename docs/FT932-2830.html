			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Phone numbers may be for life THE introduction of 9bn new telephone numbers in 1995 will open a variety of intriguing possibilities for phone users, it was announced yesterday. The new numbers will become available when the digit '1' is inserted after the initial zero for all UK area codes. One possibility arising from this is that it may soon be possible to buy a 'phone number for life', according to draft plans unveiled by Oftel, the telecommunications industry regulator. With advanced network technology, such personal numbering could enable telephone calls and faxes to be routed to wherever the user happens to be. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said personal numbering was 'a very exciting development' for which the 'intelligent networks' technology exists. It could also be used for purposes such as giving members of families a personal ringing tone on household telephones. 'You could even have singing and shouting phones', said Oftel's technical director. 'Personal numbering services are developing quickly in the United States,' says Oftel's consultation paper. 'They are likely to commence shortly in the UK and become an area of rapid growth.' British Telecommunications played down the idea, saying the investment required on its 6,000 exchanges would be 'enormous'. 'It's like saying we can build Concorde - but how many people can actually fly in it?' the company said. Oftel's consultation paper covers the 9bn telephone numbers that will be available for allocation after the national code change in April 1995. Oftel is proposing to open only 3bn numbers for immediate allocation. Unallocated numbers will be kept in reserve. Only 26m numbers are currently in operation, but restrictions imposed by codes mean the network is close to saturation in parts of the country.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                     PROPOSED NEW PHONE NUMBERS  ------------------------------------------------------------------ 01   Existing codes with extra 1 after initial 0. eg BT's      headquarters number 071 356 5000 would be 0171 356 5000 02   To be used for national codes in addition to 01 03   Mobile services 07   Personal numbering 08   Specially tariffed services 00   International calls  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Oftel  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

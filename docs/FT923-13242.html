			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / US consumer prices increase moderately in June US consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 per cent in June, the government said yesterday, providing new evidence that the sluggish economy is keeping inflation in check, Reuter reports from Washington. The government also said retail sales rose 0.5 per cent last month, almost entirely because of a surge in new-car sales. The Labour Department said the increase in prices at the retail level compared with a 0.1 per cent gain in May. Last month's rise reflected a jump in the cost of energy, partly offset by falling prices for clothing and other goods. The increase in sales followed a revised gain of 0.4 per cent in May, the Commerce Department said. But excluding cars, sales barely rose 0.1 per cent in June after a 0.2 per cent gain in May, suggesting consumers remain cautious about making large purchases. A sustained pick-up in consumer spending is considered vital for a broad recovery in the US economy as purchases of goods and services fuel about two-thirds of economic activity.</p>

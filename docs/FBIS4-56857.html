			<p>BFN     [Text] Superintendent General Publio Fretes Fernandez,  retired -- head of the National Narcotics Directorate (Dinar) --  has stated that Paraguay urgently needs a law to stop money  laundering because drug money is being actively laundered in  Paraguay. He announced that a bill will be submitted to  Congress soon. "Money is being laundered on a regular basis in  Paraguay. There is no other explanation for the ease with which  so many people mysteriously invest money in our country," Fretes  said. The high-ranking police officer explained that there is  abundant and obvious evidence that a lot of money from doubtful  sources openly circulates in Paraguay.    He added: "You can see the high-rise buildings, stadiums,  and  amphitheaters that have sprouted like mushrooms after rain in  Asuncion and its suburbs. A lot of money is involved, a lot of  investments."    He explained: "Even though Dinar does not have a law on  which  to act, it investigates to the extent possible. It would be  impossible for those involved to identify any legal source for  their capital. These are reliable signs that drug money is  laundered in Paraguay."    The chief of Dinar added that since he took over the Police  Investigative Department, he has noticed the swift and easy  "circulation" of large amount of cash. "At the airport we  frequently find people bringing in or taking out $800,000 or  $900,000. Asked about the source of this money, they merely say  it was taken it out of a bank. We can do nothing because we  have no law to back us up. These money amounts are bound to  draw attention," the police officer explained when talking about  the clues available to the drug enforcement police. Fretes  added that his organization, which is under the jurisdiction of  the National Antinarcotics Secretariat (Senad), is drawing up a  bill which it will submit to Congress in due time.</p>

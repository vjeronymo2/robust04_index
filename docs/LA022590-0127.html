			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIEN'S RESIGNATION AS UCI VICE CHANCELLOR  </P> <P> Tien, we hardly knew you! No sooner did Dr. Chang-Lin Tien arrive at UCI as our  executive vice chancellor (1 1/2 years ago) than he will be leaving to become  chancellor at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> I do not expect Dr. Tien to say no to Berkeley's invitation, but I am worried  that the momentum and spirit of progressive change at UCI will end.  </P> <P> For a while UCI seemed to have taken a step forward; I just hope we do not now  see it take two steps backward!  </P> <P> If UCI wants to be a great research university, it should aggressively continue  ensuring that the curriculum reflects not only Western perspectives, but also  Eastern and Third World views. Also, steps toward the democratization of  student affairs should be taken. I am especially concerned that we will see a  decline in American Indians, African-Americans, Chicanos and Latinos among our  student body, faculty and administrators. These ethnic groups are the most  severely under-represented in higher education, particularly at UCI.  </P> <P> Jack Peltason would be wise to instruct his selection committee for Tien's  replacement to affirmatively recruit minority candidates for UCI's No. 2  position. Concerned students will be watching and hope that the campus  administration will, for a change, seek our involvement in the selection of our  leadership.  </P> <P> ALVARO NUNEZ  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

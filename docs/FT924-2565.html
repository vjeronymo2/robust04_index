			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Continued pressure on metals from CIS exports expected PRICES OF the main traded metals in 1993 would continue to be held down by exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States but they would move up slightly from present depressed levels, suggested Mr Thomas Baack, chief economist at Metallgesellschaft, the German mining and metals group, yesterday. Production and consumption of the main traded metals in the west would be roughly in balance next year, but CIS exports would cause a supply surplus. 'At the moment there are no prospects of an improvement in this respect,' he said. Even so, most present metals prices were 'unsustainably low.' Introducing MG's annual 'state of the non-ferrous metal markets' report, Mr Baack said western aluminium and nickel producers - worst affected by the CIS exports - needed to shut down much more production capacity to compensate. He doubted whether Norilsk Nikel, which produces about 80 per cent of the CIS nickel, would carry out its undertaking to cut production next year. Mr Baack pointed out that CIS copper exports were likely to rise by 100,000 tonnes to 500,000 tonnes this year but net imports from the former eastern bloc countries would not change because China would probably import 100,000 tonnes. In its report, MG suggests that high stocks of aluminium will weigh on prices next year so they are unlikely to exceed Dollars 1,300 a tonne. (So far this year the price has averaged Dollars 1,256). MG assumes there will be a slow recovery of the construction and automotive industries in the western industrial nations in 1993 which will help copper's price to average Dollars 2,100 a tonne (Dollars 2,290 so far this year). Present extremely low zinc prices will improve in 1993, but only to Dollars 1,300 a tonne (Dollars 1,250), the report suggests. Lead, having suffered for two years from the depressed state of the US automotive industry, is currently hampered by a weakness of the Japanese vehicle-making industry. So only a slow improvement is expected, giving a average price of Dollars 600 a tonne in 1993 (Dollars 551).  ---------------------------------------------------------- BASE METAL PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION  ----------------------------------------------------------               1992    ('000t)     1993   ('000t)  ---------------------------------------------------------- Alumin      14,900    15,200    15,300   15,600 Copper       8,800     9,100     9,000    9,250 Zinc         5,350     5,350     5,500    5,500 Lead         4,350     4,350     4,450    4,450 Nickel         600       660       600      680 Tin            150       186       160      190  ---------------------------------------------------------- Source: Metallgesellschaft  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

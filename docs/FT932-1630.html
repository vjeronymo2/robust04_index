			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Kamaz seeks foreign partner Kamaz, Russia's biggest truck manufacturer, said yesterday it had obtained promises of Rbs30bn in cheap state credits to rebuild an engine plant destroyed by fire, but was still looking for a foreign partner to invest about Dollars 200m, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow. The group, one of the first to be privatised in the former Soviet Union, said it wanted to restore half the old engine-producing capacity to how it was while replacing the other half with a foreign joint venture producing a new type of diesel engine. Mr Leonid Komm, finance director, said in an interview the company was examining proposals from leading western diesel engine manufacturers. This included Cummins of the US.</p>
